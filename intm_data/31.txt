andes statistical tools for the analyses of deep sequencing kelvin li eli venter shibu yooseph timothy stockwell b lance eckerle d mark denison r david spiro j barbara meth a   the advancements in next generation sequencing technologies such as 454 1 or solexa 2 have led to an increased interest in the deep sequencing of samples from mixed populations when the sequences of interest are largely similar and only a few salient differences exist within these populations it is difficult to quantify or to identify the important trends with existing tools the msa is a useful visual aid when analyzing a small set of sequences within a sample but to identify important trends within a large number of sequences or among multiple sets of deeply sequenced samples a more quantitative approach is necessary existing tools such as bioperl 3 biopython 4 and samtools 5 are useful for efficiently generating manipulating and storing msas but statistical metrics and visualizations for the comparison of the samples that the msas represent do not exist the applications we have implemented in andes allow an investigator to identify and compare the variations within a sample or among multiple samples three independent projects that have used andes will be described in the results and discussion section the first project involved quantifying on a whole genome level the mutation rates and the locations of novel variations for a coronavirus that had been passaged 10 consecutive times in cell culture the depth of sequencing was derived from a single solexa run for each of 3 selected passages this exemplifies how andes can be used to compare temporally separated samples to analyze genome-wide mutation trends and to identify specific variations for further analyses in the second project andes was used to differentiate between the strains of human influenza h1n1 sequences that were deposited into genbank because the majority of human h1n1 sequences were generated from the circulating seasonal strain there were little or no consistent annotations in the genbank records to differentiate them from the collected sequences of the 2009 swine-origin influenza pandemic in this case the sequencing depth was accumulated across data that were deposited by a community of influenza researchers the clustering and analyses of the dataset made it possible to design strain-optimized degenerate pcr primers for the purpose of sequencing both seasonal and swine origin h1n1 genomes the final project described is an application of the andes toolset to assess the sequencing accuracy and identify loci-specific sequencing errors for a 454 titanium sequencing run performed on a subregion of the 16s rrna gene 16s rdna the deep sequencing of clonal copies of a 16s sequence provided the data to empirically determine actual pcr and sequencing error rates this has played a critical role in characterizing the nature of sequencing errors on downstream analyses the fundamental data structure of the andes suite of tools is the position profile this data structure contains the number of nucleotides that support each position of the analyzed region of interest andes currently supports the conversion from the output of clustalw6 ie aln files however the format of the position profile is relatively trivial therefore the encoding of output from an alternative alignment application should be readily supported alignments generated with razers7 muscle 8 and amoscmp 9 tools have also been successfully converted into position profiles and analyzed figure 1 shows the input msa that the resultant position profile in figure 2 was created from each column in the position profile is calculated by summing the number of nucleotides or gap contributions at each position each line of the position profile is essentially a probability mass function pmf with support at a t g c and - gap when the values are normalized and sum to 1 gaps introduced at the beginning or end of the msa are assumed to be caused by read termination so these gaps are not considered to be nucleotide variations and are therefore ignored bases with iupac ambiguity codes 10 in the alignment are given equal weight for each nucleotide they represent for example the iupac code m represents a or c so 05 will be contributed to both a and c position counts the major allele is also stored in the profile for visual convenience the number of lines in the position profile is the gapped length of the consensus sequence for the msa the alignment of two or more profiles is important for comparing or merging their contents into a new composite profile profile merging may be used to pool multiple sample profiles together or to accumulate the sequencing results from a previously partitioned sample since the compute time of an all-versus-all msa tool such as clustalw has an exponential growth rate 8 as a function of the number of sequences in a run n it is recommended to reduce n and take advantage of parallel computation resources this can be accomplished by dividing n across s independent runs with smaller input sizes of ns and then performing a final merge across the s profiles profile alignment in andes involves computing the major allele for each position based on the underlying nucleotide composition if the most common allele at a position is a gap then the most frequent allele that caused the gap to open is used as the major allele the representative major alleles for each profile are then aligned with clustalw the results from the clustalw alignment are then used as a proxy to the underlying nucleotide distributions since the quality of the profile alignment can only be as good as the algorithms used to align the major alleles andes also allows for the integration of alternative msa tools such as muscle which can also produce clustalw-like output to complete the profile merge the new position frequencies are then summed for each column using the major allele positions as proxies similarly for a profile comparison the corresponding positional frequencies between the two aligned profiles are then compared the root mean square deviation rmsd plot is a visualization of the differences between the nucleotide distributions along the alignment of two or more samples in the rmsd plot the alignment between two sequences is represented along the x-axis and the computed rmsd value for each nucleotide position between two aligned samples is represented along the y-axis figure 3 to compute the rmsd for each nucleotide position the standard rmsd formula 11 was modified to compare the nucleotide distributions between each sample rmsdxyipzatgcpxippyip25 pxip and pyip are the probabilities of nucleotide p at position i for the sample x and y respectively the nucleotide p is an element of the nucleotide set a t g c - where the - character represents a gap that was necessary to align the two profiles the position i ranges from 1 to the length of the gapped alignment l the number of insertions and deletions indels that were necessary to align the sequences in the msa are also included for each position the denominator within the square root operator 5 is the number of symbols in the nucleotide set used the minimum rmsd value of 0 occurs when the distributions of nucleotides are identical between the two alignments for a specific position the maximum value of 0632 is generated if the allele of one sample is completely different than the second sample for example if sample x consisted of 100 ts and sample y consisted of 100 gs another important rmsd value is 0316 this value occurs when one sample is biallelic for example at and the other sample is partially similar with a single allelic representation of a see figure 4 and 5 for sample calculations of the two cases summary rmsd values between two samples can be computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the rmsd value for every position along the length of the alignment l these summary values can be used to generate a distance matrix among all samples see table 1 the shannon entropy se is a measure of uncertainty or information content in a random variable when applied to the distribution of nucleotides at a single position it represents the amount of variation at that position a normalized shannon entropy nse can be computed by using a logarithm of base 5 the number of supports for the distribution for the calculation this nse has a range between 0 and 1 where 0 represents no variation only a single allele is represented in the sample and 1 represents maximum variation the uniform existence of a t g c and gaps sexipzatgcpxiplog5pxip pxip is the probability of nucleotide p at position i for the sample x the nucleotide p is an element of a t g c - where the - character represents a gap that was necessary to align all the sequences within the sample the position i ranges from 1 to the length of the gapped alignment l the number of insertions and deletions indels which were necessary to align the sequences in the msa are also included for each position the se plot is generated by plotting the alignment of a single sample along the x-axis versus the se on the y-axis for example figure 6 a summary se value for a single sample can be computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the se for every position along the length of the alignment l since the se can be calculated within a single sample it is useful for quickly identifying regions or positions of variability without the necessity of choosing an ideal reference sequence the base conversion probabilities between two samples or within a single sample can be computed between aligned profiles given an alignment of all sequences in the samples the following formula which is based on the definition of conditional probability is utilized pxpyqi1lpxippyiqi1lpyiq this formula computes the probability of base q in aligned position i in sample y converting to base p in aligned position i in sample x summed over all aligned positions p and q are from the nucleotide set a t g c - i is the nucleotide position range between 1 to the length of the gapped alignment l computing base conversion frequencies is useful for determining if there are any unexpected pressures in mutation rates towards particular nucleotides or sequencing error biases one will typically see a significantly higher base conversion rate between transitions ag or ct than transversions other remaining combinations inter-sample cluster analyses can be performed by first computing the distance matrix among all samples with the rmsd formula distancexy1li1lrmsdxyi the matrix can be loaded into a statistics package such as r 12 and a multidimensional scaling mds plot or dendrogram may be computed and plotted mds is a statistical technique used to convert an n dimensional description of the relationship between samples eg a distance matrix into a lower dimensional plot eg 2d as a result samples with similar characteristics are reflected in the plot by their close spatial proximity to each other sample r code has been provided in the andes tool set to perform these cluster analyses based on the generated distance matrices the detection of polymorphisms and the generation of a representative consensus sequence both depend on the investigators threshold for determining the significance of underlying variations for example this threshold may be the rate of sequencing errors or the prevalence of a minor allele that the investigator would like to eliminate from the consensus sequence it is common to automatically assign iupac ambiguity codes to certain base positions even when the existence of the alternative base or bases has a low frequency eg 1 representative alternatively consensus sequences may be manually edited or entire sequences may be eliminated from the set of representative input sequences in the effort to reduce the dominance of ambiguity codes in the final consensus sequence these workarounds are tedious and the elimination of specific sequences from the set of sequences under analysis leaves the final consensus sequence potentially skewed towards the representation of only the most common variants downstream processes such as degenerate primer design will then be forced to compute on a non-representative consensus to generate the most representative consensus sequence it is preferable to use the largest sample possible since this will represent the population of interest most accurately and minimize the effects of random errors profile to consensus generation automatically converts a position profile into a consensus sequence using the standard iupac ambiguity codes the benefit of using a position profile to generate a consensus sequence is the ability to perform filtering a priori using either a nominal or percent cutoff when a nominal threshold-based filter is applied the nucleotide frequencies for each position that do not exceed the specified threshold are set to zero by not changing the values of the nucleotide frequencies that exceed the threshold their relative proportions are still maintained when applying a percent cutoff filter the positional nucleotide frequencies are first normalized into positional probability mass functions pmfs an application of threshold-based filtering can be to remove low levels of nucleotide representations as a result of sequencing errors or to prioritize the depth of variation allowed in the consensus sequence an example of the effect of filtering based on nucleotide probability is shown in figure 7 in this example the ambiguity code assigned to the position was d because the position required representation for the existence of a t and c in the sample a sequencing error upper bound rate of 5 was determined and used as a threshold for filtering low prevalence nucleotide representations the necessity for a c representation was removed allowing the new ambiguity code to become a w representing a or t assuming the representation of c was a result of sequencing error the w ambiguity code is a more accurate representation of the allelic composition at that position for the sample if deep sequencing is performed on a homogenous or clonal population then it is possible to estimate the average quality value qv that should have been assigned to each position independent of the quality values assigned by the sequencing technologys base caller this is useful for comparing the actual error rate to that of the base callers quality value for example to properly calibrate the sequencing qv or to set alternative thresholds of sequence quality based on actual acceptable error rates the standard formula for qv is qvi10 log10perri the probability of an error perri is estimated for each position i as perri1maxpzatgcpxip the probability of an error is defined as the probability of not attaining the most common allele if the empirically determined error rate is 0 then the qv is set to 40 ie 00001 errors per base if the coverage depth allows for the determination of error rates less than 00001 then a qv of greater than 40 is optionally permitted most base callers limit their maximum qv to 40 although there is no theoretical limit to compare or merge the positional nucleotide distributions across multiple profiles it is necessary to first perform a global profile alignment so that homologous nucleotide positions can be determined to demonstrate the profile alignment strategy based on using the major allele as a proxy 2900 sequences a sample size divisible by 2 4 and 10 were randomly sampled from the 2913 avian influenza mp segments that were available from genbank and multiple degrees of partitioning and merging were compared against the reference profile which was generated without any partitioning or merging the results of this experiment show the effect of partition size and count on both profile generation accuracy and compute time the accuracy of the partition and merge strategy was measured and illustrated with the rmsd plot the split and merge of 2 4 and 10 partitions were plotted against the reference as seen in figure 8 most nucleotide distributions between merged profiles were identical to the reference with an rmsd value of 0 exceptions occurred around 450 bp a dinucleotide repeat and at the 5 and 3 ends where even the reference msa was questionable due to improper gapping the combination of lower sequencing quality towards the 3 end of sequences mismatching sequence lengths and short tandem repeats typically contribute to poor end msas overall the merging of profiles was accurate even across 10 partitions timing statistics measuring the reduction of both serial and parallel compute times using this partition and merge strategy are laid out in table 2 parallel compute times were estimated as the sum of the parallel times for sequence alignment profile generation and profile merge the serial compute times used the sum of the serial times for the same 3 steps the parallel compute time for each step was estimated as the longest running job among partition compute times and the serial compute time was estimated as the sum of all partition compute times when the input sequences were split into 10 partitions serial and parallel speedup factors of 44x and 4135x were observed respectively with very little degradation of profile generation accuracy deep sequencing platforms such as 454 solexa and solid provide opportunities to explore genetic diversity of populations at much greater resolution than sanger sequencing development of quantitative and visual analyses of genome-wide variations are critical for identifying trends and assessing their biological significance figure 3 is an example of a root mean square deviation rmsd plot applied to a study of viral diversity using deep sequencing data that was generated from a series of coronavirus cov passages the coronavirus utilized in this study was engineered to produce a rapidly mutating phenotype viral rna from the 1st 5th and 10th passages was subjected to rt-pcr and amplicons were deeply sequenced with solexa 13 reads were mapped onto a sanger sequenced reference cov sequence genbank accession ay278741 using razers and a position profile was generated for each of the sequenced passages the approximate coverage depth for base positions ranged from 500x to 1000x there was significantly greater sequencing depth for positions covered by overlapping amplicons the rmsd plot was then generated based on the positional rmsd values computed between the position profiles for each of the passages and the reference the blue green and red glyphs represent variations from the 1st 5th and 10th passages respectively for each base position from the rmsd plot one can determine that the positional distributions of nucleotides have increasingly deviated from the reference with the association of annotation not presented an investigator can quickly determine which genes may have been impacted and focus on their analyses the shannon entropy se plot was then generated to further investigate the variation within the sample of the cov population sequenced in the 10th passage figure 6 the se plot facilitates distinguishing which positions in the sequenced genomes have higher than background levels of variation most of the positions in the analyzed region from 25500 - 28000 bp have an se close to zero which would indicate that a single allele was dominant an se analysis over time may show se values for specific positions increase as the viral population began to adapt to growth in the cell culture and then decrease if an advantageous variation increasingly dominates in the population positions with consistently high se values over time may be experiencing little or no selective pressure for example in figure 6 the variation seen in the se plot was higher than the background in the region between 26000 and 26700 this region encompasses the envelope protein and membrane protein orfs of the cov this data may suggest to researchers that an experiment could be designed to investigate the role of these particular proteins to the covs adaptation to growth in cell culture a nucleotide conversion table was computed between the 1st and 10th passage on the same region of the cov genome that was analyzed for the rmsd and se plots table 3 this nucleotide conversion table summarizes the probability that a base in the 1st passage will change to another base by the 10th passage 1st passage nucleotides have been labeled for each row on the left of the table and 10th passage nucleotides have been labeled for each column at the top of the table for example there is a 047 probability that a g in the 1st passage will become an a by the 10th passage transition probabilities ag or ct which have been highlighted in bold tend to be greater than transversion probabilities from the table the probability of the transition from ga 047 is greater than the transversion probabilities for gt 008 or gc 006 however the at 024 and tg 035 transversions have higher rates than the ag 018 and tc 028 transitions this contributes additional evidence that there may be some selective pressure acting upon this region of the genome especially if these probabilities depart significantly from those computed for the entire length of the genome when using the same sequencing technology establishing a baseline for sequencing technology specific systematic sequencing errors is especially important for the nucleotide conversion analyses since these computed values are absolute rather than relative to another samples positional nucleotide distribution since every read contributes to the overall analysis rather than a vote towards a consensus sequence the impact of sequencing errors on individual reads must be considered most sequencing technologies either include a step to amplify the target dna or require quantities of dna which required the investigator to perform dna amplification a priori it has been estimated that pcr amplification will introduce an upper bound on sequence quality which is dependent on the fidelity of the polymerase excluding pcr slippage and mispriming taq dna polymerase has been demonstrated to produce error rates of at least 10-5 for base substitutions and 10-6 for frameshift errors 14 the application of the nucleotide distribution-based filtering tools an integral part of andes allows the user to define a threshold for differentiating between base conversions which may be significant versus those that should be attributed to sequencing or pcr errors an important capability of andes is the ability to compute the summary distances between deep sequencing results to produce an n  n distance matrix when a large group of sequences can be partitioned for example temporally andes can be used to quantify the differences among each partition with the help of statistical cluster analyses tools partitions that contain the variations of interest can be identified as an example the hemagglutinin ha coding segments of human influenza a h1n1 sequences were downloaded from ncbi and were grouped according to the collection date that was annotated in their respective genbank records sequences were grouped into biweekly partitions when possible if the collection day was not available then the sequence was assigned to the partition with the same month with a null day for example if the collection date for a sample was june 2008 then the samples sequence would be assigned to the 2008-06-00 partition if the collection year was the only information recorded then the sequence would be assigned to a partition with a null month and a null day for example 2008-00-00 for each partition clustalw was used to align all the sequences within the partition and a position profile was generated a distance matrix was then generated by computing the summary rmsd value between every position profile and r the statistical software package was used to produce a dendrogram with the hclust function figure 9 as apparent from the dendrogram the human h1n1 samples that were collected from march to june 2009 have much greater sequence similarity than those collected from june 2008 to january 2009 this may be attributed to the sudden focus of h1n1 sequencing performed on potential swine origin viral samples that were collected starting march 2009 many other applications can be imagined for comparing position profiles across partitions for example investigating influenza diversity among different avian species or association of viral clades by geographic location the ability to analyze groups of similar sequences that have been objectively partitioned either spatially or temporally allows individual partitions of interest to be identified the underlying position profiles of these partitions can then be merged together to generate a new cumulative position profile from which a consensus sequence can be generated for downstream applications such as degenerate primer design for example suppose it was determined that the mutation rate for a circulating virus caused a percentage of previously designed primers to fail at an unacceptable level for high throughput sequencing over a period of 4 months by downloading sequences from genbank and building partitions of new sequences on a weekly basis an incrementally merged profile consisting of an arbitrarily defined time period extending into the past can be quickly generated after the merged profile has been converted into a consensus sequence with an appropriate threshold set to achieve the desired sensitivity the currently used primers can be tested in silico on the new consensus sequence to determine which regions will not have the minimum required coverage depth due to predicted primer failure new primers can then be designed on these regions based on the new consensus because all of the sequences are included in the cumulative position profile manual intervention is not necessary to decimate redundant sequences as a result it is possible to generate a consensus sequence that more closely represents the genotypes of the viral variants in circulation accurately and in a timely manner to identify the nature of sequencing artifacts and how they may impact the analyses of a 16s metagenomic sample andes was applied to compute empirically-determined quality values on a set of 454 titanium sequencing runs these actual quality values were compared against those assigned by the 454 base caller or associated with sequence features such as homopolymer runs briefly a mock community consisting of 22 known microbial organisms from the phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes deinococcus-thermus firmicutes and proteobacteria was established pcr amplification targeted 3 variable regions of the ribosomal 16s gene each approximately 500 bp in length pcr products were then sequenced using 454 titanium the resultant sequences were then analyzed using the blast algorithm 15 against the 16s reference database consisting only of the mock community in order to associate each sequence with an organism and 16s copy with the highest similarity for each organism 16s copy variable region combination a partition of sequences was created and amoscmp was used to align the partitioned sequences against the specific organism 16s copy variable region reference sequence a position profile was then generated based on the amoscmp results figure 10 is an example of the estimated quality values along one of the organism 16s copy variable region combination partitions the average coverage depth was 10514 the majority of positions had error rates of less than 1 in 100 qv  20 these average qvs were then compared against the average of qvs for each position assigned by the 454 base caller in order to determine how well 454 assigned quality values correlated to actual error rates further correlation analyses were also performed after aggregating by nucleotide type and length of homopolymer runs not shown the results from the studies indicate that there was little correlation between empirically determined quality values and the 454 assigned quality values this suggests that many of the sequencing errors are unpredictable with current error models the consensus sequences from 454 assemblies are generally of high quality because the availability of coverage depth ameliorates the impact of random errors systematic errors such as those caused by homopolymer runs which cannot be addressed with additional sequencing depth are known and accepted to be a source of error that needs be addressed in downstream processing however the level of individual error rates cannot be dismissed if they are intended for downstream cluster analyses an important step prior to establishing operational taxonomic units otus an example of the frequency of errors along the length of an organism 16s copy variable region combination is shown in figure 10 this pattern of random error along the entire length of the alignment is consistent with the difficulties that have been observed when using individual 454 sequences to establish otus in order to estimate population diversity 16 contrary to initial supposition addressing errors from homopolymer runs alone is not sufficient to solving the problem of accurately establishing otus tools such as andes which allow an investigator to produce an accurate local and global view of deep sequencing results serves to make the identification of these trends more visible so they may eventually be addressed correctly as discussed in the merging and comparing profiles subsection the alignment of two profiles uses the major allele for each positional distribution as the proxy for the alignment while this works well for most datasets that have been analyzed it would be preferable to use the rmsd distances between positions as actual mismatch penalties this would make the full nucleotide distribution at each position available for optimally determining whether introducing a gap or a substitution was more suitable the increasing cost efficiency of deep sequencing provides us with a great opportunity for asking questions about and exploring the potentially complex structure of variations within an evolving nearly homogeneous population or a shared biomarker we have explored the application of the andes tool sets toward understanding mutation rates of a coronavirus aiding in the cluster analyses of seasonal versus swine origin h1n1 flu partitions and exploring the quality of a deep sequencing technology itself andes provides a useful tool set and a basis for the comparison of complex samples at the level of positional nucleotide distributions both visually and statistically these tools will help to

bertrand ignacio snchez cecilia perret prez marcela ferrs garrido   the middle east respiratory syndrome mers is caused by mers-cov  a recently identified coronavirus several coronaviruses can cause upper respiratory tract infections but in some cases they can also produce lower respiratory tract infections and flu-like states the sars coronavirus and mers-cov are two pathogens from the coronavirus family that predominantly cause serious lower tract respiratory infections with a high mortality rate but they are genetically different viruses mers-cov was first identified in 2012 following the death of a patient in saudi arabia with a serious respiratory infection this finding led to the retrospective diagnosis of the first cases of an in-hospital outbreak during 2012 in jordan most cases have been recorded in the middle east with more than 75 of the cases in saudi arabia and some cases outside this region affecting travelers the mortality rate of mers is approximately 30 information about the mers mechanism of transmission is still limited but it is likely to occur through droplets and by direct and indirect contact with infected respiratory secretions aerosol transmission has not been ruled out currently transmission between humans is limited and occasional with a low secondary attack rate isolated cases have been recorded consisting of nosocomial and household outbreaks but transmission is not sustained over time this was the situation in the major south korean outbreak which originated through a case in saudi arabia and affected more than 180 people adequate infection control measures in healthcare rapidly limit in-hospital transmission genetic analysis shows that the human mers-cov is quite similar to the virus found in bats and essentially identical to that observed in camels the virus appears to have originated in bats transitioning through camels probably in africa and afterward being transmitted to humans serological studies do not show its presence in humans before 2012 but it has been observed in camels since the 1990s this observation suggests that camels are the reservoirs of the virus which can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with these animals or through consumption of their milk 1599 cases had been diagnosed by july 2015 with 574 deaths world health organization who of these patients 63 are male with an average age of 48 years fig 341 in children the disease tends to be milder or asymptomatic with severe cases resulting from a comorbidity incubation defined as the period between the primary and the secondary case is estimated to last an average of 5 days 214 days clinical presentation is characterized by fever cough myalgia and diarrhea the disease has a wide symptomatic spectrum which can range from asymptomatic infections to fulminant respiratory failure which is related to high mortality patients evolve rapidly 5-day period on average to respiratory and kidney failure requiring ventilation support and intensive care management in more than 60 of cases diagnostic confirmation is achieved through viral isolation in laboratories with biosecurity clearance level 3 alternatively the virus is detected in respiratory samples through molecular biology techniques polymerase chain reaction pcr which are only available in reference laboratories in patients who have displayed symptoms for more than 14 days the determination of specific antibodies is recommended there is no specific treatment  because no antiviral therapy is available only support measures in intensive care for the most serious cases there is no specific preventive vaccine this infection should be suspected in every traveler who reports having traveled to the arabian peninsula during the past 14 days and who also presents with respiratory symptoms and fever  sars is the first identified coronavirus capable of producing a serious pulmonary disease unlike those previously known hcov-229e and hcov-oc 43 which cause the common cold sars emerged in late 2002 in china and quickly disseminated through southeast asia europe africa and america bats were its presumed reservoir and it was transferred to humans through civets this virus caused great international alarm because of its rapid progression and its seriousness resulting from extensive and rapidly progressing pneumonia with a mortality rate around 50 health workers were particularly affected the most constant symptoms during admissions were high fever malaise cough and headache followed by diarrhea and prolonged fever more than 8000 cases were noted causing more than 700 deaths thanks to international coordination under who leadership the epidemic was controlled in july 2003 there were five clear objectives which were achieved in record time identification of the etiological agent development of diagnostic tests for virus detection creation and evaluation of epidemiological treatment protocols to reduce morbidity and mortality definition of key epidemiological parameters to control transmission and formulation of appropriate public health measures  sars demonstrated that coronaviruses can cause serious lower respiratory infections which would later be observed for hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku 1 to date no new circulation of this agent has been proven coronavirus nl 63 which belongs to coronavirus group i was discovered for the first time in a child with bronchiolitis in the netherlands in 2004 and then ratified in small children hospitalized for serious respiratory infections hku1  which belongs to the coronavirus group ii identified in 2005 was also shown to be capable of causing a lower respiratory tract infection both have been described throughout the world proving their ubiquity this virus is detected in up to 10 of acute respiratory disease cases and its symptoms range from upper respiratory disease including flu-like disease fever rhinitis odynophagia and cough to serious conditions with a rapidly progressing respiratory disease infection by hcov-n63 in children manifests as an obstructive laryngotracheitis in up to 45 of cases in comparison with children not infected by this virus the first hcov-hku1 viruses were described in elderly patients with preexisting conditions that caused their death some later studies which considered children as well as adults have confirmed that infection caused by this coronavirus may worsen the health status of individuals with underlying diseases so that they need to be hospitalized more often as with hcov-n63  infection causes upper respiratory tract symptoms such as fever coryza odynophagia and coughing wheezing pneumonia and bronchiolitis may also be present in children a greater frequency of feverish convulsions has been observed in comparison with children who were not infected by hcov-hku1  hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 are viruses that tend to manifest as a common cold just as the usual coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-oc43  nevertheless in small children elderly patients and immunosuppressed patients they can cause serious respiratory disease with a high mortality rate the influenza a virus is widespread in nature its main reservoir is domestic and feral birds several types exist according to their hemagglutinin h and neuraminidase n makeup only two of which have recently circulated among humans and are causing seasonal outbreaks h1n1 and h3n2 the animal reservoir of the virus is large and varied several subtypes have been described which include 17 hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase types these zoonotic viruses may cause diseases and infections in several animals generally pigs and poultry these zoonotic viruses in particular adapt very poorly to humans so they seldom cause human diseases which are limited to outbreaks circumscribed in terms of time and population nevertheless human cases of a h5n1 were observed in hong kong for the first time in 1997 and have continued being reported to date more than 700 cases have been notified all in asia and northern africa with 413 deaths most cases are isolated with some intrafamilial clusters being described human-to-human transmission is rare which reflects the poor ability of the virus to adapt to human respiratory mucosa the persistence of the circulation of these viruses and the great genetic variability of the influenza a virus make us fear that the avian virus may adapt to humans which would ease its transmission among the human population potentially causing a pandemic this is what happened with the h1n1 influenza a which had a porcine origin and adapted to humans creating a pandemic in 2009 the first cases of human infection caused by h7n9 influenza a were reported in china during 2013 and most of these were related in one way or another to contact with poultry whether direct or environmental in markets where live birds are commercialized by 2015 there had been 488 confirmed h7n9 influenza cases in china since the beginning of the outbreak with 185 deaths this virus does not seem to spread easily among humans and there has been no proof of sustained human transmission although its transmission potential seems to be more effective than that of the h5n1 influenza a virus a couple of cases have been reported outside china a traveler in malaysia who stayed in china and a man and his wife who were diagnosed in canada in january 2015 after traveling to china who there are no recorded secondary cases in these countries which confirms its low probability of human-to-human transmission cases have been observed during the coldest seasons in china from december 2014 to february 2015 83 new cases were diagnosed with an average age of 56 years and 19 deaths of these newly diagnosed patients 72 are male and 93 of patients have had direct contact with poultry markets the incubation period is 4 days 28 days even though mild cases have been described most diagnoses have been serious with a mortality rate close to 35 hospitalized patients have a febrile disease with temperatures above 1022 f and cough the disease progresses swiftly from moderate to severe in contrast to human seasonal influenza most patients do not report rhinorrhea or odynophagia in a set of hospitalized patients the disease progressed swiftly for an average of 3 days after its onset counting from the beginning of the symptoms until hospitalization almost 70 required invasive mechanical ventilation with a death rate of 30 deaths from respiratory failure reached 38 and 62 were caused by septic shock most deaths corresponded to elderly patients and with a underlying disease as well as to the use of systemic steroids diagnosis is performed by identifying viral rna through rt-pcr in respiratory tract samples obtained through swabbing or nasal suctioning as well as other avian influenza a virus  this virus is sensitive to oseltamivir and is resistant to adamantines oseltamivir is indicated for hospitalized or ambulatory patients whether they have been confirmed or are under suspicion of being infected by h7n9 influenza even if more than 48 h have passed since the onset of symptoms the dosage and timeframe of therapy are not clearly established for serious patients but a longer timeframe is suggested around 10 days and in higher doses in patients with mild and noncomplicated infections therapy must continue for 5 days patients with mild infection who require ambulatory treatment and whose only exposure factor is travel to an area where there are recorded cases in humans or birds have no empirical indication for oseltamivir isolated cases of avian origin in humans caused by the influenza h10n8 virus and h6n1 have been observed in china these facts prove that in these zoonotic influenza cases vigilance is extremely important given its pandemic potential so it is crucial to pay close attention to travelers and enforce local vigilance in 1993 a new virus from the the bunyaviridae family was identified in the united states of america it was named virus with no name and was deemed responsible for what is now known as cardiopulmonary hantavirus syndrome sndrome cardiopulmonar por hantavirus scph a feverish disease characterized by respiratory insufficiency and shock this discovery which was a new zoonosis in practice extended over the next years across the whole american continent in this process new clinical manifestations were recognized and new agents identified including the andes laguna negra araquara and choclo viruses which are prevalent in chile argentina paraguay brazil and panama respectively their natural reservoir are sigmondontinae rodents which belong to the muridae family these animals develop a chronic infection with an intermittent viral and asymptomatic excretion stress situations such as lack of food during birthing periods cold or habitat interventions such as logging have been associated with greater virus excretion in these rodents mice excrete the virus through their feces urine and saliva contaminating the environment the most representative virus-carrying rodents are peromyscus maniculatus or deer mouse which carries the no-name virus oligoryzomys longicaudatus or long-tailed mouse and calomys laucha among others humans acquire the infection through the inhalation of secretions stools urine saliva of infected rodents the andes virus predominant in southern argentina and the single causal agent in chile is only transmitted through close human-to-human contact  hantaviruses are spherical viruses with a tri-segmented rna genome with a lipid envelope through which two glycoproteins gn and gc protrude these three segments code through proteins such as rna polymerase l segment glycoproteins gn and gc m segment which are important in the recognition of 3 integrins that the virus use as receptors and nucleoprotein s segment a highly conserved protein used for the laboratory diagnosis of these agents the lipid envelope is sensitive and is destroyed by detergents chloride desiccation and sun exposure all these actions form the basis of the prevention and control recommendations for hantavirus infections the agent enters the respiratory tract through inhalation of the aerosolized virus in the environment or through contaminated human secretions after an incubation period that ranges from 1 to 6 weeks 18 days on average nonspecific symptoms begin including fever myalgias and headache plus digestive symptoms more common in children this stage is followed by progressive respiratory disease and finally by respiratory failure which is the most serious manifestation of this infection in 100 of the cases of acute infection the virus is present in all the white cells and in variable proportions in plasma respiratory secretions saliva and urine also viral rna has been detected in white cells up to 15 days before and 90 days after the first symptoms interaction with 3 integrins and the replication of viral endothelial cells of various tissues appear to alter the modulation functions of permeability in these cells especially increasing the permeability in small lung vessels which favors arterial hypotension thrombocytopenia and hypoxia from plasma flooding into alveolar spaces protein n and superficial glycoproteins stimulate the production of specific and neutralizing antibodies which have been associated with better survival outcomes when they increase prematurely patients who progress to the cardiopulmonary phase where respiratory failure sets in require supplementary oxygen in addition more than two thirds need mechanical ventilation and 50 of patients develop cardiogenic shock which constitutes a poor prognosis factor the increased vascularity rate explains the pulmonary edema observed during this stage this functional alteration is transitory lasting from 48 to 72 h afterward pulmonary function is quickly recovered following a brief period of noticeable diuresis cardiogenic shock is difficult to manage and is the main cause of death the lethality of hanta cardiopulmonary syndrome is about 35 and most deaths occur during the first 48 h of evolution the hemogram is the most useful general laboratory test for hypothesizing a diagnosis because it can from an early stage reveal manifest reductions in the number of platelets as well as the presence of lymphocytes which take the shape of immunoblasts a late onset of hematocrit increase has been observed which is concomitant with the beginning of the cardiopulmonary phase of the disease it is also helpful to test for ldh and transaminases which increase nonspecifically a chest x-ray may change in a matter of hours from a nonspecific interstitial pattern to diffuse pulmonary edema the virological diagnosis is confirmed through rt-pcr in white cells or through the elisa detection of specific igmigg for each regional virus currently there is no specific treatment for hantavirus infection other than cardiopulmonary support patient should be monitored closely preferably in an intensive care unit to provide measures such as mechanical ventilation for breathing support restriction of liquids and vasoactive drugs the use of an antiviral such as ribavirin has not been shown to be an effective treatment extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo has been used as a rescue therapy in some cases of serious cardiopulmonary failure that do not respond to conventional ventilation and vasoactive drugs in chile two therapeutic options have been investigated for hantavirus  methylprednisolone in high doses and immune plasma with high neutralizing antibody titers only the latter strategy has shown promising results relative to mortality rate reduction when used immediately after symptom onset as a control measure in hospitalized patient management and considering that hantavirus has been described as capable of causing nosocomial transmission standard precautions must be taken ideally interning the patient in an individual room and wearing protection equipment apron gloves face mask no 95 with a high efficiency filter and security glasses especially in procedures during which there is close contact with the patients fluids such as intubation secretion suctioning and retrieval of samples for laboratory tests this viral agent enterovirus d68  has been known since 1962 when it was isolated in children suffering from bronchiolitis and pneumonia because no widely available trials have been conducted not much is known about its epidemiology and clinical manifestations during the fall of 2014 missouri and illinois hospitals reported an unusual rise in the number of serious cases of children with or without a background of obstructive disease who presented with acute respiratory infection enterovirus d65 was detected in these patients by applying molecular biology techniques to respiratory samples the infection is more frequent in school-age children whose most relevant clinical antecedent was the presence of previous persistent coughing asthma or wheezing episodes that may have required intensive care unit icu management the virulence of this agent is more impressive than that of other enteroviruses considering that it was also identified as a causal agent of obstructive episodes in previously healthy children who when treated with antiasthma therapy did not respond adequately and had to be hospitalized in intensive care because of hypoxemia and with some exceptions had to receive mechanical ventilation the most common laboratory findings were high total neutrophils and chest x-ray showing peribronchial interstitial infiltrations hyperinsufflation and atelectasis as diagnostic tests improve in sensitivity and specificity and their use becomes more widespread in pediatric centers our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogeny of this viral agent will increase two polyomaviruses with respiratory tropism were discovered in 2007 through deep sequencing of samples taken from respiratory secretions of symptomatic patients polyomaviruses ki kipyv and wu wupyv these viruses can be found in the lower and upper respiratory tract of immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised patients their pathogenic role is not completely clear because they usually occur at low frequency have a low viral load and are related to pathogens whose morbidity is better characterized diagnosis requires molecular techniques real-time pcr whose inclusion in future research will allow us to better characterize the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of the infections caused by these agents  nosocomial transmission of emerging viruses via aerosol-generating medical procedures seth judson d vincent munster j   aerosol-generating medical procedures agmps are increasingly being recognized as important sources for nosocomial transmission of emerging viruses intubation was investigated as a possible cause of ebola virus ebov transmission among health-care workers hcws in the united states 1 additionally the high rate of nosocomial transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov caused speculation about the role of agmps 2345 crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus cchfv was also associated with nosocomial infection secondary to agmps 6 while guidelines were developed for performing agmps on patients with certain viral infections assessing and understanding the risk that specific viruses and agmps pose for nosocomial transmission could improve infection control practices as well as reveal relationships in virus transmission despite the perceived importance of agmps in nosocomial transmission of viruses and other infectious agents scarce empirical or quantitative evidence exists 7 in order to assess the risk that certain viruses and agmps create for nosocomial transmission we first need to identify potential agmps and viruses the second step is then to determine the risk associated with these viruses and procedures either through retrospective analysis investigating the circumstances of nosocomial transmission or through experiments such as using air sampling during agmps to determine the risk of generating infectious virus-laden aerosols lastly we can use this knowledge to re-evaluate current guidelines and communicate which viruses and agmps pose the highest risk for nosocomial transmission medical procedures that have the potential to create aerosols in addition to those that patients regularly form from breathing coughing sneezing or talking are called agmps 7 while there are many suspected agmps few agmps were confirmed to generate aerosols in order to determine which agmps could be important for nosocomial virus transmission we first need to characterize what aerosols are and how they are created  aerosols are particles suspended in air that can contain a variety of pathogens including viruses and there is ongoing debate about how to classify them many divide aerosols into the categories of small droplets which some exclusively call aerosols and large droplets with small droplets having the potential to desiccate and form droplet nuclei that travel long distances while large droplets do not evaporate before settling on surfaces 8 classifying aerosols by their initial size is relevant in relation to their dispersal patterns but it is also important to classify aerosols according to where they deposit in the respiratory tract because pathogenesis can be influenced by whether a virus deposits in the upper respiratory tract urt or lower respiratory tract lrt 9 dispersal and deposition depend on a variety of factors and there is no exact cutoff for small and large droplets some authors use 5 m in diameter as a cutoff for small droplets while another possible cutoff between aerosol types is 20 m since aerosols 20 m in diameter can desiccate to form droplet nuclei and aerosols 20 m do not deposit substantially in the lrt 10 often the term airborne transmission is used to describe infection by small droplet aerosols and droplet nuclei while droplet transmission refers to the route of large droplet aerosols since aerosols can be of multiple sizes we use the term aerosol transmission to generally describe transmission through the generation of infectious small and large droplet aerosols in addition to these modes of transmission agmps may also create opportunities for direct contact and fomite transmission which may be difficult to distinguish hcws are considered to be at risk for nosocomial virus transmission from both small and large droplet aerosols for both seem to play a role in human-to-human virus transmission small droplets can be inhaled into the lrt while large droplets can splash into the eyes or mouth and deposit in the urt certain respiratory viruses like influenza a virus are believed to transmit between people by both small and large droplets 10 whereas other nonrespiratory viruses like ebov could theoretically be spread by large droplets because small droplets containing these viruses are not known to form in the human respiratory tract 8 it is unknown whether certain agmps generate either small or large droplets or both therefore depending on what aerosols are formed agmps could potentially amplify a normal route of transmission for respiratory viruses or open up a new route of transmission for other viruses  we can group possible agmps into two categories procedures that mechanically create and disperse aerosols and procedures that induce the patient to produce aerosols figure 1 and table 1 procedures that irritate the airway such as bronchoscopy or tracheal intubation can cause a patient to cough forcefully potentially emitting virus-laden aerosols and both of these procedures are associated with the possibility of increasing the risk of sars-cov transmission among hcws 1112 the pressure on a patients chest during cardiopulmonary resuscitation can also induce a cough-like force which was another possible source of sars-cov nosocomial transmission 13 sputum is also routinely collected from patients for diagnostic purposes by cough induction but it is not associated with nosocomial virus transmission in contrast to causing a patient to produce aerosols agmps can also mechanically create and disperse respiratory aerosols through procedures such as ventilation suctioning of the airway or nebulizer treatment both manual ventilation using a bag-valve-mask and other forms of noninvasive ventilation niv such as continuous positive airway pressure cpap bilevel positive airway pressure bipap and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation hfov are associated with sars-cov nosocomial transmission 11 although the exact mechanisms of how these procedures create virus-laden aerosols in the respiratory tract remain unknown it is possible that forcing or removing air from the respiratory tract could generate aerosols  while agmps are traditionally thought of in regard to the generation of respiratory aerosols agmps can also aerosolize infected fluids in other regions of the human body surgical techniques can aerosolize blood and possibly viruses for example infectious hiv-1 was found in the aerosols generated by surgical power tools 14 and a tracheotomy was associated with sars-cov transmission 11 lasers can create plumes of debris that contain infectious aerosolized virus as well 15 it is important to recognize the range of agmps and the circumstances under which they might be performed on infected patients in order to associate certain agmps with nosocomial virus transmission researchers need to test whether certain procedures generate aerosols with infectious virus either through hospital sampling or laboratory procedures the family arenaviridae in the order bunyavirales contains multiple viruses that have the potential for nosocomial transmission due to agmps arenaviruses spill over when humans inhale the aerosolized excreta of the rodent hosts for these viruses additionally laboratory workers and nhps were also infected by aerosolized arenaviruses specifically junin virus lassa virus and machupo virus 23 arenavirus infections can cause viral hemorrhagic fevers vhfs in humans known nosocomial transmission has occurred from patients infected with lassa virus and machupo virus 2627 less clinical or experimental data exist for other arenaviruses but these may have similar characteristics although arenaviruses are found in the respiratory tracts of humans or animal models 242528 there is no evidence for human-to-human airborne transmission of arenaviruses however arenavirus aerosol transmission could theoretically occur when aerosols are mechanically generated through agmps like arenaviruses multiple other viruses within the order bunyavirales are zoonotic and can cause vhfs both crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever cchf orthonairovirus and andes hantavirus were associated with nosocomial transmission with cchf transmission occurring after agmps were performed without eye or respiratory protection 631 interestingly other hantaviruses were aerosol transmitted to humans either through accidentally aerosolizing the virus or through inhaling aerosolized rodent excreta 23 but only andes hantavirus was confirmed to transmit from person to person 31 although hantaviruses can cause respiratory disease in humans as in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps and were found in the respiratory tract 30 they do not seem to efficiently transmit between humans like typical respiratory viruses however similar to arenaviruses certain bunyaviruses found in human- or animal-model respiratory tracts including cchf virus hantaviruses and rift valley fever virus could possibly gain the route of aerosol transmission if an agmp is performed the family of coronaviridae contains viruses that are known to transmit routinely between humans through the aerosol route both mers-cov and sars-cov cause respiratory disease in humans and transmit via aerosols but it is unknown whether small-droplet or large-droplet aerosols are the modes of transmission for these viruses significant nosocomial transmission of sars-cov has incited the most research regarding the role of agmps in nosocomial virus transmission 111213 while recent nosocomial transmission events of mers-cov warrant further research 2345 therefore agmps could possibly amplify an already established route of infection for these viruses filoviruses also cause vhfs and could potentially become transmissible through agmps during outbreaks of ebola virus disease evd concerns were raised regarding airborne transmission of ebov because of nosocomial transmission events and the discovery of the virus in the human respiratory tract 3638 given what we know from experimental and epidemiological evidence airborne transmission is unlikely yet it is possible that agmps could create infectious ebov-laden aerosols that could lead to nosocomial transmission 844 likewise viruses belonging to the other species of ebolaviruses that are pathogenic in humans as well as another filovirus marburg virus could share similar transmission properties the family of viruses orthomyxoviridae contains both human and zoonotic viruses of which the most well-known are influenza viruses while seasonal flu vaccines protect hcws against influenza viruses currently circulating in the human population influenza a virus h1n1 influenza a virus h3n2 and influenza b virus hcws are not safe from novel influenza a virus subtypes emerging from animals namely avian and swine influenza a viruses this includes influenza a virus subtypes such as h5n1 and h7n9 some influenza a viruses are known to transmit between humans via aerosols 10 however there is variation in the efficiency of human-to-human aerosol transmission of different influenza a viruses for instance to date there were few instances of nosocomial transmission of h7n9 or h5n1 even when protective measures were not used while there were multiple nosocomial transmission events of pandemic h1n1 and other influenza a virus subtypes 394546474849 this could be due to variation in infectivity of the virus and tissue tropism with the pandemic h1n1 preferentially replicating in the human upper respiratory tract and the avian influenza a viruses preferentially replicating in the lower respiratory tract 5051 therefore agmps have the potential to amplify or open up the route of aerosol transmission for influenza a viruses understanding the characteristics of the aerosol transmission of different influenza a viruses and subtypes could help us determine the risk of influenza a viruses for nosocomial transmission due to agmps  of the viruses in the family paramyxoviridae the recently emerged nipah and hendra viruses pose a high risk to hcws performing agmps both viruses are known to cause respiratory disease in humans and nosocomial transmission was documented for nipah virus 42 aerosol transmission is one of the suspected routes of transmission for nipah virus because of evidence from contact tracing and finding the virus in human respiratory secretions 41 hendra virus spilled over from horses to humans and no human-to-human transmission was documented but the virus was detected in human lungs 43 although henipaviruses do not seem to be as contagious through the aerosol route between people as other viruses in their family such as measles virus it is possible that agmps could contribute to the formation of infectious nipah- and hendra-laden aerosols that could cause nosocomial infection given the lack of experimental or epidemiological data on nosocomial virus transmission and agmps current guidelines for infection control are based on the precautionary principle in order to have a more nuanced understanding of the risks associated with difference agmps and viruses we need more research in both clinical and experimental settings this type of research could take two different forms retrospective epidemiological studies or on-site sampling and experimental tests the former was used to assess the risk of agmps and sars-cov transmission 11 however the quality of retrospective data limits these kinds of studies control cases are necessary to rule out other sources of nosocomial transmission besides agmps such as direct patient contact and fomite transmission moreover these studies rely on reporting that may be infrequent andor unreliable air sampling for viruses during agmps performed on patients would provide the most clinically relevant data multiple air-sampling techniques for viruses now exist researchers can use both solid and liquid impactors to sample and recover aerosolized viruses 52 personally worn bioaerosal samplers and stationary room samplers were used to detect influenza a virus rna in an emergency department 53 researchers also used aerosol samplers to determine the amount of influenza a h1n1 rna in aerosols in the vicinity of patients while agmps were being performed 54 this allowed the authors to determine which procedures were associated with a higher concentration of viral rna 54 in order to determine whether viable virus is present in aerosols virus isolation could be performed from air samples and further quantification could occur through titrations or plaque assays 52 one group used a simulated aerosol chamber to demonstrate that viable influenza virus a could be extracted from surgical masks and n95 respirators 55 particle sizers may also be used in experimental settings to characterize the size and dispersal of aerosols one group used particle sizers to measure the size and travel distance of aerosols from patients who underwent agmps such as nebulizer treatment and niv 56 determining the quantity of viable virus expelled from certain patients during agmps could help determine phenomena like super-spreading events while understanding aerosol characteristics such as particle size could elucidate mechanisms of transmission while on-site sampling works for current nosocomial transmission events we can design experiments to gain prospective knowledge procedures such as bronchoscopy and intubation are performed on animal models of the high-risk viral diseases we identified and air sampling during these procedures could determine whether they are aerosol-generating experimentally generating virus-laden aerosols of different sizes and under different environmental conditions could also help determine the risks of different viruses based on their stability in aerosols 5758 researchers could then create risk models for different viruses based on aersol stability as well as data on the quantity concentration travel distance and size of aerosols formed during agmps multiple environmental factors influence the viability of aerosolized viruses including relative humidity temperature uv radiation and gas composition of the air 52 these factors affect viruses differently and so it is important to consider the environments where emerging viruses exist and where agmps are being performed the aforementioned agmps include those that are both ubiquitous such as cpr or manual ventilation as well as those that are limited to advanced health-care settings such as bronchoscopy the risk of transmission from agmps may be very different in a field-based treatment unit than from a tertiary care hospital additionally some health-care settings such as hospitals with biocontainment units include additional air-handling systems that can limit aerosol exposure to hcws 59 therefore the risk of nosocomial transmission via agmps varies greatly based on the environment and this must be considered when designing experiments during the 20132016 outbreak of evd the centers for disease control and prevention cdc updated its guidelines regarding precautions to prevent the transmission of ebov in health-care settings 60 the updated guidelines further emphasized proper personal protective equipment ppe and isolation when performing agmps on evd patients currently in addition to standard ppe the cdc recommends the use of eye protection airborne infection isolation rooms and n95 or higher respirators when performing agmps on patients with vhfs sars-cov and avian or pandemic influenza a viruses 61 the cdc made similar recommendations as an interim guidance for mers-cov 62 and we were unable to find additional cdc agmp guidelines for nipah virus hendra virus or hantaviruses more evidence of nosocomial transmission events of these and other viruses due to agmps is likely to prompt future guidelines therefore our understanding of the risks associated with agmps and nosocomial virus transmission is not static and we must continue to improve our knowledge to develop appropriate precautions the ambiguity of which procedures and viruses require additional protective measures during agmps may lead to breaches in protocol during many of the cited nosocomial transmission events hcws did not use proper eye or respiratory protection even when aware of the need for respiratory protection hcws may mistakenly wear surgical masks or unfitted n95 respirators which do not provide proper protection additionally hcws may not have access to approprtiate ppe depending on the health-care environment therefore while determining the risks of certain viruses and procedures is essential communicating their respective precautions and providing resources is equally important likewise proper patient triage and diagnosis are the first steps to ensuring that precautions are undertaken when performing agmps  overall more research and communication about the risks of certain viruses and agmps are necessary to resolve the uncertainty surrounding their role in nosocomial virus transmission although we identified certain viruses and procedures that could be high risk and should be experimentally or clinically tested emerging viruses or novel procedures may also play significant roles if we are to design proactive infection control guidelines and understand the underlying biology of viral transmission we must conduct collaborative clinical and scientific research on nosocomial virus transmission and agmps  automated degenerate pcr primer design for high-throughput sequencing improves efficiency of viral sequencing kelvin li susmita shrivastava anushka brownley dan katzel jayati bera anh nguyen thu vishal thovarai rebecca halpin timothy stockwell b   organisms that evolve rapidly have the selective advantage of quickly adapting to their host or surroundings for example a few amino acid changes on the surface protein hemagglutinin of the influenza virus are sufficient to evade the hosts antibody detection within the time span of a single season 1 to effectively genotype and monitor the genome of a rapidly evolving and heterogeneous population it is important to have the capability to amplify the nucleic acid sequences from samples taken from that population as the genotype is shifting as the viral sequencing projects have increased at jcvi over the past few years a high-throughput mechanism to rapidly select pcr primers with a high probability of success was necessary in this paper we describe the modifications made to our high-throughput primer design pipeline previously developed for human re-sequencing 2 we describe the results for 8 out of the 15 viruses that have had pcr primers designed for measles virus mumps virus rubella virus human parainfluenza virus 1 and 3 human respiratory syncytial virus a and b and human metapneumovirus pcr primers for the remaining viruses were also successfully designed using the same degenerate primer design pipeline but were not included in the results and discussion because a few primers from the entire computationally designed set were modified to suit project specific laboratory pcr requirements thus the utilized primer pairs were not completely true to the algorithms recommendations the excluded viruses were human coronavirus feline coronavirus canine coronavirus sars coronavirus human adenovirus human norwalk virus and influenza viruses human influenza a and b and avian influenza a the use of degenerate primers to selectively amplify a set of closely related sequences is periodically found in literature previous work on computational tools have included codehop 3 which designs degenerate primers based on conserved amino acid sequences and hyden 4 which tries to maximize the coverage of a degenerate primer pair with a minimal amount of degeneracy for viral sequences an amino acid based methodology of codehop would introduce a larger set of degenerate bases than would be necessary to successfully amplify a set of isolates thus unnecessarily increasing the potential for non-specific priming and alternative products hydens objective focuses on a primer pair for a family of genes rather than the whole genome sequencing of a potentially heterogeneous sample of same species viruses in a high-throughput environment the goal of jcvis degenerate primer design pipeline is to maximize the success rate of selected primer pairs given a set of sequences that are assumed to represent the target population it is not only important to decide which bases to make degenerate but also how many and which combinations will lead to successful pcr the high throughput features of the jcvis degenerate primer design pipeline that have been inherited from the original non-degenerate version include dynamic tiling an overlapping non-fixed amplicon set across the entire target genome as well as the capability to predict primer pairs that have very high success rates under one of either of two amplification protocols standard or high gc dynamic tiling allows the selection of an amplicon set to be dependent on the landscape of features on the template by parameterizing the minimum maximum and optimal amplicon overlap and amplicon sizes the jcvi primer design pipeline crawls across a template based on the last amplicon selected thus minimizing the number of successful amplicons necessary to cover the genome while only selecting amplicons predicted to be successful this exhaustive search is not possible with fixed tiling the necessity of designing highly successful primers for a high-throughput directed sequencing environment is a consequence of the prohibitively high labor costs required to manually reprocess failures by tuning pcr conditions the work we present here utilizes two laboratory protocols based on our previous publication to achieve a comparable level of success in this paper the results of the degenerate primer design the augmentation of the previously published high-throughput pcr primer design software 2 and the methodology used to construct the reference degenerate consensus sequence are described the degenerate primer design pipeline was used to design primers for multiple viral projects across 15 different dna and rna viruses including both segmented and non-segmented viruses the results for 8 different non-segmented viruses are presented here the size of these genomes varied from 9kb to 156kb with various degrees of sampled genomic sequence variation and gc content the summary statistics for the primers designed for the 8 different non-segmented viral genomes using the two different pcr protocols described as the standard and high gc protocols are presented in table 1 the standard and high gc protocols are described briefly in the materials and methods section table 1 contains the actual sequencing success rates for each targeted viral consensus sequence and the relevant information regarding each consensus sequences construction the median amplicon coverage for all viruses is approximately 3x however in many cases the ends of the genomes had a lower minimum coverage ie1x or 2x due to the inability to select primer beyond the end of the available sequence dynamic tiling produced an even tiling of amplicon coverage across all genomes primers designed using the standard protocol targeted organisms with less than 50 gc content these included the human parainfluenza virus hpiv-1 and hpiv-3 measles virus mev mumps virus muv human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv-a and hrsv-b and human metapneumovirus hmpv-a and hmpv-b for organisms with gc content exceeding 50 eg rubella virus rubv-1 and rubv-2 the high gc protocol was used amplicons were designed to cover the entire genome for all viruses so only full length complete sequences available from ncbis viral genomes 5 were used to generate the consensus sequences the number of sequences used to generate the consensus sequence and the percent of degenerate bases across the constructed consensus sequences are described in table 1 the number of sequences collected to construct each consensus sequence ranged from 3 for hrsv-a and hrsv-b to 32 for muv for each viral type a single consensus file was generated with a target of less than 10 degenerate bases with two exceptions the resultant percent ambiguity across the constructed consensus sequence ranged from 412 for hrsv-b to 928 for muv if a single consensus could not be generated with less than 10 ambiguity multiple consensus sequences were constructed based on sequence similarity-based clustering results the two exceptions were measles virus mev and rubella virus rubv-g2 which had percent ambiguities exceeding 10 for measles virus the allele frequencies for multi-allelic positions were not filtered to remove the less dominant allele frequencies even when the percentage of degenerate bases across the constructed consensus sequence exceeded 10 even though the less dominant allele frequencies were below the expected threshold for sequencing error because the percent degeneracy across the consensus sequence was very close to 10 it was decided that stratifying the sequences and generating multiple consensus sequences may not be cost effective the total success rate was not expected to be significantly impacted for the rubella virus the input sequences were stratified into two genotypes because the total percentage of degenerate bases in the initially constructed consensus sequence was 21 see figure 1 after computational stratification two sets of sequences were used as input to generate consensus sequences for genotype 1 g1 and genotype 2 g2 based on 11 and 5 sequences respectively this reduced the percent degeneracy across the consensus sequence to 607 and 1313 for g1 and g2 respectively g2 contained many multi-allelic positions that were not filtered at an allelic frequency of 20 1 out of 5 it was not clear whether these should be attributed to sequencing error within the input sequences so the variations were retained just to be conservative degenerate primers were computed independently for the g1 and g2 consensus sequences and then redundant primer pairs between the two computes were removed for human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv separate sets of primers were designed for hrsv-a and hrsv-b since there was more than 20 sequence dissimilarity across the entire genome with 24 ambiguity see figure 2 splitting the sequences into two subsets ensured that the sequences in each subset were less than 10 dissimilar the sequences in the subset hrsv-a differed by 55 and those in hrsv-b differed by 45 with a percent ambiguity of 68 for hrsv-a and 41 for hrsv-b for human metapneumovirus hmpv there appeared to be two distinct clades between which they were approximately 20 dissimilar these initial sequences were split into two clades of hmpv-a with 925 ambiguity and hmpv-b with 795 ambiguity separate primers pairs were then designed for the two clades independently for all viral genomes amplicons were designed with an intended coverage depth of 2x or 3x with the exception of hmpv-a and hmpv-b which had a coverage depth of only 1x multiple depths of coverage increase the likelihood of successfully amplifying the targeted region at least once because when a second pair of candidate primers is selected the primer design pipeline ensures that the second primer pair will not overlap any of the previously selected primer pairs in a high-throughput sequencing environment all wells in a plate are processed so additional amplicon coverage was generated if any empty wells remained if the number of amplicons designed exceeded the number of wells on a plate amplicons were computationally reduced to a smaller subset so that every targeted region was covered by at least one amplicon projects also differed by their sequencing requirements thus resulting in varying amplicon numbers and coverage depth depending on each virus type determining the success of degenerate primer design is a more complicated process than that of standard non-degenerate primer design not only does the degenerate primer design algorithm need to accurately model and predict the outcome of pcr with a heterogeneous population of primer pairs but the constructed degenerate consensus sequence needs to sufficiently represent the targeted genomes population the latter can be detrimentally impacted by a lack of available sequence information or the potential for heavily biased sequencing favouring strains specifically studied by a single or few laboratories the success rates provided in table 1 represent the average success rates for each virus type as a percentage of all sequencing reactions performed however since the effect of isolate is confounded inside of the average success rate to gain a deeper understanding of the success rate of primer pairs across isolates a graded approach was taken this was necessary because if a primer pair was successful at a low percentage across all samples then it was possible that the primers did not match the genotype of the isolate rather than a poorly selected primer pair based on the primer design algorithm alone for each primer pair and isolate sequencing was performed in both the forward and reverse directions if a sequence was recovered for an isolate and primer pair under standard expectations of high quality values length etc then that sequencing direction was considered a success success rates were tallied for forward reverse and then averaged between both sequencing directions these per primer pair success rates were then graded at cutoffs of greater than 25 50 75 85 and 90 percent of isolates see table 2 this cumulative and graded approach was necessary to distinguish between amplification failures that were either isolate or target region specific note that these are actual not predicted success rates calculated based on laboratory experiments not predicted success rates based on in silico computations furthermore because of the fairly uniform amplicon coverage across all genomes eg figure 3 the reported success rates should not be inflated by any redundant stacking of amplicons over easy-to-amplify loci table 2 contains the forward reverse and average success rates for each viral consensus sequence for each directional set of statistics the sequencing success rate was computed across all isolates for example for hrsv-a 94 of all primers designed had greater than 75 of the isolates successfully sequenced to separate pcr failure bias due to the gc content of the genome alone the overall success rates of primer pairs were calculated for high gc and standard protocols separately for the standard protocol the overall forward reverse and averaged sequencing success rates of primer pairs were 83 82 and 82 respectively for over 95 of the isolates however at greater than 75 of the isolates there was a consistent 95 primer pair success rate for mumps virus most of the primer failures were recorded in the vp protein region which has rna editing with the insertion of non-template g and in the variable region of the sh gene a consistent pattern in the plate location of the primer failures was also discovered which could be an issue related to laboratory conditions and not due to the design of the primers for the high gc protocol the three sequencing success rates of primer pairs were lower than expected for greater than 75 of isolates success rates were 77 73 and 70 for the overall forward reverse and total sequencing success rate respectively there did not appear to be a relationship between the percentages of ambiguity in the consensus sequence and the success rates of the designed primers simple linear regression adjusted r2  0167 this lack of correlation could be a result of the few sequences represented by the degenerate consensus sequence poorly representing the isolates very accurately designed primer pair sequences and success rates are available as additional file 1 the high-throughput degenerate pcr primer design pipeline has been very successful in providing the basis for high-quality viral sequencing results and for minimizing costs associated with labor reprocessing and genome finishing the modular architecture of the primer design software has made it possible to readily integrate new features into the pipeline as a result the augmented primer design software when coupled with the rt-pcr modified production-verified prior pcr laboratory protocols serves as a powerful tool for high-throughput degenerate primer design thus enabling the quick and effective sequencing of diverse viral strains the importance of proper degenerate consensus sequence construction a key input into the process is described and the success rate of the designed primers supports the effectiveness of these combined methodologies the input into the degenerate primer design pipeline is a consensus reference sequence of the targeted genome this consensus sequence is used as a reference for detecting alternative products and as a template from which primer pair candidates are selected for segmented viruses or if only a subset of the entire genome is targeted a subset may be specified as the template but the entire genome sequence is still required as a reference for detecting potential alternative amplification products the generation of the consensus sequence with ambiguity codes may be established by first generating a multiple sequence alignment msa with a tool such as clustalw 6 or muscle 7 and then using a msa-to-consensus generator such as cons from emboss 8 or one of the applications from andes 9 if the sequence diversity of the targeted population or genomic region is significant then it is recommended to use a tool such as andes to determine if it is necessary to stratify the population and also filter positions of potential variance by various means this is described later in the material and methods subsection constructing the consensus sequence with andes the output is a set of degenerate primer pairs and their theoretical amplicons based on the consensus reference sequence a variety of supplemental design information is also generated among them is a summary file of critique results including information such as primer and amplicon location on the reference their melting temperatures and primer dimer calculations along with the sequences of the primers an adobe portable document format pdf file which contains a visualization of the tiling layout of the amplicons across the targeted genome is also generated along with the summary file figure 3 the core architecture for primer design has remained unmodified from its original form the coverage manager cm component determines a dynamic tiling path across the genome based on the results of the primer critiquor pc components examination of candidate primer pairs the pc component consists of a series of tests or critiques that determine whether a primer pair will be successful based on empirical evidence from previous sequencing experiments the cm component utilizes primer3 10 to generate a list of candidate primer pairs however because primer3 will return an error message if ambiguity codes are found on the user-specified template an extra step is performed to convert ambiguity codes into ns after primer3 has generated a list of primer pair candidates with embedded ns the cm remaps the ns back to their original ambiguity code and passes the degenerate primer pair candidates to the pc component for additional critiquing the following critique modules utilized by the pc component were modified to assess the anticipated success of primer pair candidates with degenerate base positions instead of using blast 11 with a small word size to search for primer binding sites on the reference consensus genome dreg from emboss is utilized dreg uses regular expressions a highly flexible pattern recognition specification for sequence matching based on the conditions of the laboratory protocol utilized in the high-throughput sequencing laboratory it was determined that the binding of the 11 base pairs of the 3 end were sufficient for the polymerase to initiate synthesis of the copy strand for this reason only the 11 base pairs of the three prime end of the degenerate primer sequence are specified in the regular expression pattern detected primer binding sites are then analyzed to determine whether an alternative product will be formed based on detected primer binding site orientation and pair-wise distances for each degenerate sequence in a primer pair candidate a list of disambiguated sequences is generated by enumerating all possible non-degenerate primer sequences that can be represented by each degenerate sequence self and pair-wise primer dimer predictions are calculated within and between the disambiguated primer sequence lists respectively primer melting temperatures are computed by averaging the nearest neighbor thermodynamic calculations 12 of the melting temperatures of the disambiguated sequences derived from the degenerate sequence the construction of the template andor reference consensus sequence with ambiguous bases is a critical step prior to executing the degenerate primer design pipeline unlike using standard ie non-degenerate primers where the analyst must assume that the primers are binding to conserved regions surrounding the target the necessity of degenerate primers presumes that the target population is sufficiently heterogeneous such that there are insufficient conserved regions to allow standard primers to successfully bind and amplify all samples from the population degenerate primer design allows for a mixed population of primer pairs to be simultaneously available during the pcr reaction thus increasing the likelihood of successfully targeting an unknown sample from a heterogeneous population a properly designed consensus sequence or set of consensus sequences will represent this heterogeneous population maximizing the likelihood of attaining pcr products for all samples while at the same time minimizing the potential for alternative products the number of alternative products may exhibit a quadratic relationship with the number of unique primer sequences involved in the pcr thus it is a goal to minimize the number of degenerate bases in each primer sequence while maximizing the proportion of the target population the primers specifically bind to the end effect is to limit the number of degenerate bases per primer to no more than 4 but preferably less than 3 bases andes tools provide the analyst with two key methodologies to support minimizing the number of degenerate bases utilized while maximizing the proportion of the population targeted abundance filtering and sample stratification ultimately the targeted percent of degenerate bases in the consensus sequence should be no more than 10 but ideally less than 8 abundance filtering in andes can be performed using several techniques to reduce the number of degenerate bases introduced into the consensus sequence when filtering is applied the analyst assumes that not all point mutations represented in the set of sequences acquired from the population are equally important some polymorphisms may be due to sequencing error while others may only represent an insignificant subpopulation given a msa constructed from a set of sequences determined to be a reasonable representation of the population andes computes the distribution of nucleotides for each position a nominal filter or percentage filter can be applied to remove the presence of alleles that are not represented at or above a user-specified frequency or percentage threshold respectively for example the degenerate base w is required if both the alleles a and t exist in the population for a specific position however if 2 of the samples are as and 98 are ts applying a 4 percentage filter would change the w to the non-degenerate base t if the analyst believes that this polymorphism was actually due to sequencing error alternatively a statistical filter combining both frequency and percentage may be applied this utilizes the binomial distribution to determine whether an allele would be detected upon resampling to the same depth based on a user-specified confidence ie alpha lastly an optimization-based filter is also available in which the analyst specifies the maximum percentage of degenerate bases to be allowed in the consensus sequences and the algorithm iteratively removes alleles starting with the ones with the lowest proportion across the samples until the maximum percentage of degenerate bases have been achieved if these filtering techniques either remove alleles that need to be targeted or do not reduce the number of degenerate bases in the constructed consensus sequence sufficiently then sample stratification will be necessary the goal of sample stratification is to reduce the total variation in a combined population by placing individuals into clusters which contain less intra-cluster variance than the entire population the more a difference between clusters can be used to separate the clusters the less variation will exist within each of the formed clusters with respect to the entire population this stratification ie clustering can be performed with andes given a msa andes can be used to compute a distance matrix and dendrogram based on sequence similarity which can then be used to generate clusters given a user-specified cutoff the maximum intra-cluster percent dissimilarity cutoff that works well is approximately 10 when the percent similarity within a cluster or undivided set of sequences falls below 90 the number of degenerate bases that must be introduced into the consensus sequence becomes too high for each cluster that is created to reduce the amount of intra-cluster dissimilarity a separate consensus sequence is subsequently generated to represent that subpopulation when determining an appropriate threshold for any of these methodologies it is important to keep in mind the number of sequences included since the confidence of real polymorphisms existing in the population can only be attained with sufficient sample size a general landscape of variation can be ascertained with a plot of normalized entropy versus location with sufficient conserved regions flanking highly variable regions and a sufficiently large amplicon size regions with localized high rates of variation do not generally introduce difficulty in primer pair selection due to the primer designers dynamic tiling capabilities the jcvi primer design pipeline automatically detects sub-regions of the targeted genome sequence that may use the standard protocol or must use the high gc protocol once the sub-regions have been separated the proper primer design parameters are utilized for the design and selection of primer pairs key parameters shared between

william valderrama daniel streicker g   bats are associated with numerous zoonotic pathogens including sars coronavirus and ebola virus that have emerged unpredictably into human and domestic animal populations with serious health and economic consequences 1 a central impediment to forecasting the cross-species transmission of bat viruses and developing strategies for their control is the scarcity of data that could inform how these viruses are maintained in their bat reservoirs 2 in particular data from bats are usually collected from small geographical areas over short timescales whereas the high mobility of bats can enable long-term viral persistence across large spatial scales 3 by contrast cross-species infections spillovers can span large areas and timescales but rarely occur at sufficiently high frequency to enable robust inference into transmission dynamics within bats and are often complicated by the possibility of onward transmission within spillover host species 2 in latin america common vampire bats desmodus rotundus are the most important source of human and animal rabies a lethal encephalitis transmitted by the bites of infected animals 4 the widespread distribution of the vampire bat from mexico to argentina coupled with a mechanism for cross-species transmission obligatory blood feeding behaviour creates high economic social and public health burdens of rabies across the region 5 although post-exposure vaccination of humans and pre-exposure vaccination of livestock are available and efficacious they are not practiced at large scales 56 instead control of vampire bat-transmitted rabies vbr uses bat population control either by indiscriminate killing and roost destruction or by government-led campaigns that use a poisonous paste vampiricide to kill bats that groom treated conspecifics or feed from the wounds of treated livestock 78 the efficacy of these programmes has been questioned by field studies showing that rates of vbr exposure in bats were equivalent or higher in culled colonies and independent of natural variation in bat colony size 9 further modelling work showed that apparently counterproductive effects of culling could arise because vbr persists not locally within a bat colony but by viral dispersal between colonies 10 identifying the precise nature of spatial dynamics and how these contribute to long-term viral persistence is critical to improving rabies control detection of epizootic expansions or seasonally varying transmission could help anticipate when and where spillover could occur thereby enabling preventative vaccination of humans and livestock or interventions within the bat population ahead of outbreaks 1112 because rabies is not transmitted among livestock following infection by bats livestock provide an ideal sentinel to study the spatiotemporal dynamics within the natural bat reservoir to date phylogenetic and time-series analyses of vbr in livestock have revealed contrasting patterns epizootics were reported in the north of argentina in the 1970s 13 but more recent analyses show continuous infection of livestock indicative of enzootic persistence 59121416 however incidence varies within enzootic zones and is speculated to be affected by natural and anthropogenic processes on the one hand livestock vaccination or bat culls could conceivably decrease the burden and transmission of vbr respectively if practiced intensively yet land use and climate changes could offset these gains by providing greater availability of livestock a key food resource for bats and increasing minimal winter temperatures which together limit the size and geographical range of vampire bats 17 if vbr outbreaks are increasing determining whether increases are caused by spatial expansions into previously uninfected areas or intensified transmission within enzootic zones is critical to appropriately allocate vaccines surveillance and educational campaigns the national surveillance system of peru has documented the time and place of rabies infections in largely unvaccinated livestock populations since 2004 because rabies transmitted by dogs is restricted to a small isolated region of peru virtually all livestock cases are spillover infections from vampire bats 1819 this unique dataset creates a remarkable opportunity to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying the perpetuation of vbr in bat populations and thereby inform control strategies across latin america here using high-resolution time-series data on vbr outbreaks we i resolve the spatiotemporal patterns underlying previously undetected increases in the burden of vbr in peru ii test whether increases are caused by spatial expansions or intensified transmission within historically enzootic zones and iii assess patterns of how spatial expansions occurred across the landscape next in an area of intensive vbr transmission in the andes we pair time-series data with field data on batlivestock contacts vaccination and reporting practices to iv estimate the velocity of advancing epizootics of vbr on a heterogeneous landscape and v forecast impending spillover risks to humans and livestock suspected outbreaks of rabies were reported by farmers to one of the 103 satellite offices of national service of agrarian health of peru senasa for sample collection and laboratory testing for rabies infection n  2269 see data accessibility section because we focused on the spatiotemporal dynamics of vbr rather than the intensity of outbreaks we analysed data as outbreaks defined as one or more laboratory-confirmed rabies infection on a farm rather than as individual cases however most outbreaks 83 involved only a single sick or dead animal in the southern andes we used reports of bat bites on livestock a proxy for vampire bat presence combined with national census data to assess the patchiness of bats on the landscape the spatial distribution of bat bites on livestock was collected by the regional government of apurimac by conducting visual inspection of livestock in 169 rabies enzootic communities 14 farms per community within two valleys chalhuanca and rio apurimac from june 2014 until july 2015 20 we hypothesized that patchy bat distributions would require longer bat flights that could lead to accelerated or punctuated spatial spread of vbr whereas the continuous presence of bats might enable slower gradual spread we used oral questionnaires to evaluate the presence of vampire bats feeding on livestock knowledge of rabies and vaccination practices in communities that did not report outbreaks in the national surveillance dataset we interviewed 60 farmers in six districts in the chalhuanca valley and 30 farmers in two districts in the rio apurimac valley using a standardized questionnaire see the electronic supplementary material for details and ethical approval information spatial dynamics of vbr were explored by calculating the number of outbreaks per region from 2003 to 2014 the annual number of districts infected the cumulative number of districts that reported rabies for the first time each year and the percentage of districts that had a neighbouring district reporting rabies prior to its first report we tested whether the average elevation of outbreaks changed through time in each region of peru using generalized linear models glm with normally distributed errors the akaikes information criterion aic was used for model selection chosen a difference of more than two aic points and the significance of each factor within the selected model was tested using a wald test 21 we also tested the overall effect of year on outbreak elevation using a generalized linear mixed model glmm with region as a random effect using the glmmadmb package of r district and elevation maps were obtained from the gadm database gadmorg and the cgiar-csi httpwwwcgiar-csiorg respectively using the raster package of r temporal autocorrelation analyses were used to investigate the seasonality of vbr outbreaks using the acf function of r which allows significance testing different time lags of autocorrelation the large number of vbr outbreaks in the neighbouring regions of apurimac ayacucho and cusco aac 62 of all outbreaks in peru provided a high-resolution dataset to resolve the epidemiological dynamics underlying spatial expansions detected at the national level changes in the infected area over time were estimated using annual kernel densities with the bkde2d function of the kernsmooth package of r bandwidth  015 and grid  200  200 km 22 in two valleys where data suggested an epizootic advance chalhuanca and rio apurimac figure 4b we tested whether spatial expansions followed a wave-like pattern using linear regressions between the time and the distance of outbreaks from the predicted index case because vbr persisted locally after invading new areas we divided the landscape into equidistant hexagonal bins using the hexbin function xbins set to 6 of the hexbin package in r and analysed the month of the first outbreak in each cell we incorporated effects of spatial heterogeneity on vbr spread by calculating distances to index cases as least-cost distances based on a landscape resistance model defined as the minimum distance along elevations 3600 m the maximum recorded elevation of d rotundus roosts in the area see the electronic supplementary material a sensitivity analysis for this assumption using 200 randomly selected elevation thresholds from 3500 to 4500 m for each of the two valleys is provided in the electronic supplementary material the index cases of each travelling wave were estimated by simulating 5000 random hypothetical origins of each wave and choosing the origin that maximized the r2 of each linear regression 23 wavefront speeds were calculated as the inverse of the slope of the linear regression with the intercept set to zero we evaluated the sensitivity of wavefront speeds to the inferred origin by bootstrap resampling with replacement the hexbins used in the main analysis in each of 200 bootstrap replicates in each valley we evaluated 5000 random hypothetical origins and identified the origin location that maximized the r2 of the distancetime regression we then compared the distributions of bootstrapped wavefront speeds and r2 to the main analysis we used the bat bite distribution data dataset ii to evaluate whether the patchiness of bats on the landscape could influence wavefront speeds we divided each valley into hexagonal cells with a specific 5 km radius assumed as a conservative distance for bat dispersal 24 within each cell we calculated the number of towns from the 2014 census the number of communities visited for bite inspection and whether the community reported at least one bat bite we tested whether the valleys differed on the number of towns per cell and the percentage of communities reporting bites per cell using a wilcoxon test in the two valleys where we quantified wavefront speeds of vbr we predicted the spatial spread of future outbreaks from 2015 to 2017 forecasts used the slope of the linear regression to predict the arrival of rabies to each locality according to the least-cost distance of each locality to the inferred origin as a within-data validation of our predictions we developed a training model based on the first 75 of available data and applied this to predict the remaining 25 of rabies arrival dates details of the cross-validation analysis are given in the electronic supplementary material all analyses were performed in r 25 in total 1146 51 of 2265 suspected outbreaks between 2003 and 2014 were confirmed rabies positive using the fluorescent antibody test making vbr the most common notifiable disease in peruvian livestock electronic supplementary material figure s5a cattle were infected in 91 of the confirmed outbreaks followed by horses 4 goats 2 sheep 1 and other assorted species 2 11 pigs four buffalos and one camelid outbreaks were widespread across the andes and amazon with 14 of 25 governmental regions reporting at least one suspected outbreak in livestock and 12 regions reporting from 7 to 470 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks figure 1a temporal autocorrelation analysis revealed no seasonality in vbr spillover to livestock at either the national or the regional level
 at the national level the number of vbr outbreaks began a consistent increase in 2011 with a near doubling of outbreaks by 2014 figure 1b this increase is unlikely to be caused by changes in reporting the 56 other livestock diseases tracked by the same surveillance system increased from the establishment of the system in 2003 until 2008 but remained stable in later years when rabies reports intensified electronic supplementary material figure s5b furthermore in a linear model including the effects of the number of other diseases reported and year on the annual number of rabies outbreaks year f19  111 p  001 but not outbreaks of other diseases f19  064 p  01 was significant full model r2  07 increases in vbr outbreaks were not geographically ubiquitous outbreaks declined or were stable in the amazon but became more frequent in the andes particularly in three regions characterized by valleys with high agricultural production surrounded by high elevation peaks apurimac 470 outbreaks 41 of the national total ayacucho 197 17 and san martin 128 11 figure 1a electronic supplementary material figure s6 the national increase in rabies outbreaks occurred concurrently with spatial expansions into historically uninfected areas the cumulative number of districts with confirmed cases more than tripled between 2003 and 2014 such that on average vbr spread into 12 standard deviation sd  0319 previously uninfected districts per year figure 2 inset a pattern also observed at the monthly level 1 district month1 sd  0007 the number of infected districts also increased in annual non-cumulative reports with most dramatic spatial expansions coinciding with the increase in outbreaks following 2011 figures 1b2 hotspots of spatial expansion occurred in the regions of san martin amazonas and cajamarca in the north of peru 52 districts yr1 sd  036 and in apurimac ayacucho and cusco in the south 41 districts yr1 sd  012 by contrast few new districts were infected in the amazonian regions of loreto ucayali and madre de dios 14 districts yr1 sd  021 where no new districts were infected in the last 3 years consistent with epizootic spatial expansions from enzootic zones 85 of newly infected districts had a neighbouring district infected in the same or previous year
 significant increases in the elevation of vbr outbreaks occurred in regions containing transitions from the amazon rainforest into the andes mountains ie cusco cajamarca san martin and ucayali by contrast the mean elevation of rabies outbreaks was unchanged in regions with only high ie apurimac and ayacucho in the andes and low ie madre de dios and loreto in the amazon elevations figure 3 the model with a region by year interaction was more strongly supported than year  region aic  912 year alone aic  179033 and region alone aic  9605 our glmm showed that controlling for region as a random effect the elevation of outbreaks generally increased through time z-value  293 p  001 however in several regions eg ayacucho cusco the minimum elevation of outbreaks decreased through time concurrently with increases in the maximum elevation of outbreaks creating a funnel pattern which indicates that downhill invasions also occurred figure 3
 in the aac kernel density estimates showed a 74 increase in the spatial extent of vbr between 2003 and 2014 equivalent to a newly infected area of approximately 21 000 km2 figure 4c two different spatiotemporal dynamics of vbr were observed in the north of the aac eg san miguel huanipaca huancarama districts vbr persisted enzootically via sporadic outbreaks through the duration of the time series consistent with metapopulation dynamics proposed by blackwood et al 10 figure 4ab by contrast vbr only recently invaded districts in the south or southwest eg tintay mollepata circa
 in the valleys of chalhuanca and rio apurimac strong linear relationships between the temporal and the least-cost spatial distance from each outbreak to the predicted index cases revealed wave-like expansions of vbr figure 5 by the end of 2014 these waves had travelled 39 km in chalhuanca 94 outbreaks since 2009 and 54 km in rio apurimac 45 outbreaks since 2012 dispersal rates were strikingly consistent through time as evidenced by high r2 values in linear models within each valley r2  098 and 093 for chalhuanca and rio apurimac respectively figure 5b interestingly vbr is spreading through bat populations nearly twice as rapidly in the rio apurimac valley as in chalhuanca 172 km yr1 95 confidence interval ci 153197 versus 91 km yr1 95 ci 8697 figure 5a uncertainty in the origin locations had little influence on wavefront speeds bootstrap estimates revealed similar speeds across all plausible origin locations with estimations ranging from 143 to 204 km yr1 r2 087098 in rio apurimac and from 67 to 112 r2 096099 in chalhuanca electronic supplementary material figure s1 likewise estimates of wavefront speeds were insensitive to elevation thresholds in the landscape resistance models with values across thresholds in the range of 165179 km yr1 r2 092093 in rio apurimac and 7892 r2 097098 in chalhuanca electronic supplementary material figure s2
 the consistency of wavefront speeds within each valley suggests that vbr spreads predominately by short distance dispersal through a continuously occupied landscape rather than by punctuated spread driven by long distance flights of infected bats census data showed no significant difference between valleys in the number of towns per 5 km grid cell chalhuanca mean  sd 129  115 rio apurimac 125

number of inspections per cell valley effect t-value144  074 p  04 together these data suggest widespread presence of bats in each valley with similar distributions of communities and survey effort our questionnaires confirmed the presence of vampire bats as incidence of bat bites ahead of advancing wavefronts which will enable the spread of vbr into currently rabies-free parts of each valley figure 5a moreover only 25 chalhuanca and 3 rio apurimac of respondents knew that bats could transmit rabies and fewer than half 47 chalhuanca and 40 rio apurimac knew the appropriate government agency for reporting rabies only 1 out of 90 farmers had vaccinated any animals against rabies given the presence of vampire bats and the low preparedness for outbreaks ahead of wavefronts we used our spatial models to forecast dates of rabies arrival to currently uninfected areas the predictive power of our models was supported by our within-data validation the true arrival of rabies fell within the predicted cis in all outbreaks electronic supplementary material figure s3 with an average difference of 64 and 33 months between the predicted and actual arrival dates in chalhuanca and rio apurimac respectively n  5 and 7 hexagonal cells to predict respectively by forward projecting our full models we predict vbr arrival to vampire bat populations in six currently uninfected districts by the end of 2015 13 by 2016 and 22 by 2017 in the two valleys combined figure 5a electronic supplementary material table s1 using a high-resolution spatiotemporal dataset of rabies outbreaks we illustrate the power of combining sentinel animal data from national surveillance systems with statistical models to predict the time and place of future cross-species transmissions of bat viruses in peru we observe a recent doubling of vbr outbreaks in livestock which is associated with spatial expansions of the virus into previously uninfected bat populations in the region of the country where most outbreaks occur the expansion forms multiple independent waves of infection that are travelling at consistent rates and trajectories towards communities where we document high contact rates between bats and unvaccinated livestock and poor knowledge of rabies widespread invasions into new areas and increases in the burden to human and animal health reveal vbr as an emerging rather than an enzootic zoonosis and mandate new strategies for rabies control in latin america the consistent detection of vbr in one previously uninfected district per month over the last 12 years is an alarming signal of the growing human and animal health threat posed by vbr the triggers of these expansions are uncertain but they are occurring throughout the country in transition zones between the amazon and andes and in valleys within the andes figure 3 one possibility is that growing livestock populations could have increased the size or connectivity of vampire bat populations facilitating viral introduction 5 however livestock census data from 1994 and 2012 indicate no change in livestock densities in the newly infected districts peruvian national livestock census cenagro another hypothesis is that rising temperatures due to climate change could expand bat populations and thus vbr to higher elevations 17 indeed our glmm shows that vbr is spreading on average to higher elevations importantly however expansions occurred in areas well below the maximum elevation of vbr in other parts of the peru 3600 mts and the elevation of outbreaks did not increase in high elevation regions where vbr was enzootic throughout the time series ie apurimac and ayacucho figure 3 thus we argue that the emergence of vbr in these regions is caused not by climate-driven changes in the vampire bat distribution but instead an epidemiological process of protracted viral invasion of a relatively new virus in vampire bat populations a hypothesis supported by molecular clock estimates of the most recent common ancestor of vampire bat rabies 26 in further support for the slow invasion hypothesis the travelling waves in the two focal valleys of aac were initiated only in the last few years despite molecular evidence that vbr was present in northwestern parts of the region since the early 1970s and the evidence from our questionnaire study that vampire bats are already present in rabies-free parts of each valley 14 figure 5a the slow wavefront speeds that we observe in vampire bats relative to other rabies reservoirs eg 30100 km yr1 in raccoons and their low variability is more consistent with short distance dispersal of infected bats than invasion driven by rare long distance flights 27 indeed although translocation experiments show that vampire bats are physiologically capable of long distance movements home range sizes are typically 10 km2 92428 one remaining question is why waves are travelling at different rates in different valleys different patterns of between-colony bat movements in each valley driven by underlying differences in the distribution of bat colonies could influence wave speeds however valleys had similar distributions of farms and intensities of bites electronic supplementary material figure s5 suggesting that long distance dispersal of vbr is unlikely to be a limiting factor in either valley anthropogenic disturbances particularly the intensity of bat culls could also conceivably influence viral spread on the one hand culls could reduce the probability of dispersal by an infected bat by reducing infection prevalence or competition-driven dispersal on the other hand dispersal by survivors of culls could facilitate viral invasion into uninfected areas a similar example of disturbance-driven pathogen spread was observed in the uk where disruption of badger territorial boundaries by culling facilitated the spatial spread of bovine tuberculosis 29 finally differences in wavefront speeds could potentially arise if viral strains with different infection phenotypes circulate in each valley however previous work showed that only one geographically isolated viral lineage has circulated in the aac since the early 1970s 14 therefore we suspect that the waves described here have a common evolutionary origin and recent evolution is unlikely to explain the observed variation in wavefront speeds in the absence of intervention the arrival of vbr to currently uninfected areas will cause considerable livestock mortality major economic losses and a new public health threat to farmers who handle infected bats or livestock it is difficult to quantify the real impact of these viral invasions on agriculture because under-reporting of vbr is thought to be significant but remains unquantified in most areas of latin america precluding estimation of the true burden of the disease on livestock 30 in the two aac valleys alone we forecast that over 11 600 small-scale farms containing at least 339 000 livestock 93 715 cows 215 707 sheep 15 690 goats and 13 774 pigs will newly be at risk of rabies in the next 3 years vaccination of these animals would cost at least us373 000 per year us11 per vaccine a significant financial burden to small-scale farmers who rely on livestock sales to pay for house maintenance and childhood education and for local governments that have not previously been affected by rabies the high cost of vaccines together with low local knowledge of rabies indicated by our questionnaires presents a major challenge to overcome with epizootic invasion impending to aid planning of interventions we provide a forecast of rabies arrival dates to presently uninfected areas like all predictive models our projection uncertainty increases further into the future thus it will be useful to update models as additional data become available nevertheless the consistency of wavefront speeds even after considering uncertainty in origin locations and the ability of our model to successfully predict known dates of rabies arrival provide confidence in our forecasts although our phenomenological models of rabies spread account for habitat heterogeneity using a least-cost distance algorithm other methods exist for estimating wavefront speed statistical methods such as trend surface analysis are used over larger spatial and time scales than our data where outbreaks are distributed along relatively short valleys spatially explicit mechanistic models have also been widely used to model rabies spread in carnivores in heterogeneous landscapes eg 2731 unfortunately the dispersal distances of infected bats and the sizes of colonies are unknown so parameterization of such a model for vbr would not be straightforward moreover without additional data such models would not be expected to alter our mean predictions we therefore argue our approach is ideally suited to inform rapid responses in a public health and veterinary emergency travelling waves have been identified in several other wildlife zoonoses eg ebola virus 23 rabies in raccoons 32 and plague in rodents 33 the waves of vbr that we identify are important because they are occurring in real time and are predictable in speed and trajectory creating a powerful opportunity to direct the distribution of vaccines and educational campaigns to areas where infection is imminent electronic supplementary material table s1 our results further open new possibilities for the control of a bat-borne zoonosis in its reservoir while interventions such as culling have historically focused on enzootic areas our findings enable targeting of healthy bat populations before viral invasion such a strategy was attempted in argentina in the 1970s but even with a dramatic 95 reduction of vampire bat populations using cyanide poisoning the epizootic advanced 34 this failure could reflect an absence of natural geographical barriers allowing the virus to circumnavigate the intervention zone or the challenges of using population reduction to control a pathogen with frequency-dependent transmission 91035 an appealing alternative would be to increase the proportion of immunized bats while maintaining the age structure and relatively sedentary dispersal behaviour of vampire bats a transmissible gel-based topical rabies vaccine was effective in captive vampire bats but has never been released in wild populations 36 vaccination ahead of the epizootic front could be particularly effective when paired with natural geographical barriers such as the high andean peaks that occur in the aac this study demonstrates the power of animal health surveillance systems to generate high-resolution insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of zoonotic viruses that would probably be impossible to detect relying on studies within a wildlife reservoir alone the travelling waves that we detected in peru directly inform management of viral spillover from bats by providing recommendations for where and when livestock should be vaccinated and educational campaigns should be carried out while creating a unique opportunity to trail experimental interventions in bat populations to block spatially replicated advancing epizootics  betacoronavirus 1 in alpacas vicugna pacos in the high peruvian andes l luna pe brando l maturrano r rosadio fdf silva rm soares

sara ruiz i elizabeth zumbrun e aysegul nalca p conn michael   well-developed animal models are necessary to understand the disease progression pathogenesis and immunologic responses in humans furthermore to test vaccines and medical countermeasures well-developed animal models are essential for preclinical studies ideally an animal model of human viral infection should mimic the hostpathogen interactions and the disease progression that is seen in the natural disease a good animal model of viral infection should allow many parameters of infection to be assayed including clinical signs growth of virus clinicopathological parameters cellular and humoral immune responses and virushost interactions furthermore viral replication should be accompanied by measurable clinical manifestations and pathology should resemble that of human cases such that a better understanding of the disease process in humans is attained there is often more than one animal model that closely represents human disease for a given pathogen small animal models are typically used for first-line screening and for initially testing the efficacy of vaccines or therapeutics in contrast nonhuman primate nhp models are often used for the pivotal preclinical studies this approach is also used for basic pathogenesis studies with most experiments performed in small animal models when possible and nhps only used to fill in remaining gaps in knowledge the advantages of using mice to develop animal models are low cost low genetic variability in inbred strains and abundant molecular biological and immunological reagents specific pathogen-free spf transgenic and knockout mice are also available a major pitfall of mouse models is that the pathogenesis and protection afforded by vaccines and therapeutics cannot always be extrapolated additionally blood volumes for sampling are limited in small animals and viruses often need to be adapted through serial passage in the species to induce a productive infection the ferrets airways are anatomically and histologically similar to that of humans and their size enables larger or more frequent blood samples to be collected making them an ideal model for certain respiratory pathogens ferrets are outbred with no standardized breeds or strains thus greater numbers are required in studies to achieve statistical significance and overcome the resulting variable responses additionally spf and transgenic animals are not available and molecular biological reagents are lacking other caveats making ferret models more difficult to work with are their requirement for more space than mice rabbit-style cages and the development of aggressive behavior with repeated procedures nhps are genetically the closest species to humans thus disease progression and hostpathogen responses to viral infections are often the most similar to that of humans however ethical concerns of experimentation on nhps along with the high cost and lack of spf nhps raise barriers for such studies nhp studies should be carefully designed to ensure that the least amount of animals are used and the studies should address the most critical questions regarding disease pathogenesis hostpathogen responses and protective efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics well-designed experiments should carefully evaluate the choice of animal including the strain sex and age furthermore route of exposure and the dose should be as close as possible to the route of exposure and dose of human disease the endpoint for these studies is also an important criterion depending on the desired outcome the model system should emulate the host responses in humans when infected with the same pathogen in summary small animal models are helpful for the initial screening of vaccines and therapeutics and are also often beneficial in obtaining a basic understanding of the disease nhp models should be used for a more detailed characterization of pathogenesis and for pivotal preclinical testing studies ultimately an ideal animal model may not be available in this case a combination of different well-characterized animal models should be considered to understand the disease progression and to test medical countermeasures against the disease in this chapter we will be reviewing the animal models for representative members of numerous virus families causing human diseases we will focus on the viruses for each family that are the greatest concern for public health worldwide poliovirus pv is an enterovirus in the picornavirus family and causes poliomyelitis1 humans are the only natural host for the virus but a number of nhp species are also susceptible all three serotypes of pv cause paralytic disease but it is relatively rare with only 12 of infected individuals ultimately developing paralysis humans typically acquire and transmit the virus by the oralfecal route although transmission by aerosol droplets may also be possible2 the virus replicates in the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa made possible by the resistance of pv to stomach acids3 cd155 expression in peyers patches and m cells suggest that these cell types may be important during initiation of infection4 replication at extraneural sites precedes invasion into the central nervous systems cnss when it occurs two effective vaccines the salk killed polio vaccine delivered by the intramuscular route and the sabin live attenuated polio vaccine delivered orally have been used very successfully to eliminate the disease from most parts of the world5 the world health organization has led a long and hard-fought global polio eradication campaign with much success but full eradication has not yet been achieved since 2003 between 1000 and 2000 cases of pv infection are reported worldwide each year6 thus animal models are also needed to test new vaccine approaches that could be used toward eradication of polio in the areas where it still persists additionally the recent focus of work with pv animal models has been fraught with urgency as to gain understanding of pv pathogenesis before the eradication effort is complete and work with this virus ceases animal models for the study of pv consist of nhp models and mouse models mice are susceptible to certain adapted pv strains p2lansing p1lsb and a variant of p3leon mice infected intracerebrally with p2lansing develop disease with some clinical and histopathological features resembling that of humans7 wild-type mice are not susceptible to wild-type pv however the discovery of the pv receptor cd155 in 1989 led to the use of hcd155 transgenic mice as a model of pv infection8 these mice are not susceptible to pv by the oral route and must be exposed intranasally or by intramuscular infection to induce paralytic disease9 interestingly hcd155 mice that have a disruption in the interferon ifn-receptor gene are susceptible to oral infection10 this finding has given rise to speculation that an intact ifn- response may be responsible for limiting infection in the majority of individuals exposed to pv thus mouse models have proven to be very useful in gaining a better understanding of pv disease and pathogenesis rhesus macaques are not susceptible to pv by the oral route but they have been used extensively to study vaccine formulations for safety and immunogenicity for monitoring neurovirulence of the live attenuated sabin vaccine and in the past for typing pv strains11 bonnet monkeys are also susceptible to oral inoculation of pv which results in the gastrointestinal shedding of virus for several weeks with paralysis occurring in only a small proportion of animals consistent paralytic disease can be induced in bonnet monkeys macaca radiata through exposure to pv by infection into the right ulnar nerve at the elbow resulting in limb paralysis that resembles human paralytic poliomyelitis both clinically and pathologically12 as such bonnet monkeys can be used to study pv distribution and pathology and the induction of paralytic poliomyelitis or provocation paralysis13
 hepatitis a virus causes jaundice which is a public health problem worldwide the incubation period lasts from 15 to 45 days with an average of 28 days transmission between humans occurs by the oralfecal route person-to-person contact or ingestion of contaminated food and water14 hepatitis a virus causes an acute and self-limited infection of the liver with a spectrum of signs and symptoms ranging from subclinical disease to jaundice fulminant hepatitis and in some cases death15 16
 the disease can be divided into four clinical phases 1 incubation period during which the patient is asymptomatic but virus replicates and possibly transmits to others 2 prodromal period which might last from a few days to a week with patients generally experiencing anorexia fever 103 f fatigue malaise myalgia nausea and vomiting 3 icteric phase in which increased bilirubin causes characteristic dark brownish colored urine this sign is followed by pale stool and yellowish discoloration of the mucous membranes conjunctiva sclera and skin most patients develop an enlarged liver and approximately 515 of the patients have splenomegaly 4 convalescent period with resolution of the disease and recovery of the patient rarely during the icteric phase extensive necrosis of the liver occurs these patients show a sudden increase in body temperature marked abdominal pain vomiting jaundice and the development of hepatic encephalopathy associated with coma and seizures all signs of fulminant hepatitis death occurs in 7090 of patients with fulminant hepatitis16
 experiments showed that hepatitis a causes disease only in humans chimpanzees several species of south american marmosets stump-tailed monkeys and owl monkeys via the oral or intravenous iv routes17 18 19 20 it is known that cynomolgus macaques are infected with hepatitis a virus in the wild21 amado et al used cynomolgus macaques macaca fascicularis for experimental hepatitis a infections17 the animals did not exhibit clinical signs of disease but viral shedding was observed in saliva and stool as early as 6 h postinoculation pi and 7 days pi respectively although mild-to-moderate hepatic pathology was observed in all macaques seroconversion and mildly increased alanine aminotransferase alt an enzyme associated with liver function were observed in some of them because this study had a very small group of animals four macaques the data should not be considered as conclusive and more studies are needed to better define the cynomolgus macaque model
 although hepatitis a virus is transmitted by the oral fecal route studies in chimpanzees and tamarins showed that the iv route was much more infectious than oral route was there was no correlation between dose and development of clinical disease for either species or experimental routes and similar to cynomolgus macaques none of these species showed clinical signs of disease20
 inoculation of common marmosets callithrix jacchus with hepatitis a virus did not produce clinical signs of disease as seen in other nhp models22 23 liver enzyme levels increased on day 14 pi and monkeys had measurable antihepatitis a antibodies by day 32 pi an experimental study with cell culture-adapted hepatitis a virus in guinea pigs challenged by oral or intraperitoneal routes did not result in clinical disease increase in liver enzymes or seroconversion24 viral load was detected in stool and serum between days 14 and 52 and 21 and 49 days respectively liver pathology showed mild hepatitis furthermore histopathology indicated that virus replicated in extrahepatic tissues such as spleen regional lymph nodes and intestinal tract in summary none of the animal models for hepatitis a infection is suitable for studying pathogenesis of the virus because all clinical and most of the laboratory parameters remain within normal range or only slightly increased after the infection one possibility is to test the safety of vaccines against hepatitis a virus in those models with demonstrable viral shedding noroviruses of which norwalk is the prototypic member are responsible for up to 85 of reported food-borne gastroenteritis cases in developing countries this virus is responsible for approximately 200000 deaths annually25 a typical disease course is self-limiting but there have been incidences of necrotizing enterocolitis and seizures in infants26 27 symptoms of infection include diarrhea vomiting nausea abdominal cramping dehydration and fever incubation normally is for 13 days with symptoms enduring for 23 days28 viral shedding is indicative of immunocompromised status within an individual with the elderly and young having a prolonged state of shedding29 transmission occurs predominately through the oralfecal route with contaminated food and water being the major vector30
 a major hindrance to basic research into this pathogen is the lack of a cell culture system therefore animal models are used not only to determine the efficacy of novel drugs and vaccines but also for understanding the pathogenesis of the virus therapeutic intervention consists of rehydration therapy and antiemetic medication31 no vaccine is available and development of one is expected to be challenging given that immunity is short lived after infection32
 nhps including marmosets cotton-top tamarins and rhesus macaques infected with norwalk virus can be monitored for the extent of viral shedding however no clinical disease is observed in these models disease progression and severity are measured exclusively by assay of viral shedding33 it was determined that more virus was needed to create an infection when challenging by the oral route than when challenging by the iv route chimpanzees were exposed to a clinical isolate of norwalk virus by the iv route although none of the animals developed disease symptoms viral shedding within the feces was observed within 25 days postinfection and lasted anywhere from 17 days to 6 weeks viremia never occurred and no histopathological changes were detected the amount and duration of viral shedding were in line with what is observed upon human infection34 a recently identified calicivirus of rhesus origin named tulane virus was used as a surrogate model of infection rhesus macaques exposed to tulane virus intragastrically developed diarrhea and fever 2 days postinfection viral shedding was achieved for 8 days the immune system produced antibodies that dropped in concentration within 38 days postinfection mirroring the short-lived immunity documented in humans the intestine developed moderate blunting of the villi as seen in human disease35
 a murine norovirus has been identified and is closely related to human norwalk virus however clinically the viruses present a different disease the murine norovirus does not induce diarrhea nor vomiting and can develop a persistent infection in contrast to human disease36 37 38
 porcine enteric caliciviruses can induce diarrheal disease in young pigs and an asymptomatic infection in adults39 gnotobiotic pigs can successfully be infected with a passaged clinical noroviruses isolate orally diarrheal disease developed in 74 of the animals and 44 were able to shed virus in their stool no major histopathological changes or viral persistence was noted40
 calves are naturally infected with bovine noroviruses experimentally challenging calves with an oral inoculation of a bovine isolate resulted in diarrheal disease 1416 h postinfection recovery was achieved after 535 and 67 h postinfection41
 easter equine encephalitis virus eeev was first documented as a disease of horses in massachusetts when 75 horses died in three counties along the northeast coast during the summer of 1831 although additional horse cases were reported between 1845 and 1912 in new york north carolina new jersey maryland and virginia42 43 eeev was not successfully isolated from the brains of infected horses until 1933 the link between equine cases and the human disease was confirmed in 1938 by observing 30 cases of fatal encephalitis in children living in the same area as the equine cases during this outbreak eeev was isolated from the cnss of these children as well as from pigeons and pheasants44
 eeev primarily affects areas near salty marshes and can cause localized outbreaks of disease in the summer the enzootic cycles are maintained in moist environments such as coastal areas shaded marshy salt swamps in north america na and moist forests in central america and south america sa45 birds are the primary reservoir and the virus is transmitted via mosquitoes furthermore forest-dwelling rodents bats and marsupials frequently become infected and may provide an additional reservoir in central america and sa despite known natural hosts the transmission cycles in these animals are not well characterized44 reptiles and amphibians have also been reported to become infected by eeev eeev pathogenesis and disease have been studied in several laboratory animals as a natural host birds do not generally develop encephalitis except pheasants or emus in which eeev causes encephalitis with 5070 mortality46 young chickens show signs of extensive myocarditis in early experimental infection and heart failure rather than encephalitis is the cause of death47 besides the heart other organs such as pancreas and kidney show multifocal necrosis additionally lymphocytopenia has been observed in the thymus and spleen in birds45
 eeev causes neuronal damage in newborn mice and the disease progresses rapidly resulting in death48 similarly eeev produces fatal encephalitis in older mice when administered via the intracerebral route whereas inoculation via the subcutaneous route causes a pantropic infection eventually resulting in encephalitis49 50
 guinea pigs and hamsters have also been used as animal models for eeev studies51 52 guinea pigs developed neurological involvement with decreased activity tremors circling behavior and coma neuronal necrosis was observed and resulted in brain lesions in these animals52 subcutaneous inoculation of eeev produced lethal biphasic disease in hamsters with severe lesions of nerve cells the early visceral phase with viremia was followed by neuroinvasion encephalitis and death in addition parenchyma necroses were observed in the liver and lymphoid organs51
 intradermal intramuscular or iv inoculations of eeev in nhps cause disease but does not always result in symptoms of the nervous system intracerebral infection of eeev results in nervous system disease and fatality in monkeys53 the differences in these models indicate that the initial viremia and the secondary nervous system infection do not overlap in monkeys when they are infected by the peripheral route54 intranasal and intralingual inoculations of eeev also cause nervous system symptoms in monkeys but less drastic than those caused by intracerebral injections54 the aerosol route of infection also progresses to uniformly lethal disease in cynomolgus macaques55 in this model fever was followed by elevated white blood cells and liver enzymes neurological signs subsequently developed and nhps became moribund and were euthanized between days 5 and 9 days postexposure meningoencephalomyelitis was the main pathology observed in the brains of these animals56 similar clinical signs and pathology were observed when common marmosets were infected with eeev by the intranasal route57 both aerosol and intranasal nhp models had similar disease progression and pathology as those seen in human disease a common marmoset model was used for comparison studies of sa and na strains of eeev57 previous studies indicated that the sa strain is less virulent than na strain for humans common marmosets were infected intranasally with either the na or sa strain of eeev na strain-infected animals showed signs of anorexia and neurological involvement and were euthanized 45 days after the challenge although sa strain-infected animals developed viremia they remained healthy and survived the challenge epizootics of viral encephalitis in horses were previously described in argentina more than 25000 horses died from western equine encephalitis virus weev in the central plains of the united states in 191258 weev was first isolated from the brains of horses during the outbreak in the san joaquin valley of california in 1930 although it was suspected the first diagnosis of weev as a cause of human encephalitis occurred in 1938 when the virus was recovered from the brain of a child with fatal encephalitis44 in horses the signs of disease are fever loss of coordination drowsiness and anorexia leading to prostration coma and death in about 40 of affected animals59 weev also infects other species of birds and often causes fatal disease in sparrows weev infection occurs throughout western na and sporadically in sa as it circulates between its mosquito vector and wild birds44 chickens and other domestic birds pheasants rodents rabbits ungulates tortoises and snakes are natural reservoirs of weev60 61 weev has caused epidemics of encephalitis in humans horses and emus but the fatality rate is lower than that for eeev62 predominately young children and those older than 50 years demonstrate the clinical symptoms of the disease63 severe disease seizures fatal encephalitis and significant sequelae are more likely to occur in infants and young children64 65 typically the disease progresses asymptomatically with seroprevalence in humans being fairly common in endemic areas species used to develop animal models for weev are mice hamsters guinea pigs and ponies studies with ponies resulted in viremia in 100 of the animals 15 days pi fever was observed in 7 of 11 animals and six exhibited signs of encephalitis44
 after subcutaneous inoculation with weev suckling mice started to show signs of disease by 24 h and died within 48 h66 in suckling mice the heart was the only organ in which pathologic changes were observed conversely adult mice exhibited signs of lethargy and ruffled fur on days 45 postinfection mice were severely ill by day 8 and appeared hunched and dehydrated death occurred between days 7 and 14 and both brain and mesodermal tissues such as heart lungs liver and kidney were involved66 67 intracerebral and intranasal routes of infection resulted in a fatal disease that was highly dependent on dose while intradermal and subcutaneous inoculations caused only 50 fatality in mice regardless of the amount of virus49
 studies demonstrated that although the length of the incubation period and the disease duration varied weev infection resulted in mortality in hamsters by all routes of inoculation progressive lack of coordination shivering rapid and noisy breathing corneal opacity and conjunctival discharge resulting in closing of the eyelids were indicative of disease in all cases68 cns involvement was evident with intracerebral intraperitoneal and intradermal inoculations68 weev is highly infectious to guinea pigs69 intraperitoneal inoculation of weev is fatal in guinea pigs regardless of virus inoculum with the animals exhibiting signs of illness on days 34 followed by death on days 59 nalca unpublished results very limited studies have been performed with nhps the intranasal route of infection causes severe lethal encephalitis in rhesus macaques54 reed et al exposed cynomolgus macaques to low and high doses of aerosolized weev the animals subsequently developed fever increased white blood counts and cns involvement demonstrating that the cynomolgus macaque model would be useful for testing of vaccines and therapeutics against weev70
 venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev is maintained in nature in a cycle between small rodents and mosquitoes45 the spread of epizootic strains of the virus to equines leads to high viremia followed by a lethal encephalitis and tangential spread to humans veev can easily be spread by the aerosol route making it a considerable danger for laboratory exposure in humans veev infection causes a sudden onset of malaise fever chills headache and sore throat45 71 72 symptoms persist for 46 days followed by a 2- to 3-week period of generalized weakness encephalitis occurs in a small percentage of adults 05 however the rate in children may be as high as 4 neurologic symptoms range from nuchal rigidity ataxia and convulsions to the more severe cases exhibiting coma and paralysis the overall mortality rate in humans is 145
 laboratory animals such as mice guinea pigs and nhps exhibit different pathologic responses when infected with veev the lymphatic system is a general target in all animals infected with cns involvement variable between different animal species the disease caused by veev progresses very rapidly without showing signs of cns disease in guinea pigs and hamsters mortality is typically observed within 24 days after infection and fatality is not dose dependent44 veev infection lasts longer in mice which develop signs of nervous system disease in 56 days and death 12 days later lethal dose in mice changes depending on the age of mice and the route of exposure56 in contrast to guinea pigs and hamsters the time of the death in mice is dose dependent mortality is observed generally within 24 days after infection and fatality is not dose dependent subcutaneousdermal infection in the mouse model results in encephalitic disease very similar to that seen in horses and humans73 virus begins to replicate in the draining lymph nodes at 4 h pi eventually virus enters the brain primarily via the olfactory system furthermore aerosol exposure of mice to veev can result in massive infection of the olfactory neuroepithelium olfactory nerves and olfactory bulbs and viral spread to brain resulting in necrotizing panencephalitis74 75 aerosol and dermal inoculation routes cause neurological pathology in mice much faster than other routes of exposure do the clinical signs of disease in mice infected by aerosol are ruffled fur lethargy and hunching progressing to death56 74 75 intranasal challenge of c3hhen mice with high dose veev caused high morbidity and mortality76 viral titers in brain peaked on day 4 postchallenge and stayed high until animals died on day 910 postchallenge protein cytokine array done on brains of infected mice showed elevated interleukin il-1a il-1b il-6 il-12 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 ifng mip-1a and regulated and normal t-cell expressed and secreted levels this model was used successfully to test antivirals against veev77
 veev infection causes a typical biphasic febrile response in nhps initial fever was observed at 1272 h after infection and lasted 12 h secondary fever generally began on day 5 and lasted 34 days78 veev-infected nhps exhibited mild symptoms such as anorexia irritability diarrhea and tremors leucopenia was common in animals exhibiting fever79 supporting the leucopenia observed microscopic changes in lymphatic tissues such as early destruction of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and spleen a mild lymphocytic infiltrate in the hepatic triads focal myocardial necrosis with lymphocytic infiltration have been observed in monkeys infected with veev surprisingly characteristic lesions of the cns were observed histopathologically in monkeys in spite of the lack of any clinical signs of infection78 the primary lesions were lymphocytic perivascular cuffing and glial proliferation and generally observed at day 6 postinfection during the secondary febrile episode cynomolgus macaques develop similar clinical signs including fever viremia lymphopenia and encephalitis upon aerosol exposure to veev80
 chikungunya virus is a member of the genus alphaviruses specifically the semliki forest complex and has been responsible for a multitude of epidemics mainly within africa and southeast asia45 the virus is transmitted by aedes mosquitoes given the widespread endemicity of aedes mosquitoes chikungunya virus has the potential to spread to previously unaffected areas this is typified by the emergence of disease for the first time in 2005 in the islands of the southwest indian ocean including the french la reunion island and the appearance in central italy in 200781 82
 the incubation period after a mosquito bite is 25 days followed by a self-limiting acute phase that lasts 34 days symptoms during this period include fever arthralgia myalgia and rash headache weakness nausea vomiting and polyarthralgia have all been reported83 individuals typically develop a stooped posture due to the pain for approximately 12 of infected individuals joint pain can last months after resolution of primary disease and has the possibility to relapse underlying health conditions including diabetes alcoholism or renal disease increase the risk of developing a severe form of disease that includes hepatitis or encephalopathy children between the ages of 3 and 18 years have an increased risk of developing neurological manifestations84 there is no effective vaccine or antiviral wild-type c57bl6 adult mice are not permissive to chikungunya virus infection by intradermal inoculation however it was demonstrated that neonatal mice were susceptible and severity was dependent upon age at infection six-day-old mice developed paralysis by day 6 and all died by day 12 whereas 50 of nine-day-old mice were able to recover from infection by 12 days mice were no longer permissive to disease infected mice developed loss of balance hind limb dragging and skin lesions neonatal mice were also used as a model for neurological complications85 86
 an adult mouse model has been developed by injection of the ventral side of the footpad of c57bl6j mice viremia lasted 45 days accompanied by foot swelling and noted inflammation of the musculoskeletal tissue87 88 adult ifnabr knockout mice also developed mild disease with symptoms including muscle weakness and lethargy symptoms that mirrored human infection all adult mice died within 3 days this model was useful in identifying the viral cellular tropism for fibroblasts85 imprinting control region icr cd1 mice can also be used as a disease model neonatal mice subcutaneously inoculated with a passaged clinical isolate of chikungunya virus developed lethargy loss of balance and difficulty in walking mortality was low 17 and 8 for newborn cd1 and icr mice respectively the remaining mice fully recovered within 6 weeks after infection86 a drawback of both the ifnabr and cd1 mice is that the disease is not a result of immunopathogenesis as occurs in human cases given that the mice are immunocompromised89
 long-tailed macaques challenged with a clinical isolate of the virus developed a similar clinical disease to humans initially the monkeys developed high viremia with fever and rash after this period viremia resolved and virus could be detected in lymphoid liver meninges joint and muscle tissue the last stage mimicked the chronic phase in which virus could be detected up to two months after infection although no arthralgia was noted90
 dengue virus is transmitted via the mosquito vectors aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus91 given the endemicity of the vectors it is estimated that half of the worlds population is at risk for exposure to dengue virus this results in approximately 50 million cases of dengue each year with the burden of disease in the tropical and subtropical regions of latin america south asia and southeast asia92 it is estimated that there are 20000 deaths each year caused by dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf93
 there are four serotypes of dengue virus numbered 14 which are capable of causing a wide spectrum of disease that ranges from asymptomatic to severe with the development of dhf94 incubation can range from 3 to 14 days with the average being 47 days the virus targets dendritic cells and macrophages after a mosquito bite95 typical infection results in classic dengue fever df which is self-limiting and has flu-like symptoms in conjunction with retroorbital pain headache skin rash and bone and muscle pain dhf can follow with vascular leak syndrome and low platelet count resulting in hemorrhage in the most extreme cases dengue shock syndrome dss develops characterized by hypotension shock and circulatory failure94 thrombocytopenia is a hallmark clinical sign of infection and aids in differential diagnosis96
 severe disease has a higher propensity to occur upon secondary infection with a different dengue virus serotype97 this is hypothesized to occur due to antibody-dependent enhancement ade there is no approved vaccine or drug and hospitalized patients receive supportive care including fluid replacement in developing an animal model it is important to note that mosquitoes typically deposit 104106
 pfu and is therefore the optimal range to be used during challenge a comprehensive review of the literature regarding animal models of dengue infection was recently published by zompi et al98
 several laboratory mouse strains including aj balbc and c57bl6 are permissive to dengue infection however the resulting disease has little resemblance to human clinical signs and death results from paralysis99 100 101 a higher dose of an adapted dengue virus strain induced dhf symptoms in both balbc and c57bl6102 103 this model can also yield asymptomatic infections a mouse-adapted ma strain of dengue virus 2 introduced into ag129 mice developed vascular leak syndrome similar to the severe disease seen in humans104 passive transfer of monoclonal dengue antibodies within mice leads to ade during the course of infection viremia was increased and animals died due to vascular leak syndrome105 another ma strain injected into balbc caused liver damage hemorrhagic manifestations and vascular permeability103 intracranial injection of suckling mice with dengue virus leads to death and has been used to test the efficacy of therapeutics106
 scid mice engrafted with human tumor cells develop paralysis upon infection and are thus not useful for pathogenesis studies107 108 df symptoms developed after infection in nodscidil2rgko mice engrafted with cd34 human progenitor cells109 rag-hu mice developed fever but no other symptoms upon infection with a passaged clinical isolate and laboratory-adapted strain of dengue virus 2110
 a passaged clinical isolate of dengue virus type 3 was recently used to create a model in immunocompetent adult mice interperitoneal injection in c57bl6j and balbc caused lethality by day 67 postinfection in a dose-dependent manner the first indication of infection was weight loss beginning on day 4 followed by thrombocytopenia a drop in systolic blood pressure along with noted increases in the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase ast and alt were also observed viremia was established by day 5 this model mimicked the characteristic symptoms observed in human dhfdss cases111
 a novel model was developed that used infected mosquitoes as the route of transmission to hu-nsg mice female mosquitoes were intrathoracically inoculated with a clinical isolate of dengue virus type 2 infected mosquitoes then fed upon the mouse footpad to allow for the transmission of the virus via the natural route the amount of virus detected within the mouse was directly proportional to the amount of mosquitoes it was exposed to with four to five being optimal detectable viral rna was in line with what is observed during human infection severe thrombocytopenia developed on day 14 this model is intriguing given that disease was enhanced with mosquito delivery of the virus in comparison to injection of the virus112
 nhp models have used a subcutaneous inoculation in an attempt to induce disease although the animals are permissive to viral replication it is to a lower degree than that observed in human infection113 the immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide enhances infection in rhesus macaques by allowing the virus to invade monocytes114 throughout these preliminary studies no clinical disease was detected to circumvent this a higher dose of dengue virus was used in an iv challenge of rhesus macaques hemorrhagic manifestations appeared by day 3 and resulted in petechiae hematomas and coagulopathy however no other symptoms developed115 further development would allow this model to be used for testing of novel therapeutics and vaccines although primates do not develop disease upon infection with dengue their immune system does produce antibodies similar to those observed during the course of human infection this has been advantageous in studying ade sequential infection led to a crossreactive antibody response which has been demonstrated in both humans and mice116 this phenotype can also be seen upon passive transfer of a monoclonal antibody to dengue and subsequent infection with the virus rhesus macaques exposed in this manner developed viremia that was 3- to 100-fold higher than was previously reported however no clinical signs were apparent117 the lack of inducible dhf or dss symptoms hinders further examination of pathogenesis within this model japanese encephalitis virus  jev is a leading cause of childhood viral encephalitis in southern and eastern asia and is a problem among military personnel and travelers to these regions it was first isolated from the brain of a patient who died from encephalitis in japan in 1935118
culex mosquitoes which breed in rice fields transmit the virus from birds or mammals mostly domestic pigs to humans the disease symptoms range from a mild febrile illness to acute meningomyeloencephalitis after an asymptomatic incubation period of 12 weeks patients show signs of fever headache stupor and generalized motor seizures especially in children the virus causes encephalitis by invading and destroying the cortical neurons the fatality rate ranges from 10 to 50 and most survivors have neurological and psychiatric sequelae119 120
 jev virus causes fatality in infant mice by all routes of inoculation differences in pathogenesis and outcome are seen when the virus is given by intraperitoneal inoculation121 these differences depend on the amount of virus and the specific viral strains used the biphasic viral multiplication after peripheral inoculation is observed in mice tissues primary virus replication occurs in the peripheral tissues and the secondary replication phase in the brain122
 hamsters are another small animal species that are used as an animal model for jev fatality was observed in hamsters inoculated intracerebrally or intranasally while peripheral inoculation caused asymptomatic viremia studies with rabbits and guinea pigs showed that all routes of inoculation of jev produce asymptomatic infection123
 serial sampling studies with 12-day-old wistar rats inoculated intracerebrally with jev indicated that jev causes the overproduction of free radicals by neurons and apoptosis of neuronal cells124 following a study in 2010 by the same group showed that although cytokines tumor necrosis factor tnf- ifn- il-4 il-6 il-10 and chemokine mcp-1 increased gradually and peaked on days 10 pi with jev in rats the levels eventually declined and there was no correlation with the levels of cytokines and chemokines and neuronal damage125
 intracerebral inoculation of jev causes severe histopathological changes in brain hemispheres of rhesus monkeys symptoms such as weakness tremors and convulsions began to appear on days 610 with indicative signs of encephalomyelitis occurring on days 812 postinfection for most of the animals followed by death occurring on days 812 postinfection for most of the animals followed by death126 although intranasal inoculation of jev results in fatality in both rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys peripheral inoculation causes asymptomatic viremia in these species123 127
 west nile virus wnv was first isolated from the blood of a woman in the west nile district of uganda in 1937128 after the initial isolation of wnv the virus was subsequently isolated from patients birds and mosquitoes in egypt in the early 1950s129 130 and was shown to cause encephalitis in humans and horses wnv is recognized as the most widespread of the flaviviruses with a geographical distribution that includes africa the middle east western asia europe and australia131 the virus first reached the western hemisphere in the summer of 1999 during an outbreak involving humans horses and birds in the new york city metropolitan area132 133 since 1999 the range of areas affected by wnv quickly extended older people and children are most susceptible to wnv disease wnv generally causes asymptomatic disease or a mild undifferentiated fever west nile fever which can last from 3 to 6 days134 the mortality rate after neuroinvasive disease ranges from 4 to 11131 135 136 137 the most severe complications are commonly seen in the elderly with reported case fatality rates from 4 to 11 hepatitis myocarditis and pancreatitis are unusual severe nonneurologic manifestations of wnv infection although many early laboratory studies of wn encephalitis were performed in nhps mice rat hamster horse pig dog and cat models were used to study the disease138 139 140 141 142 143 144
 inoculation of wnv into nhps intracerebrally resulted in the development of either encephalitis febrile disease or an asymptomatic infection depending on the virus strain and dose viral persistence is observed in these animals regardless of the outcome of infection ie asymptomatic fever encephalitis141 thus viral persistence is regarded as a typical result of nhp infection with various wnv strains after both intracerebral and subcutaneous inoculation the virus localizes predominantly in the brain and may also be found in the kidneys spleen and lymph nodes wnv does not result in clinical disease in nhps although the animals show a low level of viremia145 146
 wnv has also been extensively studied in small animals all classical laboratory mouse strains are susceptible to lethal infections by the intracerebral and intraperitoneal routes resulting in encephalitis and 100 mortality intradermal route pathogenesis studies indicated that langerhans dentritic cells are the initial viral replication sites in the skin147 148 the infected langerhans cells then migrate to lymph nodes and the virus enters the blood through lymphatic and thoracic ducts and disseminates to peripheral tissues for secondary viral replication virus eventually travels to the cns and causes pathology that is similar to human cases149 150 151 152
 tesh et al developed a model for wn encephalitis using the golden hamster mesocricetus auratus hamsters appeared normal during the first 5 days became lethargic at approximately day 6 and developed neurologic symptoms by days 710143 many of the severely affected animals died 714 days after infection viremia was detected in the hamsters within 24 h after infection and persisted for 56 days although there were no substantial changes in internal organs progressive pathologic differences were seen in the brain and spinal cord of infected animals furthermore similar to the above-mentioned monkey experiments by pogodina et al persistent wnv infection was found in the brains of hamsters the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars sars-coronavirus cov emerged in 2002 as it spread throughout 32 countries in a period of 6 months infecting 8000 people and causing nearly 800 deaths153 154 the main mechanism of transmission of sars-cov is through droplet spread but it is also viable in dry form on surfaces for up to 6 days and can be detected in stool suggesting other modes of transmission are also possible155
 although other members of the family usually cause mild illness sars-cov infection has a 10 case fatality with the majority of cases in people over the age of 15 years156 157 after an incubation period of 210 days clinical signs of sars include general malaise fever chills diarrhea dyspnea and cough158 in some sars cases pneumonia may develop and progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards fever usually dissipates within 2 weeks and coincides with the induction of high levels of neutralizing antibodies159
 in humans sars-cov replication destroys respiratory epithelium and a great deal of the pathogenesis is due to the subsequent immune responses160 infiltrates persisting within the lung and diffuse alveolar damage dad are common sequelae of sars-cov infection virus can be isolated from secretions of the upper airways during early but not later stages of infection as well as from other tissues161
 sars-cov can replicate in many species including dogs cats pigs mice rats ferrets foxes and nhps162 chinese palm civets raccoon dogs and bats are possible natural hosts no model captures all aspects of human clinical disease pyrexia and respiratory signs mortality 10 viral replication and pathology163 in general the sars-cov disease course in the model species is much milder and of shorter duration than in humans viral replication in the various animal models may occur without clinical illness andor histopathologic changes the best-characterized models use mice hamsters ferrets and nhps table 381
 mouse models of sars-cov typically are inoculated by the intranasal route under light anesthesia young 6- to 8-week old balbc mice exposed to sars-cov have viral replication detected in the lungs and nasal turbinates with a peak on day 2 and clearance by day 5 postexposure there is also viral replication within the small intestines of young balbc mice however young mice have no clinical signs aside from reduced weight gain and have little to no inflammation within the lungs pneumonitis intranasal sars-cov infection of c57bl6 b6 also yield reduced weight gain and viral replication in the lungs with a peak on day 3 and clearance by day 9171 in contrast balbc mice 1314 months of age show weight loss hunched posture dehydration and ruffled fur on days 36 postexposure interstitial pneumonitis alveolar damage and death also occur in old mice resembling the age-dependent virulence observed in humans 129s mice and b6 mice show outcomes to sars-cov infection similar to those observed for balbc mice but have lower titers and less prolonged disease one problem is that it is more difficult to obtain large numbers of mice older than 1 year a number of immunocompromised knockout mouse models of intranasal sars-cov infection have also been developed 129svev mice infected with sars-cov by the intranasal route develop bronchiolitis with peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation in adjacent alveolar septae172 viral replication and disease in these mice resolve by day 14 postexposure beige cd1 and rag1 mice infected with sars-cov have similar outcomes to infected balbc mice with regard to viral replication timing of viral clearance and a lack of clinical signs signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 stat1 ko mice infected intranasally with sars-cov have severe disease with weight loss pneumonitis interstitial pneumonia and some deaths the stat1 ko mouse model is therefore useful for studies of pathogenicity pathology and evaluation of vaccines syrian golden hamsters strain lvg are also susceptible to intranasal exposure of sars-cov after the administration of 103 tcid50 tissue culture infective dose along with a period of transient viremia sars-cov replicates in nasal turbinates and lungs resulting in pneumonitis there are no obvious signs of disease but exercise wheels can be used to monitor decrease in nighttime activity some mortality has been observed but it was not dose dependent and could have more to do with genetic differences between animals because the strain is not inbred163 damage is not observed in the liver or spleen despite detection of virus within these tissues several studies have shown that intratracheal inoculation of sars-cov in anesthetized ferrets mustela furo results in lethargy fever sneezing and nasal discharge167 clinical disease has been observed in several studies sars-cov is detected in pharyngeal swabs trachea tracheobronchial lymph nodes and high titers within the lungs mortality has been observed around day 4 postexposure as well as mild alveolar damage in 510 of the lungs occasionally accompanied by severe pathology within the lungs173 with fever overt respiratory signs lung damage and some mortality the ferret intratracheal model of sars-cov infection is perhaps most similar to human sars albeit with a shorter time course sars-cov infection of nhps by intransal or intratracheal routes generally results in a very mild infection which resolves quickly sars-cov infection of old world monkeys such as rhesus macaques cynomolgus macaques cynos and african green monkeys agms have been studied with variable results possibly due to the outbred nature of the groups studied or previous exposure to related pathogens clinical illness and viral loads have not been consistent however replication within the lungs and dad are features of the infections for each of the primate species some cynos have no illness but others have rash lethargy and respiratory signs and pathology170 rhesus have little to no disease and only have mild findings upon histopathological analysis agms infected with sars-cov have no overt clinical signs but dad and pneumonitis have been documented viral replication has been detected for up to 10 days in the lungs of agms however the infection resolves and does not progress to fatal ards farmed chinese masked palm civets sold in open markets in china were thought to be involved in the sars-cov outbreak intratracheal and intranasal inoculation of civets with sars-cov results in lethargy decreased aggressiveness fever diarrhea and conjunctivitis174 leucopenia pneumonitis and alveolar septal enlargement with lesions similar to those observed in ferrets and nhps have also been observed in laboratory-infected civets common marmosets have also been shown to be susceptible to sars-cov infection175
 vaccines have been developed for related animal covs in chickens cattle dogs cats and swine have used live-attenuated killed dna and viral-vectored vaccine strategies176 an important issue to highlight from work on these vaccines is that cov vaccines such as those developed for cats may induce a more severe disease177 as such immune mice had th2-type immunopathology upon sars-cov challenge178 severe hepatitis in vaccinated ferrets with antibody enhancement in liver has been reported179 additionally rechallenge of agms showed limited viral replication but significant lung inflammation including alveolitis and interstitial pneumonia which persisted for long periods of time after viral clearance180
 mouse and nhp models with increased virulence may be developed by adapting the virus by repeated passage within the species of interest ma sars and human ace2 transgenic mice are available181
 all mammals experimentally or naturally exposed to rabies virus have been found to be susceptible this highly neurotropic virus is a member of the lyssavirus
genus and is transmitted from the bite of an infected animal to humans182 the virus is able to replicate within the muscle cells at the site of the bite and then travel to the cns once reaching the cns by retrograde axonal transport the virus replicates within neurons creating inflammation and necrosis the virus subsequently spreads throughout the body via peripheral nerves183
 a typical incubation period is 3090 days and is highly dependent upon the location of the bite proximity to the brain is a major factor for the onset of symptoms the prodromal stage lasts from 2 to 10 days and is when the virus initially invades the cns flu-like symptoms are the norm in conjunction with pain and inflammation at the site of the bite subsequently there are two forms of disease that can develop in 80 of cases an individual develops the encephalitic or furious form this form is marked by hyperexcitability autonomic dysfunction and hydrophobia the paralytic or dumb form is characterized by ascending paralysis ultimately both forms result in death days after the onset of symptoms once the symptoms develop there is no proven effective therapy in the developing world death is caused by the lack of access to medical care including postexposure prophylaxis in na fatal cases result because of late diagnosis184
 syrian hamsters have been challenged with rabies virus intracerebrally intraperitoneally intradermally and intranasally all animals died as a result of the exposure although intracerebral and intranasal inoculation led to only the furious form depicted by extreme irritability spasms excessive salivation and cries the virus used had been isolated from an infected dog brain and passaged in swiss albino mice animals inoculated by intracerebral injection develop disease within 46 days whereas all other routes of entry develop disease within 612 days185 this model has been used to study and test novel vaccine candidates186
 mice have been extensively studied as an animal model for rabies it was shown that swiss albino mice intracerebrally injected with a virus isolated from a dog developed only the paralytic form of disease 6 days after the initial challenge balbc mice are universally susceptible to intracerebral injection of rabies virus within 9 days disease symptoms include paralysis cachexia and bristling appearing 13 days before death187 a more natural route of infection via peripheral injection into masseter muscles was tested on icr mice these mice developed neurological signs including limb paralysis and all died within 612 days188 icr mice have been instrumental in analyzing novel vaccines and correlates of protection189 this line of mice was also used to assess the value of ketamine treatment to induce coma during rabies infection190 another mouse line used is the p75 neurotrophin receptor-deficient mouse this mouse developed a fatal encephalitis when inoculated intracerebrally with the challenge virus standard191 bax-deficient mice have also been used to determine the role of apoptotic cell death in the brain during the course of infection192 a viral isolate from silver-haired bats can also be used in the mouse model this strain is advantageous given that it is responsible for the majority of deaths in north na193
 early death phenomenon is typified by a decrease to time of death in a subset of individuals and animals that have been vaccinated and subsequently exposed to rabies194 this trend has been demonstrated experimentally in swiss outbred mice and primates195 196
 cynomolgus and rhesus were both infected with passaged rabies virus to create an nhp model a high titer of virus was needed to induce disease but exposure was found to not be universally fatal the animals that survived beyond 4 weeks within the experiment did not develop clinical disease nor succumb to infection primates that did develop disease refused food and had progressively less activity until death this lasted from 24 h up to 4 days with all animals with symptoms dying within 2 weeks196
 bats have been experimentally challenged with rabies vampire bats desmodus rotundus intramuscularly injected with a bat viral isolate displayed clinical signs including paralysis in half of the population of the study animals of those who did develop disease the duration was 2 days and incubation period ranged from 7 to 30 days regardless of disease manifestation 89 of challenged animals died197
 skunks can be challenged intramuscularly or intranasally with either challenge virus strain or a skunk viral isolate interestingly the challenge virus strain more readily produced the paralytic form whereas the street form of rabies developed into the furious form however the challenge strain virus resulted in a shorter incubation period of 78 days in comparison to 1214 days seen with the street virus198
 filoviridae consists of two well-established genera ebola virus and marburg virus marv and a newly discovered group cuevavirus199 table 382
 it is thought that fruit bats are the natural host reservoir for these viruses that have lethality rates from 40 to 82 in humans marv first emerged in 1967 in germany when laboratory workers contracted the virus from agms chlorocebus aerthiops that were shipped from uganda ebola viruses sudan and zaire sudv and ebov caused nearly simultaneous outbreaks in 1976 in what is now the democratic republic of congo drc bundibugyo virus bdbv first emerged in 2007 in bundibugyo uganda with 56 confirmed cases200 two other ebola viruses are known ta forest tafv previously named cote circumflex over the o divoire ciebov and reston restv which have not caused major outbreaks or lethal disease in humans the disease in humans is characterized by aberrant innate immunity and a number of clinical symptoms such as fever nausea vomiting arthralgiamyalgia headaches sore throat diarrhea abdominal pain anorexia and numerous others201 approximately 10 of patients develop petechia and a greater percentage depending on the specific strain may develop bleeding from various sites gums puncture sites stools etc199
 natural transmission in an epidemic is thought to be through direct contact or needle sticks in hospital settings however much of the research interest in filoviruses primarily stems from biodefense needs particularly from aerosol biothreats as such intramuscular intraperitoneal and aerosol models have been developed in mice hamsters guinea pigs and nhps for the study of pathogenesis correlates of immunity and for testing countermeasures202 because filoviruses have such high lethality rates in humans scientists have looked for models that are uniformly lethal to stringently test efficacy of candidate vaccines and therapeutics immunocompetent mice have not been successfully infected with wild-type filoviruses due to the control of the infection by the murine type 1 ifn response203 however wild-type inbred mice are susceptible to filovirus that has been ma by serial passage204 balbc mice which are the strain of choice for intraperitoneal inoculation of ma-ebov are not susceptible by the aerosol route205 for aerosol infection of immunocompetent mice a panel of bxd balbc  dba recombinant inbred strains were screened and one strain bxd34 was shown to be particularly susceptible to airborne ma-ebov with 100 lethality to low or high doses 100 or 1000 pfu these mice developed weight loss of 15 and succumbed to infection between days 7 and 8 postexposure the aerosol infection model uses a whole-body exposure chamber to expose mice aged 68 weeks to ma-ebov aerosols with a mass median aerodynamic diameter mmad of approximately 16 m and a geometric standard deviation of approximately 20 for 10 min another approach uses immunodeficient mouse strains such as scid stat1 ko ifn receptor ko or perforin ko with a wild-type ebov inoculum by intraperitoneal or aerosol routes206 mice are typically monitored for clinical disease scores based on activity and appearance weight loss and moribund condition survival coagulopathy a hallmark of filovirus infection in humans has been observed with bleeding in a subset of animals and failure of blood samples to coagulate late in infection liver kidney spleen and lung tissue taken from moribund mice have pathology characteristic of filovirus disease in nhps although most mouse studies have used ma-ebov or ebov an intraperitoneal ma marv model is also available207 ma-marv and ma-ebov models are particularly useful for screening novel antiviral compounds208
 hamsters are frequently used to study cardiovascular disease coagulation disorders and thus serve as the basis for numerous viral hemorrhagic fever models209 an intraperitoneal ma-ebov infection model has been developed in syrian hamsters210 this model which has been used to test a vesicular stomatitis virus vectored vaccine approach uses male 5- to 6-week-old syrian hamsters that are infected with 100 ld50 of ma-ebov virus is present in tissues and blood collected on day 4 and all animals succumbed to the disease by day 6 detailed accounts of this model have been presented at international scientific meetings by ebihara and feldmann et al but have not been reported in a scientific journal at the time of writing this chapter211
 guinea pig models of filovirus infection have been developed for intraperitoneal and aerosol routes using guinea pig-adapted ebov gp-ebov and marv gp-marv212 213 guinea pigs models of filovirus infection are quite useful in that they develop fever which can be monitored at frequent hourly intervals by telemetry additionally the animals are large enough for regular blood sampling in which measurable coagulation defects are observed as the infection progresses hartley guinea pigs exposed to aerosolized gp-marv or gp-ebov become moribund at times comparable to that of nhps generally succumbing to the infection between 7 and 12 days postexposure by aerosol exposure gp-ebov is uniformly lethal at both high and low doses 100 or 1000 pfu target doses but lethality drops with low 1000 pfu presented doses of airborne gp-marv and more protracted disease is seen in some animals213 weight loss of between 15 and 25 is a common finding in guinea pigs exposed to gp-ebov or gp-marv fever which becomes apparent by day 5 occurs more rapidly in gp-ebov exposed guinea pigs than with gp-marv exposure lymphocytes and neutrophils increase during the earlier part of the disease and platelet levels steadily drop as the disease progresses increases in coagulation time can be seen as early as day 6 postexposure blood chemistries ie alt ast alkaline phosphatase alkp and blood urea nitrogen indicating problems with liver and kidney function are also altered late in the disease course nhp models of filovirus infection are the preferred models for more advanced disease characterization and testing of countermeasures because they most closely mimic the disease and immune correlates seen in humans214 old world primates have been primarily used for the development of intraperitoneal intramuscular and aerosol models of filovirus infection uniformly lethal filovirus models have been developed for most of the virus strains in cynomolgus macaques rhesus macaques and to a lesser degree in agms and marmosets215 216 217 218 219 low-passage human isolates that have not been passaged in animals have been sought for development of nhp models to satisfy the food and drug administration fda animal rule prominent features of the infections are onset of fever by day 5 postexposure alteration in liver function enzymes alt ast and alkp decrease in platelets and increased coagulation times clinical disease parameters may have a slightly delayed onset in aerosol models petichial rash is a common sign of filovirus disease and may be more frequently observed in cynomolgus macaques than in other nhp species dyspnea late in infection is a prominent feature of disease after aerosol exposure a number of pronounced pathology findings include multifocal necrosis and fibrin lesions particularly within the liver and the spleen lymphocytolysis and lymphoid depletion are also observed multilead surgically implanted telemetry devices are useful in the continuous collection of temperature blood pressure heart rate and activity levels as such blood pressure drops as animals become moribund and heart rate variability standard deviation of the heart rate is altered late in infection the most recently developed telemetry devices can aid in plethysomography to measure respiratory minute volume for accurate delivery of presented doses for aerosol exposure hendra and nipah virus are unusual within the paramyxoviridae family given that they can infect a large range of mammalian hosts both viruses are grouped under the genus henipavirus the natural reservoirs of the viruses are the fruit bats from the genus pteropus hendra and nipah have the ability to cause severe disease in humans with the potential for a high case fatality rate220 outbreaks caused by nipah virus have been recognized in malaysia singapore bangladesh and india while hendra outbreaks have yet to be reported outside of australia221 222
 hendra was the first member of the genus to be identified and was initially associated with an acute respiratory disease in horses all human cases have been linked to transmission through close contact with an infected horse there have been no confirmed cases of direct transmission from human to human or bat to human nipah has the distinction of being able to be transmitted by humans although the exact route is unknown223 the virus is susceptible to ph temperature and desiccation and thus close contact is hypothesized to be needed for successful transmission224 both viruses have a tropism for the neurological and respiratory tract hendra virus incubation period is 717 days and is marked by a flu-like illness symptoms at this initial stage include myalgia headache lethargy sore throat and vomiting225 disease progression can continue to pneumonitis or encephalitic manifestations with the person succumbing to multiorgan failure226 nipah virus has an incubation period of 4 days to 2 weeks227 much like hendra the first signs of disease are nondescript severe neurological symptoms subsequently develop including encephalitis and seizures that can progress to coma within 2448 h228 survivors of infection typically make a full recovery however 22 suffer permanent sequelae including persistent convulsions229 at this time there is no approved vaccine or antiviral and treatment is purely supportive animal models are being used to not only test novel vaccines and therapeutics but also deduce the early events of disease because observed human cases are all at terminal stages the best small animal representative is the syrian golden hamster due to their high susceptibility to both henipaviruses clinical signs upon infection recapitulate the disease course in humans including acute encephalitis and respiratory distress challenged animals died within 417 days postinfection the progression of disease and timeline are highly dependent on dose and route of infection intranasal inoculation leads to imbalance limb paralysis lethargy and breathing difficulties whereas intraperitoneal resulted in tremors and paralysis within 24 h before death virus was detected in lung brain spleen kidney heart spinal cords and urine while the brain was the most affected organ this model has been used for vaccination and passive protection studies230 231 232
 the guinea pig model has not been widely used due to the lack of a respiratory disease upon challenge233 234 inoculation with hendra virus via the subcutaneous route leads to a generalized vascular disease with 20 mortality clinical signs were apparent 716 days postinfection with death occurring within 2 days of cns involvement higher inocula have been associated with the development of encephalitis lesions intradermal and intranasal injections do not lead to disease although the animals are able to seroconvert upon challenge inoculum source does not affect clinical progression nipah virus challenge only develops disease upon intraperitoneal injection and results in weight loss and transient fever for 57 days virus was shed through urine and found to be present in the brain spleen lymph nodes ovary uterus and urinary bladder235
 ferrets display the same clinical disease as seen in the hamster model and human cases236 237 upon inoculation by the oronasal route ferrets develop severe pulmonary and neurological disease within 69 days including fever coughing and dyspnea lesions do develop in the ferrets brains but to a lesser degree than seen in humans cats have also been used as an animal model for henipaviruses disease symptoms are not dependent upon the route of infection the incubation period is 48 days and leads to respiratory and neurological symptoms238 239 this model has proven to be useful in a vaccine challenge model squirrel and agms are representative of the nhp models within the squirrel monkeys nipah virus is introduced by either the intranasal or iv route and subsequently leads to clinical signs similar to that in humans although intranasal challenge results in milder disease upon challenge only 50 animals develop disease manifestations including anorexia dyspnea and acute respiratory syndrome neurological involvement is characterized by uncoordinated motor skills loss of consciousness and coma viral rna can be detected in the lung brain liver kidney spleen and lymph nodes but is only found upon iv challenge240 agms have been found to be a very consistent model of both viruses intratracheal inoculation of the viruses results in 100 mortality and death within 85 and 912 days postinfection for hendra and nipah respectively the animals develop severe respiratory and neurological disease with generalized vasculitis241 242
 the reservoir of the viruses gray-headed fruit bats has been experimentally challenged due to their status as the host organism for henipaviruses the bats do not develop clinical disease however hendra virus can be detected in kidneys heart spleen and fetal tissue and nipah virus can be located in urine243
 pigs have been investigated as a model as they develop a respiratory disease upon infection with both nipah and hendra244 245 246 oral inoculation does not produce a clinical disease but subcutaneous injection represents a successful route of infection live virus can be isolated from the oropharynx as early as 4 days postinfection nipah can also be transmitted between pigs nipah was able to induce neurological symptoms in 20 of the pigs even though virus was present in all neurological tissues regardless of symptoms247 within the pig model it seemed that nipah had a greater tropism for the respiratory tract while hendra for the neurological system horses also are able to develop a severe respiratory tract infection accompanied with fever and general weakness upon exposure to nipah and hendra oronasal inoculation led to systemic disease with viral rna detected in nasal swabs within 2 days248 249 animals died within 4 days postexposure and were found to have interstitial pneumonia with necrosis of alveoli250 251 virus could be detected in all major systems mice rats rabbits chickens and dogs have been tested but found to be nonpermissive to infection232 252 suckling balbc mice succumb to infection if the virus is inoculated intracranially253 embryonated chicken eggs have been inoculated with nipah virus leading to a universally fatal disease within 45 days postinfection254
 respiratory syncytial virus is responsible for lower respiratory tract infections of 33 million children under the age of 5 years which in turn results in three million hospitalizations and approximately 200000 deaths255 within the united states hospital costs alone amount to 600 million dollars256 outbreaks are common in the winter257 the virus is transmitted by large respiratory droplets that replicate initially within the nasopharynx and further spreads to the lower respiratory tract incubation for the virus is 28 days respiratory syncytial virus is highly virulent leading to very few asymptomatic infections258 disease manifestations are highly dependent upon the age of the individual primary infections in neonates produce nonspecific symptoms including the overall failure to thrive apnea and feeding difficulties infants present with a mild upper respiratory tract disease that could develop into bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia contracting the virus at this age results in an increased chance of developing childhood asthma259 young children develop recurrent wheezing whereas adults exacerbate previous respiratory conditions260 common clinical symptoms are runny nose sneezing and coughing accompanied with fever mortality rates in hospitalized children are 13 with the greatest burden of disease seen in 34-month-olds261 there is no vaccine available and ribavirin usage is not recommended for routine treatment262 animal models were developed in the hopes of formulating an effective and safe vaccine unlike the formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus vaccine fi-rsv this vaccine-induced severe respiratory illness in infants who received the vaccine and were subsequently infected with live virus263
 mice can be used to model disease although a very high intranasal inoculation is needed to achieve clinical symptoms264 265 strain choice is crucial to reproducing a physiological relevant response266 age does not affect primary disease manifestations267 however it does play a role in later sequelae showing increased airway hyperreactivity268 primary infection produces increased breathing with airway obstruction264 269 virus was detected as early as day 3 and reached maximum titer at day 6 postinfection clinical illness is defined in the mouse by weight loss and ruffled fur as opposed to runny nose sneezing and coughing as seen in humans cotton rats are useful given that it is a small animal disease model the virus is able to replicate to high titers within the lungs and can be detected in both the upper and lower airways after intranasal inoculation270 271 it has been reported that viral replication is 50- to 1000-fold greater in the rat model than in the mouse model272 the rats develop mild-to-moderate bronchiolitis or pneumonia273 although age does not seem to factor in clinical outcome it has been reported that older rats tend to take longer to achieve viral clearance viral loads peak by the fifth day dropping to below the levels of detection by 8 the histopathology of the lungs seems to be similar to that in humans after infection274 this model has limited usage in modeling the human immune response to infection as challenge with the virus creates a th2 response whereas humans tend to skew toward th1275 276 277 fi-rsv disease was recapitulated upon challenge with live virus after being vaccinated twice with fi-rsv chinchillas have been challenged experimentally via intranasal inoculation the virus was permissive within the nasopharynx and eustachian tube the animals displayed an acute respiratory tract infection this model is thought to be useful in studying mucosal immunity during infection278
 chimpanzees are permissive to replication and clinical symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus including rhinorrhea sneezing and coughing adult squirrel monkeys newborn rhesus macaques and infant cebus monkeys were also challenged but did not exhibit any disease symptoms nor high levels of viral replication279 bonnet monkeys were also tested and found to develop an inflammatory response by day 7 with viral rna detected in both bronchial and alveolar cells280 the chimpanzee model has proven to be useful for vaccine studies281 282
 sheep have also been challenged experimentally since they develop respiratory disease when exposed to ovine respiratory syncytial virus283 lambs were also found to be susceptible to human respiratory syncytial infection284 285 when inoculated intratracheally the lambs developed an upper respiratory tract infection with cough after 6 days some lambs went on to develop lower respiratory disease including bronchiolitis the pneumonia resolved itself within 14 days during the course of disease viral replication peaked at 6 days and rapidly declined studying respiratory disease in sheep is beneficial given the shared structural features between them and humans286 287
 the influenza viruses consist of three types influenza a b and c based on antigenic differences influenza a is further classified by subtypes 16 ha and 9 na subtypes are known seasonal influenza is the most common infection and usually causes a self-limited febrile illness with upper respiratory symptoms and malaise that resolves within 10 days288 the rate of infection is estimated at 10 in the general population and can result in billions of dollars of loss annually from medical costs and reduced work-force productivity approximately 40000 people in the united states die each year from seasonal influenza289 thus vaccines and therapeutics play a critical role in controlling infection and development using animal models is ongoing290
 influenza virus replicates in the upper and lower airways peaking at approximately 48 h postexposure infection can be more severe in infants and in children under the age of 22 years people over the age of 65 years or immunocompromised individuals in whom viral pneumonitis or pneumonia can develop or bacterial superinfection resulting in pneumonia or sepsis291 pneumonia from secondary bacterial infection such as streptococcus pneumonia streptococcus pyrogenes and neisseria meningitides and more rarely
staphylococcus aureus is more common than viral pneumonia from the influenza itself accounting for approximately 27 of all influenza-associated fatalities292 death often due to ards can occur as early as 2 days after the onset of symptoms lung histopathology in severe cases may include dad alveolar edema and damage hemorrhage fibrosis and inflammation288 the h5n1 avian strain of influenza has lethality rates of approximately 60 of known cases likely because the virus preferentially binds to the cells of the lower respiratory tract and thus the potential for global spread is a major concern293
 the most frequently used animal models of influenza infection include mice ferrets and nhps a very thorough guide to working with mouse guinea pig ferret and cynomolgus models was published by kroeze et al294 lethality rate can vary with the virus strain used with or without adaptation dose route of inoculation age and genetic background of the animal the various animal models can capture differing diseases caused by influenza benign severe superinfection and sepsis severe with ards and neurologic manifestations290 also models can use seasonal or avian strains and models have been developed to study transmission important for understanding the potential for more lethal strains such as h5n1 for spreading among humans mouse models of influenza infection are very predictive for antiviral activity and tissue tropism in humans and are useful in testing and evaluating vaccines295 inoculation is by the intranasal route using approximately 60 l of inoculum in each nare of anesthetized mice exposure may also be to small particle aerosols containing influenza with an mmad of 5 m most inbred strains are susceptible with particularly frequent use of balbc followed by c57bl6j mice males and females have equivalent disease but influenza is generally more infectious in younger 2- to 4-week-old 810 g mice mice are of somewhat limited use in characterizing the immune response to influenza mice lack the mxa gene which is an important part of the human innate immune response to influenza infection the mouse homolog to mxa mx1 is defective in most inbred mouse strains296
 weight loss or reduced weight gain decreased activity huddling ruffled fur and increased respiration are the most common clinical signs for more virulent strains mice may require euthanasia as early as 48 h postexposure but most mortality occurs from 5 to 12 days postexposure accompanied by decreases in rectal temperature297 pulse oximeter readings and measurement of blood gases of oxygen saturation are also used to determine the impact of influenza infection on respiratory function298 virus can be isolated from bronchial lavage fluids throughout the infection and from tissues after euthanasia for influenza strains with mild-to-moderate pathogenicity disease is nonlethal and virus replication is detected within the lungs but usually not other organs increases in serum alpha-1-acidglycoprotein and lung weight are also frequently present however mice infected with influenza do not develop fever dyspnea nasal exudates sneezing or coughing mice can be experimentally infected with influenza a or b but the virus generally requires adaptation to produce clinical signs mice express the receptors for influenza attachment in the respiratory tract however the distribution varies and sa 23 predominates over sa 26 which is why h1 h2 and h3 subtypes usually need to be adapted to mice and h5n1 h2 h6 and h7 viruses do not require adaptation299 to adapt mice are infected intratracheally or intranasally by virus isolated from the lungs and reinfected into mice and then the process is repeated a number of times once adapted influenza strains can produce severe disease systemic spread and neurotropism however h5n1 and the 1918 pandemic influenza virus can cause lethal infection without adaptation300 h5n1 infection of mice results in viremia and viral replication in multiple organ systems severe lung pathology fulminant diffuse interstitial pneumonia pulmonary edema high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and marked lymphopenia301 as in humans the virulence of h5n1 is attributable to damage caused by an overactive host immune response additionally mice infected with the 1918 h1n1 influenza produces severe lung pathology and oxygen saturation levels that decrease with increasing pneumonia302
 in superinfection models a sublethal dose of influenza is given to mice followed 7 days later by intranasal inoculation of a sublethal dose of a bacterial strain such as s pneumoniae or s pyrogenes303 morbidity characterized by inflammation in the lungs but not bacteremia begins a couple of days after superinfection and may continue for up to 2 weeks at least one transmission model has also been developed in mice with h2n2 influenza transmission rates of up to 60 among cage mates can be achieved after infection by the aerosol route and cocaging after 24 h304
 domestic ferrets mustela putorius furo are frequently the animal species of choice for influenza animal studies because the susceptibility clinical signs peak virus shedding kinetics of transmission local expression of cytokine mrnas and pathology resemble that of humans305 306 307 ferrets also have airway morphology respiratory cell types and a distribution of influenza receptors sa 26 and sa 23 within the airways similar to that of humans308 influenza was first isolated from ferrets infected intranasally with throat washes from humans harboring the infection and ferret models have since been used to test efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic treatments309
 when performing influenza studies in ferrets animals should be serologically negative for circulating influenza viruses infected animals should be placed in a separate room from uninfected animals if animals must be placed in the same room uninfected ferrets should be handled before infected ferrets anesthetized ferrets are experimentally exposed to influenza by intranasal inoculation of 02505 ml containing approximately 104106 egg id50 dropwise to each nostril influenza types a and b naturally infect ferrets resulting in an acute illness which usually lasts 35 days for mildly to moderately virulent strains310 ferrets are more susceptible to influenza a than to influenza b strains and are also susceptible to avian influenza h5n1 strains without adaptation311 virulence and degree of pneumonitis caused by different influenza subtypes and strains vary from mild to severe and generally mirror that seen in humans nonadapted h1n1 h2n2 and h3n2 have mild-to-moderate virulence in ferrets strains of low virulence have predominant replication in the nasal turbinates clinical signs and other disease indicators are similar to that of humans with a mild respiratory disease sneezing nasal secretions containing virus fever weight loss high viral titers and inflammatory infiltrate in the airways bronchitis and pneumonia312 replication in both the upper and lower airways is associated with more severe disease and greater mortality additionally increased expression of proinflammatory mediators and reduced expression of antiinflammatory mediators in the lower respiratory tract ferrets correlates with severe disease and lethal outcome h5n1-infected ferrets develop severe lethargy greater ifn response transient lymphopenia and replication in respiratory tract brain and other organs313
 old and new world primates are susceptible to influenza infection and have an advantage over ferret and mouse models which are deficient for h5n1 vaccine studies because there is a lack of correlation with hemagglutination inhibition314 of old world primates cynomolgus macaque m fascicularis are most frequently used for studies of vaccines and antiviral drug therapies315 316
 h5n1 and h1n1 1918 infections of cynos are very similar to those in humans317 cynos develop fever and ards upon intranasal inoculation of h5n1 with necrotizing bronchial interstitial pneumonia318 nhps are challenged by multiple routes ocular nasal and tracheal simultaneously 1  106
 pfu per site virus antigen is primarily localized to the tonsils and pulmonary tissues infection of cynos with h5n1 results in fever lethargy nasal discharge anorexia weight loss nasal and tracheal washes pathologic and histopathologic changes and alveolar and bronchial inflammation the 1918 h1n1 caused a very high mortality rate due to an aberrant immune response and ards and had 50 lethality humans only had a 13 lethality ards and mortality also occur with the more pathogenic strains but nhps show reduced susceptibility to less virulent strains such as h3n2299 influenza-infected rhesus macaques represent a mild disease model pathogenesis for vaccine and therapeutic efficacy studies319 other nhp models include influenza infection of pigtailed macaques as a mild disease model and infection of new world primates such as squirrel and cebus monkeys320
 rats f344 and sd inoculated with rat-adapted h3n2 developed inflammatory infiltrates and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids but had no lethality and few histopathological changes321 additionally an influenza transmission model has been developed in guinea pigs as an alternative to ferrets322
 cotton rats sigmodon hispidus have been used to test vaccines and therapeutics in a limited number of studies323 324 cotton rats have an advantage over mice in that the immune system is similar to humans including the presence of the mx gene and influenza viruses do not have to be adapted325 326 nasal and pulmonary tissues of cotton rats were infected with unregulated cytokines and lung viral load peaking at 24 h postexposure virus was cleared from the lung by day 3 and from the nares by day 66 but animals had bronchial and alveolar damage and pneumonia for up to 3 weeks there is also a s aureus superinfection model in cotton rats327 coinfection resulted in bacteremia high bacterial load in lungs peribronchiolitis pneumonitis alveolitis hypothermia and higher mortality domestic pig influenza models have been developed for vaccine studies for swine flu pigs are susceptible in nature as natural or intermediate hosts but are not readily susceptible to h5n1328 329 although pigs infected with influenza may have fever anorexia and respiratory signs such as dyspnea and cough mortality is rare330 size and space requirements make this animal difficult to work with although the development of minipig ellegaard gottingen models may provide an easier-to-use alternative rift valley fever virus rvfv causes epizootics and human epidemics in africa rvfv mainly infects livestock such as sheep cattle and goats after 2- to 4-day incubation period animals exhibit signs of fever hepatitis and abortion which is a hallmark diagnostic sign known among farmers331
 mosquito vectors unpasteurized milk aerosols of infected animals body fluids or direct contact with infected animals are the important routes of transmission to humans332 333 after 26 days of incubation period rvfv causes a wide range of signs and symptoms in humans ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease with hepatitis vision loss encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever334 335 336 depending on the severity of the disease when the symptoms start 1020 of the hospitalized patients might die in 36 days or 1217 days after the disease onset334 hepatic failure renal failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation dic and encephalitis are demonstrated within patients during postmortem examination mice are one of the most susceptible animal species to rvfv infection subcutaneous or intraperitoneal routes of infection cause acute hepatitis and lethal encephalitis at a late stage of the disease in mice337 338 mice start to exhibit signs of decreased activity and ruffled fur by day 23 postexposure immediately after these signs are observed they become lethargic and generally die 36 days postexposure ocular diseases or hemorrhagic form of the disease has not been observed in mice models so far334 increased viremia and tissue tropism were reported in mice with338 increased liver enzymes and lymphopenia observed in sick mice rats and gerbils are also susceptible to rvfv infection rats susceptibility is dependent on the rat strain used for the challenge model there was also noted an age dependence in susceptibility of rats although wistar-furth and brown norway strains and young rats are highly susceptible to rvfv infection fisher 344 buffalo and lewis strains and old rats demonstrated resistance to infection339 340 similar pathologic changes such as liver damage and encephalopathy were observed in both rats and mice there was no liver involvement in the gerbil model and animals died from severe encephalitis the mortality rate was dependent on the strain used and the dose given to gerbils341 similar to the rat model the susceptibility of gerbils was also dependent on age so far studies showed that rvfv does not cause uniform lethality in an nhp model intraperitoneal intranasal iv and aerosol routes have been used to develop the nhp model rhesus macaques cynomolgus macaques african monkeys and south american monkeys were some of the nhp species used for this effort342 monkeys showed a variety of signs ranging from febrile disease to hemorrhagic disease and mortality temporal viremia increased coagulation parameters pt aptt and decreased platelets were some other signs observed in nhps animals that succumbed to disease showed very similar pathogenesis to those seen in humans such as pathological changes in liver and hemorrhagic disease there was no ocular involvement in this model recently smith et al compared iv intranasal and subcutaneous routes of infection in common marmosets and rhesus macaques343 marmosets were more susceptible to rvfv infection than were rhesus macaques with marked viremia acute hepatitis and late onset of encephalitis increased liver enzymes were observed in both species necropsy results showed enlarged livers in the marmosets exposed by iv or subcutaneous routes although there were no gross lesions in the brains of marmosets histopathology showed encephalitis in the brains of intranasally challenged marmosets crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv generally circulates in nature unnoticed in an enzootic tickvertebratetick cycle and similar to other zoonotic agents seems to produce little or no disease in its natural hosts but causes severe disease in humans cchfv transmits to humans by ixodid ticks direct contact with sick animalshumans or body fluids of animalshumans344 incubation prehemorrhagic hemorrhagic and convalescence are the four phases of the disease seen in humans the incubation period lasts 19 days during the prehemorrhagic phase patients show signs of nonspecific flu-like disease for approximately a week the hemorrhagic period results in circulatory shock and dic in some patients345 346
 over the years several attempts have been made to establish an animal model for cchf in adult mice guinea pigs hamsters rats rabbits sheep nhps etc347 348 349 350 until recently the only animal that manifests disease is the newborn mouse infant mice infected with cchfv intraperitoneally caused fatality around day 8 postinfection351 pathogenesis studies showed that virus replication was first detected in the liver with subsequent spread to the blood serum virus was detected very late during the disease course in other tissues including the heart day 6 and the brain day 7 the recent studies using knockout adult mice were successful to develop a lethal small animal model for cchfv infection352 353 bente et al infected stat1 knockout mice by the intraperitoneal route in this model after the signs of fever leucopenia thrombocytopenia viremia elevated liver enzymes and proinflammatory cytokines mice were moribund and succumbed to disease in 35 days of postexposure the second model was developed by using ifn-alphabeta ifn receptor knockout mice353 similar observations were made in this model as in the stat1 knockout mouse model the animals were moribund and died 24 days after exposure with high viremia levels in the liver and spleen other laboratory animals including nhps show little or no signs of infection or disease when infected with cchfv348 butenko et al used agms cercopithecus aethiops for experimental cchfv infections except one monkey with a fever on day 4 postinfection the animals did not exhibit signs of disease antibodies to the virus were detected in three out of five monkeys including the one with fever in 1975 fagbami et al infected two patas monkeys cercopithecus erythrocebuserythrocebus and one guinea baboon papio papio with cchfv347 although all three animals had low level viremia between days 1 and 5 after inoculation only the baboon serum had neutralizing antibody activity on day 137 postinfection similar results were obtained when horses and donkeys have been used for experimental cchfv infections donkeys develop a low-level viremia354 and horses developed little or no viremia but high levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies which remained stable for at least 3 months these studies suggest that horses may be useful in the laboratory to obtain serum for diagnostic and possible therapeutic purposes355
 shepherd et al infected 11 species of small african wild mammals and laboratory rabbits guinea pigs and syrian hamsters with cchfv349 although scrub hares lepus saxatilis cape ground squirrels xerus inauris red veld rats aethomys chrysophilus white-tailed rats mystromys pumilio and guinea pigs had viremia south african hedgehogs atelerix frontalis highveld gerbils tatera brantsii namaqua gerbils desmodillus auricularis two species of multimammate mouse mastomys natalensis and m coucha and syrian hamsters were negative all species regardless of viremia levels developed antibody responses against cchfv iv and intracranially infected animals showed the onset of viremia earlier than those infected by the subcutaneous or intraperitoneal routes the genus hantavirus is unique among the family bunyaviridae in that it is not transmitted by an arthropod vector but rather by rodents356 rodents of the family muridae are the primary reservoir for hantaviruses infected host animals develop a persistent infection that is typically asymptomatic transmission is achieved by the inhalation of infected rodent saliva feces and urine357 human infections can normally be traced to a rural setting with activities such as farming land development hunting and camping as possible sites of transmission rodent control is the primary route of prevention358
 the viruses have a tropism for endothelial cells within the microvasculature of the lungs359 there are two distinct clinical diseases that infection can yield hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs due to infection with old world hantaviruses or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps caused by new world hantaviruses360 hfrs is mainly seen outside of the americas and is associated with the hantaviruses dobravabelgrade also known as dobrava hantaan puumala and seoul358 incubation lasts two to three weeks and presents as flu-like in the initial stages that can further develop into hemorrhagic manifestations and ultimately renal failure thrombocytopenia subsequently develops which can further progress to shock in approximately 15 patients the overall mortality rate is 7 infection with dobrava and hantaan viruses are typically linked to the development of severe disease hps was first diagnosed in 1993 within the southwestern united states when healthy young adults became suddenly ill progressing to severe respiratory distress and shock the etiological agent responsible for this outbreak was identified as sin nombre virus361 this virus is still the leading cause within na of hps hps due to other hantaviruses has been reported in argentina bolivia brazil canada chile french guiana panama paraguay and uruguay362 363 the first report of hps in maine was recently documented361 andes virus was first identified in outbreaks in chile and argentina this hantavirus is distinct in that it can be transmitted between humans364 the fulminant disease is more lethal than that observed for hfrs with a mortality rate of 40 there are four phases of disease including prodromal pulmonary cardiac depression and hematologic manifestation365 incubation typically occurs 1417 days after exposure366 unlike hfrs renal failure is not a major contributing factor to the disease there is a short prodromal phase that gives way to cardiopulmonary involvement accompanied by cough and gastrointestinal symptoms it is at this point that individuals are typically admitted to the hospital pulmonary function is hindered and continues to suffer within 48 h after cardiopulmonary involvement interstitial edema and air-space disease normally follow in fatal cases cardiogenic shock has been noted367 vaccine development has been hampered by the vast diversity of hantaviruses and the limited number of outbreaks368
 syrian golden hamsters are the most widely used small animal models for hantavirus infection hamsters inoculated intramuscularly with a passaged andes viral strain died within 11 days postinfection clinical signs did not appear until 24 h before death at which point the hamsters were moribund and in respiratory distress mortality was dose dependent with high inoculums leading to a shorter incubation before death during the same study hamsters were inoculated with a passaged sin nombre isolate no hamsters developed any symptoms during the course of observation although an antibody response to the virus that was not dose dependent was determined via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay hamsters infected with andes virus were found to have significant histopathological changes to their lung liver and spleen all had an interstitial pneumonia with intraalveolar edema infectious virus could be recovered from these organs viremia began on day 8 and lasted up to 12 days postinfection infection of hamsters with andes virus yielded a similar clinical disease progression as is seen in human hps including rapid progression to death fluid in the pleural cavity and significant histopathological changes to the lungs and spleen a major deviation in the hamster model is the detection of infectious virus within the liver369
 lethal disease can be induced in newborn mice but does not recapitulate the clinical symptoms observed in human disease370 adult mice exposed to hantaan virus leads to a fatal disease dependent upon viral strain and route of infection the disease progression is marked by neurological or pulmonary manifestations that do not mirror human disease371 372 knockout mice lacing ifn- were found to be highly susceptible to hantaan virus infection373 in a study looking at a panel of laboratory strains of mice c57bl6 mice were found to be most susceptible to a passaged hantaan viral strain injected intraperitoneally animals progressed to neurological manifestation including paralyses and convulsions and succumbed to infection within 2436 h postinfection clinical disease was markedly different than that observed in human cases372
 nhps have been challenged with new world hantaviruses however no clinical signs were reported374 375 cynomolgus monkeys challenged with a clinical isolate of puumala virus developed a mild disease376 377 challenge with andes virus to cynomolgus macaques by both iv and aerosol exposure led to no signs of disease all animals did display a drop in total lymphocytes within 5 days postinfection aerosol exposure led to 4 of 6 monkeys and 8 of 11 iv injected monkeys developed viremia infectious virus could not be isolated from any of the animals the family arenaviridae is composed of two serogroups old world arenaviruses including lassa fever virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and the new world viruses of pichinde virus and junin virus all these viruses share common clinical manifestations378 lassa fever virus is endemic in parts of west africa and outbreaks are typically seen in the dry season between january and april379 this virus is responsible for 100000500000 infections per year leading to approximately 5000 deaths380 outbreaks have been reported in guinea sierra leone liberia nigeria and central african republic however cases sprung up in germany the netherlands the united kingdom and the united states due to transmission to travelers on commercial airlines381
 transmission of this virus typically occurs via rodents in particular the multimammate rat mastomys species complex379 humans become infected by inhaling the aerosolized virus or eating contaminated food there has also been noted human-to-human transmission by direct contact with infected secretions or needle-stick injuries the majority of infections are asymptomatic however severe disease can occur in 20 of individuals the incubation period is from 5 to 21 days and the initial onset is characterized by flu-like illness this is followed by diarrheal disease that can progress to hemorrhagic symptoms including encephalopathy encephalitis and meningitis a third of patients develop deafness in the early phase of disease which is permanent for a third of those affected the overall fatality is about 1 however of those admitted to the hospital it is between 15 and 25 there is no approved vaccine and besides supportive measures ribavirin is effective only if started within 7 days382 383
 the primary animal model used to study lassa fever is the rhesus macaque384 aerosolized infection of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has been a useful model for lassa fever both rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys exposed to the virus developed disease but rhesus more closely mirrored the disease course and histopathology observed in human infection385 iv or intragastric inoculation of the virus led to severe dehydration erythematous skin submucosal edema necrotic foci in the buccal cavity and respiratory distress the liver was severely affected by the virus as depicted by measuring the liver enzymes ast and alt386 disease was dose-dependent with iv intramuscular and subcutaneous inoculation requiring the least amount of virus to induce disease aerosol infections and eating contaminated food could also be used and mimic a more natural route of infection387 within this model the nhp becomes viremic after 46 days clinical manifestations were present by day 7 and death typically occurred within 1014 days388 389 intramuscular injection of lassa virus into cynomolgus monkeys also produced a neurological disease due to lesions within the cns390 this pathogenicity is seen in select cases of human lassa fever391 392
 a marmoset model has recently been defined using a subcutaneous injection of lassa fever virus virus was initially detected by day 8 and viremia achieved by day 14 liver enzymes were elevated and an enlarged liver was noted upon autopsy there was a gradual reduction in platelets and interstitial pneumonitis diagnosed in a minority of animals the physiological signs were the same as seen in fatal human cases393
 mice develop a fatal neurological disorder upon intracerebral inoculation with lassa although the outcome of infection is completely dependent upon the major histocompatibility complex mhc background and age of animal along with the route of inoculation394 guinea pig inbred strain 13 was found to be highly susceptible to lassa virus infection the outbreed hartley strain was less susceptible and thus strain 13 has been the preferred model given its assured lethality the clinical manifestations mirror those seen in humans and rhesus395 infection with pichinde virus that has been passaged in guinea pigs has also been used disease signs include fever weight loss vascular collapse and eventual death396 397 the guinea pig is an excellent model given that it not only results in similar disease pattern as humans but also the viral distribution is similar along with the histopathology and immune response398 399
 infection of hamsters with a cotton rat isolate of pirital virus is similar to what is characterized in humans and the nhp and guinea pig model the virus was injected intraperitoneally resulting in the animals becoming lethargic and anorexic within 67 days virus was first detected at 3 days and reached maximum titers within 5 days neurological symptoms began to appear at the same time and all the animals died by day 9 pneumonitis pulmonary hemorrhage and edema were also present400 these results were recapitulated with a nonadapted pichinde virus401 402 403
 globally diarrheal disease is the leading cause of death with rotavirus being one of the main etiological agents responsible according to the world health organization rotavirus alone is responsible for a third of all hospitalization related to diarrhea and 500000600000 deaths per year404 the virus is very stable due to its three-layer capsid which allows it to be transmitted via the oralfecal route depositing itself in the small intestine rotavirus is highly contagious and only 10 viruses are needed to cause symptomatic disease405
 the host determinant with the greatest influence on clinical outcome is age neonates typically are asymptomatic which is suggested to be due to the existence of maternal antibodies hence the most susceptible age group is 3 months to 2 years coinciding with a drop in these protective antibodies406 within this age range children will develop noninflammatory diarrhea virus replicates in the intestinal villus enterocytes resulting in their destruction and malabsorption of needed electrolytes and nutrients symptoms of disease include watery nonbloody diarrhea with vomiting fever and potentially dehydration that lasts up to a week407 there is a short episode of viremia during the course of infection408
 mice can be used as both an infection and disease model depending upon age at challenge mice 14 days old develop disease whereas older mice are able to clear the infection before the onset of symptoms409 this halts the study of active vaccination against disease in the infection model in the adult mouse model the course of the infection is monitored via viral shedding within the stool410 infant mice specifically balbc receiving an oral inoculation of a clinical strain of virus developed diarrhea within 24 h postinfection and 95 of those exposed developed symptoms within 72 h postinfection symptoms lasted from 2 to 4 days with no mortality viral shedding was at its peak at 24 h and lasted up to 5 days there were noted histopathological changes within the small intestine localized to the villi that was reversible407 within the adult mouse model oral inoculation of a mouse rotavirus strain showed viral shedding by 3 days lasting up until 6 days postinfection410 these mouse models have been used to study correlates of protection and therapeutic efficacy including gastro-gard409 411 412
 rats can also be used as disease models depending upon the strain of rat413 414 suckling fischer 344 rats were exposed to a simian strain of rotavirus orally the rats were susceptible to diarrheal disease till they were 8 days old with age determining the length of viral shedding415 rats have mainly been used to study the correct formulation for oral rehydration these rodents are large enough to perform in situ intestinal perfusions within these studies 8-day-old rats were infected with a rat strain of rotavirus by orogastric intubation within 24 h postinfection the rats developed diarrhea at which point the small intestine was perfused to compare differing solutions of oral rehydration416
 gnotobiotic pigs are also used given that they can be infected with both porcine and human strains417 they are susceptible to developing clinical disease from human strains up to 6 weeks of age they allow for the analysis of the primary immune response to the virus given that they do not receive transplacental maternal antibodies and are immune competent at birth418 another advantage of this model is that the gastrointestinal physiology and mucosal immune system closely resemble that of humans419 this model has been useful in studying correlates of protection
 gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived calves have also been used as an experimental model of rotavirus infection they are able to develop diarrhea and shed live virus420 gnotobiotic lambs can also develop clinical disease upon oral inoculation with clinical strains421 infant baboons agms and rhesus macaques have all proven to be infection models with severity measure by viral shedding422 423
 the lentiviruses are a subfamily of retroviridae which includes human immunodeficiency virus hiv a virus that infects 06 of the worlds population a greater proportion of infections and deaths occur in sub-saharan africa worldwide there are approximately 18 million deaths per year with 260000 being children transmission of hiv occurs by exposure to infectious body fluids there are two species hiv-1 and hiv-2 with hiv-2 having lower infectivity and virulence confined mostly to west africa the vast majority of cases worldwide are hiv-1424
 hiv targets t-helper cells cd4 macrophages and dendritic cells425 acute infection occurs 24 weeks after exposure with flu-like symptoms and viremia followed by chronic infection symptoms in the acute phase may include fever body aches nausea vomiting headache lymphadenopathy pharyngitis rash and sores in the mouth or esophagus cd8 t-cells are activated which kill hiv-infected cells and are responsible for antibody production and seroconversion acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids develops when cd4 t-cells decline to 200 cells per microliter thus cell-mediated immunity becomes impaired and the person is more susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain cancers humanized mice created by engrafting human cells and tissues into scid mice have been critical for the development of mouse models for the study of hiv infection a number of different humanized mouse models allow for the study of hiv infection in the context of intact and functional human innate and adaptive immune responses426 the scidhu hiv infection model has proven to be useful particularly in screening antivirals and therapeutics427 a number of different humanized mouse models have been developed for the study of hiv including rag1c rag2c nodscidc hnog nodscidc hnsg nodscid blt and nodscidc hnsg blt cd34 human stem cells derived from the umbilical cord blood or fetal liver are used for humanization428 hiv-1 infection by intraperitoneal injection can be successful with as little as 5 peripheral blood engraftment429 vaginal and rectal transmission models have been developed in blt scidhu mice in which mice harbor human bone marrow liver and thymus tissue hiv-1 viremia occurs within approximately 7 days pi430 in many of these models spleen lymph nodes and thymus tissues are highly positive for virus similar to humans431 importantly depletion of human t-cells can be observed in blood and lymphoid tissues of hiv-infected humanized mice and at least some mechanisms of pathogenesis that occur in hiv-infected humans also occur in the hiv-infected humanized mouse models432 the advantage of these models is that these mice are susceptible to hiv infection and thus the impact of drugs on the intended viral targets can be tested one caveat is that although mice have a common mucosal immune system humans do not due to the differences in the distribution of addressins433 thus murine mucosal immune responses to hiv do not reflect those of humans there are a number of important nhp models for human hiv infection simian immunodeficiency virus siv infection of macaques is widely considered to be the best platform for modeling hiv infection of humans importantly nhps have similar pharmacokinetics metabolism mucosal t-cell homing receptors and vascular addressins to those of humans thus although the correlates of protection against hiv are still not completely known immune responses to hiv infection and vaccination are likely comparable these models mimic infection through the use of contaminated needles iv sexual transmission vaginal or rectal and maternal transmission in utero or through breast milk434 435 436 there are also macaque models to study the emergence and clinical implications of hiv drug resistance437
 these models most routinely use rhesus macaques macaca mulatta cynomolgus macaques macaca fasicularis and pigtailed macaque macaca nemestrina animals of all ages are used depending on the needs of the study for instance the use of newborn macaques may be more practical for evaluating the effect of prolonged drug therapy on disease progression however adult nhps are more frequently used studies are performed in bsl-2 animal laboratories and nhps must be of simian type-d retrovirus free and siv seronegative siv infection of pigtailed macaques is a useful model for hiv peripheral nervous system pathology wherein an axotomy is performed and regeneration of axons is studied438
 challenges may be through a single high dose iv infection of rhesus macaques with 100 tcid50 of the highly pathogenic sivdeltab670 induces aids in most macaques within 517 months mean of 11 months439 peak viremia occurs around week 4 aids in such models is often defined as cd4 t-cells that have dropped to 50 of the baseline values alternatively repeated low-dose challenges are often used depending on the requirements of the model440 441
 because nhps infected with hiv do not develop an infection with a clinical disease course similar to that in humans siv or sivhiv-1 laboratory-engineered chimeric viruses simianhuman immunodeficiency virus or shiv are used as surrogates nhps infected with pathogenic siv may develop clinical disease which progresses to aids and are thus useful pathogenesis models a disadvantage is that siv is not identical to hiv-1 and is more closely related to hiv-2 however the polymerase region of siv is 60 homologous to that of hiv-1 and it is susceptible to many reverse transcriptase rt and protease inhibitors siv is generally not susceptible to nonnucleoside inhibitors thus hiv-1 rt is usually put into siv for such studies442
 sivmac239 is similar to hiv in the polymerase region and is therefore susceptible to nucleoside rt or integrase inhibition443 nhps infected with sivmac239 have an asymptomatic period and disease progression resembling aids in humans characterized by weight losswasting cd4 t-cell depletion additionally sivmac239 uses the cxcr5 chemokine receptor as a coreceptor similar to hiv which is important for drugs that target entry444
 nhps infected with shiv strains may not develop aids but these models are useful in testing vaccine efficacy for example rt-shivs and env-shivs are useful for the testing and evaluation of drugs that may target the envelope or rt respectively442 one disadvantage of the highly virulent env-shiv shiv-896 p is that it uses the cxcr4 coreceptor of note env-shivs that do use the cxcr5 coreceptor are less virulent viremia develops and then resolves without further disease progression445
 simian-tropic st hiv-1 contains the vif gene from siv infection of pigtailed macaques with this virus results in viremia which can be detected for three months followed by clearance446
 a number of routes are used for siv or shiv infection of nhps with iv inoculation being the most common route mucosal routes include vaginal rectal and intracolonic mucosal routes require a higher one-time dose than does the iv route for infection for the vaginal route female macaques are treated with depo-provera estrogen one month before infection to synchronize the menstrual cycle thin the epithelial lining of the vagina and increase the susceptibility to infection by atraumatic vaginal instillation447 upon vaginal instillation of 500 tcid50 of shiv-162p3 peak viremia was seen around 12 days postexposure with 107 copies per milliliter and dropping thereafter to a constant level of 104 rna copies per milliliter at 60 days and beyond in another example in an investigation of the effect of vaccine plus vaginal microbicide on preventing infection rhesus macaques were vaginally infected with a high dose of sivmac251448 an example of an intrarectal model used juvenile 2-year-old pigtailed macaques challenged intrarectally with 104 tcid50s of sivmne027 to study the pathogenesis related to the virulence factor vpx449 here viremia peaked at approximately 10 days with 108 copies per milliliter viral rna was expressed in the cells of the mesenteric lymph nodes the male genital tract is seen as a viral sanctuary with persistently high levels of hiv shedding even with antiretroviral therapy to better understand the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on virus and t-cells in the male genital tract adult 3- to 4-year old male cynomolgus macaques were intravenously inoculated with 50 aid50s of sivmac251 and the male genital tract tissues were tested after euthanasia by pcr ihc and in situ hybridization450
 pediatric models have been developed in infant rhesus macaques through the infection of siv allowing for the study of the impact of developmental and immunological differences on the disease course451 importantly mother-to-infant transmission models have also been developed452 pregnant female pigtailed macaques were infected during the second trimester with 100 mid50 shiv-sf162p3 by the iv route four of nine infants were infected one in utero and three either intrapartum or immediately postpartum through nursing this model is useful for the study of factors involved in transmission and the underlying immunology nhps infected with siv or shiv are routinely evaluated for weight loss activity level stool consistency appetite virus levels in blood and t-cell populations cytokine and chemokine levels antibody responses and cytotoxic t- lymphocyte responses may also be evaluated the ultimate goal of an hiv vaccine is sterilizing immunity preventing infection however a more realistic result may be to reduce severity of infection and permanently prevent progression strategies have included live attenuated nonreplicating and subunit vaccines these have variable efficacy in nhps due to the genetics of the host mhc and terminal-repeat retrotransposon in miniature trim alleles differences between challenge strains and challenge routes453 nhp models have led to the development of antiviral treatments that are effective at reducing viral load and indeed transmission of hiv among humans one preferred variation on the models for testing the long-term clinical consequences of antiviral treatment is to use newborn macaques and treat from birth onward in some cases more than a decade454 unfortunately however successes in nhp studies do not always translate to success in humans as seen with the recent step study that used an adenovirus-based vaccine approach455 vaccinated humans were not protected and may have even been more susceptible to hiv viremia was not reduced and the infections were not attenuated as hoped with regard to challenge route iv is more difficult to protect than mucosal and is used as a worst-case scenario however efficacy at one mucosal route is usually comparable to that at other mucosal routes human and animal papillomaviruses cause benign epithelial proliferations warts and malignant tumors of the various tissues that they infect456 there are 100 human papillomaviruses hpvs with different strains causing warts on the skin oropharynx nasopharynx larynx and anogenital tissues approximately a third of these are transmitted sexually of these virulent subtypes such as hpv-16 hpv-18 hpv-31 hpv-33 and hpv-45 place individuals at high risk for cervical and other cancers major challenges in the study of these viruses are that papillomaviruses generally do not infect any other species outside of the natural hosts and can cause a very large spectrum of severity thus no animal models have been identified that are susceptible to hpv however a number of useful surrogate models exist that use animal papillomaviruses in their natural host or a very closely related species457 458 these models have facilitated the recent development of useful and highly effective prophylactic hpv vaccines459
 wild cottontail rabbits sylvilagus floridanus are the natural host for cottontail rabbit papillomavirus crpv but this virus also infects domestic rabbits oryctolagus cuniculus which are a very closely related species460 in this model papillomas can range from cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas on the one end of the spectrum and spontaneous regression on the other lesions resulting from crpv in domestic rabbits do not typically contain infectious virus canine oral papillomavirus copv cause florid warty lesions in the mucosa of the oral cavity within 48 weeks postexposure in experimental settings461 the mucosatrophic nature of these viruses and the resulting oropharyngeal papillomas that are morphologically similar to human vaginal papillomas caused by hpv-6 and hpv-11 make this a useful model462 these lesions typically spontaneously regress 48 weeks after appearing this model is therefore useful in understanding the interplay between the host immune defense and viral pathogenesis male and female beagles aged 10 weeks to 2 years with no history of copv are typically used for these studies infection is achieved by the application of a 10 l droplet of virus extract to multiple 05 cm2 scarified areas within the mucosa of the upper lip of anesthetized beagles463
 bovine papillomavirus bpv has a wider host range than do most papillomaviruses infecting the fibroblasts cells of numerous ungulates458 bpv-4 infection of cattle feeding on bracken fern which is carcinogenic can result in lesions of the oral and esophageal mucosa that lack detectable viral dna bpv infections in cattle can result in a range of diseases such as skin warts cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract and urinary bladder and papillomatosis of the penis teats and udder finally sexually transmitted papillomaviruses in rhesus macaques and cynomolgus macaques rhesus papillomavirus is very similar to hpv-16 and is associated with the development of cervical cancer464
 mice cannot be used to study disease caused by papillomaviruses unless they are engrafted with relevant tissue but they are often used to look at immunogenicity of vaccines465 466
 
herpesviridae please see chapter 25 monkeypox virus mpxv causes disease in both animals and humans human monkeypox which is clinically almost identical to ordinary smallpox occurs mostly in the rainforest of central and western africa the virus is maintained in nature in rodent reservoirs including squirrels467 468 mpxv was discovered during the pox-like disease outbreak among laboratory java macaques in denmark in 1958 no human cases were observed during this outbreak the first human case was not recognized as a distinct disease until 1970 in zaire the present drc with the continued occurrence of a smallpox-like illness despite eradication efforts of smallpox in this area during the global eradication campaign extensive vaccination in central africa decreased the incidence of human monkeypox but the absence of immunity in the generation born since that time and increased dependence on bush meat have resulted in renewed emergence of the disease in the summer of 2003 a well-known outbreak in the midwest was the first occurrence of monkeypox disease in the united states and the western hemisphere among 72 reported cases 37 human cases were laboratory confirmed during an outbreak469 470 it was determined that native prairie dogs cynomys sp housed with rodents imported from ghana in west africa were the primary source of outbreak
 the virus is mainly transmitted to humans while handling infected animals or by direct contact with the infected animals body fluids or lesions person-to-person spread occurs by large respiratory droplets or direct contact471 most of the clinical features of human monkeypox are very similar to those of ordinary smallpox472 after a 7- to 21-day incubation period the disease begins with fever malaise headache sore throat and cough the main sign of the disease that distinguishes monkeypox from smallpox is swollen lymph nodes lymphadenitis which is observed in most of the patients before the development of rash471 473 typical maculopapular rash follows the prodromal period generally lasting 13 days the average size of the skin lesions is 051 cm and the progress of lesions follows the order macules through papules vesicles pustules umblication then scab and desquamation and lasts typically 24 weeks fatality rate is 10 among the unvaccinated population and death generally occurs during the second week of the disease469 471
 mpxv is highly pathogenic for a variety of laboratory animals and so far many animal models have been developed by using different species and different routes of exposure table 383
 because of the unavailability of variola virus to develop animal models and resulting disease manifestations in humans that are similar mpxv is one of the pox viruses that are used very heavily to develop a number of small animal models via different routes of exposure wild-derived inbred mouse stat1-deficient c57bl6 mouse prairie dogs african dormice ground squirrels are highly susceptible to mpxv by different exposure routes474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481
 casteij mice one of the 38 inbred mouse strains tested for susceptibility to mpxv showed weight loss and dose-dependent mortality after intranasal exposure to mpxv studies with the intraperitoneal route of challenge indicated a higher susceptibility to mpxv with an almost 50-fold less ld50 when compared to the intranasal route474 scid-balbc mice were also susceptible to the intraperitoneal challenge route and the disease resulted in mortality day 9 postinfection476 similarly c57bl6 stat1 mice were infected intranasally with mpxv and the infection resulted in weight loss and mortality 10 days postexposure mice models mentioned here are very promising for screening of therapeutics against pox viruses but testing in additional models will be required for advanced development high doses of mpxv by intraperitoneal or intranasal route caused 100 mortality in 6 days postexposure and 8 days postexposure respectively in ground squirrels480 the disease progressed very quickly and most of the animals were lethargic and moribund by day 5 postexposure without any pox lesions or respiratory changes a comparison study of usa mpxv and central african strain of mpxv in ground squirrels by subcutaneous route resulted in systemic disease and the mortality in 611 days postexposure the disease resembles hemorrhagic smallpox with nose bleeds impaired coagulation parameters and hemorrhage in the lungs of the animals because in the us outbreak the virus was transmitted by infected prairie dogs this animal model has recently been studied much further and used to test therapeutics and vaccines compared to other small animal models475 481 491 492 studies using intranasal intraperitoneal and intradermal routes of exposure showed that mpxv was highly infectious to prairie dogs by using the west african mpxv strain the intraperitoneal route caused a more severe disease and 100 mortality than challenge by the intranasal route anorexia and lethargy were common signs of the disease for both exposure routes in contrast to the intraperitoneal route the intranasal route of exposure caused severe pulmonary edema and necrosis of lungs in prairie dogs while splenic necrosis and hepatic lesions were observed in intraperitoneally infected animals481 recent studies by hutson et al used intranasal and intradermal infections with west african and congo basin strains and showed that both strains and routes caused smallpox-like disease with longer incubation periods and generalized pox lesions475 therefore this model can be used for testing therapeutics and vaccines against pox viruses the african dormouse is susceptible to mpxv by the foodpad injection route or intranasal route478 mice exhibited decreased activity hunched posture dehydration conjunctivitis and weight loss viral doses of 200 and 2000 pfu provided 100 mortality with a mean time to death of 8 days upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage hepatomegaly lymphadenopathy and hemorrhage in lungs were observed during necropsy with the hemorrhage in several organs this model resembles hemorrhagic smallpox considering the limited availability of ground squirrels and african dormice lack of reagents to these species and resemblance to hemorrhagic smallpox disease these models are not very attractive for further characterization and vaccine and countermeasure testing studies nhps were exposed to mpxv by several different routes to develop animal models for mpxv482 483 485 489 490 during our studies by using an aerosol route of exposure we observed that macaques had mild anorexia depression fever and lymphadenopathy on day 6 postexposure482 complete blood count and clinical chemistries showed abnormalities similar to those of human monkeypox cases with leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia493 whole-blood and throat swabs had viral loads peak around day 10 and in survivors gradually decrease until day 28 postexposure because doses of 4  104 1  105 or 1  106
 pfu resulted in lethality for 70 of the animals whereas a dose of 4  105 pfu resulted in 85 lethality survival was not dose dependent the main pitfall of this model was the lack of pox lesions with the high dose before animals can develop pox lesions they succumbed to disease with the low challenge dose pox lesions were observed but they were few in comparison to the iv model mpxv causes dose-dependent disease in nhps when given by the iv route490 studies showed that with 1 107
 pfu iv challenge results in systemic disease with fever lymphadenopathy macula-papular rash and mortality an intratracheal infection model deposits virus into the trachea delivering directly to the airways without regard to particle size and the physiological deposition that occurs during the process of inhalation by skipping the upper respiratory system fibrinonecrotic bronchopneumonia was described in animals that received 107
 pfu of mpxv intratracheally489 although a similar challenge dose of intratracheal mpxv infection resulted in a similar viremia in nhps than with the aerosol route of infection the timing of the first peak was delayed by 5 days in intratracheally exposed macaques compared to aerosol infection and the amount of virus detected by qpcr was approximately 100-fold lower this suggests that local replication is more prominent after aerosol delivery compared to that after intratracheal delivery an intrabronchial route of exposure resulted in pneumonia in nhps490 delayed onset of clinical signs and viremia were observed during the disease progression in this model similar to aerosol and the intratracheal route of infection models the number of pox lesions was much less than in the iv route of the infection model
 a major downside of the iv intratracheal and intrabronchial models is that the initial infection of respiratory tissue incubation and prodromal phases are circumvented with the direct inoculation of virus into the blood stream or into the lung this is an important limitation when the utility of these models is to test possible vaccines and treatments in which the efficacy may depend on protecting the respiratory mucosa and targeting subsequent early stages of the infection which are not represented in these challenge models although the aerosol model is the natural route of transmission for human variola virus varv infections and a secondary route for human mpxv infections the lack of pox lesions is the main drawback of this model therefore when this model is decided to be used to test medical countermeasures the endpoints and the biomarkers to initiate treatment should be chosen carefully hepatitis b is one of the most common infections worldwide with 400 million people chronically infected and 316000 cases per year of liver cancer due to infection494 the virus can naturally infect both humans and chimpanzees495 hepatitis b is transmitted parenterally or postnatally from infected mothers it can also be transmitted by sexual contact iv drug use blood transfusion and acupuncture496 the age at which one is infected dictates the risk of developing chronic disease497
 acute infection during adulthood is self-limiting and results in flu-like symptoms that can progress to hepatocellular involvement as observed with the development of jaundice the clinical symptoms last for a few weeks before resolving498 after this acute phase life time immunity is achieved499 of those infected 5 will develop the chronic form of disease chronicity is the most serious outcome of disease as it can result in cirrhosis or liver cancer hepatocellular carcinoma is 100 times more likely to develop in a chronically infected individual than in a noncarrier500 the viral determinant for cellular transformation has yet to be determined although studies involving the woodchuck hepadna virus suggest that x protein may be responsible501 many individuals are asymptomatic until complications emerge related to chronic carriage chimpanzees have a unique strain that circulates within the population502 503 it was found that 36 of all wild-caught animals from africa are positive for hepatitis b antigen504 natural and experimental challenge with the virus follows the same course as human disease however this is only an acute model of disease505 to date the use of chimpanzees provides the only reliable method to ensure that plasma vaccines are free from infectious particles506 this animal model has been used to study new therapeutics and vaccines chimpanzees are especially attuned to these studies given that their immune response to infection directly mirrors humans507 other nhps that have been evaluated are gibbons orangutans and rhesus monkeys although these animals can be infected with hepatitis b none develop hepatic lesions or liver damage as noted by monitoring of liver enzymes508
 mice are not permissible to infection and thus numerous transgenic and humanized lines that express hepatitis b proteins have been created to facilitate their usage as an animal model these include both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts the caveat to all of these mouse lines is that they reproduce only the acute form of disease495 recently the entire genome of hepatitis b was transferred to an immunocompetent mouse line via adenovirus this provides a model for persistent infection509
 hepatitis b can also be studied using surrogate viruses naturally occurring mammalian hepadna viruses510 the woodchuck hepatitis virus was found to induce hepatocellular carcinoma511 within a population 6575 of all neonatal woodchucks are susceptible to chronic infection512 a major difference between the two hepatitis isolates is the rate at which they induce cancer almost all chronic carriers developed hepatocellular carcinoma within 3 years of the initial infection in woodchucks whereas human infection takes much longer513 the acute infection strongly resembles what occurs during the course of disease in humans there is a self-limiting acute phase resulting in a transient viremia that has the potential of chronic carriage514 challenge with virus in neonates leads to a chronic infection while adults only develop the acute phase of disease515 a closely related species to the woodchuck is the marmota himalayan this animal is also susceptible to the woodchuck hepadna virus upon iv injection it was found to develop an acute hepatitis with a productive infection516
 hepatitis d is dependent upon hepatitis b to undergo replication and successful infection in its human host517 there are two modes of infection possible between the viruses coinfection in which a person is simultaneously infected or superinfection in which a chronic carrier of hepatitis b is subsequently infected with hepatitis d518 coinfection leads to a similar disease as seen with hepatitis b alone however superinfection can result in chronic hepatitis d infection and severe liver damage519 both coinfection and superinfection can be demonstrated within the chimpanzee and woodchuck by inoculation of human hepatitis d520 a recently published report demonstrated the use of a humanized chimeric mouse to study the interactions between the two viruses and drug testing521
 the ideal animal model for human viral disease should closely recapitulate the spectrum of clinical symptoms and pathogenesis observed during the course of human infection whenever feasible the model should use the same virus and strain that infects humans it is also preferable that the virus be a low passage clinical isolate thus animal passage or adaptation should be avoided if model species can be identified that are susceptible ideally the experimental route of infection would mirror that which occurs in natural disease to understand the interplay and contribution of the immune system during infection an immunocompetent animal should be used the above characteristics cannot always be satisfied however and often virus must be adapted knockout mice must be used andor the disease is not perfectly mimicked in the animal model well-characterized animal models are critical for licensure to satisfy the food and fdas animal rule this rule applies to situations in which vaccines and therapeutics cannot safely or ethically be tested in humans thus licensure will come only after preclinical tests are performed in animal models many fields in virology are moving toward standardized models that can be used across institutions to test vaccines and therapeutics a current example of such an effort is within the filovirus community where animal models euthanasia criteria assays and virus strains are in the process of being standardized the hope is that these efforts will enable results of efficacy tests on medical countermeasures to be compared across institutions this chapter has summarized the best models available for each of the viruses described
  covid-19 created chaos across the globe three novel quarantine epidemic models bimal mishra kumar ajit keshri kumar yerra rao shankar binay mishra kumar buddhadeo mahato syeda ayesha bansidhar rukhaiyyar prasad dinesh saini kumar aditya singh kumar   the first ancient pandemic well back around 165 a d known as the antonine plague generally referred as the plague of galen was a pandemic that affected asia minor egypt greece and italy and is thought to have been either smallpox or measles though the true cause is still unknown and have killed over approximately 5 million people 3 then arose the plague of justinian around 541-542 a d which is assumed to have killed perhaps half the population of europe was an outbreak of the bubonic plague that afflicted the byzantine empire and mediterranean port cities killing up to 25 million people in its year long reign of terror 4 from 1346 to 1353 a d an outbreak of the plague called as the black death ravaged europe africa and asia with an estimated death toll between 75 and 200 million people this is assumed to have originated in asia the plague traversed to continents via the fleas living on the rats that so frequently lived aboard merchant ships 5 like the first and second pandemics the third cholera pandemic originated in india spreading from the ganges river delta before making disaster through asia europe north america and africa and ending the lives of over a million people originally the asiatic flu or russian flu scientifically said to be flu pandemic 1889-1890 as it was called this strain was thought to be an outbreak of the influenza a virus subtype h2n2 though recent discoveries have instead found the cause to be the influenza a virus subtype h3n8 6 the first cases were observed in may 1889 in three separate and distant locations bukhara in central asia turkestan athabasca in north-western canada and greenland rapid population growth of the 19th century specifically in urban areas only helped the flu spread and before long the outbreak had spread across the globe the sixth cholera pandemic originated in india where it killed over 800000 before spreading to the middle east north africa eastern europe and russia the sixth cholera pandemic was also the source of the last american outbreak of cholera 19101911 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 between 1918 and 1920 a disturbingly deadly outbreak of influenza flu pandemic tore across the globe infecting over a third of the worlds population and ending the lives of 20  50 million people of the 500 million people infected in the 1918 pandemic the mortality rate was estimated at 10 to 20 with up to 25 million deaths in the first 25 weeks alone 13 asian flu was a pandemic outbreak of influenza a of the h2n2 subtype that originated in china in 1956 and lasted until 1958 13 in its two-year spree asian flu travelled from the chinese province of guizhou to singapore hong kong and the united states and the death toll was approximately 2 millions a category 2 flu pandemic sometimes referred to as the hong kong flu the 1968 flu pandemic was caused by the h3n2 strain of the influenza a virus a genetic offshoot of the h2n2 subtype from the first reported case on july 13 1968 in hong kong it took only 17 days before outbreaks of the virus were reported in singapore and vietnam and within three months had spread to the philippines india australia europe and the united states first identified in democratic republic of the congo in 1976 hivaids has truly proven itself as a global pandemic killing more than 36 million people since 1981 currently there are between 31 and 35 million people living with hiv the vast majority of those are in sub-saharan africa where 5 of the population is infected roughly 21 million people as awareness has grown new treatments have been developed that make hiv far more manageable and many of those infected go on to lead productive lives between 2005 and 2012 the annual global deaths from hivaids dropped from 22 million to 16 million 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 the history of human coronaviruses began in 1965 when tyrrell and bynoe1 found that they could passage a virus named b814 it was found in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures obtained from the respiratory tract of an adult with a common cold 15 human coronaviruses first characterized in the 1960s are responsible for a substantial proportion of upper respiratory tract infections in children since 2003 at least 5 new human coronaviruses have been identified including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus which caused significant morbidity and mortality nl63 representing a group of newly identified group i coronaviruses that includes nl and the new haven coronavirus has been identified worldwide these viruses are associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease and are likely common human pathogens 16 the cause of a very new severe acute respiratory syndrome called sars emerged in 20022003 as a coronavirus from southern china and spread throughout the world with quantifiable speed the sars epidemic put the animal coronaviruses in the spotlight in the last twenty years several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 to 2003 and h1n1 influenza in 2009 have been recorded most recently the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 sars-cov provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in china and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths and the mers-cov that began in saudi arabia and has approximately 2500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases 17 18 19 on february 11 2020 the who director-general announced that the disease caused by this new cov was a covid-19 which is the acronym of coronavirus disease 2019 20 coronavirus is the name given to group of viruses that infect mammals and birds the name corona is derived from latin word meaning crown that refers to its characteristic appearance where its surface is covered in the form of club shaped protein spikes 21 the host and reservoir of coronavirus is depicted in figure 1
 by 2020 coronavirus had gained popularity globally with respect to its nomenclature this family of viruses seems to expand continuously according to scientists and sars-cov-2 alternatively known as covid-19 also belongs to this family of viruses there is a probability that some of these viruses might have been missed by the scientists and hence there is still a lot to explore about covid-19 and the response mechanism of the human immune system by now 40 coronaviruses have got their names approved as per the international committee for the taxonomy of viruses the numbers of identified coronaviruses have reached to seven including the current covid 19 most of these viruses seem to affect the animals four among these seven viruses are acquired by community and transmit through population continually for long period of time on the other hand sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are recent outbreaks and are associated with very high mortality rates shereen et al 22 states in addition to the above three h5n1 influenza a and h1n1 2009 cause acute lung injury ali and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards all leading to pulmonary failure and ultimate fatality all corona viruses start in animals and pass on to humans through mutation recombination and adaptation shereen et al 22 supports that the originating source of covd-19 is bats but the intermediate source before transmission to humans is not yet identified many animal coronaviruses infect animals during a particular season the reason why these animal coronaviruses do not cause symptoms in their host reservoir is because they continuously co-evolve and adapt over a long period of time with their reservoir host the symptoms are mild even if they are shown symptoms in species vary like in birds it causes upper respiratory tract infections while in cows or pigs it results in diarrhea in humans it causes respiratory tract infections that could lead to common cold the high infection rate recombination rate and mutation rate of these animal coronaviruses increase the probability of mutants ability to transmit into another host it has been speculated that the severity of disease is significantly very high between the new host and the coronavirus at the new round of adaption it is not yet proved but speculated that the new host will be able to fight the virus effectively only after a long period of adaption and co-evolution hence leading to milder symptoms the seven human coronaviruses are transitioned into humans through other animals after originating in animals like bats and rodents the four human coronaviruses including hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e cause mild common cold like symptoms although they cause infections across all age groups throughout the year but the rates are higher in winters and early spring they cause multiple re-infections throughout human lifespan these viruses are transmitted to human beings when they come in close in contact with the host these viruses during their incubation period in human beings develop or even mutate for further transmission to other human beings earlier form of coronaviruses includes sars and mers that were lethal but were not able to transmit in exponential manner like covid 19 the structure of 2019-ncov s in the prefusion conformation is depicted in figure 2
 covid 19 is associated with the fever severe respiratory illness and pneumonia it is found to be related with sars-cov and several bat coronaviruses and is characterized as new member of the betacoronavirus genus shereen et al 22 states that the subgroups of coronaviruses family include alpha  beta  gamma  and delta  coronavirus and covid 19 belongs to the  group of coronavirusesits infection rate is significantly higher than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov hence raising the concern of international public health emergency it enters into the host cells through a densely glycosylated spike s protein this protein undergoes substantial structural change in order to form fusion between the membranes of the virus and the host cell the protein subunit s1 binds with the host cell receptor prefusion trimer is destabilized by the receptor binder resulting in transition to subunit s2 the down receptor inaccessible conformation state is more stable than the up receptor accessible conformation state s protein pays an indispensable function and the characterization the prefusion structure provides vital information which is used in the design and development of the vaccine covid 19 overall structure s resembles that of sars-cov s resulting in a root mean square deviation rmsd of 38  over 959 c atoms the position of the receptor binding domains rbd in their respective down conformations is one of the larger differences between these two structures the sars-cov rbd packs tightly against the n-terminal domain of the neighboring protomer while covid 19 rbd is angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer covid 19 s and sars-cov s reflect the high structural homology between the two proteins despite the difference in the alignment angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the same functional host cell receptor shared between covid 19 s and sars-cov s the apparent ease with which covid 19 spreads from human to human is mainly because of its very high affinity for human ace2 shereen et al 22 supports that the transmission rate of sars-cov 2 is higher than the sras cov owing to the events of genetic recombination in the rbd domain shereen et al 22 states that a clinically approved antivirus is not yet available to fight against the covid 19the rapid spreading of covid 19 indicates the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines the information available on covid 19 atomic-level structure will facilitate the additional protein-engineering efforts which could result in the improvement of antigenicity and protein expression for the development of vaccine the structural data will also provide information on occurrence of the mutations when virus undergoes genetic drift define whether residues map to known antibody epitopes sites for other coronavirus spike proteins the structure also assures on whether the protein produced is homogeneous and in the prefusion conformation the structure of respiratory syndrome which causes coronavirus in humans is depicted in figure 3
 the designing and screening of small molecules with fusion-inhibiting potential are also facilitated by the atomic-level detail the information is indispensable in supporting the precision design of the vaccine and discovering the antiviral measures 23 further shereen et al 22 also describes the compartive analysis of the critical nature of the three outbreaks including covid 19 sars cov and mers cov while emulating the approaches that are recommended in developing effective vaccines the covid-19 virus affects different people in different ways covid-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people develops mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring special treatment people who have underlying medical conditions and those over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death common symptoms include fever tiredness and dry cough other symptoms include shortness of breath aches and pains sore throat and very few people reports diarrhoea nausea or a runny nose 24 pneumonia of unknown cause detected in wuhan china was first reported to the who country office in china on 31 december 2019 20 because the first cases of the covid-19 disease were linked to direct exposure to the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan republic of china the animal-to-human transmission was presumed as the main mechanism nevertheless subsequent cases were not associated with this exposure mechanism therefore it was concluded that the virus could also be transmitted from human-to-human and symptomatic people are the most frequent source of covid-19 spread the possibility of transmission before symptoms develop seems to be infrequent although it cannot be excluded moreover there are suggestions that individuals who remain asymptomatic could transmit the virus this data suggests that the use of isolation is the best way to contain this epidemic 25 based on data from the first cases in wuhan and investigations conducted by the chinese centre for disease control and prevention cdc and local cdcs the incubation time could be generally within 3 to 7 days and up to 2 weeks as the longest time from infection to symptoms was 125 days 95 confidence interval 92 to 18 26  this data also showed that this novel epidemic doubled about every seven days whereas the basic reproduction number r0 is 22 in other words on average each patient transmits the infection to an additional 22 individuals of note estimations of the r0 of the sars-cov epidemic in 2002-2003 were approximately 3 27 study suggests that people may acquire the coronavirus through the air and after touching contaminated objects scientists discovered the virus is detectable for up to three hours in aerosols up to four hours on copper up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel 28 an analysis of publicly available data on infections from the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 that causes the respiratory illness covid-19 yielded an estimate of 51 days for the median disease incubation period according to a new study led by researchers at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health 29 this median time from exposure to onset of symptoms suggests that the 14-day quarantine period used by the us centers for disease control and prevention for individuals with likely exposure to the coronavirus is reasonable the analysis suggests that about 975 percent of people who develop symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection will do so within 115 days of exposure lauer et al estimated that for every 10000 individuals quarantined for 14 days only about 101 would develop symptoms after being released from quarantine 29

 based on the report of who the transmission of covid-19 in the top 10 countries across the globe is mentioned in table 1
30 the subsequent materials of this paper are structured as follows section 2 deals with basic terminologies and basic reproduction number of severe pandemic diseases three epidemic models of three different stages of covid-19 and its stability are discussed in section 3 section 4 discusses on simulations and its analysis with examples finally the paper is concluded in section 5 followed by references nomenclature used in three epidemic models of the pandemic disease covid-19 is given in table 2
 
susceptible st in epidemiology a susceptible individual sometimes known simply as a susceptible is a member of a population who is at risk of becoming infected by a disease 
immigrant population et it is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens or to take up employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker 
infectious population it it refers to the population who are infected by a contagious disease covid-19 in our case may be through immigrant population transmission or by local individual transmission or community transmission 
home isolation q1t it refers to the restriction of movement or separation of well persons who are susceptible or possibly exposed to a contagious disease covid-19 in our case before it is known whether they will become ill isolation usually takes place in the home and may be applied at the individual level or to a group or community of susceptible or exposed population 
quarantine q2t it refers to the separation and restricted movement of ill persons who have a contagious disease covid-19 in our case in order to prevent its transmission to others it typically occurs in a hospital setting but under very special cases may be done at home under a special facility usually individuals are quarantined but the practice may be applied in larger groups 
recovered population rt it refers to the population who are recovered from covid-19 
basic reproduction number r0 the basic reproduction number denoted by r0
31 of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection 32 basic reproduction number of some highly infectious disease is given in table 3
 here a mathematical model is developed to express the first stage of covid-19 this model has six compartments susceptible population - immigrant population - home isolation population - infectious population - hospital quarantine population - recovered population any country or state is in stage 1 if persons are found covid-19 positive that has recent international travel history this model helps us to understand how this foreign return population spreads covid-19 to other citizens of that country if not handled properly in the absence of vaccination and proper treatment two force-control policies namely home isolation and hospital quarantine are adopted by many countries to control this covid-19 epidemic the same is framed and analysed here with the help of our model as depicted in figure 4
 based on our hypothesis and flow of transmission of the disease covid-19 in human population as depicted in figure 4 we have the following system of equations1dsdtbsi1sq11ededta1e2e112e1edidtsiq112idq1dt2e1q1dq2dti112e12q2drdtq21rwhere the total population ns  e i q1  q2  r thendndtdsdtdedtdidtdq1dtdq2dtdrdtdndtba1n2iq1q2

 in this section we discuss the local stability of endemic equilibrium and disease free equilibrium of the system 1 after dropping the last equation of 1  by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations respectively

 clearly the system 2 has four negative real roots and the root 5120if12
 clearly all roots are negative real roots so system 1 is disease free equilibrium and is locally asymptotically stable too the endemic equilibrium seiq1q2r which is interior of  can be obtained by taking all the equations of the system 2 equal to zero thussb1112a1a1i1111ea11i2ai1i111112b1112a1a1q12a111q2i11112a1112ri11112a11112

 here the four eigen values are1121231411which have strictly negative real parts and other two eigen values are given by quadratic equations2ab0whereai212s0bi12121211s0ab0
 since ab  0 so by routh-hurwitz criteria system 1 is stable since all the eigen values have negative real parts so the system 1 is locally asymptotically stable at the endemic equilibrium  if r0  1 in this section we prove the global stability for endemic equilibrium we adopt the geometrical approach for the mapping f drn  rn where d is an open set if its differential equations xfx be such that its every solution xt can be uniquely determined by its initial condition xtx0 then an equilibrium points xd and satisfies the conditionsd is simply connectedthere exists a compact absorbing sub set k of d

 the second compound additive jacobian matrix is given byj2si2120000i210s000i2120s0i0s2120000is21220000212
 to obtain matrix m in the bendixson condition we define a matrixpdiag1iq1iq1iq1iq1iq1then

 hence lozinskii measure reduces to msupg1g2ii
 so 0tmdtlogitt
 hence q20tmdtt0which is defined as the indicator of global stability of the unique positive endemic equilibrium hence the system is globally asymptotic stable here a mathematical model is developed to express the second stage of covid-19 which is now more difficult to control in comparison to stage 1 this model also has the same six compartments susceptible population - immigrant population - home isolation population - infectious population - hospital quarantine population - recovered population any country or state is in stage 2 if only those found covid-19 positive that has no international travel history but came in direct contact of those persons who has recently returned from countries that are affected by covid-19 this model helps us to understand how this infected population spreads covid-19 to other citizens of that country if not handled properly in the absence of vaccination and proper treatment two force-control policies namely home isolation and hospital quarantine are adopted by many countries to control this covid-19 epidemic the same is framed and analysed here with the help of this model as shown in figure 5
 based on our assumptions and flow of transmission of covid-19 of stage 2 in human population as depicted in figure 5 we have the following system of equations3dsdtbsi1sdedta2e12e1edidtsiq112idq1dts2e1q1dq2dti12e12q2drdtq21r

 for equilibrium points in the steady state of the system 3 we have4a2e12e1e0siq112i0s2e1q10i12e12q20q21r0
 in this section we discuss the local stability of endemic equilibrium and disease free equilibrium of the system 3 after dropping the last equation of 3 and by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations

 hence by routh-hurwitz criteria system is stable thus all the eigen values have negative real parts and hence the system 3 is locally asymptotically stable at the endemic equilibrium  if r0  1 in order to prove the global stability of the region  we take s and i compartment leave q1 population and make it free from the r population therefore in the positive quadrant of the s-i plane we apply dulacs criteria with multiplier d1i considerf1bsis1sf2s12ithendf1bis1sidf2s12

 thus no periodic solution exists in the region  hence by poincare-bendixson property all solution starting in positive quadrant of si- plane with io and siab1 approaches s i as t   in this case the limiting form of rest of the system of equations 3 shows that eeq1q1q2q2rr thus the endemic equilibrium seiq1q2r is globally stable in the given region  for the system 3 based on our hypothesis and flow of transmission of covid-19 of stage 3 in human population as depicted in figure 6 we have the following system of equations5dsdtbsi1ssdidtsiq112idq1dts1q1dq2dti12q2drdtq21r

 if the disease is absent in the population then dndtb1n
 this shows that population size n tends to carrying capacity b1 as t   it shows that the solution of 5 exists in the region defined bysiq1q2rr5siq1q2rb1
 since all the solution remains bounded in the positively invariant region  and in the maximal interval 0 the initial value problem is well posed for the basic reproduction number we take the following system of equationsdidtsiq112idq1dts1q1dq2dti12q2drdtq21r

 in this section we discuss the local stability of endemic equilibrium and disease free equilibrium of the system 5 after dropping the last equation of 5 and then by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations

 so by routh-hurwitz criteria the system is locally asymptotically stable thus all the eigen values have negative real parts and hence the system 5 is locally asymptotically stable at the endemic equilibrium  if r01 in order to prove the global stability of the region  we take s and i compartment leave q1 population and make it free from the r population therefore in the positive quadrant of s-i plane we apply dulacs criteria with multiplier d1i considerf1bsis1sf2s12ithendf1bis1sidf2s12

example 1 the local stability of the infection-free equilibrium point has been numerically simulated and depicted in figures 7
a 9a and 11a for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively and the corresponding simulated data for this unsuccessful attack are listed in table 4
 7 and 10 respectively the initial point and the parametric values along with basic reproduction number roare shown in table 5
 8 and 11 for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively the value of rofor all the three stages is less than one it is clearly observed that the infection-free equilibrium point turns out to be stable for all the stages
example 2 the local stability of the endemic equilibrium point has been numerically simulated and depicted in figures 8

for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively the value of rofor all the three stages is greater than one it is clearly observed that the endemic equilibrium point turns out to be stable for all the stages
example 3 the behaviour of system 1 3 and 5 are studied by considering quarantine population  recovered population plane and figure 7b 9b and 11b for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively reflects that recovered population is directly proportionate with quarantine population for ro  1  even for ro  1 the same relationship is achieved in figure 8bi 10bi and 12bi for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively and the same with respect to time is shown with 3-dimentional graph in figure 8bii 10bii and 12bii for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively
example 4 the behaviour of system 1 3 and 5 are also studied by considering home isolation population  recovered population plane and figures 7c 9c and 11c for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively reflects that recovered population is not much affected or depends on home isolation population for ro  1  even for ro  1 the same relationship is achieved in figures 8c 10c and 12c for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively
example 5 the behaviour of system 1 3 and 5 are also studied by considering infectious population  quarantine population plane and figure 7d 9d and 11d for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively reflects that infectious population gradually becomes quarantine population and is under control whereas forro  1 figures 8d 10d and 12d for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively depicts that a large number of populations are infectious as well as quarantined
example 6 the global stability of the endemic equilibrium point forro  1 is shown in figures 8e 10e and 12e for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively it shows the plane formed by the susceptible population and infectious population it can be clearly seen in all above said figures that the trajectories are seen to be asymptotically stable at endemic equilibrium point which is unique and globally stable
 from figure 7b it is clear that the more we quarantine the positive cases of covid-19 the more is the recovery in the infectious population from figure 7c it is evident that the more we have social distancing of the susceptible population that is home isolation the larger we have the chances to escape from the infectious covid-19 the more we quarantine the infectious covid-19 population in the hospital the more is the recovery which is very clearly reflected from figure 10
bii after 1185 days the recovery starts but after 21 days there is a sharp increase in the recovery population social distancing that is the more we home isolate the susceptible population the transmission of the disease in population is almost negligible which is clearly reflected in figure 10c the susceptible population when are in complete lockdown the transmission of the disease is very less which is evident from figure 11
c 
figure 12
bi clearly reflects that the more we quarantine the positive cases of covid-19 the recovery population is more from figure 12bii it is very clear that the more we quarantine the infectious population from covid-19 the more is the recovery and after 21 days of hospital quarantine there is a sharp increase in the recovery population from figure 12c it is evident that the more we home isolate the susceptible population the more is the chances of getting them infected from covid-19 three quarantine models are developed for three different stages of covid-19 reproduction number for all the three stages is obtained and the condition for local and global asymptotic stability is well established when the reproduction number is greater than one the systems developed in all the three stages of infection-endemic equilibrium in s-i phase plane is globally asymptotic stable the two vital pivot parameters of all the three models of covid-19 home isolation and hospital quarantine is well analysed from the numerical simulations it is very clear that the more we have home isolation or complete lockdown or social distancing the less we have the chances to be infected and the disease to be transmitted in the population which is very evident from figures 7c 8c 9c10c11c 12c the general home isolation for our results is approximately 1185 days from the simulation results it is also evident from figures 8bi 9b 10biii 11b 12bi ii that covid-19 positive population when are subjected to hospital quarantine the transmission of the disease is reduced and the rate of recovery also increases till date when no vaccine or treatment is available for covid-19 then from our developed models it is well established that social distancing and hospital quarantine for positive cases is the only best treatment the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper there is no conflict of interest among the authors  respiratory viruses j peiris s charles madeley r gordon cook c alimuddin zumla i   the respiratory tract can be divided into upper and lower parts with the boundary at the lower end of the larynx viral infections confined to the upper part upper respiratory tract infection urti are rarely life-threatening with the exception of croup they can be uncomfortable but do not usually call the individuals future into question these infections do not automatically spread to the lower respiratory tract but where the lower respiratory tract is involved the process is extensive and rarely confined to one lobe or even one lung this contrasts with pneumococcal pneumonia which is typically confined to one lobe of one lung see also chapter 11 although widespread the clinical consequences of viral infection are usually less severe than those seen in bacterial pneumonia otherwise such infections would be much more lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and disease due to avian influenza subtype h5n1 are notable exceptions where disease severity and mortality from a virus infection is particularly high the most common manifestations of a lower respiratory tract infection lrti are bronchiolitis in infants or an atypical pneumonia even when an lrti occurs the upper tract is also usually involved and the causative virus can usually be recovered from it there are no clear-cut differences between the clinical presentations of any viruses in the respiratory tract for example although respiratory syncytial virus rsv is the most common cause of bronchiolitis worldwide this clinical condition may also be caused by parainfluenza viruses influenza viruses adenoviruses or rhinoviruses consequently it must not be assumed that two patients with similar clinical illnesses will have been infected by the same virus this is particularly so in babies and young children conversely the same virus may cause a range of clinical manifestations in different patients3
 this virus is distributed worldwide and is found wherever it has been sought it is frequently associated with bronchiolitis in babies  with a peak incidence at about 6 months  and is the most common virus detected especially in children under 1 year of age who are hospitalized with respiratory infections large epidemics occur annually at the same season but the seasonality of rsv epidemics may vary in different geographical regions see epidemiology below the starting date and extent of the epidemic may vary but the annual epidemic occurs reliably for diagnostic purposes there is only one serotype but two subtypes a and b have been described and they may co-circulate with one usually predominating in any given year no obvious differences in disease severity or pathogenesis have been documented3
 rsv causes a substantial but variable lrti disease burden in tropical countries4 in a population-based study of infants in kenya it was found that rsv was common approximately 36 of infections led to ltri 23 were severe and 3 of infected children were hospitalized5 more recently it is becoming clear that rsv causes significant morbidity in the elderly as well as in infants6
 antigenically these are the most variable of the respiratory viruses both exhibit antigenic drift in which the surface antigens of the virus change gradually in the face of immunological pressure from the host species with one or two variants predominating at a given time in showing this progressive and directional antigenic change they are unique among respiratory viruses in addition influenza a but not influenza b shows occasional major antigenic changes in the surface antigenic structures haemagglutinin andor neuraminidase and called antigenic shift which may lead to a pandemic such pandemic influenza viruses are derived from avian influenza viruses through genetic re-assortment with animal or human strains this results in the incorporation of new viral surface antigens to which the human population is immunologically nave the timing extent and direction of either drift or shift have so far been completely unpredictable however when viruses with antigenic shift appear in the human population a worldwide pandemic of influenza a becomes possible memorable examples occurred in 1918 spanish flu in 1957 asian flu and in 1968 hong kong flu with no animal reservoirs to provide such new antigens shift does not occur in influenza b smaller-scale influenza epidemics associated with antigenic drift contribute to mortality in the elderly and in those with pre-existing conditions such as chronic cardiopulmonary or renal disease diabetes immunosuppression or severe anaemia the risk of reyes syndrome is increased following influenza in children on long-term aspirin therapy while the morbidity and excess mortality associated with influenza in temperate regions is well documented6 the more diffuse seasonality see epidemiology below obscures the disease burden due to influenza in the tropics nevertheless recent studies in hong kong and singapore have revealed that influenza-associated mortality and morbidity in tropical settings is as significant as in temperate climates7 interestingly influenza-associated mortality is not restricted solely to respiratory complications a small proportion of cardiovascular mortality also appears to be triggered by influenza7
 avian influenza virus h5n1 is currently endemic in poultry in a number of countries in asia and africa and has repeatedly been transmitted zoonotically to humans often with fatal consequences8 9 the associated disease was unusual in that previously healthy young adults and children are among those most severely ill the disease presents as a rapidly progressive viral pneumonia with severe leucopenia and lymphopenia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction that fail to respond to standard antibiotic therapy for the pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia some patients also manifest a watery diarrhoea and moderate liver dysfunction most though not all patients have a history of recent exposure to sick poultry transmission remains zoonotic although occasional instances of limited and so far unsustained human-to-human transmission following close family-type contact have been reported early diagnosis and treatment with oseltamivir is life-saving see treatment below other avian influenza a viruses eg subtypes h9n2 h7n7 have also caused human infection h9n2 and h7n7 have caused mild flu-like illness or conjunctivitis h7n7 but one fatal respiratory illness caused by h7n7 virus is documented the continued zoonotic transmission of these avian viruses does not imply that they are inevitably likely to lead to another pandemic however the unusual severity of h5n1 disease in humans gives cause for concern because one cannot assume that the acquisition of human-to-human transmissibility if it ever occurs will always be associated with a significant loss of virulence irrespective of whether or not a putative pandemic threat becomes reality it is clear that h5n1 viruses have already had a significant impact on the poultry industry on human economic and social well-being and consequently on human health this virus which resembles respiratory syncytial virus rsv was discovered in 2001 by van den hoogen and colleagues in the netherlands10 it is now recognized to be a separate virus in its own right although the disease it causes its world wide distribution and seasonality are similar to those of rsv11 12 it too may cause infections in the elderly as well as in babies under 1 year old and its discovery has accounted for some of the diseases in these age-groups for which no cause had been found hitherto retrospective serology though has shown that this is not a new pathogen even for man but has been around for a long time there are four serotypes of parainfluenza with type 4 possessing two subtypes 4a and 4b types 1 and 2 typically cause croup a high-pitched barking cough in children which is profoundly irritating to their parents type 3 can cause bronchiolitis or pneumonia and less often croup in temperate countries types 1 and 2 together with rsv are more prevalent in the winter months whereas type 3 is unusual among respiratory viruses in occurring more often in spring and early summer this dissociation between the peaks of activity of parainfluenza type 3 and rsv has also been observed in tropical regions13
 there are 51 different serotypes but the majority of respiratory infections involve types 17 types 1 2 5 and 6 are usually associated with endemic disease in temperate regions and types 3 4 and 7 with epidemics the higher-numbered serotypes appear in the respiratory tract from time to time but the majority of them have been found only in the gut see chapter 46 adenoviruses are unusual in that prolonged carriage up to 2 years in some cases may occur in the tonsils of children often with no continuing illness the clinical significance of adenoviruses isolated from the throats of children must therefore be interpreted cautiously especially if the strain has not been typed however they may cause a primary and severe pneumonia in debilitated children in whom it may be rapidly fatal and in some immunocompromised patients these are frequent causes of the common cold itself a frequent winter and summer illness in temperate countries but they have a year-round seasonality in the tropics14 they can be difficult to grow in culture and are very under-reported mainly because diagnosis is often not attempted with over 100 serotypes serological diagnosis is impracticable molecular diagnosis based on conserved parts of the viral genome has revealed that rhinoviruses are detected in a substantial number of children hospitalized with acute respiratory disease in both temperate and tropical regions14 however in a proportion of cases a rhinovirus is detected together with other respiratory pathogens and the relative contribution of rhinovirus to the illness is unclear a better understanding of the epidemiology of rhinoviruses in apparently asymptomatic children and adults is needed rhinoviruses are now also recognized to be a significant precipitating factor in exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease in both children and adults15 they have also occasionally been the sole pathogens present in the lungs of immunocompromised patients dying with respiratory signs and symptoms human coronavirus hcov strains 229e and oc43 have been long recognized as the second main cause of the common cold more recently three other coronaviruses have been detected in humans sars cov see below hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 the hcov 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 viruses are ubiquitous and are regularly detected in respiratory specimens of a small proportion 110 of children hospitalized with acute respiratory disease and in many parts of the world16 17 18 infection with these human coronaviruses presents as an upper respiratory tract infection asthma exacerbation acute bronchiolitis pneumonia febrile seizures and also as croup especially nl63 hku1 can be associated with urti lrti especially in those with underlying diseases of the respiratory tract and with febrile seizures in children17 hcov are not readily cultivable and require molecular methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr for detection see diagnosis below in 2003 a coronavirus causing a severe and often fatal pneumonia emerged in southern china within weeks of its spread to hong kong the disease had also spread worldwide to affect over 30 countries across five continents a dramatic illustration of how rapidly a newly emerging respiratory disease can spread19 it was unusual in that it caused severe disease which was also readily transmitted to those caring for the patients unlike many other respiratory viral infections viral load in the upper respiratory tract did not peak until the second week of illness and consequently transmission was rare within the first 5 days from onset of illness this allowed public health measures of early case recognition and isolation to interrupt transmission within the community sars was a disseminated infection and not one confined to the respiratory tract19 virus was detectable in the faeces and urine and these may also contribute to transmission under some circumstances the virus originated as a zoonosis the precursor virus is present in bats rhinolophus spp20 civet cats and other small mammals within live game-animal markets in southern china provided a reservoir and amplifier of the virus and probably provided the opportunity for adaptation to humans21 while the transmission of the human-adapted virus that caused the global outbreak in 2003 has been interrupted it is possible that the disease may reappear either through the escape of the human-adapted sars cov from a laboratory or by the re-adaptation of the animal virus to efficient human transmission measles see also chapters 43 and 47 is often not recognized as a major cause of lrti morbidity or mortality and there are a number of factors that may account for this underassessment22 children with measles may not always be admitted to a general paediatric ward the aetiology may be attributed to a super infecting pathogen rather than to measles and some patients with measles especially when immunocompromised as a result of malnutrition cytotoxic drug treatment or for other reasons will fail to develop the typical rash in patients who do not manifest typical clinical features both clinical and laboratory diagnosis of measles is difficult even in the developed world where the diagnosis has been actively sought in developing countries measles is found to be a major cause of lrti accounting for 621 of morbidity and 850 of the mortality attributed to lrti the effects of the virus on the respiratory tract can be direct giant cell pneumonitis or indirect the latter includes the depressive effects of the virus on the host immune system stores of vitamin a and overall nutritional status all of these can lead to an increased risk of super-infection with other viral or bacterial pathogens human boca viruses belong to the family parvoviridae are associated with a proportion of lower respiratory tract disease and wheezing in children especially those aged 6 months2 years23 24 the viral dna is also detectable in the serum but it is not clear whether this represents infectious virus enteroviruses have been known for many years as causes of a range of clinical manifestations their role in respiratory infections is now being increasingly investigated25
 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps is a rare but important cause of severe respiratory illness in the north and south american continents their role in respiratory disease was first recognized in may 1993 when an outbreak of a severe and frequently fatal respiratory disease occurred in the area in the usa where the four states arizona colorado new mexico and utah abut the causative agent was found to be a hantavirus later called sin nombre virus the natural host was found to be the deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus the local population of which had recently increased rapidly bringing them and their excreta more into contact with humans and allowing the virus to cross the species gap related viruses causing a similar disease syndrome have since been isolated in north eg new york bayou black creek canal viruses and south eg andes virus americas but with different species of natural rodent hosts26 these viruses all belong to the same hantavirus genus as those causing haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs in the old world hantaan seoul and puumala viruses both hfrs and hps have a similar febrile prodrome with thrombocytopenia and leucocytosis in hps the key differences are that the capillary leakage which follows is localized to the lungs and that with sin nombre virus renal dysfunction is minimal there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak but there is evidence that some of the south american hantaviruses causing hps may be transmitted between humans in a nosocomial setting a detailed analysis of the respiratory complications of the immunocompromised patient oncology leukaemia transplantation is outside the compass of this book but some mention is necessary of opportunistic infections in patients who have been immunodepressed by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv or who have the acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids see also chapter 20 they are likely to contract any of the viruses already mentioned and may have difficulty in eradicating them due to the lack of functioning cellular immunity however viral respiratory infections are not in themselves necessarily a life-threatening problem in patients with aids with three exceptions cytomegalovirus measles and varicella-zoster virus cytomegalovirus is an opportunist pathogen in immunocompromised patients in whom it can cause serious or even fatal respiratory complications it is more important as an opportunist pathogen of transplant recipients especially bone marrow transplants than those immunocompromised through aids perinatal cytomegalovirus infection may occasionally present as pneumonitis in the newborn and together with chlamydiae must be considered in the differential diagnosis apart from such occasional illnesses most cytomegalovirus infections are clinically silent although serological surveys have shown positivity rates approaching 100 in some overcrowded populations it is also a cause of congenital malformations especially sensorineural deafness following maternal infection in pregnancy see also chapter 47 in the immunocompromised giant cell pneumonitis due to measles can be fatal and may occur even in patients who have past immunity naturally derived or vaccine induced chickenpox is usually trivial in school-age children but may be severe and include respiratory complications in adults and in the immunocompromised the diagnosis of several other agents has been undertaken in virus laboratories because these agents cause respiratory infections which overlap clinically with those due to viruses and they are diagnosed serologically see below they include psittacosis q fever and mycoplasmosis where isolation of the causative organism is either difficult or dangerous they also include chlamydia pneumoniae twar which is recognized as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia although diagnostic tests are not yet widely available the activities of these agents are under-recorded in most parts of the world since they are amenable to antibiotic therapy it is important that they are diagnosed berman2 has summarized the data from developing countries and found that the percentage of hospitalized patients who were virus positive was about twice the figure found in those attending as outpatients this difference is not surprising and probably reflects both the greater opportunity to make a specific diagnosis in the hospitalized patient and the greater severity of their disease the majority of trivial episodes head colds and increased nasal secretions are not subjected to virus diagnosis and the causative viruses are unconfirmed as with most other diseases respiratory infections are made worse by other components of the patients environment poverty malnutrition pollution and overcrowding common in urban environments everywhere in the world are well recognized to contribute to the frequency and severity of respiratory illness the effects may be direct or indirect through the presence of other disease poor sanitation and poor personal hygiene figure 461
 nevertheless although a poor malnourished child in a densely populated and economically deprived urban area will have many respiratory illnesses viruses are no respecters of persons and his or her better-off cousin in a wealthy environment may also have a considerable number of infections where the difference lies is that the latter will be able to cope better and will have fewer longer-term sequelae which include chronic respiratory impairment wheezing asthma bronchitis and bronchiectasis there are several approaches to this they include demonstration of 1 viral antigens by immunofluorescence33 34 or enzyme immunoassays35 2 viral infectivity by growth in cell culture or 3 viral nucleic acid by various techniques details of the techniques are not given here but the advantages and disadvantages of each are indicated in table 464
 before setting up a diagnostic laboratory the aims of the operation should be clearly thought out if the catchment population is very large the number of specimens may also be large and the advantages of automation eg in machine-based nucleic acid amplification or enzyme immunoassays may be decisive however this level of abundance is rare and the number of available specimens may be too few automation may then be less advantageous and is often minimal except for serology see below except for special studies most of the specimens will come from hospitalized patients because of the practical difficulties of collecting and delivering specimens from the community virology specimens are perishable and must be delivered to the laboratory without delay such methods of diagnosis depend on good-quality specimens being taken from the patient it is easier to take a bad specimen than a good one and close cooperation with the laboratory will help to raise the positivity rate this at present means demonstrating an antibody response in the serum to the stimulus provided by the virus seeking responses in cellular immunity or antibody in other body fluids remain research techniques only for a valid diagnosis a convalescent specimen of serum taken after enough time for a response has elapsed is needed but may be difficult to collect 2 weeks after the onset from patients who may by then be totally recovered and unwilling to oblige the investigators interest this is particularly true with children nevertheless unless an antibody response can be demonstrated seroconversion or a rising titre some uncertainty over the validity of the result will remain the alternative is to demonstrate an igm-class response but this suffers from the twin disadvantages that such tests are not available for all viruses and the sample to be reliably positive may have to be taken after the acute illness is over with the problems already mentioned serology remains the routine choice for some respiratory agents which although not viral in nature are traditionally diagnosed by virus laboratories these include psittacosis q fever and mycoplasma pneumoniae infection all cause an illness with an insidious onset and are difficult andor dangerous to isolate since all therefore are susceptible to antibiotics a diagnosis is important and can be life-saving the role of chlamydia pneumoniae is poorly documented at present in the absence of an easily used test the diagnosis of chickenpox is usually clinically obvious but measles may present problems because the skin rash is often absent in the immunocompromised patient immunofluorescent examination of nasopharyngeal secretions for measles-infected cells provides a rapid diagnosis but this is unlikely to be widely available cytomegalovirus can be cultured from the sputum voluntary or induced or detected in bronchoalveolar lavagelung biopsy specimens if available adenoviruses in the immunocompromised may be detected by culture or molecular methods in the respiratory tract blood urine and faeces detection in multiple sites is evidence of disseminated disease and is an indicator of poor prognosis and for urgent antiviral therapy rsv and influenza viruses are particularly infectious and are notorious causes of cross-infection in hospitals this may pose particular hazards to patients at higher risk such as those with underlying heart or lung disease eg congenital heart damage or bronchopulmonary dysplasia transmission of rsv as with most other respiratory viruses is by direct contact or via infected surfaces or fomites influenza a on the other hand is efficiently spread by large droplets and occasionally via small droplets precautions that may help reduce the risk of cross-infection include the isolation andor cohort nursing of infected patients and scrupulous care in hand-washing between patients it is essential to remember that viruses can also infect medical and other hospital staff rsv may be asymptomatic or cause a common cold in adults and be transmitted by and through them sars was indeed a frightening reminder that hospitals may serve as a venue for amplification and dissemination of virus infections amantadine and its alternative rimantadine were options for the prevention in outbreaks within closed communities of high risk individuals and less convincingly for the treatment of influenza a38 however since 2003 increasing resistance of both h3n2 and h1n1 subtypes of influenza a virus has now led to its withdrawal as an option for the treatment of seasonal influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as zanamivir and oseltamivir which inhibit the viral enzyme neuraminidase from both influenza a and b concerned with release of the virus from infected cells are effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza but have to be given within 48 h of onset for apparent clinical benefit they are expensive and are best used on those most at risk of serious illness  those at the extremes of life they are also effective against other influenza a virus subtypes including avian influenza a h5n1 while either zanamivir given by inhaler or oseltamivir given orally can be used for prophylaxis of h5n1 influenza disease given the potential for dissemination of this virus beyond the respiratory tract the systemically active oseltamivir is the preferred option for treatment however experience with human cases of h5n1 avian influenza has shown that resistance develops rapidly and may be a major problem in widespread prophylactic or therapeutic use these drugs are not active on other respiratory viruses even those with viral neuraminidases generally the management of viral respiratory infections is essentially symptomatic and is dealt with elsewhere chapter 11 antibiotics are not routinely indicated for viral respiratory infections unless secondary bacterial superinfection occurs the atypical bacterial infections mentioned above q fever mycoplasmosis and chlamydiosis are amenable to antibiotic therapy tribavirin given as an aerosol inhalation is claimed to reduce the severity of rsv infection in infants but this remains controversial it is a very expensive drug but may be life-saving in those with congenital heart andor lung damage for whom rsv infection may be the final insult which pushes them into heart or lung failure tribavirin may have some effect in influenza but the evidence is minimal it has also been used in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome but again the evidence of efficacy is minimal aciclovir given iv is effective in the treatment of varicella or herpes simplex infections of the respiratory tract in the immunocompromised patient it should also be used in an immunocompetent patient usually an adult with varicella pneumonia ganciclovir and foscarnet are useful in cytomegalovirus infection in the immunosuppressed but a detailed discussion of this problem is beyond the scope of this chapter with the cells of the target organ immediately accessible to viruses it is proving difficult to produce effective vaccines to respiratory tract viruses39 other than in measles which has a systemic phase vaccines have had only limited success in the tropics even the measles vaccine has limitations because much of the impact of this virus on morbidity and mortality is during infancy and existing measles vaccines are not effective at inducing immunity in the presence of passive maternal antibody newer measles vaccines including one using canarypox virus as a vector have been explored but not yet adopted a second dose of conventional vaccine has also been suggested but cost makes this impractical in many countries influenza vaccine is used for persons at high risk eg patients with underlying heart respiratory or immunocompromising diseases patients on dialysis the elderly and contains antigens from two current influenza a subtypes h3n2 and h1n1 and from influenza b the constituents are modified as the prevalent strains vary the conventional influenza vaccine is formalin-killed egg-grown virus and has provided useful protection particularly in the elderly and those with pre-existing lung damage in whom even minimal protection may be enough to prevent death an alternative approach of a live attenuated vaccine containing cold-adapted influenza strains has shown some efficacy and such vaccines are now available the possible emergence of an h5n1 avian strain adapted to man has stimulated research into new ways to produce vaccines eg using reverse genetics or a disabled adenovirus as a vector for influenza antigens and for new antiviral drugs phase 23 clinical trials with such h5n1 candidate vaccines are in progress and have shown that the conventional approaches used in seasonal vaccines are poorly immunogenic with the avian h5 haemagglutinin therefore novel adjuvants and whole virus vaccines are now being tried in mathematical simulations of a new pandemic vaccines have been shown to be the intervention with the greatest public health impact but until the virus does adapt we do not know whether any of these novel approaches will be effective in controlling a pandemic an experimental enteric coated vaccine to adenovirus 14 was developed for use in the us army to combat epidemics in recruit camps but has found no application elsewhere prevention of rsv severe measles and varicella in susceptible immunocompromised or severely malnourished contacts may also be achieved by passive immunization there is evidence that humanized mouse antibodies or hyperimmune gamma-globulin may give some protection from or reduce the severity or duration of rsv infections in the more vulnerable eg premature babies but these preparations are very expensive and their use should be confined to those in whom infection will be life-threatening on standard management40 normal human gamma globulin is effective in preventingattenuating measles if administered within 3 days of contact for the prophylaxis of varicella high-titre varicella-zoster human immune globulin zig must be used maximum protection from severe disease but not from infection follows administration within 48 h of contact but some benefit may accrue if given within 10 days of exposure respiratory infections are very common throughout the world and are worse where social conditions are inadequate much childhood respiratory tract disease is either totally due to viruses or is virus-initiated and the same viruses appear to be involved in all regions tropical or temperate epidemiological data are incomplete everywhere but more so for the poorer parts of the world and come mostly from hospitalized patients nevertheless rsv is a universal childhood pathogen found everywhere it has been sought the numbers of virologically confirmed diagnoses each year most them in patients in hospital in the newcastle and tyneside area in the uk population about 1 million and from hong kong island population about 07 million are remarkably similar 500600 and 500700 cases respectively there are likely to be many more in the crowded cities of india china the philippines brazil and elsewhere the effects of rsv and other viruses are exacerbated by overcrowding malnutrition air pollution poor sanitation minimal medical care etc a pandemic of influenza a similar to the one that swept the world in 19189 will be a major health problem whether and when it may happen is unpredictable but current preparative measures may help to reduce its impact respiratory disease like diarrhoea results in significant morbidity and mortality in the developing world has significant economic consequences and will require an enormous commitment of resources to abate viruses and bacteria are both involved and there are few effective vaccines at present  zoonoses stuart levin lee goldman andrew schafer i   zoonoses are classically though not without controversy defined as infections or diseases naturally transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals there are approximately 1400 human pathogens of which about 800 species are zoonotic of the approximate 180 emerging or reemerging pathogens in the past 3 decades 130 are known to be zoonotic with a disproportionate number of the new zoonoses being caused by rna viruses as a recent editorial states this is a microbial world that humans are barely allowed to live in and nothing microbes do or become should surprise us we have little ability to predict how an emerging zoonotic pathogen will act most zoonotic pathogens like rabies enter a human and cause disease but in these cases humans are dead-end hosts and are unlikely to transmit the disease to others less commonly pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv or recombinant swine h1n1 enter the human population with great difficulty but are then successfully transmitted to cause global epidemics solely from human-to-human transfer the recent emphasis on emerging infections which are predominantly zoonoses and the potential for new pandemics markedly enhance the need for human medicine to be integrated with veterinary medicine and veterinary research during the course of evolution humans have sought the company of vertebrates for many reasons including their companionship as pets the more than 100 million dogs and cats in the united states facilitate the transmission of more than 250 different infectious species and cause more than 1 million bite injuries each year almost all arthropod-transmitted infectious agents acquired from vertebrates in the united states are due to either ticks or mosquitoes ticks are the more common villain and lyme disease is the most common arthropod-transmitted infectious disease in the united states not all arthropod-transmitted diseases are zoonotic for instance arthropod-transmitted infections such as west nile fever schistosoma japonicum and trypanosoma rhodesiense are zoonoses whereas schistosoma mansoni trypanosoma gambiense wuchereria bancrofti onchocerca volvulus and vivax malaria are not these non-zoonoses cause more than a billion infections per year are transferred from human to human and do not depend on vertebrate reservoirs human infestations with ectoparasites are not considered zoonoses the risk of contracting a zoonosis is increased by direct animal contact in meat handlers poachers hunters exotic animal smugglers and international travelers by exposure to and inhalation of infectious air particles by insect bites contact with previously infected human blood products and contact with and ingestion of infectious agents transmitted by animal-contaminated water and by insufficiently cooked meat eggs dairy products and fish raw shellfish which are the garbage filters of the ocean can transmit at least 25 different infectious or toxic diseases to humans but shellfish are invertebrates and such diseases are not zoonoses ticks can introduce more than one pathogen while feeding lyme disease ehrlichiosis and babesiosis can all be transmitted by a single tick bite threats from mosquito bites include st louis encephalitis and west nile virus patrons of petting zoos pet owners farmers hunters laboratory researchers cave explorers hikers and veterinarians among others are at higher risk for a zoonosis than is the general population infectious agents transmitted by these routes from animal sources essentially include members of all microbial classes viruses and prions bacteria and rickettsia fungi helminths and protozoa immunocompromised hosts such as splenectomized patients transplant recipients patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids and pregnant women and their fetuses are at higher risk for clinical disease when exposed to these various infectious agents chagas disease a protozoal infection is a zoonosis in south america but is not endemic to the united states however immigration from latin america has led to an estimated 300000 persons with trypanosoma cruzi infection usually subclinical in the united states and the potential for transmission of the infection through blood or organ donations leishmania donovani is almost always a small-animal reservoir zoonosis but in india it has set up shop with just human-to-human insect transfer as the world shrinks warms flattens and remains in conflict new infectious diseases seem inevitable and previously rare ones are seen in unexpected places table 336-1
 because of global warming human intrusion into previously underexplored or never-explored sites world travel deforestation and the increasing threat of biologic terrorism or warfare increasing urbanization intermingling of humans and domestic animals and lack of adequate sanitation can dramatically increase the incidence and severity of epidemic infectious disease zoonoses can manifest as a variety of clinical syndromes including respiratory disease table 336-2
 central nervous system disease table 336-3

 emerging zoonotic infectious diseases include nipah virus and hendra virus encephalitis hantavirus pneumonia and hantavirus fever with renal failure the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars west nile encephalitis which spread coast to coast in the united states over 3 years and is now apparently a permanent resident monkeypox an outbreak in the upper midwest was caused by pet prairie dogs leishmania mexicana in texas and at least 8 to 10 newly identified tick-borne rickettsial spotted fevers worldwide including the flea-borne rickettsia felis in california avian or bird flu h5n1 sars monkeypox h1n1 swine influenza and west nile fever have recently exposed the fragility of our world village nevertheless exotic zoonoses remain a less frequent cause of fever in travelers than the well-known ordinary gastrointestinal and pulmonary pathogens nonanimal-associated environment- or travel-related infectious diseases can be confused with zoonoses the vast majority of clinical diseases caused by legionella pneumophila entamoeba histolytica giardia lamblia burkholderia pseudomallei chromobacterium violaceum aeromonas hydrophila and airborne fungi such as blastomyces dermatitidis coccidioides immitis and histoplasma capsulatum are acquired through environmental exposure and are only rarely related to animal hosts sporothrix schenckii almost always an environmentally acquired pathogen stemming from vegetation-related injuries has also been transmitted from cats with draining cutaneous ulcers to owners and animal handlers histoplasmosis has been acquired by explorers spelunkers in caves contaminated by bat guano other noninfectious toxin-induced diseases acquired from animals and insects such as tick paralysis and the fish toxin illnesses do not represent zoonoses unfortunately some descriptive disease titles can be misleading to clinicians and interfere with reaching the correct diagnosis the transmission of tick-borne rocky mountain spotted fever actually occurs much more commonly in the southeastern united states than in the rocky mountains and has even occurred in the middle of new york city urban new york city continues to be a major source of rickettsialpox where it was first described 60 years ago vegetarians and other strict nonpork-eating persons have been seriously infected with the pig tapeworm taenia solium as a result of fecal contamination of food from infected human food-handlers until recently human influenza a was not well recognized as a zoonosis however interspecies spread and mixing of swine avian h5n1 virus and human influenza viruses can occur in unique geographic areas such as southern china or mexico 2009 novel h1n1 virus where dense concentrations of ducks pigs and people cohabit viral incubation of the three influenza species in the pig with a reassortment of antigens and subsequent spread of virulent new influenza strains to humans can lead to massive influenza pandemics that in sheer numbers billions surpass any past epidemics of smallpox or plague initially hiv-1 and hiv-2 were transmitted as simian immunodeficiency viruses from chimpanzees and mangabey primates respectively to humans as with influenza the subsequent 33 million and counting cases of hiv no longer require an animal reservoir for continuing transmission because these pandemics of aids and influenza now spread human to human without the help of the initiating animal host the world health organization no longer considers them zoonoses leprosy an illness of biblical notoriety transmitted from human to human is endemic in at least three animal species including the armadillo this animal has rarely been implicated in the transmission of leprosy to humans in the united states despite the large number of zoonoses described clinicians evaluating an individual patient usually need to consider only a limited number of historical details to arrive at an appropriate differential diagnosis1a history of direct contact with animals or animal products animal bites arthropod exposure and food ingestion may offer clues to the correct cause2the patients travel history must be considered because a number of zoonoses are still quite limited in geographic distribution3occupational and recreational high-risk activities must be ascertained4the patients clinical manifestations course and organ involvement are used to focus on the most likely cause see table 336-2 table 336-3 table 336-4 table 336-55though neither specific nor sensitive the inoculation nodule eschar tache noire chancre necrotic ulcer with or without fever rash or local lymphadenopathy is the only general clue from the physical examination that might alert the physician to a zoonosis when the history does not6significant unilateral hilar adenopathy in the presence of acute pneumonia can be a clue to anthrax plague or tularemia
treatment the approach to treatment of the various zoonoses is presented in their respective chapters
 guidelines have been published to help prevent nosocomial transmission of zoonotic diseases preventive measures to decrease infection in compromised hosts include the routine immunization of pets neutering of pets use of caution when handling pet fomites rigorous handwashing practices and avoidance of ingesting undercooked meat fish shellfish and eggs isolation is recommended for anthrax andes hantavirus disease herpes b monkeypox q fever rabies plague sars influenza and the hemorrhagic fever illnesses caused by argentine bolivian crimean-congo ebola lassa and marburg viruses the prognosis of zoonoses varies widely but a number of these disease have very high case-fatality rates table 336-6

 back et al 2002 coates et al 2001 these supercomplexes maintain the structure of mitochondria and regulate their functions tatsuta et al 2005 phbs protect newly imported proteins from degradation by the m-aaa mitochondrial atpases associated with diverse cellular activities protease steglich et al 1999 promote mitochondrial protein synthesis he et al 2012 maintain the organization and copy number of mitochondrial dna mtdna kasashima et al 2008 and act as a chaperones for newly synthesized proteins of the mitochondrial complex i nijtmans et al 2000 2002 and the gtpase optic atrophy 1 opa1 during mitochondrial fission and morphogenesis merkwirth et al 2008 phb1 also interacts with the adaptor protein p66shc a major mediator of stress-induced apoptosis madireddi 2006 this adaptor protein is activated by uvc h2o2 and reactive oxygen species ros and induces the generation of ros in mitochondria leading to apoptosis gertz et al 2008 it remains unclear whether phb1 modulates this proapoptotic response nevertheless it is tempting to speculate that p66shc is involved in the cytoprotective activities of phbs and their ligands particularly against oxidative stress bernard et al 2011 fahrig et al 2005 kathiria et al 2012a liu et al 2009b ribeiro et al 2012a phb2 is also regulated by a second messenger sphingosine-1-phosphate s1p which controls diverse physiological processes through several targets s1p binds with high affinity to phb2 and thereby maintains the integrity of the mitochondrial respiration machinery strub et al 2011 this process is involved in the preconditioning protection of the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury gomez et al 2011 phbs are not limited to mitochondria they are also found in the nucleus the endoplasmic reticulum the plasma membrane and macrophage phagosomes garin et al 2001 where they modulate many aspects of cell physiology their roles are extremely complex partly because phbs are themselves regulated by several tyrosine and serine phosphorylations o-glcnac modifications palmitoylations transamidations and tyrosine nitrosylations mishra et al 2010 phb1 interacts physically with the second messenger pip3 and phb2 interacts with s1p ande and mishra 2009 strub et al 2011 each posttranslational modification of the phbs has substantial effects on their activity figure 2
 one of the best-documented examples is akt phosphorylation of phb1 at thr258 which blocks its interaction with shp12 and facilitates akt signaling ande and mishra 2009 shp12 is a phosphatase that facilitates akt signaling and enhances insulin signaling additionally the phosphorylation of phb1 at thr258 is necessary for the activation of c-raf raf-1 by ras chiu et al 2013 rajalingam et al 2005 established that the activation of c-raf by ras requires the heterodimerization of phospho-phb1thr258 with c-raf the phosphorylation of phb1 at thr258 in the plasma membrane of cancer cells activates pi3kakt and c-raferk pathways which promote proliferation and metastasis chiu et al 2012 by contrast insulin-receptor-induced phosphorylation of phb1 at tyr114 promotes its heterodimerization with the phosphatase shp1 and blocks akt signaling ande et al 2009a it has been suggested that the regulation of phb1 by transforming growth factor  tgf- is responsible for the dual effect of this cytokine in prostate cancer zhu et al 2010 in the early stage of tumorigenesis tgf- acts as a tumor suppressor but subsequently it promotes metastatic spread during cancer progression the binding of tgf- to its receptor triggers the c-rafmekerk pathway and also activates smad 23 or smad 15 thereby causing opposite effects figure 2 erk activates protein kinase c  pkc- which leads to the phosphorylation of phb1 and consequently to cell survival and invasion however smad signaling also upregulates 14-3-3 protein which inhibits pkc- leading to a hypophosphorylation of phb1 that promotes apoptosis the activity of phb2 is regulated by serine and threonine phosphorylation in particular at ser91 and tyr248 ross et al 2008 sun et al 2011 calciumcalmodulin-dependent protein kinase iv camkiv phosphorylates phb2 at ser91 impeding its ability to repress the transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2 mef2 sun et al 2011 the consequence of this phosphorylation of phb2 on the activity of other transcription factors has not been reported phb2 also inhibits circadian transcription by interacting with casein kinase 1  ck1 kategaya et al 2012 phbs have been detected at the surface of platelets microglial cells wintachai et al 2012 endothelial cells in adipose tissue kolonin et al 2004 paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells patel et al 2010 intestinal epithelial cells sharma and qadri 2004 and activated t cells yurugi et al 2012 in platelets phb1 and phb2 interact directly with protease-activated receptor 1 par1 to promote platelet aggregation zhang et al 2012 the physiological role of phb1 at the surface of microglial cells and endothelial cells of adipose tissue remains elusive but it has been demonstrated that phb1 at the surface of cancer cells is involved in resistance to paclitaxel patel et al 2010 a virulence antigen of salmonella typhi the causative agent of typhoid interacts with phb1 and phb2 at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells resulting in downregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk cascade and inhibition of early inflammatory responses patel et al 2010 similarly considerable proportions of total phb1 and phb2 are located on the surface of activated t cells where they contribute to the activation of erk induced by t cell activation yurugi et al 2012 phb1 is also present in human serum embedded in lipid droplets where it interacts with the complement protein c3 to promote innate immunity mishra et al 2007 interestingly serum phb1 and phb2 concentrations were found to be significantly elevated in patients with colorectal cancer suggesting that they may serve as a biomarker for this type of cancer mengwasser et al 2004 a brief presentation of the interactions between phbs and other proteins is provided in table 1
for a list of other putative partners of phb1 see table s1 both phb1 and phb2 are involved in growth resistance to chemotherapy and metastasis through several mechanisms including activation of the ras-c-raf-mek-erk pathway modulation of tgf- signaling and transcriptional regulation indeed phb1 interacts with the transcription factor p53 in the nucleus of cancer cells to increase its transcriptional activity fusaro et al 2003 p53 is a tumor suppressor that controls the cell cycle apoptosis genomic stability and angiogenesis chander et al 2010 2011 fusaro et al 2003 joshi et al 2007 a component of ubiquitin ligase complexes skp2b which is overexpressed in many breast cancers interacts with both phb1 and phb2 to promote their degradation chander et al 2010 2011 umanskaya et al 2007 because phb1 acts as an activator fusaro et al 2003 and chaperone chander et al 2011 for p53 this depletion in phb1 leads to an attenuated activity of p53 in cancer cells overexpressing skp2b and consequently promotes their survival phb1 is also an important regulator of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein rb and its family members p107 and p130 wang et al 1999b these proteins bind and inhibit e2f transcription factors leading to cell-cycle arrest phb1 represses the activity of e2f transcription factors by interacting with several proteins including rb histone deacetylases hdacs and the nucleosome-remodeling proteins brg-1 and brm wang et al 1999a 1999b 2002 a growing body of evidence indicates that the cellular localization of phbs is a determinant of their function especially in cancer cells patel et al 2010 found that phb1 is overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells that are resistant to taxoids doxorubicin and etoposide they also demonstrated that the redirection of phb1 from the cytoplasm to the cell surface is critical for drug resistance and their work suggests that cell-surface phb1 may serve as a biomarker of chemoresistance in cancer patients in normal epithelial breast cells phb1 is located primarily in the mitochondria but in invasive and noninvasive breast cancer cells it is mainly confined to the nucleus suggesting that phb1 localization is associated with tumorigenesis chen et al 2011 confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that phbs colocalize with the proto-oncogenes c-myc c-fos p53 and rb in neuroblastoma sk-n-sh cells li et al 2011 treatment with the anticancer drug camptothecin leads to phb1 and p53 being exported from the nucleus to the mitochondria of breast cancer cell lines fusaro et al 2003 this camptothecin-induced translocation of phb1 which is dependent on the protein transporter crm-1 occurs preferentially in transformed cell lines and not in untransformed or primary cells a peptide corresponding to the nuclear export signal of phb1 prevented the export of phb1 resulting in the protection of cells from apoptosis indicating that the translocation of phb1 from the nucleus to the mitochondria contributes to its tumor-suppressive effects rastogi et al 2006b one mechanism by which the intracellular location of phbs is controlled involves the signaling protein big3wdr5 which traps phb2 in the cytoplasm and consequently stimulates the estrogen-signaling pathway in the hormone-related growth of breast cancer cells kim et al 2009 beyond these activities of phbs as proteins the 3-utr of phb1 messenger rna mrna was found to suppress both the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro and the growth of breast tumors in xenografted mice in vivo manjeshwar et al 2003 this was the first demonstration that an rna molecule can function as a tumor suppressor in human breast cancer the tumor-suppressor activity of phb1 and its mrna 3-utr is further supported by the discovery that the oncogenic microrna-27a mir-27a which is upregulated in many cancers chhabra et al 2010 targets the 3-utr of phb1 and downregulates phb1 in human gastric adenocarcinoma liu et al 2009a fletcher et al 2012 demonstrated that mir-27a is upregulated by androgen receptor in prostate cancer resulting in reduced phb1 mrna and protein levels and increased cancer cell growth interestingly adding phb1 to cells overexpressing mir-27a blocked mir-27a-induced growth demonstrating that the oncogenic activity of mir-27a strongly involves phb1 signaling in prostate cancer an important question that needs to be examined is why phbs display both anti- and protumorigenic roles in cancers summarized in table 2
 this dichotomy may reflect the heterogeneity of cancer cell types which are manifested by an alteration of different signaling pathways consequently the regulation of transcription translation and posttranslational modification of phbs probably depends on the cancerous cell type involved these posttranslational events eg phosphorylation sumoylation o-glcnac modification palmitoylation and transamidation modulate both the subcellular localization of phbs and their downstream effects on proliferation and survival of cells on the cell surface phb1 promotes chemoresistance but on the inner face of the plasma membrane it can contribute to the oncogenic activation of c-raf however it is tempting to speculate that in the nucleus phb1 displays antitumorigenic activity due to its action on p53 rb p107 p130 and components of the mammalian replication machinery additional studies are required to decipher the roles played by signaling and intracellular localization of phbs in oncogenesis many studies have indicated that phbs protect cells from oxidative stress which is due to an excessive production or an impaired elimination of ros jones 2008 it is closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and is an important component of the etiology of cancers inflammatory cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes mellitus in view of the central role of phbs in maintaining the normal structure and function of mitochondria it is unsurprising that phbs can alleviate the deleterious effect of oxidative stress many stresses in particular oxidative stress upregulate phb1 and phb2 to promote cell survival indeed phb1 expression is enhanced in neurons by various stresses including electrical stimulation hypoxia-ischemia oxygen-glucose deprivation zhou et al 2012 exercise-induced neuroplasticity ding et al 2006 injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine park et al 2010 and schizophrenia-induced oligodendrocyte dysfunction bernstein et al 2012 phb1 is also upregulated in the liver of steatohepatitis patients tsutsumi et al 2009 in fetal rabbit lung after exposure to hyperoxic conditions henschke et al 2006 in pancreatic -cells after ethanol intoxication lee et al 2010b and in cardiac cells after ischemic-hypoxic preconditioning kim et al 2006 muraguchi et al 2010 or chronic restraint stress liu et al 2004 this cytoprotectant response involves the translocation of phb1 from the nucleus and the cytoplasm to mitochondria in pancreatic -cells lee et al 2010b in the retina and retinal epithelium lee et al 2010a and in ovarian granulosa cells chowdhury et al 2007 figure s2 sripathi et al 2011 suggested that the localization and trafficking of phbs are determined by the modulation of their binding to specific lipids indeed strong binding of phb1 to cardiolipin was shown to correlate with the localization of phb1 within mitochondria in transformed epithelial cells after an oxidative stress by contrast under normal conditions in these cells phb1 binds strongly to pip3 but not to cardiolipin overexpression of phb1 protects pancreatic -cells ovarian granulosa cells and cardiomyocytes from apoptosis induced by ethanol ceramide staurosporine serum withdrawal and oxidative stress-induced injury consistent with phb1 having a cytoprotective role chowdhury et al 2007 2011 lee et al 2010b liu et al 2009b 
merkwirth et al 2012 recently described a critical role of phb2 in the survival of neurons neuron-specific deletion of phb2 in the mouse forebrain impaired mitochondrial architecture leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and filament formation this phenotype was accompanied by severe behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions that were reminiscent of alzheimers disease the details of the mechanisms of this cytoprotection remain poorly documented the only other actors that have been identified as being involved are s1p and stat3 s1p protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion damage by directly activating phb2 thereby regulating respiration and cytochrome oxidase subunit iv assembly and decreasing the hearts susceptibility to opening of the permeability transition pore ptp gomez et al 2011 interleukin-6 il-6 increases phb1 levels through phosphorylation of the transcription factor stat3 to promote the survival of intestinal cells and cardiomyocytes gratia et al 2012 theiss et al 2007b in intestinal epithelial cells in vivo phb1 interacts with stat3 to modulate stat3-mediated apoptosis kathiria et al 2012b in cardiomyocytes il-6-induced upregulation of phb1 is central to the cardioprotective effects of il-6 against oxidative stress gratia et al 2012 importantly phosphorylated stat3 protects cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress by stimulating respiration and inhibiting the ptp within mitochondria and not through a transcriptional effect boengler et al 2010 it would be interesting to determine whether phb1 modulates this mitochondrial action of stat3 inflammatory bowel diseases ibds are characterized by strong oxidative stresses associated with downregulated antioxidant enzymes in the intestinal mucosa lih-brody et al 1996 several studies in vitro and in vivo have indicated that phb1 alleviates intestinal inflammation and promotes the survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells phb1 binds to a salmonella typhi antigen to inhibit the inflammatory response to s typhi infection sharma and qadri 2004 phb1 expression is abnormally low during ulcerative colitis and crohns disease the two most common forms of ibd hsieh et al 2006 theiss et al 2007a yeo et al 2006 due to an overstimulation of tumor necrosis factor  tnf- signaling in the inflamed colon theiss et al 2009a this downregulation of phb1 increases ros signaling and tnf--induced autophagy promoting inflammation in patients with ibd kathiria et al 2012a interestingly transgenic mice overexpressing phb1 in intestinal epithelial cells exhibit reduced proinflammatory nuclear factor b nf-b signaling in the colonic mucosa after treatment with tnf- demonstrating that phb1 plays a critical role in inflammation a detailed examination of this mechanism of action revealed that phb1 inhibits tnf--induced translocation of nf-b by downregulating the expression of importin 3 a protein involved in nf-b nuclear import theiss et al 2009a in an in vivo model of ibd phb1 transgenic mice exhibited lower oxidative stress and colitis than wild-type mice theiss et al 2009b this cytoprotective effect is due to the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 nrf2 a transcriptional activator of antioxidant responses further evidence that phb1 is a putative therapeutic target for treating ibd comes from the observations that adenovirus-directed administration by enema and nanoparticle-based colonic delivery of phb1 effectively enhanced the levels of phb1 at the surface of colonic epithelial cells and alleviated colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate theiss et al 2011 
picard et al 2013 recently demonstrated that phb1 accumulates in the nucleus of osteoarthritic chondrocytes where it represses the expression of the transcription factor pitx1 suggesting an involvement of phb1 in the etiology of osteoarthritis in addition to phb1 phb2 is also involved in inflammation indeed heterozygous phb2 were shown to be more sensitive to liver insults and inflammatory aggressions than wild-type animals confirming a cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory role of phb2 in liver snchez-quiles et al 2012 
lucas et al 2013 recently discovered how phb1 and phb2 induce an immune response in b cells the interaction of cd86 with phbs was shown to induce the phosphorylation of ib phospholipase c2 and protein kinase cii leading to the nuclear translocation of nf-b p65 into the nucleus and the subsequent transcription of oct-2 and igg1 
ande and mishra 2009 and ande et al 2009a established that phb1 is a key regulator of insulin signaling and adipocyte differentiation indeed phb1 is directly phosphorylated by the insulin receptor to promote insulin signaling and block akt signaling whereas phosphorylation of phb1 by akt has the opposite effect interestingly phb1 is not only phosphorylated but is also conjugated to o-linked -n-acetylglucosamine in myoblast cells in response to insulin and high glucose this glucose-induced o-glcnac modification and phosphorylation of phb1 may be associated with insulin resistance modification and tyrosine phosphorylation of phb ande et al 2009b gu et al 2011 phb1 inhibits pyruvate carboxylase and decreases insulin-stimulated oxidation of glucose and fatty acid in adipocytes implying that it has a role in promoting lipid accumulation vessal et al 2006 crosslinking experiments showed that phb1 associates with pyruvate carboxylase and eps 15 homology domain protein 2 ehd2 suggesting that phb1 shuttles between the extracellular space and the mitochondria by a mechanism involving lipid rafts and ehd2 recently ande et al 2012 demonstrated that treatment of preadipocytes with insulin or a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  ppar agonist upregulates phb1 thereby promoting preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes remarkably overexpression of phb1 was sufficient to induce adipogenesis phb1 on the cell surface is also a marker of adipose vasculature and may be a possible therapeutic target for obesity see below several recent studies demonstrated that the internalization of some viruses involves phbs for instance phb1 interacts with chikungunya virus wintachai et al 2012 phb2 interacts with dengue virus kuadkitkan et al 2010 and both phb1 and phb2 interact with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov cornillez-ty et al 2009 phb1 and phb2 also interact with the hiv-1 glycoprotein to promote replicative spread in nonpermissive cells emerson et al 2010 interestingly recombinant capsid protein vp1 rvp1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus dephosphorylates akt and phospho-phb ttr258 in lipid rafts to downregulate c-raferk signaling and inhibit metastasis of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo chiu et al 2012 moreover using high-throughput mass spectrometry jang et al 2012 discovered that lipoteichoic acid a major virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria binds to phb2 implicating phb2 in host immune responses to infections flavaglines have a unique cyclopentabbenzofuran skeleton ebada et al 2011 ribeiro et al 2012b rocaglamide the first of these compounds to be described was isolated more than 30 years ago by king et al 1982 from medicinal plants of the genus aglaia meliaceae in southeast asia since then 100 other flavaglines including rocaglaol and silvestrol have been identified figure 3
a figure s3 although flavaglines display a myriad of pharmacological effects due to their anticancer anti-inflammatory neuroprotective and cardioprotective properties it is the anticancer properties that have attracted the most attention from scientists ebada et al 2011 ribeiro et al 2012b at concentrations in the low-nanomolar range flavaglines inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells are not toxic to normal cells hausott et al 2004 ribeiro et al 2012a su et al 2006 thuaud et al 2009 2011 zhu et al 2007 and show no sign of toxicity in mice bernard et al 2011 cencic et al 2009 lee et al 1998 thuaud et al 2009 zhu et al 2009 king et al 1982 were the first to demonstrate the antileukemic activity of rocaglamide in a mouse model subsequently ohse et al 1996 established that flavaglines strongly inhibit protein synthesis and lee et al 1998 demonstrated that these compounds delay the growth of human breast cancer cells in athymic mice however because the tumors were not eradicated these investigations were interrupted since then with the development of targeted therapies approaches to the development of cytostatic compounds have changed radically gutierrez et al 2009 as a consequence there is now a renewed interest in flavaglines as potential anticancer agents although flavaglines have shown significant anticancer effects in mouse models of cancer alinari et al 2012 cencic et al 2009 hwang et al 2004 king et al 1982 lee et al 1998 lucas et al 2009 meurer-grimes et al 2002 thuaud et al 2011 their most promising potential is associated with their ability to enhance the in vivo efficacy of other anticancer drugs and in particular to relieve the resistance of tumors to chemotherapies indeed flavaglines were shown to enhance doxorubicin chemosensitivity in several mouse lymphoma models bordeleau et al 2008 cencic et al 2009 zhu et al 2009 importantly flavaglines did not display any overt sign of toxicity in mice in these studies consistent with previous observations very recently using affinity chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry polier et al 2012 identified phb1 and phb2 as the direct targets of flavaglines the binding of flavaglines to phbs inhibits ras-c-raf-mek-erk signaling and such signaling is essential for the survival of cancer cells figure 3b c-raf needs to interact with phbs to be phosphorylated by ras and thus participate in signaling rajalingam et al 2005 the binding of flavaglines to phbs prevents this interaction both in vitro and in vivo knockdown of either phb1 or phb2 with small interfering rna sirna mimicked the effects of flavaglines through inhibition of cap-dependent translation and an arrest of cell-cycle progression via a depletion of cyclin d3 cdk4 cdk6 and cdc25a moreover rocaglamide strongly depleted phb1 and phosphorylated c-raf at the plasma membrane suggesting that the relocation of phbs to the membrane is involved in the mode of action of flavaglines these various observations support the idea that flavaglines exert their anticancer effects through their action on phbs these findings are of particular interest because we now have evidence that ras-c-raf-erk constitutes an overactivated pathway in many human cancers and that this pathway is a promising target for treatments in oncology matallanas et al 2011 maurer et al 2011 bleumink et al 2011 showed that this inhibition of c-raf-erk signaling blocks cap-dependent protein synthesis indeed erk activates mnk1 which phosphorylates eif4e allowing cap-dependent synthesis to occur few proteins require phosphorylated eif4e for their synthesis and most of them are involved in oncogenesis angiogenesis and chemoresistance thus the in vivo anticancer effects of flavaglines seems to be a consequence of the inhibition of the synthesis of cyclins d1 and d3 cdk4 cdk6 cdc25a c-myc bcl-2 survivin mcl-1 the pim12 kinases vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and matrix metallopeptidase 9 mmp9 bordeleau et al 2008 cencic et al 2009 nasr et al 2013 polier et al 2012 schatz et al 2011 although inhibition of the ras-c-raf-erk signaling pathway may be involved in the flavagline-induced suppression of cap-dependent synthesis in cells bleumink et al 2011 it is more difficult to explain the observed inhibition of protein synthesis in vitro where c-raf mek and erk are absent this observation suggests either that another molecular target is involved in the inhibition of translation by flavaglines or that phbs interact with the translational machinery to control its activity flavaglines induce apoptosis in cancer cells through a myriad of mechanisms ribeiro et al 2012b involving cytochrome c mi et al 2006b zhu et al 2007 apoptosis-inducing factor thuaud et al 2009 caspase 12 thuaud et al 2009 and the mapks jnk and p38 zhu et al 2007 2009 whether these mechanisms involve phb1 and phb2 or another target remains to be determined the effect of flavaglines on phbs-interacting proteins other than c-raf is also an issue that needs to be examined silvestrol is the flavagline that has been the most studied in vivo for its anticancer properties alinari et al 2012 bordeleau et al 2008 cencic et al 2009 hwang et al 2004 kim et al 2007 mi et al 2006a robert et al 2009 schatz et al 2011 however the development of this compound is severely limited by its sensitivity to p-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance and its suboptimal absorption distribution metabolism and excretion adme characteristics gupta et al 2011 liu et al 2012 fortunately structure-activity relationship sar studies have established that the deletion of the methyl ester or the amide in position 2 results in compounds that escape this multidrug resistance without any loss of cytotoxicity figure s3 ribeiro et al 2012a thuaud et al 2009 2011 in addition to their anticancer effects flavaglines also display potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities indeed flavaglines at nanomolar concentrations act as immunosuppressors by inhibiting the production of interferon- tnf- il-2 and il-4 by t lymphocytes proksch et al 2005 this immunosuppression is mediated by activation of the mapks jnk and p38 which selectively inactivate nuclear factor of activated t cells nfat figure 3c it is still not known how flavaglines activate jnk and p38 at higher concentrations flavaglines also inhibit nf-b another transcription factor that is involved in inflammation baumann et al 2002 interestingly the synthetic flavagline imd-019064 inhibits nf-b signaling and displays potent in vitro anti-inflammatory effects that manifest as an inhibition of proinflammatory mediator release from astrocytes microglia and endothelial cells fahrig et al 2005 figure 3d more importantly imd-019064 protects dopaminergic neurons both in vitro and in vivo in models of parkinsons disease mpp-induced neurotoxicity and traumatic brain injury recent sar studies led to the identification of fl40 which provides greater neuroprotection in vitro than imd-019064 ribeiro et al 2012a the neuroprotective activity of flavaglines is currently being actively explored by the pharmaceutical company intermed discovery which has been developing imd-026259 figure 3a for the treatment of parkinsons disease these studies have prompted evaluations of the cytoprotective potential of flavaglines in other tissues the synthetic flavagline fl3 figure 3a which displays a potent cytotoxicity in cancer cells thuaud et al 2009 was shown to protect cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo against various stresses including anthracycline cardiotoxicity bernard et al 2011 the heart is extremely sensitive to the toxicity of anthracyclines such as doxorubicin these medicines are among the most effective anticancer drugs available and have antitumor activity against both hematopoietic and solid tumors unfortunately their clinical utility is markedly hampered by their cardiotoxicity which can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure minotti et al 2004 fl3 protects cardiomyocytes from the apoptosis induced by both doxorubicin and serum starvation bernard et al 2011 interestingly these stresses are of different natures doxorubicin causes an oxidative stress whereas serum starvation blocks the growth factor signaling that is necessary for cell survival mimicking an important component of myocardial ischemia treatment with fl3 significantly reduces mortality and attenuates both apoptosis and fibrosis in the hearts of doxorubicin-treated mice thus flavaglines may both enhance the anticancer efficacy of anthracyclines and alleviate their main adverse effect cardiotoxicity anthracyclines are central to cancer chemotherapies so the discovery of a new class of cardioprotective agents would be extremely valuable clinically and further studies to examine this therapeutic application are therefore warranted the cardioprotective effects of flavaglines are mediated through the phosphorylation of the small heat shock protein hsp27 figure 3e hsp27 is critical for protecting cells against many types of damage including the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin and exerts its effects in several ways including chaperone activity control of redox homeostasis and inhibition of apoptosis kostenko and moens 2009 whether phbs or another target is involved in this cardioprotective effect of flavaglines has not been examined although the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of flavaglines have not yet been demonstrated to be mediated through a binding to phbs it is unlikely that another target is involved indeed both their pharmacological effects and cytotoxicity in cancer cells occur at the same range of concentrations as far as we know no other natural product that possesses such a complex three-dimensional structure has been shown to bind to different classes of proteins with a comparably high affinity it would be useful to further evaluate this therapeutic application of flavaglines and elucidate the mechanisms involved it may seem odd than an anticancer drug can also display various cardio- or neuroprotective effects however there are precedents for example rapamycin derivatives erlich et al 2007 khan et al 2006 malagelada et al 2010 and hdac inhibitors are both cardio- and neuroprotectants in addition to having anticancer effects bush and mckinsey 2009 mai et al 2009 a first clue to understanding this paradox may be that phb1 is localized mainly in the mitochondria of normal cells and in the nucleus in cancer cells chen et al 2011 the translocation of phb1 from the nucleus and cytosol to mitochondria promotes survival in normal cells but apoptosis in cancer cells fusaro et al 2003 it is therefore tempting to suggest that the opposite behaviors of flavaglines in cancer and normal cells are the consequences of different intracellular localizations of phbs although many academic studies have demonstrated a therapeutic potential of flavaglines in preclinical models of cancers and inflammatory and cardiac diseases these compounds have not yet been examined in a clinical trial to our knowledge only two pharmaceutical companies intermed discovery and infinity pharmaceutical are currently developing flavaglines for the treatment of parkinsons disease and cancers respectively isolated from the japanese sea hare dolabella auricularia suenaga et al 2004 suenaga et al 1996 aurilide is a cyclic depsipeptide that displays a strong cytotoxicity at nanomolar and subnanomolar concentrations on a panel of cancer cell lines figure 4
a figure s4 work involving affinity chromatography identified phb1 as the molecular target of aurilide sato et al 2011 the binding of this toxin activates the proteolytic processing of the dynamin-like gtpase optic atrophy 1 opa1 which in turn triggers remodeling of the mitochondrial cristae leading to apoptosis this devastating effect on mitochondria probably explains the extreme toxicity of this compound which impedes its study in animal models and precludes its further development as a medicament in a quest to identify compounds that modulate skin pigmentation snyder et al 2005 screened a tagged-triazine library on unpigmented melanocytes figure 4b figure s5 they identified melanogenin as an inducer of pigmentation with an ec50 of 25 m this compound upregulates tyrosinase the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of melanin 
snyder et al 2005 conjugated melanogenin to an agarose support which enabled them to identify phb1 as the molecular target by affinity chromatography further biological investigations confirmed that phb1 is responsible for the induction of pigmentation immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed that phb1 was localized only in mitochondria which led these authors to suggest that the binding of melanogenin to phb1 may disrupt the interaction between phb1 and a transcriptional factor thereby causing its translocation to the nucleus and induction of the expression of tyrosinase the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis this study was the first to demonstrate and unravel the involvement of phb1 in the regulation of mammalian pigmentation although these discoveries may provide a basis for the development of novel cosmetics and drugs for the treatment of pigment disorders no further investigation in this direction has been reported recently wu and wu 2012 demonstrated that phb1 is enriched in lipid rafts in hacat keratinocytes after uvb irradiation and that this protects the cells against uvb-induced apoptosis these findings are consistent with the notion that phb1 contributes to protection of the skin against uvb 
kolonin et al 2004 and staquicini et al 2011 used phage display techniques to identify a peptide homologous to a region of annexin a2 that targets phb1 at the surface of the vascular endothelial cells of white adipose tissue figure 4c by fusion with a proapoptotic sequence they obtained adipotide ckggrakdc-gg-dklaklak2 a chimeric peptide that damages the vasculature of the adipose tissue and consequently disrupts the blood supply to adipocytes in obese mice adipotide induced a substantial loss of weight and normalized metabolism leading to a reversal of obesity without any adverse sign of toxicity surprisingly food intake was reduced suggesting that there is an unexpected relationship between the adipose tissue vasculature and the regulation of feeding behavior kim et al 2010 in obese rhesus monkeys 4 weeks of adipotide treatment led to a 28 reduction in body fat and also reduced food intake and improved the animals metabolic status ie reduced insulin resistance these findings have implications for the development of treatment for type 2 diabetes barnhart et al 2011 adipotide is currently being developed by the biotech company arrowhead research corporation and entered a phase i trial involving obese patients with prostate cancer in july 2012 because adipotide has a negative endocrine effect on tumor growth it is expected to slow tumor growth in these patients capsaicin is a component of hot chili peppers that inhibits the proliferation of many cancer cell lines using affinity chromatography fletcher et al 2012 demonstrated that capsaicin 011 mm binds to phb2 and that this binding induces a series of proapoptotic events in human myeloid leukemia cells including 1 the translocation of phb2 from mitochondria to the nucleus 2 the dissociation of phb2 from adenine nucleotide translocator 2 ant2 leading to a noncompetitive inhibition of ant activity and 3 the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol figure 4d the latter two effects could be caused by the depletion of phb2 in mitochondria which would compromise mitochondrial integrity and promote apoptosis capsaicin was used in these experiments at concentrations that are much too high to be therapeutically relevant but this work may constitute the basis for an optimization program to develop a clinically useful drug sulfonyl amidine a inhibits the osteoclastogenesis involved in bone remodeling with an ic50 of 18 m lee et al 2010c figure 4e chang et al 2011 used affinity chromatography to identify the molecular target involved in this process and found that this compound binds to phb1 and three other proteins which of these proteins is the relevant target involved in this antiresorptive activity remains to be determined while investigating how the toxic amyloid-42 a42 peptide is produced in alzheimers disease bettayeb et al 2012 observed that the adenine derivative aftin-4 promotes a42 production in neurons figure 4f aftin-4 was found to interact with three proteins related to neural degeneration phb1 voltage-dependent anion channel 1 vdac1 and mitofilin the dihydrooxazole choxa which displays some cytotoxicity with a gi50 of 72 m in b16f0 cells was shown to alkylate the asp40 of phb1 suggesting that it could be used as a chemical probe to analyze the structure of phb1 trzeciakiewicz et al 2011 figure 4g the regulation by phbs of cell survival apoptosis metabolism and inflammation makes these proteins promising therapeutic targets for novel treatments for cancer and neurodegenerative metabolic and inflammatory diseases their intracellular localization and their translocation in response to proapoptotic signals differ substantially between normal and cancer cells this divergence of behavior which is not fully understood may be exploited to develop therapeutic agents the phase i trial of adipotide for the treatment of obese patients with prostate cancer may be the first step on the road to developing phb ligands of clinical value the recent discovery that flavaglines target phbs warrants further studies of this class of anticancer and cytoprotective agent in addition to the ongoing exploration of the roles of phbs in physiology and physiopathology we anticipate that this field will stimulate research addressing other classes of phb ligands with original pharmacological properties over the last few years phbs have been found to interact with more than 60 other proteins to regulate a myriad of cellular events there is no doubt that in the coming years new partners and new cellular regulations will be uncovered an important issue will be to determine when the alterations of phb expression subcellular localization and signaling are involved in the etiology of not only cancers but also cardiac neurological inflammatory and metabolic diseases translating this knowledge into clinical applications may lead to the development of new medicines and biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis  influenza and viral respiratory

virus family orthomyxoviridae which includes influenzavirus a b and c6 influenza a and b cause most human infections6 most seasonal epidemics and all recognized pandemics in humans are due to influenza a influenza a viruses are characterized by their antigenicity according to hemagglutinin h and neuraminidase n proteins there are 16 h and 9 n subtypes6 all antigen subtypes circulate among avian species6 globally the most common circulating influenza a viruses from 1994 to 2005 included h3n2 906 h1n1 8 and h1n2 117 there is significant variability among seasons with h3n2-dominant years being worse than h1n1 years2 8
 influenza viruses have evolved mechanisms that promote antigenic variability point mutations in the h gene give rise to new influenza strains of the same h type termed antigenic drift
fig 77-2
3 in this context existing antibodies may fail to cover the new variant antigenic drift mandates modification of influenza vaccines annually3 a second mechanism known as antigenic shift is more dramatic and allows one influenza strain such as h3n2 to acquire a completely new h or n gene such as h1 or n1 resulting in a new virus such as h3n1 or h1n2 fig 77-3
 pandemic influenza results when the antigenic mutations are dramatically different from previously circulating strains this could occur by antigenic shift or by cross-species transmission of novel h- or n-type viruses3 the recent emergence of the highly pathogenic avian viruses h5n14 is discussed later influenza is one of the most common and important respiratory illnesses affecting all ages in temperate climates influenza exhibits a seasonal pattern with peak activity during the winter months december through march2 local outbreaks abate after 6 to 8 weeks2 influenza a predominates in most seasons but epidemics of influenza b occur9
 the virus is present in high titer in respiratory secretions and is transmitted as a small-particle aerosol generated by coughing and sneezing2 person-to-person spread by direct contact with respiratory secretions may also occur children are important as vectors for transmission to adult populations10 spread throughout the general population often includes nosocomial outbreaks in nursing homes and other closed communities1
 the severity of influenza epidemics varies among seasons depending upon the virulence and antigenicity of the predominant circulating strain and immune status of the population at risk the 1984-1985 influenza season was severe with an estimated 51000 iads in the united states compared to fewer than 8000 iads during the 1978-1979 season8 approximately 90 of deaths occur among the elderly in contrast to approximately 150 annual deaths in the united states in children under age 5 years8 influenza and serious complications of influenza are more common in the elderly age 65 years children under age 2 years adults or children with concurrent illness eg pulmonary cardiac metabolic residents of chronic care facilities and pregnant women2 11
 pandemics occur infrequently but can be devastating12 the most recent global pandemics included 1918-1919 spanish flu h1n1 responsible for up to 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide 1957-1958 asian flu h2n2 1 million deaths and 1968-1970 hong kong flu h3n2 700000 deaths4 given the considerable growth of the population worldwide and exponential growth in foreign travel over the past 50 years another pandemic could be catastrophic fig 77-4
 following an incubation period of 2 to 5 days symptom onset is generally abrupt distinguishing influenza from other viral respiratory infections fever is present in more than 90 of cases other symptoms include a dry nonproductive cough nasal congestion or rhinorrhea headache sore throat and constitutional complaints eg myalgias malaise fatigue prostration10 13 influenza is an important cause of respiratory illness in children10 most influenza infections in children are self-limited but influenza may be severe in young children age 2 years or those with chronic medical conditions2 influenza is associated with increased hospitalizations14 outpatient visits15 and health care costs15 in children in previously healthy individuals children or adults symptoms resolve spontaneously within 5 to 8 days the course may be protracted and complications more frequent in high-risk or immunocompromised patients2 16 17 primary influenza pneumonia characterized by diffuse interstitial infiltrates and severe hypoxemia is unusual except during pandemics or in individuals with specific risk factors2 secondary bacterial pneumonia may complicate influenza usually 7 to 21 days following resolution of the initial illness2 acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur with some influenza strains likely mediated by a virus-induced cytokine storm18
 serious nonrespiratory complications of influenza are rare but include encephalopathy pericarditis rhabdomyolysis and renal failure2 19 central nervous system complications are more common in children than adults19 reyes syndrome a severe neurologic complication of influenza in children has largely disappeared since the link between aspirin use and reyes syndrome was discovered20
 clinical features of influenza are nonspecific21 laboratory confirmation of influenza is necessary if infection control measures and treatment are to be optimized culture of respiratory secretions is the gold standard but can take 3 to 5 days and is expensive and often not available in an outpatient setting virus titers are high early in the illness but fall rapidly in adults in one study only 48 of hospitalized elderly persons with confirmed influenza had a positive culture21 commercialized kits allow rapid detection of influenza antigens in less than 1 hour with a sensitivity of 40 to 806 21 reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is more sensitive than viral cultures or antigen detection tests but is less readily available10 rapid diagnostic tests may be invaluable during epidemics in emergency departments and outpatient and inpatient settings the adamantanes block the influenza a virus m2 ion channel protein thereby preventing replication within infected cells these agents have no activity against influenza b2 22 fig 77-5
 in early studies both amantadine symmetrel licensed in 1966 and rimantadine flumadine licensed in 1993 were shown to be effective to treat22 25 or prevent22 uncomplicated infections due to sensitive influenza a amantadine or rimantadine are equally effective provided that the drug is administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms22 25 importantly resistance to adamantanes may emerge rapidly7 26 27 resistance to adamantanes is due to single amino acid substitutions within the viral m2 protein7 that confer cross-resistance to both agents22 26 although resistance to adamantanes among untreated individuals has remained low 1 through the 1990s7 resistance rates to influenza a viruses h3n2 h1n1 or h1n2 have skyrocketed within the past few years7 26 the increase in resistance was weighted heavily by isolates from asia7 28 by 2004-2005 rates of adamantane resistance in selected asian locales included 96 china 72 hong kong 42 singapore and 36 south korea27
 resistance to adamantanes has also escalated dramatically in north america7 by the 2005-2006 influenza season in the united states greater than 90 of isolates of influenza a h3n2 from the united states or canada submitted to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc were resistant to adamantanes27 in view of these extraordinarily high rates of resistance adamantanes should not be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza a in the united states29 currently adamantanes have little role to treat or prevent influenza oral oseltamivir tamiflu is approved to treat infections due to influenza a or b and for prophylaxis of influenza among persons greater than 1 year old oseltamivir is not approved for infants less than 1 year of age since studies are lacking in this age group23 for treating acute influenza the dose in adults or children greater than 12 years old is 75 mg twice daily for 5 days the dose is lower in children 1 to 12 years old adjusted for weight22 30 for prophylaxis the dose is 75 mg daily for 10 days22 30
 
early treatment with oral oseltamivir in patients with acute influenza a or b shortens the course and reduces complications in previously healthy children or adults and high-risk patients9 25 31 nais are efficacious only if administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms23 25 duration of symptoms is shortened by 1 to 2 days in patients receiving nais compared to placebo23 large studies in north america found that patients with ili treated with oseltamivir during the influenza seasons from 1999 to 2004 had lower rates of pneumonia hospitalizations or deaths within 30 days compared to untreated patients31 32
 in controlled randomized trials administration of oseltamivir as prophylaxis reduced the risk of influenza in unvaccinated healthy adults household contacts nursing home residents and the elderly30 33 oseltamivir prophylaxis was efficacious in a cohort of 45 hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients at high risk24 the use of oseltamivir during influenza outbreaks in nursing homes was associated with reductions in hospitalizations deaths and antibiotic use compared to patients receiving either amantadine or no therapy34
 zanamivir relenza is approved to treat infections due to influenza a or b and for prophylaxis of influenza in children greater than 5 years of age22 23 zanamivir is administered by a dry powder inhaler diskhaler delivered directly to the respiratory tract23 for treating acute influenza the dose is 10 mg twice daily for 5 days children or adults22 for prophylaxis eg contacts of index cases the dose is 10 mg once daily for 10 days22 zanamivir achieves high concentrations in the respiratory tract 1000 times the 50 inhibitory concentration for neuraminidase23 the inhibitory effect starts within 10 seconds23 these properties reduce the chance for emergence of resistant viruses the major drawback to zanamivir is the inability of young children or adults with neurologic or muscular deficits to use the diskhaler zanamivir 10 mg twice daily for 5 days is effective therapy for influenza a or b in adults and children age 5 years and has minimal toxicity22 the duration of symptoms was shorted by 1 to 25 days and complications were reduced provided zanamivir was initiated within 30 hours of the onset of symptoms22 inhaled zanamivir 10 mg once daily for 10 days was effective 55 to 80 as chemoprophylaxis of influenza in healthy adults and healthy household contacts children 5 years old or adults2 35
 adverse effects with nais are uncommon22 23 29 resistance to nais is rare36 37 38 but can arise by single amino acid substitutions at n or h residues39 mutations at n residues are more clinically relevant39 mutations in n that prevent oseltamivir from binding to the n active do not affect zanamivir37 resistance to oseltamivir was noted in 4 to 8 of children and less than 1 of adults after treatment with oseltamivir2 40 higher rates of oseltamivir-resistant mutants were detected in japan 18 in children treated with oseltamivir possibly reflecting subtherapeutic doses41 the recent epidemic of avian influenza a h5n1 infection in asia42 raises the possibility that nai-resistant mutants could emerge as a result of increasing exposure to oseltamivir43 importantly most oseltamivir-resistant isolates remain susceptible to zanamivir37
 vaccines are the cornerstone for control of influenza22 44 45 influenza vaccines are developed annually with input from the world health organization who and national authorities46 viruses must be reformulated annually since genetic mutations arise continuously in influenza viruses in a process termed antigenic drift
46 given the potential for pandemic influenza eg with the antigen shift or the avian h5n1 strain fig 77-7
12 the who has developed an action plan to increase vaccine supply46 however current technologies for developing vaccines ie egg-based manufacturing process are slow and existing supplies of vaccines would be inadequate in the face of a global pandemic12
 currently available influenza vaccines include the trivalent inactivated vaccines tivs and live attenuated influenza vaccine laiv47 both vaccines contain the predicted antigenic variants of influenza a h3n2 h1n1 and influenza b viruses3 the inactivated vaccine is administered intramuscularly laiv is given as an intranasal spray flumist medimmune3 tiv evokes a higher systemic response ie serum immunoglobulin g antibody response whereas laiv elicits a better immunoglobulin a mucosal response at the site where viruses enter the body3 in the united states tiv is approved for individuals greater than 6 months of age laiv is approved for healthy persons 5 to 49 years of age48 no vaccines are approved for infants under the age of 6 months provided the strains encompassed by the vaccine match the circulating epidemic strain inactivated vaccines provided 70 to 100 protection among healthy adults and 30 to 60 protection among the elderly or young children22 47 serum antibody responses to influenza vaccination may be blunted in the elderly immunocompromised individuals and preschool children22 in adults laiv may be less effective than tiv which may reflect reduced activity against influenza b viruses47
 influenza vaccination is beneficial in adults greater than 65 years old living in the community45 49 or nursing homes13 benefits of vaccination include lower mortality all causes hospitalizations and pneumonias2 45 49 further influenza vaccination reduced mortality hospitalizations and outpatient visits for patients less than 65 years of age with concurrent medical conditions50 additionally vaccination of health care workers is highly effective in protecting high-risk patients44 51 52
 influenza vaccination either tiv or laiv in healthy children reduces the incidence of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza and acute otitis media aom53 54 55 vaccination of children in day care centers or schools reduced the incidence of ili among family contacts or in the community at large2 55 indirect benefits of vaccinating children include fewer parental days lost from work and less impaired work productivity3
 recommendations for annual influenza vaccination are published annually by the cdc in 2007 the cdc recommended annual influenza vaccination for the following populations children or adults at high risk for complications of influenza close contacts of high-risk persons all children ages 6 to 59 months and all adults greater than 50 years old regardless of health status29 box 77-1
 indications for vaccination continue to evolve many experts favor expanding influenza vaccination potentially toward universal vaccination44
box 77-1annual vaccination against influenzaannual vaccination against influenza is recommended forall persons including school-aged children who want to reduce the risk of becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting influenza to othersall children aged 6-59 months ie 6 months-4 yearsall persons aged 50 years and olderchildren and adolescents aged 6 months-18 years receiving long-term aspirin therapy who therefore might be at risk for experiencing reyes syndrome after influenza virus infectionwomen who will be pregnant during the influenza seasonadults and children who have chronic pulmonary including asthma cardiovascular except hypertension renal hepatic hematological or metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitusadults and children who have immunosuppression including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virusadults and children who have any condition eg cognitive dysfunction spinal cord injuries seizure disorders or other neuromuscular disorders that can compromise respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk for aspirationresidents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilitieshealth-care personnelhealthy household contacts including children and caregivers of children aged 5 years and adults aged 50 years and older with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children aged 6 months andhealthy household contacts including children and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza

 the virus has spread along the flyways of migratory birds to more than 30 countries worldwide4 by august 2006 238 cases had been cited in humans with 139 deaths 584 59 large-scale culling operations and intensified surveillance led to eradication of h5n1 infection in poultry in some countries however in many countries h5n1 infection is endemic in wild birds and poultry4 in countries where human contact with poultry is common the likelihood of further adaptation of the virus to humans and transmission between humans is high h7 and h9 avian influenza viruses are highly lethal in poultry but typically cause mild symptoms in humans eg conjunctivitis with subtype h762 63 or mild ili with h9n259 64 in sharp contrast human cases of h5n1 have been characterized by severe pneumonia with high fatality rates 5859 ninety percent of cases occurred in individuals less than 40 years old59 most cases had close contact with poultry in the week preceding the illness42 human-to-human transmission has been rare65
 the most common symptoms among documented cases of h5n1 include fever 98 cough 88 dyspnea 62 rhinorrhea 55 sore throat 52 diarrhea 39 myalgias 29 headache 28 and abdominal pain 2342 diarrhea may precede the onset of respiratory symptoms pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs were noted in 88 of cases42 this likely overestimates the true incidence since asymptomatic or mild cases may have been missed elevated liver enzymes lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia were noted in 50 to 67 of cases4 42 pathology revealed diffuse alveolar damage reactive hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow and lymphoid depletion in the spleen and lymph nodes4
 cultures of pharyngeal or nasal swabs or respiratory secretions may confirm the diagnosis42 but should be performed only in laboratories meeting biosafety level iii or higher requirements4 rapid antigen tests are insensitive4 rt-pcr methods are more sensitive and specific and do not require handling of live virus4
 because of the high risk of nosocomial spread patients with suspec-ted h5n1 should be isolated and placed in negative pressure rooms if available4 strict infection control measures among health care workers and all contacts are mandatory antiviral treatment should be initiated as early as possible and should be continued if active viral replication continues42 controlled trials evaluating adamantanes to treat h5n1 infections in humans are lacking however resistance to adamantanes is considerable in some regions point mutations in the m2 region conferring resistant to adamantanes were detected in greater than 95 of h5n1 isolates from vietnam and thailand but fewer than 10 of isolates from indonesia and china66 because of the potential for rapid emergence of resistance adamantanes should not be used irrespective of in vitro susceptibility4
 nais display in vitro activity against h5n1 but controlled trials assessing these agents in humans are lacking currently the who recommends oseltamivir as the first-line drug to treat suspected h5n1 infections4 because humans lack immunity against h5n1 a higher dose 150 mg twice daily and longer duration 7 to 10 days should be considered4 resistance to oseltamivir has been detected in some treated patients4 some oseltamivir-resistant isolates displaying the h274y mutation remain susceptible to zanamivir37
 chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir or zanamivir should be considered for patients at high risk for transmission eg household or close contact exposure to infected poultry or environmental source health care workers or laboratory personnel without appropriate protection4
vaccines against h5n1 are not currently available but research and development in this area are ongoing67
 rsv is an enveloped rna virus within the family paramyxoviridae and the genus pneumovirus
68 human rsv isolates are classified into two major groups a and b based primarily upon antigenic differences in the g protein68 both a and b strains circulate concurrently with a strains usually predominating69 several distinct genotypes exist annual changes in the dominant strains may evade immune defenses leading to frequent reinfections69 fig 77-9
 rsv is the chief cause of hospitalization for respiratory tract infections rtis in children69 and is second to influenza as a cause of serious viral rtis in adults68 71 73 74 primary rsv infection is nearly universal by age 2 due to incomplete immunity reinfections are common throughout life68 69 in adults rsv infections are more common in those with comorbidities eg pulmonary or cardiac disorders impaired immunity or advanced age68 71 however rsv may infect previously healthy adults75 epidemiologic studies implicated rsv in 3 to 5 of cases of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and in 6 to 22 of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd68 73 outbreaks of rsv infections have been described in closed populations eg nursing homes senior day care centers health care workers68 and military recruits in training75 the spectrum of rsv in both children and adults ranges from a trivial cold to severe sometimes fatal respiratory failure68 in infants rsv typically presents as bronchiolitis with low-grade fever rhinorrhea cough wheezing and poor feeding68 69 physical examination reveals crackles and expiratory wheezing in severe cases intercostal retraction hypoxemia and respiratory failure may ensue the disease usually resolves spontaneously but cough or bronchial hyperreactivity may persist for days or even weeks in young adults rsv typically gives rise to mild upper respiratory tract urt symptoms eg nasal congestion rhinorrhea sore throat that resolve over 4 to 10 days68 however cough wheezing dyspnea and a protracted course may occur68 69 symptoms of rsv and influenza overlap but nasal symptoms cough wheezing and sputum are more common with rsv whereas myalgias are more common with influenza76 even in previously healthy adults rsv may cause missed work days and incurs economic costs68 69 severe rsv pneumonia is uncommon but can occur in elderly patients or those with comorbidities71 76 or rarely in previously normal adults68 70
 chest radiographs in rsv pneumonia are variable and range from faint interstitial opacities mimicking heart failure to lobar consolidation68 76 concomitant infection with bacterial pathogens has been noted in 15 to 30 of patients with rsv pneumonia68 76 rsv may be a cause of exacerbations of asthma68 71 or copd77 78 in adults particularly during the winter months and was linked to a more rapid decline in lung function in a cohort of copd patients79
 laboratory diagnosis of rsv can be established via four methods viral culture antigen detection by immunofluorescence assay ifa or enzyme immune assay eia rna detection by rt-pcr and serologies68 sensitivity of cultures or antigen detection ranges from 9 to 45 sensitivity of rt-pcr is higher 60 to 9068 rt-pcr is sensitive 70 and specific 9968 and is the preferred method to detect rsv rt-pcr may be obtained from nasal swabs nasal washes sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf68 in adults sputum or balf are more sensitive than nasal specimens68 unfortunately rt-pcr is complex expensive and not available in many hospitals serologies are useful in epidemiologic surveys but are of limited practical value in individual patients68 given the limitations of diagnostic methods and limited therapeutic options discussed later an aggressive diagnostic evaluation for rsv is rarely performed in clinical practice however nasal or balf cultures and antigen detection assays should be considered for patients with severe disease or immunocompromised status68 rt-pcr is reserved for research or commercial laboratories in selected high-risk patients treatment is supportive bronchodilators may be useful in patients with wheezing or a history of asthma or copd71 aerosolized ribavirin is approved for rsv infections in infants but not all studies cited benefit68 ribavirin is difficult to administer requiring continuous inhalation by face mask or tent for 18 hrday68 alternatively high-dose ribavirin ie 2 g aerosolized for 2 hr three times daily may be considered80 one multicenter trial randomized 14 hematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct recipients with rsv urt infections to aerosolized ribavirin 2 gm tid or standard care80 progression to pneumonia was noted in one of nine patients receiving ribavirin compared to two of five patients receiving supportive care p  051 at 10 days viral loads were lower in ribavirin recipients p  007 these data are insufficient to judge efficacy currently the role of ribavirin either aerosolized or intravenous in adults remains controversial in a nonrandomized trial rsv-ivig a human polyclonal immunoglobulin with high neutralizing antibody titers combined with inhaled ribavirin decreased viral shedding and was associated with lower mortality in hsct recipients with rsv pneumonia81
 palivizumab synagis a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the fusion protein of rsv is approved for prophylaxis against rsv once monthly for 5 months during winter season in high-risk infants68 however in a randomized trial of 43 immunocompetent children with rsv infection palivizumab n  22 was no better than placebo n  2182 further a retrospective study of 40 allogeneic hsct recipients mostly adolescents with symptomatic rsv infection found that palivizumab administered to 19 patients had no effect on survival or clinical end points83
 no rsv vaccine is currently available but several candidate vaccines are under development67 68 data regarding passive immunization with intravenous immune globulin ivig or palivizumab in adults are lacking since rsv is transmitted by fomites and large droplets infection control particularly handwashing is important to limit the spread of nosocomial rsv68 masks are not required because rsv is not transmitted via aerosol68
 piv types 1 2 3 and 4 are enveloped rna virus within the family paramyxoviridae69 see fig 77-9 most children are infected with piv within the first 2 years of life while urt symptoms predominate parainfluenza is second only to rsv and possibly human metapneumovirus hmpv as a cause of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children67 69 most children are infected with piv type 3 by age 2 years and by types 1 and 2 by age 5 years69 piv type 4 is rare16 69 pneumonia or bronchitis from type 3 piv occurs primarily in infants less than 6 months old69
 piv infections exhibit distinct seasonal patterns69 type 1 piv causes the largest outbreaks with sharp rises in autumn of odd-numbered years69 piv type 2 infections are less predictable but usually follow type 1 outbreaks type 3 piv infections occur annually usually in the spring and summer a seasonal pattern has not been noted for piv type 4 piv replicates in the nasopharyngeal epithelium and spreads to the lower respiratory tract 1 to 3 days later69 transmission occurs by close or direct contact with large droplets or fomites69 the duration of viral shedding in healthy people is approximately 1 week but piv shedding for greater than 4 weeks has been noted in immunocompromised patients16 85
 infections with piv are less common than rsv in children and adults and are typically milder piv can infect copd patients during peak seasons77 78 and can infect the elderly or healthy adults in a cohort of senior day care attendees piv was implicated in 27 of acute respiratory infections rsv accounted for 2186 in a study of respiratory infections in 256 military recruits piv was isolated by culture in 3 adenovirus adv was detected in 48 and influenza in 1175 piv infections were cited in 2 to 7 of adult and pediatric hsct recipients16 85 87 88 data on solid organ transplant sot recipients are limited pivs cause a spectrum of respiratory illnesses similar to those caused by rsv but are milder69 most are upper respiratory tract infections urtis 30 to 50 are complicated by aom69 croup is the cardinal symptom of piv infections noted in 10 to 44 and is the main cause of hospitalization from piv infections in children 2 to 6 years of age69 the lower respiratory tract is involved in only 15 of cases 28 of 1000 children with such infections require hospitalization69 similar to rsv piv may precipitate exacerbations of asthma in children and adults69 reinfections may occur in adults particularly the elderly69 piv may cause bronchitis or pneumonia in organ transplant recipients87 and human immunodeficiency virusinfected or immunocompromised16 patients however even among hsct recipients piv infections are often confined to the urt in a series of 198 hsct patients with piv-3 infection 87 presented with urti symptoms only 6 had simultaneous urti and lrti symptoms88 the disease progressed from urti to lrti in 25 patients 13 progression was more likely among patients receiving corticosteroids88 piv is a risk factor for airflow decline in hsct recipients and a cause of long-term pulmonary complications89
 as with other viruses laboratory diagnosis of piv can be established by viral culture antigen detection by ifa or eia rt-pcr or serologies69 given the low prevalence of piv in adults and the lack of effective therapy diagnostic assays are rarely performed in clinical practice no licensed or proven therapy for piv is available ribavirin has in vitro activity against piv and aerosolized or intravenous ribavirin has been used to treat or prevent piv infections in immunocompromised hosts87 88 90 but efficacy remains uncertain16 69
 currently there is no vaccine for piv16 but several vaccines are being developed67
 hmpv is a member of the paramyxoviridae family pneumovirinae subfamily and metapneumovirus genus94 fig 77-10
 two major genotypes a and b and four subgroups a1 a2 b1 and b2 are recognized93 97 one research group suggested that genotype a may be more virulent than genotype b97 but others found no difference between genotypes93 the predominant genotype a or b may vary between seasons93 94
 hmpv has a global distribution93 94 98 it was first identified in 200191 but has been circulating based on serologic studies for 50 years in the netherlands98 and at least 15 to 20 years in north america99 hmpv accounts for 5 to 12 of acute rtis in children next to rsv and influenza93 97 98 100 serologic studies suggest that virtually all children are infected by the age of 5 to 10 years91 94 more than three quarters of hmpv infections are in children less than 2 years old101 but all ages may be affected95 98 infections due to hmpv both children and adults are more common in immunosuppressed individuals102 103 104 in adults hmpv accounts for 2 to 7 of acute rtis101 105 or ilis and may be implicated in 5 to 10 of acute exacerbations of asthma92 copd106 or congestive heart failure106
 
transmission of hmpv is similar to rsv ie via respiratory droplets and hand-to-mouth or hand-to-eye contact with contaminated surfaces94 outbreaks of hmpv respiratory infections have been described in long-term care facilities95 107 and health care workers ie case contacts107 like other respiratory viruses hmpv predominates in winter and spring in temperate climates97 98 101 however outbreaks may occur in the late spring93 or summer107
 clinical symptoms of hmpv infections in infants and young children are indistinguishable from rsv92 97 98 100 101 108 in previously healthy children the most common features of hmpv were bronchiolitis 59 croup 18 exacerbation of asthma 14 and pneumonia 8101 vomiting was less common in hmpv infections 10 compared to rsv 31 or influenza 28101 hospitalization is rarely required in previously healthy children101 but severe pneumonia can occur in children with comorbidities or immunosuppression97 98 co-infection with rsv and hmpv occurs in 4 to 6 of cases101 109 like other respiratory viruses hmpv may evoke exacerbations of asthma in children94 in young children aom occurs in one third to one half of cases92 94 101 conjunctivitis was noted in 4 of children with hmpv versus 22 of children with influenza infections101 in adults hmpv may cause exacerbations of asthma92 or copd110
 infections due to hmpv are usually self-limited in children and adults94 101 but fatal pneumonia may occur94 95 among fatal cases diffuse alveolar hyaline membrane damage and peribronchiolitis have been observed94 95 because of the presence of multiple viral genotypes and waning immunity95 reinfections may occur throughout life94 reinfections are typically milder than primary infections94
 hmpv exhibits fastidious growth requirements in culture and may require 14 to 21 days to grow93 94 a rapid antigen test is not available rt-pcr is the preferred means to diagnose hmpv93 95 98 no sensitive anti-hmpv antibody tests are currently available93
 no antiviral or antibody preparation is approved for the treatment of hmpv intravenous ribavirin has shown promise in vitro and in animal models111 112 inhaled ribavirin was ineffective in one hsct recipient104 however in a lung transplant recipient intravenous ribavirin was associated with a favorable response103 intravenous polyclonal antibodies inhibit hmpv and have a plausible albeit untested role in treating serious cases112
 live attenuated vaccines have shown efficacy in animals but vaccines are not yet available in humans67
 both are single-stranded rna viruses fig 77-11
 rhinoviruses are members of the picornaviridae family more than 100 serotypes exist113 variations in surface proteins account for antigenic diversity113 coronaviruses are divided into three genera and can infect humans animals and birds113
 both rhinoviruses and coronaviruses cause respiratory infections predominantly urtis in all age groups113 115 in temperate climates rhinoviral illnesses peak in the early fall and spring115 coronaviruses peak in the late fall winter and early spring113 schools day care centers family members and businesses are sources of transmission113
 rhinoviruses account for approximately 50 of common colds coronaviruses 15113 114 rhinoviruses or coronaviruses may also cause exacerbations of asthma115 or copd117 in children these viruses may serve as cofactors for aom118 119 these viral infections usually are self-limited113 115 but complications including fatal pneumonias may arise in immunosuppressed individuals16 116
 conventional virus culture methods are sensitive for rhinoviruses but insensitive for coronaviruses113 120 rt-pcr is more sensitive than cultures for rhinovirus and coronavirus120 serologies are not helpful in clinical practice and are not available in most centers113 given the mild and self-limited course observed with these viruses cultures or rt-pct are rarely performed except in epidemiologic or research studies no proven therapy for rhinoviruses or coronaviruses is available vaccines are not available113
 the etiologic agent of sars is a novel human coronavirus sars-cov that is not closely related to other human or animal coronaviruses122
fig 77-12
 sars-cov exhibits 998 homology between sars-like coronaviruses found in animal markets122 123
 sars is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted by droplet or contact routes122 124 125 the virus was transmitted from exotic animals to food handlers or workers in the food markets in guangdong province and other asian countries122
 the incubation period of sars ranges from 2 to 14 days mean 5 days122 126 maximal infectivity occurs in the second week of illness at the time of rapid clinical deterioration which correlates with the peak viral load126 it is important to emphasize that a single case of sars could trigger a global pandemic vigilant surveillance and strict infection control measures among suspected cases and contacts are critical to minimize spread122
 presenting symptoms include chills myalgias malaise and headache127 128 fever is present in greater than 95 of cases122 127 128 rhinorrhea and sore throat are uncommon in sars128 diarrhea occurs in up to 70 of patients126 127 lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and elevations in creatine kinase ck and lactate dehydrogenase ldh are early findings127 128 during the first few days of the illness respiratory symptoms are absent and chest radiographs may be normal by 7 to 10 days respiratory symptoms develop or worsen126 pulmonary infiltrates ground-glass opacities and multifocal consolidation are usually evident on chest computed tomography scans126 most patients recover spontaneously by the second or third week of illness122 however 20 to 30 develop progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards122 129 the median time from disease onset to mechanical ventilation among patients who developed respiratory failure was 9 days range 7 to 13 days122 mortality in this subset is approximately 50122 sars is uncommon in children and has a milder course122 atypical presentations of sars eg fever and diarrhea without respiratory manifestations130 131 or lack of symptoms may result in delayed diagnosis given the potential for pandemic spread of sars rapid diagnostic confirmation is essential for suspected cases sars should be considered in patients with pneumonia and ards of unknown etiology and one of the following risk factors travel to mainland china or asia within 10 days or employment in occupations at high risk eg exposure to wildlife or other animals that may be reservoirs health care workers or laboratory workers with close contact to sars-cov122 even a single case mandates immediate efforts to identify the source and potential contacts122 when a case of sars is suspected public health authorities should be contacted immediately and can guide appropriate diagnostic workup and infection control measures samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates respiratory secretions and stool should be sent for cultures and rt-pcr122 however virus isolation using cell culture is relatively insensitive requires several days and must be performed in a laboratory with biosafety level iii capability132 detection of viral rna by rt-pcr provides rapid results with sensitivity rates greater than 80 at days 9 to 12 of the illness but less than 50 at earlier or later time points122 serologic detection of an antibody response to sars-cov is the gold standard122 acute and convalescent 3 to 4 weeks sera should be obtained122 seroconversion occurs in 50 of patients by day 10 and greater than 90 by day 28122 serologies are useful for epidemiologic investigations but are less valuable in individual patients because of the time lag between infection and seroconversion personal protective equipment handwashing and infection control measures are essential when collecting transporting and handling specimens122
 because of the potential for rapid epidemic spread patients with sars should be admitted to the hospital and rigorous infection control measures are essential122 droplet and contact precautions are mandatory122 hypoxemic patients require careful monitoring and in severe cases mechanical ventilation122 procedures that involve airway manipulation eg intubation bronchoscopy suctioning nebulized therapy should be performed only when essential and under tightly controlled conditions122
 no treatment has been shown to influence mortality or clinical outcomes in sars122 intravenous ribavirin was ineffective and had significant toxicity133 corticosteroids were used in uncontrolled studies but were of unproven benefit122 other strategies employed include interferon alfa lopinavirritonavir and chinese herbal medications122 none is of proven efficacy vaccines are not yet available in humans67
 
hantavirus is a genus of rna viruses in the bunyaviridae family and is the only group in this family that is not a naturally arthropod-borne virus136 fig 77-13
 more than 25 viruses have been identified within the genus hantavirus
36 hantaviruses are hosted in nature by rodents the source of transmission to humans135 136
 three distinct groups of hantaviruses have been recognized and result in distinct clinical presentations the hantaan virus htn first isolated in korea in 1978 is a cause of hfrs in asia and europe136 the second group of viruses primarily found in the americas is associated with a severe pulmonary capillary leak syndrome and high mortality137 the first cases of hps due to the sin nombre sn virus were described in the four corners region of new mexico in 1993137 in north america the sn virus is by far the most common but other types have been described eg bayou virus black creek canal virus new york virus monongahela virus135 136 the first cases of hps in south america were described in 1997138 by 2002 hps had been confirmed in at least six countries in south america argentina bolivia brazil chile uruguay and paraguay135 the first case of human hantavirus infection in central america was described in panama in february 2000135 several types of hantavirus were described in those outbreaks the andes virus was the predominant species in chile and argentina whereas other subtypes were identified in other countries eg laguna negra virus in paraguay choclo virus in panama juquitiba virus in brazil135 136 a third group of hantaviruses associated with the subfamily arvicolinae has been detected in north america and europe and may result in less severe forms of hfrs139
 in this chapter we restrict our discussion to respiratory infections due to hantaviruses in north america principally the sn virus hantaviral infections in north america remain exceedingly rare with a seroprevalence of less than 01136 since the initial report of hcps in new mexico in 1993 fewer than 500 cases have been reported in north america136 inhalation of aerosolized virus particles present in urine feces or saliva of rodents is the most important route of human infection136 following excretion by rodents hantaviruses may remain infectious for several days136 outbreaks of hantavirus infections in humans are related to variations in rodent density eg due to climate and food supply and rodents invading peridomestic environments135 136 139 person-to-person transmission has not been described in north america europe or asia136 but was described in several cases in argentina and chile138 140 incubation period ranges from 7 to 39 days136 141
 in the most severe cases hantavirus elicits a pulmonary capillary leak syndrome producing ards and cardiogenic shock136 typically hcps is characterized by three phases prodromal cardiopulmonary and recovery136 in the prodromal phase 1 to 5 days nonspecific symptoms of fever headache malaise and myalgia are present136 gastrointestinal symptoms eg nausea vomiting diarrhea abdominal pain may be present136 importantly rhinorrhea or nasal congestion often the presenting features of other respiratory viral syndromes are absent in this early phase136 during the next cardiopulmonary phase dyspnea cough and pulmonary infiltrates develop136 thrombocytopenia occurs in 80 to 95 of patients with hcps and is usually present even in the early prodromal phase136 other laboratory aberrations may include hypoalbuminemia and elevations in transaminases creatinine ck and ldh136 with the onset of the cardiopulmonary phase dyspnea hypoxemia hypotension or cardiovascular collapse may develop136 during this phase hematocrit and leukocyte counts rise136 rapid progression to fulminant pulmonary andor cardiac failure may occur over the next 8 to 24 hours with mortality rates exceeding 30 to 50136 pulmonary hemorrhage is rare with sn virus but may complicate severe hcps due to andes virus136 pulmonary edema may reflect capillary leak as well as severe myocardial depression136 as myocardial function worsens pulmonary capillary wedge pressure rises and cardiac index is low and resistant to fluid resuscitation136 in addition arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock may develop interestingly at least one third of patients with sn infection do well with modest or no pulmonary edema136
 no clinical or laboratory features during the prodromal or early cardiopulmonary phases predict the ultimate severity of the disease136 further serologic epidemiologic studies cited serum antibodies to hantavirus in up to 13 of local community residents with no clinical evidence for illness135 suggesting that mild or asymptomatic hantavirus infections occur in humans a careful history is critical hantavirus exposure should be considered in individuals who reside in or visit rural locations even if an overt history of rodent exposure is lacking laboratory criteria suggestive of hcps include thrombocytopenia 150  103l hemoconcentration hematocrit 50 in men or 48 in women lack of toxic granulations in neutrophils left shift of myeloid series and greater than 10 immunoblasts136 a definitive diagnosis is made by serologies serum antibodies are usually present on the first day of symptoms136 viral antigen detection in fixed tissue by immunohistochemistry is sensitive and specific136 viral rna can be detected from serum or tissues by rt-pcr136
 no specific antiviral therapy for hcps exists136 treatment is supportive and directed toward treating shock and acute respiratory cardiac or renal failure136 because hcps is associated with severe myocardial depression aggressive fluid resuscitation is discouraged
136 early use of vasopressors should be initiated extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be efficacious in extreme fulminant cases of hps136 hyperimmune serum from convalescent patients is promising136 high levels of neutralizing antibodies correlated with improved survival and persist for years in survivors136
 human adv is a family of double-stranded nonenveloped dna viruses147 fig 77-14
 fifty-one serotypes and six species a through f are recognized one third of serotypes are associated with human disease147 manifestations of adv are related to specific species and strains142 144 in immunocompetent children species b and c predominate 95 typically adv strains 1 to 7144 148 most infections among military recruits are due to adv strains 4 and 7145 146 gastroenteritis is associated with enteric adv strains 40 and 41 and hemorrhagic gastritis with adv 11 33 34 and 3516 among hsct recipients most infections are due to adv species b and c142 149 but significant diversity144 and even multiple serotypes in individual patients144 150 have been noted adenovirus is a common pathogen among children and adults and accounts for at least 5 to 10 of pediatric and 1 to 7 of adults rtis142 infections occur throughout the year with no seasonal variation142 transmission of adv can occur via inhalation of aerosolized droplets direct conjunctival inoculation fecal-oral spread or exposure to infected tissue or blood142 the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days and depends upon viral serotype and mechanism of transmission142 infection can be by reactivation or new acquisition from exogenous sources142 144 rates of adv infection are higher among children due to lack of immunity and immunosuppressed patients16 142 151 the incidence of adv infections is 5 to 22 among sot recipients142 152 153 and 3 to 47 among hsct recipients16 142 143 144 148 150 153 154 155 risk factors for adv infections among hsct recipients include pediatric age group allogeneic hsct severe t-cell depletion and graft-versus-host disease142 143 153 154 155 severe lymphopenia is associated with disseminated and often fatal disease142 among sot recipients risk factors include pediatric age group receipt of antilymphocyte antibodies and donor-positiverecipient-negative adv status142
 epidemic adv infections may spread rapidly in closed environments such as military recruit barracks145 156 civilian job training facilities long-term care facilities151 and psychiatric care facilities157 as well as among hospitalized or institutionalized civilians158 adenovirus accounts for greater than 50 of febrile respiratory illnesses among healthy military recruits145 146 156 surveillance of us recruits in training from 1999 to 2004 cited greater than 73000 adv infections with peak illness rates in weeks 3 to 5 of training156 serotype 4 accounted for greater than 95 of infections156 importantly the annual rate of adv infections rose more than threefold after vaccine usage ceased156 high baseline immunity against adv titer of 132 confers substantial protection146
 adenoviral infections typically cause self-limited respiratory gastrointestinal or conjunctival disease142 less common manifestations of adv infections include hepatitis hemorrhagic cystitis nephritis encephalitis pancreatitis and disseminated disease159 160 respiratory symptoms range from mild coldlike symptoms to severe sometimes lethal pneumonia and ards142 157 pneumonia due to adv is rare in immunocompetent adults but life-threatening cases have been described146 gastrointestinal symptoms range from mild diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis142 hepatitis is often associated with subgroup c viruses types 1 2 and 5 and hemorrhagic cystitis with adv types 11 34 and 35142 the presence of adv in urine is usually associated with hemorrhagic cystitis142 severe adv infections are rare among immunocompetent hosts but dissemination occurs in 10 to 30 of hsct recipients16 142 143 144 150 154 155 adenovirus infections in sot recipients may lead to graft loss or death161 among hsct recipients with symptomatic adv disease fatality rates range from 19 to 6516 142 143 153 154 case fatality rates for untreated adv pneumonia may exceed 5016 142
 viral cultures are difficult and may take up to 21 days to isolate adv16 142 the commercially available adv eia test for stool specimens detects only serotypes 40 and 4116 adenovirus nuclear inclusions may be observed in tissue142 rt-pct of adv dna in plasma or infected sites is the preferred technique142 and is highly sensitive for disseminated disease160 162 persistently high titers correlate with clinical disease160 serial rt-pcr assays of blood and stool weekly may detect adv disease prior to the onset of symptoms and facilitate early preemptive therapy144 152 154 163 however the role of routine surveillance is controversial142
 no antiviral drug has been approved to treat adenovirus prospective randomized controlled trials are lacking cidofovir a cytosine nucleotide analogue that inhibits dna polymerase has the greatest in vitro activity most but not all species are resistant to ribavirin164 165 ganciclovir displays in vitro activity against adv but has no role to treat adv infections142 while not all adv infections require treatment cidofovir available only intravenously is the preferred therapeutic agent142 numerous studies of hsct and sot recipients have documented favorable responses to cidofovir143 144 154 163 166 167 major dosing regimens include intravenous cidofovir 5 mgkg once weekly or 1 mgkg thrice weekly for 4 to 6 weeks163 cidofovir is generally well tolerated154 163 but may cause nephrotoxicity142 hydration and probenacid may minimize nephrotoxicity142 154 167 168 newer lipid formulations of cidofovir exhibit increased activity against adv and are less toxic but not yet available169
 reduction of immunosuppression154 or immune reconstitution of hsct recipients143 may have adjunctive roles ivig has been used together with cidofovir but data are insufficient to assess efficacy143 not all patients with adv infections require treatment142 interestingly in a cohort of sot recipients all 19 with adv infection recovered spontaneously152 similarly in one study of pediatric hsct recipients adv viremia was detected in 42 and cleared without therapy in 64170
 oral vaccines against adv types 4 and 7 were developed for the us military and routine vaccination began at us recruit training camps in 1971156 these vaccines were safe and highly efficacious145 but production ceased in 1996 and available stores were depleted by 1999156 restoration of an effective adv vaccine is anticipated in 2008156
  viral networks and detection of potential zoonotic viruses in bats and rodents a worldwide analysis fabiola nietorabiela anuwat wiratsudakul gerardo suzn oscar ricochvez   bats and rodents are hosts of a significant proportion of zoonoses higher than any other mammalian order over 200 viruses belonging to 27 viral families have been isolated or detected in bats however bathuman transmission has only been observed for 11 viruses belonging to four different viral families rhabdoviridae filoviridae coronaviridae and paramyxoviridae allocati et al 2016 some examples of those viruses are as follows sarsrelated coronavirus sosuga rubulavirus ebola virus and marburg virus rabies lyssavirus nipah henipavirus and hendra henipavirus allocati et al 2016 calisher childs field holmes  schountz 2006 hayman 2016 oshea et al 2014 plowright et al 2015 rodents have similar zoonotic potential to bats and are associated with a large number of zoonotic viruses such as sin nombre virus puumala virus crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever virus kyasanur forest virus tickborne encephalitis virus lassa fever virus and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus among others all of the aforementioned bat and rodentassociated viruses have a large impact on public health however it is important to take into count that not all of these viruses are obligate pathogens some are generally commensal previous studies have explored viral associations on relatively restricted spatial or phylogenetic scales for example hayman 2016 propose maps of viral distributions according to the distribution of hosts families streicker et al 2010 explored rabies viruses using a phylogenetic approach and cui tachedjian and wang 2015 compared retrovirus associations between bats and rodents anthony et al 2017 explored coronavirus networks at the level of host family and bordes caron blasdell garinewichatitsky and morand 2017 analyse the relationships among zoonotic diseases in southeast asia luis et al 2015 analyse viral networks between rodents and bats at global scale identifying several ecology factors to explain virushost associations recently works explored the specificity and frequency of sharing dna and rna viruses among carnivores and bats wells morand wardeh  baylis 2018 and the importance of the phylogeny to explain the viral richness associated with bats and rodents guy thiagavel mideo  ratcliffe 2019 however there are currently no studies at a global level that incorporate the human influence in the viral networks while some authors consider bats and rodents to belong to a similar category of high zoonotic risk potential han schmidt bowden  drake 2015 other work examines the differences between bats and rodents luis et al 2015 several different distinctive features of bats have been hypothesized to explain their particularly high viral richness such as their ability to fly long migrations high trophic diversity and social structure brook  dobson 2015 moratelli  calisher 2015 however currently the viral diversity and connectivity among different species of bats are not well understood moratelli  calisher 2015 oshea et al 2014 making it difficult to evaluate the implications of those relationships for emerging and reemerging zoonoses while the literature does explain why bats harbour a particularly high number of viruses it does not describe viral associations at the level of host species or describe direct relationships only associations does not address the whole viral species complex and does not describe the statistics or metrics that characterize the associations bats and rodents are similar in that both are highly diverse are basal taxa within the mammal phylogeny and have similar life history characteristics luis et al 2013 rodents like bats have been recognized as reservoirs for several zoonotic viruses han et al 2015 such as virus of hantaviridae schmaljohn  hjelle 1997 and arenaviridae families charrel  de lamballerie 2010 however there are differences in rodentvirus associations that impact their zoonotic potential compared with bats in disease ecology analytical tools have been used to holistically explain the dynamics of infections and provide novel hypothesis to explain macroecological patterns johnson roode  fenton 2016 one of the theories that helps to predict dynamic changes in hostpathogen systems is graph theory also known as network theory bordes et al 2017 johnson et al 2016 this approach can be used to gain better understanding of how interactions take place within pathogen communities how hosts are connected with pathogens their preferred association and patterns of pathogen transmission godfrey 2013 white forester  craft 2017 the graphs better known as networks focus on the interactions between entities newman 2014 and they have the potential to infer relationships within a larger framework hossain  feng 2016 luke  stamatakis 2012 a network is capable of emphasizing the preferred union as a process hartonen  annila 2011 and capturing both the individual elements in a system as well as their relevant interconnections kolaczyk  csardi 2014 in disease ecology this kind of analysis could be applied to describe viral diversity associated with different hosts and detect hosts and viruses that share associations and therefore identify groups that share similar characteristics white et al 2017 in network theory centrality and dispersion metrics quantify the importance of each component member martnezlpez perez  snchezvizcano 2009 newman 2014 opsahl agneessens  skvoretz 2010 the parameter betweenness can be used to recognize dispersing hosts and key viruses in the evolution or viral transmission opsahl et al 2010 white et al 2017 while closeness can indicate hosts and viruses that may have little direct connectivity but are surrounded by important highly connected nodes opsahl et al 2010 white et al 2017 in terms of disease ecology we can employ these and other parameters to explore the hosthost virushost and virusvirus interactions by collapsing the networks and identifying communities network analysis thus offers the opportunity to recognize highly diverse viruses and hosts based on a high degree of connectedness bats and rodents are excellent taxa in which to implement this tool because they harbour a large number of highly adaptable viruses and hosts with high resistance therefore in this study we aimed to compare and recognize the differences in the associative capacity of the hostvirus networks in rodents and bats worldwide as well as to identify the viruses that may shift across species including humans suggesting zoonotic potential data were compiled from several sources for bats we retrieved data from the dbatvir database httpwwwmgcaccndbatvir for rodents data on viruses in rodents were searched in web of science httpsloginwebofknowledgecom elsevier httpswwwelseviercomadvanced-search and world wide science httpsworldwidescienceorg in each of the aforementioned databases we searched the keywords rodent virus pcr wild and zoonotic we then constructed two separate large databases of viruses isolated from rodents and bats when the taxonomic classification of the virus was not clear we searched the ictv database httpstalkictvonlineorg to confirm in the case of coronaviridae and paramyxoviridae families we assigned as bat coronavirus and bat paramyxovirus all unclassified coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses because bat astrovirus does not exist in the ictv classification we assigned all reports from astroviridae family as astrovirus to increase the certainty of identification of the viruses only studies that used molecular methods to detect viruses were included in the database we compiled subsequently each of the viruses identified in rodents or bats was classified as direct zoonotic or nonzoonotic pathogens allocati et al 2016 calisher et al 2006 han et al 2015 an independent undirected bipartite network was built for each of the orders of rodentia and chiroptera that is to say each network included two types of nodesviruses and hosts viral nodes were connected to host nodes when the virus indicated by the node has been detected in the species indicated by the host node we included a human host node which was connected to viruses that have been classified as zoonotic this helped us to group and identify zoonotic viruses and viruses close to them which could have zoonotic potential then hosttohost and virustovirus networks were constructed in order to explore these networks in different dimensions the bipartiteprojection function in the igraph package implemented in r software version 342 r core team 2017 was used to collapse the bipartite network basically in the collapsed networks a host was connected to another host when they shared a common virus and a virus to a virus when they shared a common host figure 1 in each hosthost collapsed network the host nodes were conserved and the virus nodes were transformed using the weight of corresponding links in order to illustrate the relationships among different hosts figure 1ab in each virusvirus network one for bats and one for rodents the virusvirus relationship was highlighted by collapsing the host nodes into the weighted links figure 1c we measured the networks on two levels individual node and the entire network at the node level we measured different centrality values including degree number of links that a node has betweenness number of times a node is an intermediary to connect each possible pair of nodes and closeness the degrees of average separation in relation to other nodes martnezlpez et al 2009 newman 2014 at the network level we measured density and diameter network density is the proportion of links that are actually observed in the network divided by those that could possibly occur and network diameter is the length of the longest geodesic distance newman 2014 network level measurements were useful for summarizing the big picture of the network and identify the key nodes that are closely related to humans network level measurements were generated using the algorithms provided in the packages igraph csrdi  nepusz 2006 and network butts 2008 table 1 and plots were produced using the packages igraph and ggplot2 gmezrubio 2017 in r r development core team 2011 communities were detected using the maximization of modularity method newman 2016 which recognize nodes with dense and weak connections between groups we used the function clusteredgebetweenness girvan girvan newman  newman 2002 newman  girvan 2003 in the igraph package csrdi  nepusz 2006 to identify the nodes with dense connections with humans which is based on the following equation1q12mijaij-kikj2mgigjwhere m denotes the total number of links in the network aij refers to the actual number of links between nodes i and node j  is a parameter calculated by the algorithm k degree of i gigj is a randomized number of links between a pair of nodes community detection facilitates the recognition of groups of hosts that share viruses and viruses that share hosts and which therefore may continue to enter in contact with each other because they share similar characteristics a subnetwork was built by choosing communities with more than four hostvirus pairs which is above the minimum number accepted in statistical normality samples n  3 hammer harper  ryan 2001 royston 1982 these subnetworks were illustrated to gain better community visualization and recognize the most relevant communities for the detection of potentially zoonotic viruses from the subnetwork the most important communities were chosen using to the measures of the members top five nodes and the number of zoonotic viruses 80 as selection criteria then a sociogram representing the preferential unions and the complex interaction on the largest communities was constructed using the package visnetwork almende thieurmel  robert 2016 in r this choice of subnetworks helps us to focus and observe in more detail the interactions within these important communities the rodent database contained 825 records including 172 rodent species and 123 viruses of which 53 are zoonotic viruses the bat database contained 4659 records consisting of 220 bats species associated with 166 viruses of which 40 viruses were classified as zoonotic both databases are detailed in appendix s1 the bipartite rodentia network contained 269 nodes 172 rodents 123 viruses human node and 323 links figure 2a the diameter of the network was nine and the density was 00044 mus musculus was the host with the highest degree and betweenness values at 17 and 2496 respectively the top five nodes based on centrality values are shown in table 2 and centrality values are in appendix s2 7806 of the nodes had a degree value of 1 or 2 making them uninformative in terms of epidemiological information though they may be involved in coevolutionary processes thirtynine different communities were detected sixteen communities included only two members while the largest group consisted of 32 members this particular group included humans as shown in appendix s2 ten communities with at least eight members were selected in the subnetwork figure 2b we excluded communities 1 and 9 despite fulfilling the inclusion criteria because they are linear with a single virus that influences the whole communities 3 4 and 5 satisfied our selection criteria community 3 included 23 hosts and 11 viruses this community was considered a dense network because the number of links greatly exceeds the number of nodes 34 nodes and 55 links in this community only two viruses are nonzoonotic herpesvirus 1 and cytomegalovirus cmv3 figure 2c3 shows the gradient representing the number of viruses associated with each host within that community it was noteworthy that myodes glareolus is linked with the highest number of associated viruses eight and all of which are zoonotic in the fourth community 32 nodes and 33 links were observed within this subcommunity 16 rodent species were recognized along with 16 viruses and of which only one virus was not zoonotic gbagroube virus proposed as arenaviridae virus coulibalyngolo et al 2011 figure 2c4 highlights the proximity of peromyscus maniculatus to the human node indicating a large number of shared viruses on the other hand community 5 consisted of 20 nodes and 19 links representing six rodent species and 14 viruses only two viruses in this community were zoonotic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcv and california encephalitis virus in this subcommunity most viruses linked only with m musculus this network contained 147 nodes of rodent species with 502 links the diameter of the network was 5 and the density was 00627 figure 3a the top five nodes in terms of degree betweenness and closeness are shown in table 2 and the remaining values are in appendix s3 thirtyfive different communities were detected and the largest of which contained 43 members followed by a group of 21 members appendix s3 in virusvirus network there were 122 nodes and 1661 links the diameter and density were 4 and 03494 respectively figure 3b the five viruses with the highest centrality values are all zoonoses table 3 fiftythree different communities were detected the largest of which contained 52 members and the second largest had only 12 members centrality values and community detection are given in appendix s3 a total of 387 nodes 220 bat species 166 viruses human node and 736 links were contained in the bipartite bat network the network diameter was 10 and the density was 00049 figure 4a three zoonotic viruses had the highest degree and betweenness values these were bat coronavirus rabies lyssavirus and bat paramyxovirus table 4 6571 of the nodes had degrees of 1 or 2 so they do not provide much information to the network but they may be involved in coevolutionary processes all centrality values are given in appendix s2 twentynine different communities were detected four of those had only two members and the largest community contained 38 members appendix s2 eleven communities contained eight or more members figure 4b communities 1 3 and 4 were linear and possessed simple edges with a virus that influenced the whole community community 7 was a homogeneous community with rich ecological interactions but which was not highly related to zoonotic viruses the last community was associated with humans had the highest number of zoonotic viruses involved figure 4cd details below a low number of zoonotic viruses were found in homogeneous bat network communities we focused only on the community that included the human node in figure 4a three red lines representing the three highly connected viruses in the network followed by a homogeneous community and later in green the human node connections the community that included humans figure 4cd has 13 host nodes including human and 23 virus nodes with 45 links fruit bat parvovirus was the only nonzoonotic virus in that community miniopterus mormopterus and saccolaimus were the only bat genera that directly shared viruses with humans the hosthost chiroptera network contained 221 nodes and 6949 links the diameter and density of the network were 5 and 02911 respectively figure 5a the five nodes with the highest centrality values are shown in table 5 and detailed results are in appendix s4 sixtyseven different communities were detected the largest had 69 members the second largest community consisted of 56 members including humans appendix s4 the virusvirus network contained 164 nodes and 2132 links the diameter of the network was 4 and the density was 01655 figure 5b the three highest centrality viruses were coronaviruses bat coronavirus alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus and all of which are zoonotic appendix s4 ninetyseven communities were detected the largest of which contained 35 viruses and all of the zoonotic appendix s4 bats are wellknown as excellent reservoirs for zoonotic viruses that usually result in high public health impact gay et al 2014 luis et al 2013 2015 plowright et al 2015 nevertheless in our database 53 of 123 43 rodent viruses are zoonotic nearly twice the proportion of bat viruses 40 of 166 24 rodents should thus not be overlooked as potential hosts of zoonotic viruses however bats are more linked to more cosmopolitan viruses with broad distributions of their hosts in the bipartite network of bats the main actors top values of degree betweenness and closeness are all viruses including bat coronavirus rabies lyssavirus bat paramyxovirus and astrovirus table 4 in the rodent bipartite network in contrast the main actors are two host species m musculus and rattus norvegicus and two viruses andes virus and cowpox virus table 2 hence the bat viruses have a higher degree of connectivity with a large number of bat hosts the ratio of nodes to edges in the batvirus network was 119 and in rodents was 112 in other words each bat species on average interacts with nearly two viruses and vice versa while in rodents on average there is a near onetoone hostvirus interaction leading to the rodent network having more divisions this is similar to results found by luis et al 2015 when building viral association networks in rodentia and chiroptera who then used the centrality metrics as a response variable in a generalized linear model to determine the phylogenetic functional and ecological characteristics that are responsible for this high connectivity in bats this pattern of higher host diversity among bat viruses than rodent viruses has been observed in viral metacommunities using analyses at different spatial scales nietorabiela suzn wiratsudakul  ricochvez 2018 and it has been suggested that this is due to their higher dispersal ability compared with rodents wang walker  poon 2011 however since studies on viruses detected in others mammals have not yet been carried out at a similarly large scale it is not clear whether bats level of hostvirus connectivity is atypically high among mammals we can only conclude that it is higher than in rodents in collapsed hosthost networks in both bats and rodents the human node is closely linked with the species that host zoonotic viruses the largest community including the human node is surrounded by three to four smaller groups in both networks we can highlight that in the largest community where the human is embedded the bats and rodent hosts have a high adaptability wide distribution and low phylogenetic distinction also the closest hosts to the human node are the main reservoirs of viral diseases with worldwide distribution like hantaviridae viruses rabiesrelated virus and dengue virus tables 3 and 5 however the clusters in the bat network are four times denser compared with rodents this makes it easier to continue sharing the viruses in addition they can act as virus mixers allowing the viruses to acquire characteristics that allow them to infect other host species including humans in addition the human node is more closely connected to bats it shows that viruses are shared to a greater degree among bats as discussed earlier figures 3a and 5a one plausible explanation is that many species of bats live in highdensity populations with many individuals in close proximity to each other such as in caves and roosts sites indeed there are always a larger number of bat species than rodent species in a given area kerth perony  schweitzer 2011 the difference in connectivity between the bat and rodent hostvirus networks has implications for the zoonotic potential of each taxon high connectivity facilitates viral transmission within and between species and so bats are expected to have higher zoonotic potential than rodents for example the nectarivorous bat glossophaga soricina had the highest closeness value in the hosthost network despite the fact that only three viruses have been isolated in this species bat coronavirus bat paramyxovirus and rabies lyssavirus this is because these three viruses have a high viral diversity and when the network is collapsed g soricina connects directly with 155 hosts it is the central node even more central than humans this suggests that this species is prone to harbour several viruses however we most considered the biological characteristic of the host that could prevent an efficient transmission to the human in both the bat and rodent virusvirus networks there are some large groups that include all of the zoonotic viruses the grouping of zoonotic viruses suggests a high capacity for mutation and adaptability to different hosts for that reason the viruses are shared among different hosts and thus intricate communities are presented woolhouse 2001 in bats these clusters are disordered and close together resulting in a broad viral exchange among bats in contrast a closer relationship was observed in rodent viralviral network indicating smaller groups around zoonotic viruses it is difficult though to compare our virusvirus network with other works since most studies focus on hosts moreover we faced a lack of knowledge on the organization of the viral communities assembly rules cooccurrences or even crossantigenicity these issues directly affect our network architectures for that reason deeper comprehension is required to unravel this entanglement one of the objectives covered in this work was to recognize nonzoonotic viruses that may be strongly connected with humans and therefore have zoonotic potential the batvirus community that contained humans was composed of bats distributed in africa and australia may be explained by high rates of humanbat contact allocati et al 2016 rupprecht 2009 one nonzoonotic virus that was included in the batvirus community that included humans is fruit bat parvovirus the parvoviridae family were transmitted from bats to other mammals by a viral ancestor suggesting their zoonotic capacity and groups of genes in their genome denote this potential canuti et al 2011 even though the virus currently infects only bats canuti et al 2011 it is firmly connected with the human node in our network by pteropus poliocephalus a species endemic to eastern australia lunney richards  dickman 2008 future studies are recommended to elucidate its potential for zoonosis andes viruses rodents cowpox rodents and rabies lyssavirus bats were defined as main actors high values of degree betweenness and closeness in the bipartite networks however their importance disappeared when the network was collapsed to virusvirus interactions likely because their geographical restriction may limit their viral connectivity andes virus is only distributed in south america martinez et al 2005 cowpox in europe vorou papavassiliou  pierroutsakos 2008 and rabies lyssavirus in america moratelli  calisher 2015 therefore these viruses were less important in the virusvirus networks compared with the worldwide distributed ones so subsequent at geographical scales are important coronaviruses in bats stood out throughout our study in both bipartite and collapsed networks in terms of connectivity with high values of degree betweenness and closeness in this case the three most prominent coronaviruses are bat coronavirus alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus also each virus is a protagonist in their own community these are rna viruses with high mutation rates and the viruses possess great plasticity allowing them to horizontally transfer accessory genes which facilitate new host and niche establishment de groot et al 2011 guy et al 2019 in the rodent community selected community 3 has members with predominantly european distribution further two nonzoonotic viruses are included among the nine zoonotic viruses but we do not think they are likely to have zoonotic potential because they do not have direct contact with the human node therefore in this community we do not find viruses with zoonotic potential in the rodent community 5 m musculus has high values of connectivity but in the sociogram figure 2d it is evident that the connectivity is with nonzoonotic viruses this host species thus is likely less important in public health terms but highly relevant for disease ecology in addition two zoonotic viruses are included in the community 5 and while they can transfer their zoonotic potential to other nonzoonotic viruses using m musculus as a virus mixer we consider this unlikely because the proportion of zoonotic viruses is low adding the specificity of rodents viruses and the associative characteristics founding in the rodents thus the onetoone virushost species relationship suggested by the nodetoedge ratio suggests that spillover is unlikely though not impossible in the humanrodent community gbagroube virus is noteworthy because it is the only nonzoonotic virus found in the community however the genetics of gbagroube virus is similar to lassa virus which is deadly in humans coulibalyngolo et al 2011 gbagroube virus could potentially adapt to infect humans because it is genetically similar to lassa virus coulibalyngolo et al 2011 and has strong connections with other zoonotic viruses and with humans gbagroube virus should be closely monitored along with its host mus setulosus found in central africa granjon 2016 in our study the human is the most relevant and largest node connected in both groups the relevance of the human in the network is explained by several factors first humans enormous population and globalization push human populations to nearly everywhere on earth and greatly increases the probability of contact with innumerable organisms resulting in the emergence of zoonotic diseases kock 2014 secondly because zoonotic diseases have clear social implications once detected in one species they are much more likely to be tested for and thus detected in others olivermorales  abarca garca 2016 it is therefore possible that the high apparent importance of humans in the networks is more due to the overrepresentation of zoonotic viruses in the literature than to humans actually being particularly highly in the database we do not have ebola virus reports because in the database the dbatvir database did not identify the host species from which the virus was isolated similarly we found that 7806 of rodent nodes and 6571 of bats nodes were poorly connected 12 degree surely bats have associations that we do not recognize in addition there are associations that could occur but do not but these cannot be identified because cases in which viruses were tested for and not detected are not often reported we therefore think it is important to report negative samples and the number of animals tested in meticulous reports a future study may complement and compare our study with models where the influence of humans is omitted we must take into account that the human node influences the network structure and the ecological relationships must be analysed without this influence surely laxer networks will be observed when the connective force of humans is removed however our study does need to include both to identify potentially zoonotic viruses it is pertinent that in future investigations different characteristics of the viruses must be considered simultaneously and not only by their connectivity in the network such as gene sequence type of transmission and virulence in the present study we focus only on viral host capability not on the symbionts and their associative nature spatial analysis may help to further explain how our findings apply among different regions of the world graph theory beyond allowing the visualization of complex interactions allows the quantification of many aspects of connectivity and structure rodents should be taken into account as important reservoirs for zoonotic viruses since in our database a greater proportion of the total viruses reported were zoonotic viruses in rodents than in bats fruit bat parvovirus in bats and gbagroube virus in rodents should be monitored to elucidate their zoonotic potential in the present study we only assessed their network proximity to humans and other zoonotic viruses and molecular genetic approaches may help to confirm our results counting the number of zoonotic symbionts associated with each order is not a conclusive estimate of their zoonotic potential our findings reveal that viruses were more frequently shared among bats than rodents for that reason bats have more zoonotic potential that the rodents however potential emerging zoonotic diseases may arise from both taxonomic groups we declare that we have no conflict of interest  long-term single-dose efficacy of a vesicular stomatitis virus-based andes virus vaccine in syrian hamsters joseph prescott blair debuysscher l kyle brown s heinz feldmann   andes virus andv is a new world hantavirus family bunyaviridae genus hantavirus and is the primary etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hcps in south america with case fatality rates of 3050 andv is a zoonotic virus hosted by the long-tailed pigmy rice rat oligoryzomys longicaudatus and upon transmission to humans can cause hcps 12 human-to-human transmission has also been documented 345 currently there is no approved vaccine or specific treatment for hantaviruses that cause hcps and medical intervention is largely supportive to date the only animal model that recapitulates human disease caused by andv is the syrian hamster 67 our laboratory has recently reported that a recombinant replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vsv-based vaccine engineered to express the glycoprotein complex gpc of andv in place of the vsv glycoprotein g provides complete protection from disease in hamsters 8 hamsters were sterilely protected one month after a single dose of the vaccine upon challenge with a consistently lethal dose of andv this vaccine was also efficacious post-exposure with 90 of hamsters protected when the vaccine was administered one day after inoculation with andv the mechanisms by which this vaccine offers protection is not entirely known and might differ depending on the time of challenge as post-exposure protection is unlikely to rely on the generation of neutralizing antibodies as the vsv-vector expressing an irrelevant glycoprotein also afforded peri-exposure protection against andv challenge 8 nonetheless the vsv-based vaccine platform is known to elicit a strong humoral immune response 9 in the vsv-andv system neutralizing antibodies directed against the gpc are likely important for prophylactic vaccination herein we sought to test the kinetics of the neutralizing response elicited by this vaccine and to test the duration of immunity following a single-dose vaccination to lethal disease caused by andv in the hamster model hamsters vaccinated with vsvg-andv-gpc showed a statistically significant increase p  0025 in survival when challenged with a lethal dose of andv 6 months after vaccination with 5 of 6 of the vaccinated hamsters surviving challenge whereas a single animal of the 6 unvaccinated hamsters survived andv challenge figure 1a conversely at 12 months after vaccination the vsvg-andv-gpc-vaccinated group was not significantly protected p  0090 compared to the control group although the vaccine afforded some level of protection figure 1b at this point only a single vaccinated hamster developed signs of disease and was euthanized 2 of the 6 control hamsters survived inoculation rendering the result at this time point insignificant it is notable that a single mock vaccinated animal survived at 6 months post-vaccination and two survived at the 12-month time point our laboratory has extensive experience using the syrian hamster model of hcps and experiments are typically if not always completed by the time the animals reach 23 months of age we have rarely if ever observed a control animal survive this dose and route of andv inoculation in control animals and thus far all experiments have been performed using the same stock of virus preparation that we used in this study 710 this suggests that age likely influencing immune status might play a role in natural protection from disease other studies using older hamsters have resulted in more variability in lethality supporting that older hamsters might be more immune to disease although this needs to be addressed experimentally and it is difficult to compare studies using different routes of infection stocks of viruses and sources of animals 1112 a limitation of our study is the relatively small group sizes which makes it difficult to resolve differences between the potential survival of aged control animals and discriminating this from the durability of the vaccine repeating this study using larger group sizes as well as additional time points would both lend insight into age-related affects of survival and long-term efficacy of the vaccine to examine the kinetics of the immune response to vaccination over the course of this study we obtained serum from animals at 1 2 6 and 12 months for the animals remaining after the 6 month challenge experiment post-vaccination these sera were tested for their neutralizing activity by performing a frnt80 assay along with the sera from the unvaccinated animals none of the mock-vaccinated animals developed measurable neutralizing antibodies data not shown all vaccinated animals achieved a titer of at least 320 by 1 month and three of the 12 animals achieved titers of 640 figure 2 in all but two cases neutralizing titers dropped by 6 months of vaccination and for a single animal which developed disease when challenged at 12 months post-vaccination the titer dropped below 40 animal 14 the minimum dilution used for this assay the hamster that developed disease at 6 months post-vaccination had a neutralizing titer of 80 animal 1 two other hamsters in this group also had titers of 80 but did not develop disease whereas the other three animals had titers of at least 160 for the surviving hamsters that were challenged at 12 months two had titers of 40 and three had titers of 80 although all had titers of 80 or less the observation that they were protected when the non-protected animal at 6 months had a titer of 80 suggests that the greater age of the animals could contribute to protection this correlates with the observed increase in survival of the non-vaccinated control animals in the 12-month group where two survived at this time point and only one survived at 6 months in a previous study we observed that a single dose of this vaccine provided sterile immunity in most hamsters when challenged 28 days after vaccination 8 to test whether the surviving animals in this study were sterilely protected from andv at 6 and 12 months post-vaccination we performed an elisa to detect anti-andv-n antibodies table 1 all animals that survived challenge mock vaccinated or vaccinated developed andv-n antibodies suggesting that sterile immunity was not achieved this difference could be attributed to the longer time period between vaccination and challenge in this study and is likely related to our observed decrease in neutralizing antibody titers we used different routes of inoculation herein making it difficult to directly compare this study with our previous study we chose to inoculate hamsters intranasally with the same infectious dose of virus used previously to more closely mimic human exposure or transmission as opposed to the intraperitoneal route which was previously reported mucosal immunity might be more difficult to achieve and confer sterile immunity which might allow the virus to infect cells of the respiratory tract before being neutralized by the humoral immune response elicited by the vaccine vaccination with vsv-based vaccine vectors has provided potent long-term protection in other systems mice vaccinated with vsv expressing the spike protein s of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus were protected from lethal challenge 4 months later following a single dose administration 13 vsv expressing the ha of influenza virus were protective up to a year after vaccination although these mice were given a boost of a heterologous vsv-based vaccine prior to challenge 14 differences in the platform and animal species used might account for differences in the immune response to this vaccine in the hamster female syrian hamsters 56 weeks of age harlan labs indianapolis in usa were administered 105 pfu of vsvg-andv-gpc by intraperitoneal injection ip or sterile medium as a control the vsvg-andv-gpc was prepared as previously published 8 serum samples were obtained at the indicated times post-vaccination by retro-orbital bleeding the blood was centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min at room temperature and the serum was removed and frozen for the measurement of neutralizing antibodies either 6 or 12 months after vaccination groups of 12 hamsters 6 mock-vaccinated and 6 vaccinated with vsvg-andv-gpc were challenged with andv two hundred focus forming units ffu of andv strain 9717869 which is equivalent to 100ld50 when administered ip as used in our previous studies was diluted in 100 l of sterile medium and was delivered intranasally in while the animals were under inhalational isoflurane hamsters were monitored daily for signs of disease and were euthanized upon showing signs of severe clinical disease or at 42 days post challenge at which time a terminal blood sample was collected to measure serum antibodies to measure the neutralizing antibody response to vaccination 2-fold serial dilutions of sera were mixed 11 with approximately 100 ffu of andv and incubated for 1 h at 37 c in a humidified chamber this mixture 200 l was then used to inoculate vero e6 cells atcc for 1 h at 37 c 5 co2 the inoculum was then removed and 500 l of 12 carboxymethylcellulose in modified eagles medium mem containing 25 fbs was added to the cells and incubated at 37 c 5 co2 seven days later an immunofocus assay was performed and sera resulting in a greater than 80 reduction in foci were considered positive frnt80 as previously described 15 to examine whether hamsters that survived challenge 42 days post inoculation developed anti-andv antibodies we performed an elisa to detect antibodies directed against the andv nucleocapsid protein n as described previously 10 to determine whether vaccination resulted in significant protection from andv-induced disease we compared the survival curves between mock-vaccinated and vsvg-andv-gpc-vaccinated animals using a log-rank mantel-cox test with significance set at 005 analysis was performed using prism software version 6 graphpad software inc la jolla ca usa all work with andv-infected hamsters and potentially infectious material was conducted in the bsl4 facility at the rocky mountain laboratories division of intramural research national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases national institutes of health sample removal from the bsl4 was performed according to approved standard operating procedures this animal experiment was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee and performed following the guidelines of the association for the assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care aaalac by certified staff in an aaalac-approved facility vaccination of hamsters with a single dose of a vsv-based andv vector provided long-term protection from lethal virus challenge 6 months after administration we have shown that this vaccine has a high degree of efficacy when administered between 28 days pre- and 1 day post-challenge indicating its use in emergency situations or for laboratory-acquired infections might prove viable the decline in neutralizing antibodies at 6 and 12 months indicates that the durability of this vaccine after a single-dose application at least in hamsters is questionable booster immunizations might improve the durability of this vaccine candidate although other disease models have yet to be developed for hcps-causing hantaviruses further evaluation of vaccine approaches specifically measurement of antibody responses could be warranted in other non-disease animal models  community-acquired pneumonia viral pathogens and epidemiology

respiratory infections are caused by more than one pathogen and up to 30 mixed viral  bacterial infections can be observed cap in immunocompetent adults is rare whereas persons with underlaying diseases have an increased incidence of cap in the elderly rsv influenzaviruses parainfluenzaviruses and less frequent adenoviruses are predominant viruses causing pneumonia less frequently associated with cap are the newly discovered human metapneumovirus and the coronaviruses nl63 and hku1 hantaviruses involved in the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome belong to the emerging pathogens to date in north middle and south america for optimum diagnosis the whole spectrum of potential respiratory viral agents should be included and multiple diagnostic techniques have to be used in view of the high relevance of influenzavirus for cap influenza vaccination is highly advisable for prevention of cap especially in high-risk groups  viral infections are involved in 10-25 of cap frequently mixed infections viralviral or viralbacterial are detected cap in infants and young children is most commonly due to viral infections with the predominance of respiratory syncytial virus rsv in developing countries the incidence of viral pneumonia is higher and is a relevant reason for death of young children 1 2  the major viral pathogens are summarized in table 1  usually they cause mild self-limited illness mainly restricted to the upper respiratory tract the leading viral pathogens for severe disease are rsv and influenzaviruses in the past two decades some new mostly zoonotic viral pathogens have emerged like sars-coronavirus avian influenzaviruses and hantaviruses associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps which has crossed species barriers numerous other viruses occasionally can cause severe respiratory disease in the lower respiratory tract but they are better known for other clinical manifestations tab 2 respiratory virus infections are more common in winter and early spring but some cause respiratory illness without a clear seasonal pattern the frequency of detection of respiratory viruses varies in different studies due to methodological problems many studies did not include all known respiratory viruses additionally the prevalence of viruses may vary over time and between different geographical areas in immunocompromised patients exogenous respiratory viruses may persist with prolonged shedding individuals with a subclinical infection may be an undetectable source of transmission only a few studies have investigated respiratory viruses in asymptomatic humans with very variable results an age-dependent occurrence of asymptomatic respiratory infections has been reported with the highest frequency of 68 in young children newborn to 4 years virus-associated cap occurs mainly in infants and young children in elderly and frail adults in persons with underlying diseases and in immunocompromised patients even harmless agents like rhino-or coronaviruses frequently induce acute disorders or exacerbations in people with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases or asthma the main host and environment related risk factors have been investigated but the influence of various other factors which can predispose cap is controversial in general the viral-associated cap decreases with age in several recent studies in developed countries a pathogen was detected in 79 to 85 in immunocompetent children with cap 25 to 62 of the patients had evidence of a single viral infection 8 to 11 for viralviral infection and 23 to 43 a viralbacterial infection inflammation and disease were more severe in viralbacterial infection 3 4 5 6  in nonimmunocompromised adults the demonstrated viral etiology is less common roux et al 7 identified a pathogen only in 38 of the cases with a proportion of viral infections of approximately 20 single viral infection 9 with influenzavirus as the most frequently identified viral agent in this study chronic heart failure chf was a risk factor for virus infections the virus is composed of nonenveloped icosahedral particles containing a double-stranded linear dna genome they are 70-90 nm in diameter and consist of 252 capsomers hexons and pentons with filamentous glycoproteins fibers on the penton bases which display characteristic different lengths human adenoviruses have been classified into six species subgen- era a-f on the basis of antigenicity and other biological properties hemagglutination tumorogenicity in animals this is in quite good agreement with classification based on genomic differences like dna homology of less than 20 between viruses of the different subgenera serotype-specific epitopes are predominantly found on the hexon capsomere and the terminal part of the fiber and are defined by the quantitative neutralization test at present 51 serotypes have been identified by neutralizing antibodies and nine of these are documented as respiratory pathogens adenoviruses are very resistant also against proteolytic enzymes in the intestinal tract the species c adenoviruses 1 2 5 and 6 are endemic and are responsible for approximately 60 of all human adenovirus infections adv 6 only for 4 and for more than 80 of the adenovirus infections most commonly adv 1 and 2 early in life whereas they cause 15 of symptomatic lower respiratory tract infections after primary infection c viruses may be shed in feces for months or even years following the initial infection the c viruses establish a lifelong asymptomatic persistent infection with currently unknown state of viral persistence probable places of persistence are tonsils and adenoids new data suggest that human mucosal t-lymphocytes may harbor c adenoviruses in a latent form 8  premature infants are at high risk to develop disseminated neonatal adenovirus infection with pneumonia and high lethality 9  in infants and children adenovirus infections primarily occur between 6 month and 5 years and are responsible for 4-10 of childhood pneumonias outbreaks in predominantly healthy children are most frequently associated with type 7 followed by types 3 and 21 10 11 12  for adv 7-infected children at high risk the mortality rate is up to 40 and 12 in healthy children 13  adv differ in their ability to induce inflammatory response in lung tissue but particularly adv 7 is involved in severe lung inflammation and neutrophil infiltration 14  the incidence of adv infection may vary and depends on the detection assays and the study population in general it is higher in children 21 than in adults 9 15 16  in 50 of the described cases a viral coinfection was recognized 8 17  it is likely that adv infections were caused also by reactivation of endogenous virus further these infections are not linked to seasonal pattern adenovirus epidemics do occur in human populations living in crowded conditions with poor hygiene a large outbreak predominantly caused by types 4 and 7 was observed between 1950 and 1960 in 10 of the recruits in the us military ninety percent of the adv-infected persons developed pneumonia vaccination against adv 4 and 7 since 1971 has effectively reduced illness from these serotypes 18  recent epidemiological studies have shown that latent subgroup c viruses are involved in some chronic diseases in immmunocompetent patients which are at high risk for pneumonia induced by other viral pathogens 19 20  disseminated adenovirus infections are difficult to treat and the agents used ribavirin and cidofovir yielded variable results the benefit of intravenous ribavirin a synthetic guanosine analog treatment in life-threatening disease especially in immunocompromised patients seemed to be better if antiviral therapy was started early other reports could not show a clear beneficial effect in vivo as well as in vitro data suggest that susceptibility to ribavirin is highly dependent on the virus species 22 23  viruses of subgroup c were shown to be sensitive to ribavirin whereas serotypes of the subgroups a b d e and f were resistant despite a high level and long treatment in some patients no changes in sensitivity of the virus isolates against ribavirin to date have been reported cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue of cytosine with an effective in vitro activity against different dna viruses adenoviruses included treatment is indicated for severe disseminated adv infections but results are varying and treatment is limited by severe nephrotoxicity emergence of resistant adv has been observed only in experimental systems coronaviruses are spherical pleomorphic enveloped viruses with a diameter of 80-200 nm they possess the largest genomes of all rna viruses the single-stranded positive rna is associated with the nucleoprotein n forming the helical nucleoprotein complex it is surrounded by the envelope which contains three characteristic surface structures the s protein the membrane protein m and the envelope protein e oligomeres of the s protein are formed to spikes on the virion surface and resemble a solar corona the s protein determines cell tropism is responsible for pathogenicity and is the strongest inducer of neutralizing antibodies some coro- naviruses contain a fourth envelope protein with a hemagglutinating and esterase activity four serogroups have been distinguished containing three human pathogens group 1 with the prototype hcov-229e group 2 with the known hcov-oc43 in 2003 the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars led to the detection of a novel coronavirus the consecutive extensive research in this field led to the discovery of further coronaviruses see the following after rhinoviruses coronaviruses are most frequently associated with the common cold 15-30 in young adults and they seem not to pose a risk for healthy elderly non sars coronaviruses rarely cause pneumonia however they may cause diseases of the lower respiratory tract lrt in infants immunocompromised patients patients with underlying diseases and in frail older adults during endemic outbreaks of hcov-oc43 and -229e only elderly patients at risk rarely develop pneumonia 24 25  hcov-nl63 first described in 2004 in the netherlands but although widespread within the human population it is seldom responsible for pneumonia in children 26 27 28  recently a novel coronavirus hcov-hku1 from an 71-year-old patient with copd and pneumonia was described in hong kong 29  hku1-associated pneumonias so far described occur from winter to spring predominantly in the elderly 80 were  65 years with comorbidity 30  in november 2002 a new emerging disease sars was described in china as a contagious potentially lethal atypical pneumonia the sars-cov originated from animal viruses which could be the result of recombination between mammalian and avian coronaviruses by june 2003 worldwide 8447 cases of this illness from  30 countries were registered with more than 800 deaths lethality 95 sars-cov seems to have a distinct cell entry pathway the initial infection is possible with an extreme low infectious dose resulting in the generation of proteases in the lung which are responsible for a 100-to 1000-fold more efficient rate of infection 31  in younger children sars often induces a relatively mild and nonspecific respiratory illness 32 33  in a chinese study the overall mortality rate was 197 but increased to 786 in the patient group with serious underlying diseases 34  24 -hku1 29 therapy and resistance there is no information about antiviral treatment of hcov infections and the rare cases of hcov associated pneumonia at present also no standard antiviral therapy can be recommended for sars ribavirin and corticosteroids used in severely ill patients seemed to be effective and a better outcome was reported after combination therapy with lopinavirritonavir ribavirin plus steroid 35  nothing is known about emergence of resistant virus variants human and avian influenzaviruses are described in separate chapters within this book only the epidemiological association with cap and the virological diagnosis are discussed in this chapter children 1 to 5 years and adults with comorbidity predominantly chronic heart disease and broncho-pulmonary dysplasia pregnant women in the second or third trimester and persons  65 years are at high risk for influenza virus-associated pneumonia using sensitive methods it has been shown that the prevalence of influenza infections in older children with cap may be higher and mixed infections mostly viralbacterial infections were documented in up to 35 3 21  influenza a virus-associated pneumonia in pregnancy is accompanied by higher morbidity and lethality and infants may be born preterm with low weight although pneumonia in elderly patients may present only with few respiratory signs recovery is prolonged especially in the frail elderly where the incidence of pneumonia is highest 7 36  mixed infections are more common in the older age groups but single virus infections are seen increasingly in the patients over 65 years 37  influenza b virus-associated pneumonia is rare and has been reported in single cases in children 38 39   hpiv are pleomorphic enveloped viruses of between 150 and 300 nm they contain a helical nucleocapsid with single-stranded negative rna it encodes at least six structural proteins and two nonstructural proteins important are the two envelope glycoproteins hn hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and f fusion responsible for neutralizing antibodies within the family of the paramyxoviruses only hpiv express neuraminidase activity four major hpiv serotypes exist which are divided into subtypes and genotypes with steadily occurring antigenic variations types 1 2 and 3 are distributed worldwide while type 4 is predominantly spread in america the four serotypes are distinct in their epidemiological and clinical behavior hpiv 3 is endemic throughout the year but there are yearly epidemic outbreaks from winter to spring hpiv 1 and 2 are associated with a biennial epidemic pattern with the peak from fall to winter parainfluenzaviruses 1 to 3 particularly type 3 seem to have the highest virulence and the capacity to persist the majority of type 1 infections occur in children between the second and third year of life whereas 60 of type 2 are in children younger than 5 years with a peak incidence between the first and second year they are most commonly associated with croup or laryngitis but may also cause pneumonia type 1 can be found in hospitalized previously healthy adults and may be involved in bacterial pneumonias hpiv-3 infections occur in 40 of young infants in the first year of life and in most children in the first two years pneumonia with type 3 is seen primarily in the first 6 months of life similar to rsv but with lower frequency 41  like rsv hpiv can reinfect both children and adults with predominantly mild respiratory tract symptoms accompanied by low and short virus shedding 42 43  in childhood cap parainfluenzavirus 1-3 infections beside rsv and influenzaviruses are the most common viral pathogens which are involved in up to 10 of the diseases 3 4 40 44  parainfluenza virus infections have been reported in the elderly with pneumonia in up to 12 of cases 43  viral cap in adults with comorbidity like copd or chf is characterized by a more severe clinical outcome 7 45  viralbacterial coinfections approximately 20 are observed frequently ribavirin has in vitro activity against hpiv and both aerosolized and intravenous ribavirin have been used there are anecdotal reports about reduction of clinical signs and viral load in immunocompromised patients when treatment was started early after onset symptoms ribavirin resistant virus variants have not been described rsv is a negative-strand rna virus it is pleomorphic and has a size of 150-300 nm in diameter the genome encodes eight structural and two nonstructural proteins the helical capsid is surrounded by an envelope with three surface glycoproteins the fusion f protein which mediates membrane fusion with the host cell resulting in viral penetration the g protein which is responsible for attachment to the host cell and an sh protein with unknown function in contrast to other paramyxoviruses a hemagglutinin and neuraminidase function do not exist the g protein has the highest degree of antigenic diversity in rsv it accounts for the strain-specific epitopes and allows the classification into two antigenic groups rsv-a and rsv-b with multiple genotypes 46  immunologically important are the f and the g glycoproteins inducing protective neutralizing antibodies however immune-protection is not complete and early reinfections occur the g glycoprotein is produced as a membrane bound and a secretioned form the secretioned form is able to modulate the innate immune response to rsv and priming with this protein increases the severity of illness after rsv reinfection in children with severe disease caused by rsv the type 2 th-cell response seems to be dominant the g protein induces an unbalanced thcell response which in the lung could result in airway hyperresponsiveness mucus hypersecretionion and inflammation and may contribute to peripheral blood and pulmonary eosinophilia 47  rsv infections occur worldwide peaking in the winter months in temperate climates and in the rainy season in tropical climates a and b viruses and their multiple variants generally circulate simultaneously within epidemical outbreaks yearly outbreaks are possible because the pattern of the circulating rsv strains changes depending on the local strain-specific immunity in the human population 48  rsv is the most important cause of acute respiratory tract viral infection in infants primary infections are symptomatic with a spectrum of clinical manifestations from mild upper tract illness to life-threatening pneumonia rsv accounts for 50 of all cases of pneumonia during the first 2 years of life the peak incidence of rsv lower respiratory tract infection lrti is between 1 and 6 months of age maternal rsv-specific antibodies rapidly decrease after birth to approximately 6 at 3 months this may be the reason for the high frequency of rsv infections before 3 months of age 49  premature infants 28 to 32 weeks are at risk for 12 to 6 months after birth all children get infected once until the age of 2 years but 50 of them already had experienced re-infections 4 21 40 50 51 52  there are numerous independent risk factors for severe rsv infection including genetic factors that are under discussion in immunocompromised children rsv-related mortality with very high rsv load was 15 and for children with primary immunodeficiencies 40 53  in immunocompetent adults younger than 60 years rsv reinfections are generally mild and may contribute to 2-4 of the lower respiratory tract infections in elderly people reinfections can induce life-threatening pneumonitis similar to children there may exist specific risk factors for severe rsv disease in different studies in adult and elderly patients 3-10 developed rsv diseases depending on risk factors the infections accounted for 11 of hospitalizations for pneumonia 54 55 56  the development of a prophylactic vaccine against rsv was pursued with a high priority the formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine developed in the 1960s unfortunately led to a more severe lung disease in vaccinated children after a subsequent rsv challenge 57  ribavirin is licensed to treat severe rsv-associated diseases in children immune globulin for intravenous administration and a humanized monoclonal antibody preparation palivizumab synagis are designed to prevent or reduce the severity of rsv infection it has been shown that in rsv-infected infants with lower respiratory tract disease ribavirin aerosol therapy improves clinical outcome but may be effective in adults as well despite high dose and prolonged treatment in some patients no ribavirinresistant rsv variants have been isolated 58  this recently identified paramyxovirus is most closely related to the pneumovirus rsv but hmpv differs from rsv in two aspects it is lacking the nonstructural proteins ns1 and ns2 and it has a different gene constellation hpmv is classified into two main lineages a and b based on sequence analyses of the f gen further sequence analysis of different hmpv genes including the g gene are required for refined characterization of the virus isolates the two major groups with numerous genotypes cocirculate throughout the year sometimes even genetically distinct strains of hmpv are circulating during the same year most infections have been detected during late winter and early spring following the peak activity of both rsv and influenzavirus the virus was first detected in young children in 2001 in the netherlands 59  but serological studies showed that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years hmpv has a worldwide distribution and association with respiratory illness in all age groups it causes upper respiratory tract infections but is also associated with lower respiratory tract infections it has been suggested that most severe hmpv infections occur in children  2 years of age and seem to peak in the third and fifth months of life somewhat later than rsv it is found less frequently in hospitalized children than rsv and the clinical course may be milder based on the presence of hmpv antibodies approximately 55 of children at the age of two and 100 at the age of 5-10 years had a hmpv history hmpv like rsv may cause clinical important reinfections in late childhood and adult life but the highest infection rate was found in young adults hmpv also can be responsible for pneumonia in premature born babies 60 and other persons at risk although in the study of maggi et al 61 the number of infants with age less than 2 years is small the majority of the hmpv-infected children developed pneumonia the incidence in this study was higher 33 than in other reports but the difference is related to the difference in the population of children studied 62 63  the rate of bronchopneumonias was higher in children with isolated hmpv infection than in children with mixed infections surprising in this study 61 was the detection of hmpv rna in plasma of 41 of hmpv-infected children like was shown also for rsv infections hmpv pneumonia clinically cannot be distinguished from rsv and influenza but the disease seems to be somewhat less severe and there is a greater percentage of cases with underlying diseases 25 compared to the influenza-or rsv-associated pneumonia  10 small studies demonstrated that hmpv is a relatively important viral pathogen which can also lead to pneumonia 14 especially in elderly and adults with underlying disease like copd chf or asthma 64  additional studies will be needed especially year-long active surveillance over consecutive years with analysis of more data from future respiratory seasons to fully define the clinical and epidemic impact of hmpv infections therapy and resistance no antiviral agents or antibody preparations are currently available for the treatment of hmpv infection it was shown that ribavirin and a polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin had equivalent in vitro activity against both hmpv and rsv treatment may be considered for severe hmpv infection in immunocompromised patients 65  no reports about resistant hmpv exist picornaviruses are nonenveloped particles and with a diameter of 30 nm they are very small they consist of a single positive-strand rna genome surrounded by an icosahedral capsid composed of 60 protomers each protomer consists of three nonglycosylated surface proteins vp1 to vp3 and internal proteins vp4 in the center of each protomeric unit is a canyon where antigenic sites and structures can be found binding to receptors of the target cells there are over 100 immunologically distinct rhinovirus serotypes and two species a and b can be distinguished rhinoviruses are acidlabile and differ in membrane receptor recognition further more than 60 enterovirus serotypes exist rhinoviruses are ubiquitous and infections by relatively low infectious doses occur throughout the year they are the most important pathogens of the common cold in 80-90 of humans during the peak season in late autumn rhinoviruses are able to infect the lower respiratory tract it has been shown in experimental infections that a lower respiratory infection with rhinoviruses detected in bronchial biopsy samples during common cold is not unusual picornaviruses are the most frequently detected virus in respiratory tract infections in the first year of life in hospitalized infants with acute expiratory wheezing illness respiratory picornaviruses rhino-and enteroviruses are found in 42 of the cases in older children picornaviruses are predominant with 65 at the age of 1-2 years and with 82 in children older than 3 years 66 67  earlier studies have not included rhinoviruses but current data suggest that they are rarely involved in pneumonia in infants young children and in older adults rhinoviruses can cause pneumonia in children of the age group 0-6 months but the highest isolation rate was found in children between 6 and 12 months with the same frequency as rsv 4 24 68 69  coinfections of rhinoviruses and bacteria were found in pediatric patients with cap in about 10 the inflammatory response to rhinovirus infection is strong and several cytokines are related to pneumonia like il-6 which may be an important factor in rhinovirus pathogenesis 68 70  in a recent review about enterovirus-associated respiratory tract diseases rotbart et al 71 reported that 13 of infected patients presented with pneumonia in contrast kellner et al 69 in a prospective study recovered enteroviruses only sporadically from children with upper respiratory tract disease however case reports exist about fatal pneumonias in congenital and neonatal echovirus-infected infants in these rare and sporadic cases a maternal disease has been reported in 59 to 68 71 72 73 74 75  epidemic outbreaks of hand foot and mouth disease with enterovirus 7071 in children have been observed where after cns involvement pulmonary edema appeared 76  using modern diagnostic methods it is increasingly recognized that rhinovirus and enterovirus infections are the most common reasons for unnecessary antibiotic therapy the most promising antiviral of the so called win compounds is pleconaril with a broad potent anti-ev and anti-rv activity it binds to hydrophobic sites in the base of the capsid canyons and inhibits uncoating of the capsid in all enteroviruses rhinoviruses of the species b have a significant reduced susceptibility to pleconaril for therapeutic application it will be important to differentiate between natural occurring resistance to pleconaril in b rhinoviruses and the emergence of rv resistance under pleconaril treatment 77  pleconaril has been shown to be effective in experimental studies and to significantly reduce clinical symptoms in treated adult volunteers it is available for life threatening enterovirus infections in immunocompromised patients ten percent of the enterovirus isolates have been shown to be resistant to pleconaril and some patients did not respond resistant virus has been identified ruprintrivir is an inhibitor of the virally encoded 3c protease which is still under investigation for treatment of rhinovirus infection in immunocompetent patients 78  hantaviruses are enveloped predominantly negative-strand rna viruses ambisense the genome of these viruses consists of three different singlestranded rna segments the segments l m and s encode the viral polymerase a glycoprotein processed into g1 and g2 glycoproteins located in the envelope and a nucleocapsidprotein virus particles are of spherical shape with a diameter of 80-120 nm but also elongated forms are seen 170 nm hantaviruses are important zoonotic pathogens primarily of rodents the infections are per-sistent and most of them seem to be asymptomatic in the natural rodent hosts antibodies against hantaviruses are also present in nonnatural hosts other wild and domestic animals beside the transmission to humans through humanrodent contacts infections are acquired by inhalation of virus-contaminated aerosols of rodent excreta saliva urine or feces 79  an occasional transmission may occur from person to person as was documented for andes virus in argentina some hantaviruses belong to the so called emerging pathogens they cause an influenza-like acute pulmonary disease in north middle and south america the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps the first hps was recognized in 1993 in the usa and was caused by a number of hantavirus variants eg sin nombre virus snv symptoms of hps may vary depending on the virus genotype in 1995 cases of hps were reported in south america and a new strain -the andes hantavirus -was identified in late 1999 and early 2000 first outbreaks through an again novel hantavirus the choclo virus were documented in central america the overall mortality was about 44 but is declining as a consequence of better recognizing less severe forms of the infections and a better medical management confirmed cases of hps so far include children but in the majority of cases adults 19 to 58 years snv accounts for a small number of pediatric cases in the us whereas andes virus was found in pediatric patients chile south argentina in a higher proportion 16 80 81 82  the incubation period for andes virus in chile was 5 to 25 days febrile prodromi last for approximately 4 days followed by a rapid progression to moderate to severe respiratory distress for hantavirus diseases no established specific therapy is currently available ribavirin shows activity against hv but this has not been well documented in studies emergence of resistant hv is unknown in developing countries the frequent complications of measles virus infection are responsible for the mortality rate measles virus infection causes a transient and strong immunosuppression which is the reason for the increased susceptibility to other viral or bacterial infections in 3-4 of the infected patients measles virus can cause pneumonia which can be present either as primary measles virus pneumonia or as atypical measles virus pneumonia but most patients develop secondary bacterial pneumonia measles pneumonia rarely occurs in young adults as shown in 1976 to 1979 when a measles outbreak in us air force recruits was responsible for 106 cases with pneumonia 33 of which two-thirds had a secondary bacterial infection 83  during pregnancy measles virus infections induce a higher number of pneumonias in the mother 84 85  there are a few reports about preterm and newborn infants in which measles pneumonia was observed 86  after primary infection herpes viruses are able to persist lifelong in their human host typically as latent infection but they also reactivate under immunosuppression and then some of them like cmv hsv vzv ebv and hhv6 may induce pneumonia hsv-1 pneumonia may occur occasionally in high-risk persons rarely disseminated hsv infections during pregnancy have been reported as in the case of a previously healthy womn with a fatal progressive hsv-2 pneumonia in the third trimester of pregnancy 87  ramsey et al reported 20 patients with pneumonia in which they could differentiate between cases with focal hsv pneumonia as a result of hsv spreading to the lung parenchyma and cases with interstitial pneumonia as a result of a hematogenous dissemination of hsv 88  in immunocompetent adults primary vzv infection is uncommon but the incidence is increasing 5-10 and vzv pneumonia is the main complication incidence 55-165 with high mortality some patients may develop secondary bacterial pneumonia most patients 767 do have at least one known risk factor like pregnancy smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 84 89 90 91  vzv beside influenzavirus is the most common pathogen causing pneumonia during pregnancy predominantly in the second and third trimester the risk of primary vzv infection for vzv pneumonia during pregnancy 01-183 is higher if patients are smokers or manifest multiple  100 skin lesions the mortality rate before a possible antiviral intervention was significantly higher in pregnancy 41 versus 15-121 89 92 93  vzv pneumonias as consequence of a primary vzv infection in childhood are rare 94  cmv-infected preterm infants can develop a chronic lung disease which may be associated with cmv pneumonia with high mortality ganciclovir treatment has been shown to rapidly improve symptoms a fact that supports cmv causality of pneumonia 95 96 97  extremely rare are reports about cmv pneumonia in previously healthy adults 98  in patients with lymphoma cmv pneumonia is less common and the incidence after chemotherapy and corticosteroid application is approximately 1 with a mortality rate of 30 99  two genetically distinct variants hhv-6a and -6b do exist but in primary infection the variant -6b is dominant during primary infection a severe respiratory disease is an extremely rare complication in a case report from knox et al 100 a fatal pneumonitis due to hhv-6 infection is documented in an infant with severe t lymphocytopenia whereas for immunocompromised patients bmt hhv-6 pneumonia is documented in immunocompetent patients an etiologic role of the reactivated hhv-6 infection in pneumonia is not clearly defined 101 102  another report of an extremely rare case with hhv-6-associated pneumonia is documented by merk et al 103  where an apparently immunocompetent young women developed a fatal pneumonia a mild asymptomatic pneumonitis is described in 5-10 of the cases with infectious mononucleosis but a severe pneumonitis as result of primary ebv infection is rare in immunocompetent patients 84 104 105  in patients with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia ebv dna has been found in lung tissues of infants children and of adults as well 106 107 108  in autopsy cases with diffuse interstitial pneumonia ebv dna could be detected in leukocytes and pneumocytes and frequently in airway epithelial cells 109  the ebv-associated lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia without hiv infection has been reported predominantly in adults this is also true for a rare chronic interstitial lung disease due to ebv mainly seen in adults but also shown in two infants in early months of life 106 110  especially in adult patients respiratory virus infections are extremely underdiagnosed since adequate and possible virological diagnosis is not routinely performed for diagnosis of acute respiratory infections the detection of infectious viruses or viral components proteins nucleic acid is the method of choice whereas antibody detection is not relevant and should only be used in selected patients at later timepoints after infection using paired sera nasopharyngeal aspirate npa is the gold standard for the detection of all major respiratory viruses predominantly adopted in infants and children npa is taken by suction of cell-containing mucosal secretion from the nasopharyngeal area approximately 05 ml fluid should be collected into 2 ml of viral transport medium nasal lavage can be obtained with less discomfort for the patient by gently instilling 2 ml pbs at room temperature into each nostril and by simultaneously suctioning into a sterile trap the sensitivity for virus detection is comparable to that of npa but is controversially reported for rsv 111 112  nasopharyngeal swab taken usually from adults is obtained by deep bilateral nasal and posterior pharynx swabs with sterile cotton swabs which should then be placed in 3 ml viral transport medium vtm 113  calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden sticks may contain substances which inactivate some viruses and inhibit pcr testing and should not be used tracheal aspirate can be collected from intubated patients after instillation of 4-10 ml sterile normal saline into the endotracheal tube and by suctioning into a sterile trap this is the most easily obtained specimen from lower respiratory tract in these patients 114  induced sputum should be collected in the morning after rinsing mouth and throat with sterile hypertonic saline thereafter sputum has to be collected in a sterile container induced sputum represents a more complete sampling of the respiratory tract and is comparable with nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens while induced sputum might be used for virus detection from the lower respiratory tract the obligate admixture of saliva with the accompanied flora is an obvious disadvantage nevertheless with minimal saliva contamination it is a valuable alternative material to bal 115 116  bronchioalveolare lavage bal has a high diagnostic yield for infectious pathogens predominantly in immunocompromised patients with lung infiltrates transbronchial biopsy tbb  lung biopsy this invasive technique can in addition to bal significantly improve the diagnostic yield 117  edta blood in immunosuppressed patients may facilitate diagnosis of some viruses eg adenovirus cmv and disseminated virus infections and determination of the virus load may be predictive for disease and outcome furthermore virus load is important for monitoring of therapy enzymeimmunoassays eia for rapid viral antigen detection in airway secretions exist for almost all major respiratory viruses but have been often evaluated only for children and may vary in sensitivity and specificity range between 60 and 95 results from eias for detection of single respiratory viruses are usually available between 10 min to 3 h alternatively a screening for respiratory viruses in an airway secretion can be achieved by indirect immunofluorescent antigen assay ifa sensitivity 85-95 specificity 95-99 using a pool of monoclonal antibodies whose specificity is directed against rsv influenzaviruses a b parainfluenzaviruses 1 2 3 and adenovirus the examination of several cell spots of a cytospin preparation on slides with pooled and single antisera allows viral antigen detection and typing within 2 h the results are strongly dependent on the quality of the clinical material for elderly hospitalized and immunocompromised patients with virus associated lrti the rapid virusantigen detection is insensitive when rapid conventional methods are not available like for coronaviruses metapneumoviruses rhinoviruses or enteroviruses the pcr has to be established the pcr may be used alternatively to the mentioned antigen detection assays it offers a great sensitivity and can be used for a wider range of viral pathogens in principle pcr can detect and differentiate several viruses simultaneously in a single reaction mixture as multiple rt-pcr multiplex pcr but it provides a lower sensitivity than pcr for single pathogens and is more difficult to establish for early detection and monitoring of viral infections the quantitative pcr represents a sensitive technique that delivers results within 3 h for diagnosis of disseminated virus infections with pulmonary manifestations frequently caused by adenoviruses rsv in infants or nonconventional respiratory viruses like cmv additional analysis of plasma or edta blood is helpful clinical specimen namely secretions of the respiratory tract can be used for an infectivity assay in centrifuge enhanced shell vial culture svc after inoculation of airway specimens on different cell systems which are susceptible for many of the respiratory viruses cell cultures are evaluated for early virus infection after 24-72 h with a pool of virus-specific monoclonal antibodies and afterwards for typing with the respective individual monoclonal antibodies by ifa once isolated the virus must be typed again preferentially with ifa using virus-specific monoclonal antibodies or otherwise increasingly by pcr conventional cell culture with virus isolation has no impact on clinical decision and management of patients during hospitalization virus isolation is useful for a characterization of virus strains involved in epidemic outbreaks serology is not useful during the acute phase of infection due to the delayed onset of the antibody response approximately at the end of the first week of disease serological methods can detect antibodies to use only serological methods for diagnosis of viral infections in cap is not at all sufficient paired serum samples may be used to detect seroconversion or a fourfold increase in antibody titer comparing the first and the second serum serology in addition is of limited value in newborns with maternal antibodies in immunocompromised patients in the elderly and patients receiving blood products antibody detection can be done with the complement fixation test cft increasingly obsolete elisa-igg -iga -igm immunofluorescent assays immunoblot and neutralization test adenovirus viruses can be detected in 25 to 72 of patients with disseminated infection in peripheral blood for more than 3 weeks detection of virus from multiple sites correlates with more severe disease and higher mortality it is essential to monitor viral load during antiviral therapy phenotyping of isolates can be done by neutralization test by hemagglutination test or by serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies and finally by pcr group-specific antigens are used in cft for antibody detection in the second week of disease cft is insufficient to detect antibodies in infants igg antibodies are detectable by elisa at the end of the second week whereas igm antibodies are not detectable in all cases with primary infection 10  hcovs antigen can be detected by ift using rabbit antisera no monoclonals available coronaviruses rna can be detected with rt-pcr also in stool sars-cov can be detected in plasma but in urine and stool longer than 4 weeks virus load is unusually low in the early phase of sars a chip-based test detecting 10 respiratory viral pathogens including coronaviruses has been developed non-sars human coronaviruses are difficult to isolate with sars-hcov no igg and igm antibodies can be found within the first 7 days of disease seroconversion may be delayed up to 8 weeks and igg does not persist 34 118 119  rapid antigen detection tests are available 15 min which differentiate between a and b viruses and some now include avian influenza virus h5n1 sensitivity and specificity range from 60-95 and 52-99 respectively rt-pcr is much more sensitive and allows virus typing virus isolation is still important for characterization of circulating influenza strains antibody detection with elisa-igg -iga and ifa-igg -iga is possible but shows low levels of both igg and iga a delayed peak antibody titer and shorter persistence of antibodies in elderly patients in adults and elderly people virus shedding is lower and shorter rt-pcr is more sensitive in patients with parainfluenzavirus and rsv infections particularly reinfections and it might be useful especially for rapid diagnosis in elderly for rapid rsv antigen detection in pediatric patients different antigen detection assays 20 min with sensitivities between 61 to 92 and specificities between 93 to 98 are available 120  alternatively the rapid immunofluorescent antigen assay can be used since rsv is thermolabile it is important to use a qualified transport medium and to have a cooled and short transport until processing 30 min the shell vial culture assay shows the highest sensitivity 943 and specificity 969 for detecting rsv from npa in children younger than 1 year only 41 of rsv-infected children could be identified by serology and antibodies titers that develop are usually low although both serum and secretory antibodies are produced 121  commercial monoclonal antibodies are available for ifa the sensitivity and specificity of this test is 733 and 97 respectively and results agree with rt-pcr in 896 122  isolation of hmpv is difficult and regardless of cpe the use of rt-pcr to enhance the hmpv identification in cell culture is indicated no commercial tests are available for antibody detection due to more than 100 distinct serotypes a rapid detection of rhinovirus capsid antigen cannot be developed the application of molecular assays has markedly increased the detection rate of picornaviruses in acute respiratory infections rhinovirus culture is the gold standard but it takes 3 to 7 days the sensitivity of pcr is superior to the infectivity detection in the cell culture no reliable typespecific serological test for rhinovirus infections exists entervoirus serology by neutralization tests is possible but difficult and not completely reliable currently no antigen detection assay is available rt-pcr for hantavirus rna detection is useful to detect infection and to identify the viral genotype rt-pcr for viral rna detection can be done from whole blood or serum during the acute phase in the first 10 days of illness virus isolation is inefficient and there is no routine assay serum specimens were tested for igm and igg antibodies by elisa using sin nombre virus antigen according to the guidelines of the us centers for disease control cdc positive results indicate infections with new world hantaviruses igm antibodies can be detected in all acute cases maximal igg level occurs during the first week of illness and are detectable after disease for a relatively long period since hsv vzv and cmv pneumonia can be effectively treated it is important to rapidly investigate specimens from the lower respiratory tract because pneumonia can only be established on the basis of bal or lung tissue examined by pcr hsv vzv andor shell vial culture hsv serologic tests are not relevant in case of hsv reactivation primary vzv infection can be confirmed by igm detection and by igg seroconversion in premature infants with risk for cmv pneumonia cmv dna can be found directly by pcr in urine and in the pharynx virus detection in air-way specimens virus load in bal and lung tissue will be positive before seronconversion in various studies and case reports it has been shown that respiratory viral pathogens are frequently involved in community-acquired pneumonia age groups at risk are the very young and elderly as well as persons with comorbidity where immune response is restricted the frequency of detection of respiratory viruses varies in different studies due to methodological problems patient selection and the fact that only detection of specific viruses was performed with modern diagnostic tools it has been increasingly realized that rhinovirus and enterovirus infections are the most common reasons for unnecessary antibiotic therapy often also adenovirus infections future studies have to consider the whole range of viral agents that can be involved in community-aquired pneumonia in recent decades several new respiratory viruses have been described and it is reasonable to assume that new viruses or virus types from different virus families will emerge in the future often after having crossed a host species barrier with high pathogenic potential for severe pulmonary diseases most of the relevant infections can be diagnosed by virus detection several studies in children have documented a significant proportion 25 to 30 of viralbacterial infections beside isolated virus infections children with isolated virus infection tended to be younger than coinfected children the implications of coinfecting agents in epidemiology pathogenicity and clinical outcome have to be

andres ruiz-linares maria bortolini ctira toomas kivisild   human cultural practices have drastically modified environmental conditions and behaviors promoting rapid and substantial genomic changes often associated with positive selection and adaptation gene-culture dynamics 1 2 in the history of homo sapiens sapiens a particularly important event that triggered a new and striking gene-culture-coevolution cycle was the development of agriculture and animal domestication during the neolithic period 10000 years ago further the human gene-culture coevolution mediated by the domestication of plants and animals has been argued to provide some of the clearest and most spectacular examples of niche construction the niche construction theory can be defined as a branch of evolutionary biology that emphasizes on the ability of organisms to modify the pressure of natural selection in their environment and thereby act as co-directors of their own evolution as well as that of other directly associated species 36 although more than 100 regionsgenes had been identified as the likely targets of recent positive selection resulting from cultural pressures in newly constructed niches 1 well-documented examples are scarce one of the best-known cases of gene-culture coevolution is lactase persistence lp the ability of adult humans to digest the lactose found in fresh milk and dairying high frequencies of lp are generally observed in traditional pastoralist populations for example lp reaches 64 in beni amir pastoralists from sudan whereas its frequency in a neighboring non-pastoralist community is only 20 in europe lp varies from 1554 in eastern and southern regions 6286 in central and western regions and 8996 in northern regions 5 713 multiple independent mutations have been associated with this characteristic some of which are located in an intron of the mcm6 gene a region fundamental to lactase expression 5 14 the alleles that led to lactose persistence in europe such as mcm6 13910t first underwent selection among dairying farmers around 7500 years ago possibly in association with the dissemination of the neolithic linearbandkeramik culture over central europe 13 the high copy number variation of the amylase gene and the spread of the corresponding alleles in agricultural societies are another well-studied example 7 8 11 15 16 additionally the west african kwa-speaking agriculturalists cut and clear the forest to grow yams increasing the amount of standing water after rain therefore providing better breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes 1 favoring the hbs allele which confers protection against malaria in heterozygous individuals 17 america was the last continent colonized by modern humans in prehistoric times in less than 15000 years before present ybp these first migrants had to adapt to an immensely wide variety of environments in some regions during this evolutionary trajectory as in mesoamerica and the andes hunter-gathererforager societies gave rise to agriculturalist and urban communities while others remained with a hunter-gathererforager subsistence system until the time of contact with europeans or even until the present day thus studies with native american populations can provide useful information for better understanding gene-culture coevolution and the niche construction processes based on studies with blood groups and other classical genetic polymorphisms j v neel and f m salzano were pioneers in identifying complex population processes highly dependent on cultural factors in native americans eg fission-fusion dynamic 18 other examples are related to the coevolution of genes and languages 19 20 but only two more recently reported examples might be associated with positive selection 1 tovo-rodrigues et al
21 investigated the distribution of d4 dopamine receptor drd4 alleles in several south amerindian populations and found a significant difference in the allelic distributions between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists with an increase of the 7r allele among the former and 2 acua-alonzo et al 22 showed that the 230cys allele arg230cys rs9282541 of the atp-binding cassette transporter a1 abca1 gene which was previously associated with low hdl-cholesterol levels and obesity-related comorbidities was exclusively present in native american and mestizo individuals these authors verified that cells expressing the abca1230cys allele showed a 27 cholesterol efflux reduction confirming that this native american autochthonous variant has a functional effect in vitro other investigations have shown that the presence of abca1230cys explains almost 4 of the variation in plasma hdl-c concentrations in mexican admixed populations 23 this variation in hdl-c concentration was the highest one associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism snp among different continental populations in these genome-wide association studies corroborating its functionality 23 acua-alonzo et al
22 demonstrated that 230cys resides in a haplotype that was the target of an ongoing directional selective sweep suggesting that 230cys conferred an advantage during periods of food deprivation in the past on the other hand under the current modern lifestyle 230cys may have become a major susceptibility allele for low hdl levels and has been correlated with metabolic diseases 22 this study provides an example of the thrifty genotype hypothesis which postulates that variants that increase the efficiency of energy use and storage during periods of famine would have been positively selected in prehistoric times but can be associated with diseases of affluence in contemporary societies where food is usually abundant 24 here we expand the investigations of the arg230cys polymorphism in native americans and integrate the thrifty genotype concept with the gene-culture coevolution process considering the human ability to create new ecological niches that may lead to the selection of genetic variants new data for the arg230cys polymorphism were generated for 19 amerindian populations n  229 from mesocentral america and south america table 1 additional information about these tribes can be found in bortolini et al
25 26 wang et al 27 and mazires et al
28 29 these new arg230cys data were then analyzed together with those of an earlier published report 22 providing a total of 1905 investigated individuals one hundred and twenty-six individuals of our sample were also previously genotyped for 680000 snps using illumina human 610-quad beadchipsruiz-linares et al unpublished data and a part of this information was used in some of our analyses the populations were clustered according to their geographical location and ancient mode of subsistence as follows 1 mesoamerican agriculturalists 2 andean agriculturalists and 3 south american hunter-gatherersforagers of course caution is needed regarding this classification since subsistence modes are not stable over time and may not be unique however the two categories adopted here agriculturalists and hunter-gatherersforagers represent general pre-colombian subsistence conditions providing a starting point for research related to gene-culture dynamics in native americans ethical approval for the present study was provided by the brazilian national ethics commission conep resolution no 12398 for the brazilian samples as well as by ethics committee of a universidad de antioquia medellin colombia colombian samples b universidad nacional autnoma de mxico ciudad de mxico mxico mexican samples c universidad de costa rica san jos costa rica costa rican and panamanian samples d universidad of chile santiago chile chilean samples e universit paul sabatier toulouse 3 toulouse france bolivian and french guianian samples individual and tribal informed oral consent was obtained from all participants since they were illiterate and they were obtained according to the helsinki declaration the ethics committees approved the oral consent procedure as well as the use of these samples in population and evolutionary studies the arg230cys polymorphism was genotyped using taqman assays abi prism 7900ht sequence detection system applied biosystems allele frequencies were obtained by direct counting the level of the population structure observed within and between mesoamerican agriculturalist andean agriculturalist and south american hunter-gathererforager groups was estimated using f statistics and the arlequin 351 software 30 allele frequencies were compared between the 3 population subdivisions with the students t-test alfa   005 using the r stats package r development core team httpwwwr-projectorg since estimates of allele age depend on assumptions about demographic history and natural selection we have performed two approaches to estimate the age of the variant allele based on the long-range haplotype test 35 and integrated haplotype scores 9 36 acua-alonzo et al 22 suggested that the autochthonous native american abca1230cys allele could have been positively selected however demographic events population structure and other stochastic processes can create complex patterns in the genome obscuring signals of natural selection or mimicking adaptive processes 37 additionally positive and balancing selections show different effects on the genetic diversity patterns within and between populations 38 therefore we performed additional analyses to explore these issues and elucidate the factors responsible for the eventual effect of natural selection on the abca1230 locus to detect loci under selection we used a method that contrasted the observed population differentiation fst with that generated for a null simulated distribution under a hierarchical island model using a coalescent approach in this model demes exchange more migrants within groups than between groups to generate the joint distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations 38 thus a p value can be estimated from the joint distribution for the population heterozygosity he and fst using a kernel density estimation procedure 30 the analysis was performed using arlequin 351 in consideration of 126 native americans whose results for the abca1230 locus were known data from 20 other autosomal snps rs6559725 rs11140096 rs4877767 rs4014024 rs11140109 rs7872891 rs7850633 rs17086298 rs10746709 rs5014093 rs10868019 rs11140116 rs3860938 rs3860941 rs4097644 rs9942844 rs12551103 rs7863524 rs4877785 and rs70439590 from these same individuals were compiled from a major snp panel table s2 these 20 additional snps were selected based on their location chromosome 9 from position 85252250 to 85317359 inside the putative neutral region defined by schroeder and colleagues 39 which comprises 76000 bp around the d9s1120 locus using this database table s2 and figure s1 we were able to evaluate whether the joint distribution of the observed he and fst for the abca1230 polymorphism data departed from the expected outcome at neutrality fifty thousand coalescent simulations were performed with a 100-demes island model four comparative analyses were conducted 1 mesoamerican agriculturalists n  68 vs andean agriculturalists n  35 2 mesoamerican agriculturalists vs south american hunter-gatherersforagers n  23 3 mesoamerican agriculturalists vs south americans agriculturalists  hunter-gatherersforagers and 4 andean agriculturalists vs south american hunter-gathererforagers in addition we simulated 100000 neutral genealogies for a region containing two distinct sets of 20 biallelic markers under demographic scenarios mimicking the settlement of the americas 32 40 to accomplish these simulations we used the msabc software 41 a modification of ms software 42 that uses the coalescent to generate samples under a neutral wright-fisher model the demographic parameters included 1 a current effective population size of 830 individuals 40 a number not very different from that used in the simulations of schroeder et al
39 2 three demes that corresponded to the sampled subdivisions mesoamerican agriculturalists andean agriculturalists south american hunter-gatherersforagers 3 a single ancestral population that existed from 6350 to 18000 ybp 32 40 and 4 different exponential growth rates to include the possibility of an ancestral population of 70 to 830 individuals ie constant population size 40 the genetic diversity obtained in the simulationssummarized by intra- heterozygosity and interpopulation global and pairwise fst statisticswas compared to the observed genetic diversity of two genetic datasets 1 that of the abca1230 locus plus the same 19 flanking snps listed in item c1 table s3 and 2 the same 20 snps mentioned in section c2 table s2 figure s1 the summary statistics calculated for each simulation s vectors were then compared to the summary statistics of the observed data s vectors using an euclidean distance measure     s-s with the abcestimator software implemented with the abctoolbox 43 the rationale of the analysis was to check which observed dataset could be reproduced with higher fidelity among the range of neutral simulations genetic archeological botanical and paleoecological data furnished evidence that maize zea mays ssp mays had a single domestication origin from the wild grass teosinte zea mays ssp parviglumis in the ro balsas region southwestern mexico approximately 630010000 calendar years before present 4453 pollen samples taken from sediments in lakes swamps and archeological deposits have provided evidence for the presence or absence of zea maize andor teosinte in the americas and have been used to estimate the age of maize domestication and dispersion 44 blake 44 summarized the zea pollen dates from several american archeological sites and we selected this data set to perform our analysis to test the connection between maize culture and the abca1230cys variant we used allele frequencies from mesoamericacentral america populations zapotec maya nahuatlkaqchikel-quiche totonac cabecar and guaym as well as zea pollen dates obtained in archeological sites located geographically near these populations table 2 spearman rank order correlations between the two data sets zea pollen archeological records and abca1230cys allele frequencies were obtained using the statistica 70 software statsoft inc the abca1230cys allele age estimates using population frequency information were 12097 ybp and 19409 ybp considering data from all populations and only those from mesoamericacentral america respectively but the allele age obtained using the observed ld and a bayesian approach is relatively younger 7540 ybp with a posterior probability of 99 although the numbers generated with these two distinct methods are compatible with an american origin of the abca1230cys allele 32 the last seems more realistic since methods based on ld rather than frequencies have the property of reflecting what happened to an allele more accurately 33 discrepancies between estimates obtained from these two approaches are usually taken as evidence that selection has increased the frequency of the allele to higher levels than expected by random genetic drift 33 54 patterns of genetic diversity between populations can be used to detect loci under selection 30 the joint distributions of he and fst of the abca1230 locus and 20 other snps listed in item c2 in the materials and methods section were examined to test whether the abca1230 locus and these snps departed from neutral expectation the values obtained indicated that only the abca1230 polymorphism departed significantly from neutral expectation p  002 figure 1 however when the comparisons excluded the mesoamericans eg andean agriculturalists vs south american hunter-gathererforager subdivisions no significant departure from the expected under neutrality was found data not shown these results suggest that the abca1230 allele frequencies in mesoamerica are incompatible with a simple neutral model our neutral demographic simulation analysis showed results in the same direction the region containing the abca1230 polymorphism and 19 flanking snps presented a slightly lower average heterozygosity than the putative neutral region dataset 032 vs 034 respectively but global and pairwise fst were higher for the abca1 region global fst 003 vs 001 average pairwise fst 005 vs 001 considering that both genomic regions were studied using the same quantity of markers and the same sampling strategy in populations that were subjected to the same demographic history the observed differences may occur due to diverse factors one of them being natural selection to test this hypothesis each dataset summarized by the above-mentioned statistics was also compared to each of 100000 neutral simulations by means of euclidian distances the empirical dataset containing the abca1230 polymorphism presented a poorer fit to neutrality than the putative neutral region dataset showing euclidian distances that were twofold higher than those of the neutral simulations 7064 vs 3512 interestingly when the mesoamerican agriculturalist subdivision was excluded from the analysis this difference dramatically decreased 4580 vs 3512 thus the poor fit to neutrality observed at the abca1230 site and its flanking regions may be associated with the genetic pattern found in mesoamerica a significant correlation was observed between the abca1230cys allele frequencies and the distribution of the zea pollen relics in mesoamerica figure 2 r  09 p  0002 it is important to note that the populations used in the correlation analysis performed here zapotec maya nahuatl kaqchikel-quiche totonac guaym and cabecar were investigated for microsatellites and other genetic markers in previous studies conducted by our and other groups 27 55 56 these studies indicated that these populations have a substantial amerindian substrate a generally small european contribution and almost no african influence for instance wang et al 27 showed that the maya and guaym showed the highest and the lowest numbers of individuals with some level of recent european and african admixture respectively this indicates an opposite trend from what would be expected if the level of admixture with non-indians was influencing our findings since the variant allele is absent in europeans and africans we can now examine some hypotheses in an attempt to explain the results and to draw the evolutionary scenario associated with the pattern of diversity of the abca1 arg230cys polymorphism maize is considered the most important native crop of the americas 4453 several lines of evidence indicate that the mesoamerican village lifestyle began with maize domestication 44 45 4951 57 58 originating in the mexican southwestern lowlands maize journeyed southwards traveling hand-in-hand with pottery and bringing sedentary life to the andes although the date of its entry as well as the dispersion pattern of this crop into and throughout south america remain controversial 52 other crops were also present in the pre-columbian mesoamerican civilizations squash and beans 50 59 but maize was the dietary base for most of these civilizations for example benedict and steggerda 60 showed that 75 of the calories consumed by the mayas were derived from maize in addition mesoamerica was the only region in the world where an ancient civilization lacked a domesticated herbivore therefore protein from domesticated animal sources would have been scarce in pre-hispanic mesoamerica in comparison to other parts of the ancient urbanized world including the andes 61 as a whole these studies demonstrated that the diet of the first mesoamerican sedentary communities was extremely dependent on maize these early farmers however suffered periods of plantation loss questioning the common assumption that farming and sedentary lifestyle brought increased dietary stability and health homeostasis 62 several studies have revealed that homeostasis should have declined with sedentary farming and bioarcheologists and paleopathologists have also detected a deterioration in mesoamerican health indices from 8000 to 500 years before present-ybp 63 and references therein domestic crops are more vulnerable than wild ones crowding promotes crop diseases and storage systems often fail estimates suggest that as much as 30 of stored food is lost even in a modern sophisticated system 62 in other study based on the molecular analysis of dietary diversity for three archaic native americans poinar et al 64 found evidence that as compared to individuals dependent on agriculture the diet of hunter-gatherers seems to have been more varied and nutritionally sound clearly a diet based on one or only a few crops should have been deleterious to health in the pre-columbian era 65 these different lines of evidence illustrate that the incipient farming niches of mesoamerica when communities of huntersgatherersforagers started to cultivate and domesticate wild plants could have been remarkably unstable like those of other pre-industrial societies 6 based on what was discussed above as well as in our results allele age and neutralityselection tests it is reasonable to suppose that abca1230cys has an american origin and it could have had a selective advantage during the periods of food scarcity experienced by mesoamericans during the implementation of the sedentary life style based on maize the strong correlation between maize culture propagation and 230cys frequencies in this region reinforces this suggestion even when considering that the advantage of the allele may have been lost after technological innovations had been implemented and agricultural production stabilized peng et al
66 presented evidence for a similar case of gene-culture coevolution suggesting that positive selection for the adh1b47his allele was caused by the emergence and expansion of rice domestication in east asia noteworthy is that other environmental factors may also have been involved in the distribution of the abca1 alleles since cholesterol plays an important role in various infectious processes such as the entry and replication of dengue virus type 2 and flaviviral infection 67 additionally the abca1 transporter participates in infectious andor thrombotic disorders involving vesiculation since homozygous abca1 gene deletions confer complete resistance against cerebral malaria in mice 68 69 these findings can be considered as additional causal factors to the abca1230cys selective sweep associated with agricultural development a sedentary village lifestyle with a corresponding growth in the density of the local population can promote an increase in the mortality rate particularly in children under 5 years of age 70 for example archeological and paleoecological evidence in europe showed that during the neolithic demographic transition the causes of increased infant mortality would have included a lack of drinking water supplies contamination by feces emergence of highly virulent zoonoses as well as an increase in the prevalences of other germs such as rotavirus and coronavirus causing diarrhea one of the main killers of children under 5 years of age streptococcus staphylococcus plasmodium p falciparum and p vivax which are believed to have emerged more recently and herpesvirus
70 however the real impact of the abca1230cys variant in these infectious processes will require additional functional studies in agreement with this historical scenario the genetic variation in arg230cys presented a worse fit to neutrality than loci known to be neutral indicating that selective mechanisms are necessary to explain the genetic diversity of arg230cys especially when the mesoamerican agriculturalist subdivision is considered in the analysis this result also supports our hypothesis that maize domestication in mesoamerica lead to changes in the gene pool of the natives from that region south america presents much more diversity in relation to habitats people and culture than mesoamerica for instance maize arrived in south america but apparently the level of consumption seen in mesoamericacentral america was rarely found there archaeological data indicate that only during the implantation and expansion of the inca empire 800500 ybp was the level of maize consumption important but the level of consumption was not comparable to that of mesoamericacentral america 7173 additionally south amerindian hunter-gatherersforagers present lower intrapopulation genetic variation and higher levels of population structure when compared to those seen in andean populations 27 74 this same tendency was also observed in the present study these results indicate low levels of gene flow between villagespopulations and low effective population sizes favoring the role of genetic drift conversely the andean groups show opposing characteristics these findings correlate well with distinguishing patterns of gene flow and historical effective sizes in these indigenous populations with cultural differences as well as with paleoclimatic and environment changes in their habitats 74 therefore the significant role of random processes andor more heterogeneous cultural and ecological scenarios makes it difficult to define a particular pattern associated with the arg230cys polymorphism in south american groups a situation different from that in mesoamerica in conclusion our analyses demonstrate for the first time a robust correlation between a constructed niche and a selected native american autochthonous allele the 230cys allele with a probable origin in america continent seems have been the target for an ongoing directional selective sweep as a result of the origin and spread of the maize culture in ancient mesoamerica  respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria paul mcnamara s h van doorn rogier jeremy farrar peter hotez j thomas junghanss gagandeep kang david lalloo nicholas white j   acute respiratory infections are the most frequently occurring illnesses in all age groups globally although infections are usually limited to the upper respiratory tract and generally cause mild self-limiting illnesses a small percentage progress to the lower respiratory tract where they can cause potentially life-threatening conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia annually 450 million cases of pneumonia are recorded of whom 42 million die 7 of the worlds yearly total annual deaths young children and the elderly are at particular risk especially in developing countries 151 million of 156 million reported episodes of childhood pneumonia are in the developing world pneumonia is responsible for about 17 of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years of which more than 70 occur in sub-saharan africa and south-east asia in 2008 16 million children under 5 died of pneumonia1 2 3
 pneumonia is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality at the other end of the age spectrum the annual incidence of pneumonia in elderly non-institutionalized patients is between 25 and 44 per 1000 population up to four times that of patients younger than 654
 the most important aetiological agents of severe lower respiratory illness include bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus bacteria are the main causes of pneumonia and generally have a higher case fatality rate although this may change with the widespread introduction of h influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines which could lead to viruses becoming much more prominent causes of respiratory disease viruses are the predominant cause of bronchiolitis and exacerbations of asthma and episodic viral wheeze these clinical syndromes overlap considerably and are often difficult to tell apart the clinical manifestations of infection depend not only on the particular agent but also on the individual patient pre-existing structural changes to the respiratory tract caused by congenital malformations or damage from previous episodes of infection or trauma as well as the circumstances of the individual immunocompromise malnutrition poverty overcrowding sanitation pollution etc profoundly affect outcome there are 52 different serotypes of human adenovirus belonging to six different species af only about one-third of these are associated with symptomatic illness species b c and e are associated with respiratory tract infections whereas species d causes large epidemics of infective conjunctivitis and species f serotype 4142 is associated with infectious diarrhoea infections with species b serotypes 3 7 and 21 are associated with bronchiolitis obliterans a post-infectious condition characterized by persistent airways obstruction secondary to peri-bronchiolar fibrosis5
 adenovirus infections are common have a worldwide distribution and occur throughout the year respiratory infections are frequent during childhood tend to be self-limiting and induce serotype-specific immunity outbreaks of adenoviral respiratory infections can occur in closed communities such as day-care centres boarding schools and especially among military recruits6 adenoviruses are unusual in that prolonged asymptomatic carriage up to 2 years in some cases may occur in the tonsils of children thus the clinical significance of adenoviruses isolated from the throats of children must be interpreted with caution human bocavirus a member of the parvoviridae family was discovered in 2005 in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with respiratory tract infections7 although suspected establishing its role as a respiratory pathogen has been difficult for several reasons first human bocavirus is not related to any known human respiratory pathogen second it is commonly detected with other respiratory viruses which have established pathogenic potential third detection may simply reflect asymptomatic persistence or prolonged viral shedding since other human parvoviruses also show this capacity it has been suggested that human bocavirus may be reactivated or produce a transient asymptomatic super-infection triggered by the presence of another replicating respiratory agent several studies have shown an association between human bocavirus detection and acute respiratory symptoms and viral dna has been detected in the blood of children with both respiratory symptoms and human bocavirus in respiratory specimens however definitively establishing a causal relationship will require further study8
 the influenza viruses especially influenza virus a are the most variable of the respiratory viruses their pandemic potential and the unpredictability of their emergence is a continuous cause for concern there are three genera influenza virus a b and c influenza virus c only rarely causes mild disease in humans and will not be further discussed influenza a viruses are subtyped based on their two surface antigens hemagglutinin ha h1h16 and neuraminidase na n1n9 which are responsible for host receptor bindingcell entry and cleavage of the ha-receptor complex to release newly formed viruses respectively key amino acids in these proteins especially in ha are associated with host specificity and transmissibility aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of influenza a viruses harbouring all possible subtypes a selection of subtypes has established endemicity among a range of land and water mammals eg humans pigs horses seals currently h3n2 and h1n1 are endemic among humans at the time of writing circulating h1n1 is the lineage that caused a pandemic of mild influenza in 2009 see below called h1n1-pdm09 influenza virus b is almost exclusively a human pathogen also causing yearly seasonal epidemics with rare reports of infection in dogs cats swine and seals both influenza virus a and b exhibit antigenic drift this phenomenon occurs when the surface antigens of the virus gradually change progressively and directionally to escape immunological pressure from the host species yearly epidemics of influenza virus a and b are caused worldwide by these drift variants and contribute to mortality an estimated 250500 000 every year in the elderly and in those with pre-existing conditions such as chronic cardiopulmonary or renal disease diabetes immunosuppression or severe anaemia acute on chronic new lineages of influenza virus a emerge every few decades through re-assortment of gene segments in animal hosts infected with two different viruses antigenic shift resulting in global pandemics with varying severity due to the absence of immunity in the human population 1918 spanish flu h1n1 40100 million deaths 1957 asian flu h2n2 2 million deaths 1968 hong kong flu h3n2 500 000 deaths 2009 h1n1-pdm09 15 000 deaths9 after such an introduction the new virus usually becomes the dominant circulating lineage of influenza a one exception was the pandemic of mild influenza among patients under 20 following the reintroduction after 20 years of absence when h2n2 became dominant of h1n1 in the human population in 1977 possibly caused by an escape from a research laboratory another exception was the introduction in 2009 of a novel lineage of h1n1 influenza virus a most likely from pigs in north america causing a pandemic of relatively mild influenza with an estimated 15 000 deaths and generating massive attention from both the public health communities and the general public and replacing only the 1977 h1n1 lineage between the 2009 pandemic and the time of writing h1n1-pdm09 and h3n2 influenza virus a have been co-circulating with influenza b viruses and continue to cause yearly seasonal epidemics worldwide the timing extent and direction of either drift or shift have so far been completely unpredictable with no animal reservoirs to provide such new antigens shift does not occur in influenza b and thus major epidemics do not occur sporadic dead-end human infections of animal especially avian viruses are known to occur and have caused concern regarding pandemic potential seal h7n3 and avian h7n7 and h9n2 viruses have caused conjunctivitis and  mostly  mild influenza-like illness in patients in close contact with infected seals or birds10 in 2011 there were reports of sporadic human-to-human transmission of porcine h3n2 viruses causing mild influenza-like illness11 in contrast h5n1 avian influenza viruses have consistently caused severe human respiratory illness in asia and north africa with a mortality of over 50 figure 191
 highly pathogenic h5n1 viruses were first detected in birds in 1996 in china transmission to 18 humans occurred in hong kong six of which were fatal during the next 6 years no human or animal cases were recorded in 2003 the virus re-emerged in china since then it has become panzootic among poultry and wild birds and at the time of writing has caused 573 sporadic infections 336 fatal in humans12 most of whom reported close contact with wild birds or domestic poultry the disease presents as a rapidly progressive viral pneumonia with severe leucopenia and lymphopenia progressing to ards acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction that fail to respond to standard antibiotic therapy for pneumonia early diagnosis and treatment with oseltamivir are associated with a better prognosis despite ferret-transmission models showing that only five mutations are required to enable transmission of virulent virus13 their worldwide presence for many years the huge humananimal interface in asia and suspected small-scale human-to-human transmission in family clusters no efficient or sustained human-to-human transmission of h5n1 viruses has yet been recorded14
 at the time of writing april 2013 another avian influenza virus h7n9 is causing - as yet only - sporadic zoonotic transmission events to humans in china with no recorded sustained human-to-human transmission in contrast to h5n1 this virus does not cause disease in wild or domestic birds making it more difficult to contain over a period of 2 months more than 100 cases have been identified the case fatality rate is around 20  and elderly people are most affected this again highlights the unpredictability of these events and the continuously changing threats posed by influenza a viruses the continued zoonotic transmission of these avian viruses does not imply that they will inevitably lead to another pandemic however the unusual severity of h5n1 and h7n9 disease in humans is a continuous cause for concern because one cannot assume that the acquisition of human-to-human transmissibility if ever will be associated with a loss of virulence as is usual irrespective of whether or not this pandemic threat becomes reality it is clear that avian h5n1 and h7n9 viruses have already had a significant impact on the global poultry industry and on human economic and social wellbeing and thus ultimately on human health virology and clinical textbooks and virtually all web-based information sources describe the 99 serotypes of human rhinovirus hrvs as the most frequent cause of the common cold in both the developed and the developing world although the common cold is considered a trivial illness it is an important disease worldwide in terms of morbidity and economic impact in addition to causing the common cold there is now convincing evidence that hrvs play a significant role in causing lower respiratory symptoms hrvs can replicate in the lower airways and do appear to play a critical role in causing exacerbations of asthma and other chronic lung diseases they can also drive the infant immune system towards the asthmatic phenotype and cause episodes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia that require hospitalization15
 until a few years ago only two groups of hrvs a and b were recognized but sequencing of hrvs led to the discovery of a third species hrv-c in 2006 with distinct structural biological and possibly also clinical features16 17
 the over 100 serotypes of enterovirus coxsackie a and b viruses echoviruses and enteroviruses 6871 are mainly transmitted by the oralfaecal route but can be transmitted by respiratory droplets enteroviruses are a major cause of aseptic meningitis in children and adults but are also associated with common cold herpangina in children and large epidemics of acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis and hand foot and mouth disease similarly parechoviruses are another common cause of aseptic meningitis but are also implicated as frequent causes of mild respiratory illness this virus is distributed worldwide and is found wherever it has been sought it is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and the most commonly detected virus in children under 2 years of age hospitalized for lower respiratory infection figure 192
 it is estimated that half of all children are infected during the first year of life and that by 3 years of age all have experienced at least one infection immunity following primary infection does not prevent secondary or subsequent infections caused by both antigenic differences and failure of rsv to induce persistent neutralizing antibodies in temperate regions large seasonal epidemics occur annually over cold winter months but this seasonality is more variable in the tropics see below two subtypes a and b have been described and may co-circulate with one usually predominating in any given year no obvious differences in disease severity or pathogenesis have been documented between these two subtypes18 19
 rsv causes a substantial but variable lrti disease burden in tropical countries in a population-based study of infants in kenya it was found that rsv was common approximately 36 of infections led to ltri 23 were severe and 3 of infected children were hospitalized20 rsv was also the most commonly detected respiratory pathogen in hospitalized children in vietnam21 more recently it has become clear that rsv causes significant morbidity in the elderly as well as in infants22
 this virus was discovered in 200123 the disease it causes its distribution and seasonality are very similar to those of rsv it also has two subtypes and causes infections in children under 2 years old and in the elderly retrospective serology has shown that this is not a new human pathogen but has been around for a long time24
 there are four species of parainfluenza virus piv14 piv13 are major causes of lower respiratory tract infections in infants young children the immuno-compromised the chronically ill and the elderly piv1 and 2 typically cause alternating biennial fall epidemics of croup a high-pitched barking cough in children 24 years of age piv3 infections occur mainly in the first two years of life bronchiolitis and pneumonia are the most common clinical presentations only rsv causes more lower respiratory tract infections in neonates and young infants both in temperate and tropical regions there is dissociation between the peaks of activity of piv3 and rsvhmpv host defence against piv is mediated largely by humoral immunity to the two surface antigens but repeated infections are often needed before protection develops25
 there are a number of reasons why measles is often not recognized as a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections children with measles may not always be admitted to a general paediatric ward the aetiology may be attributed to a super infecting pathogen rather than to measles and some patients with measles especially when immunocompromised will fail to develop the typical rash in patients who do not manifest the typical clinical features clinical diagnosis of measles is difficult and specific laboratory diagnostics will most likely not be requested and performed where the diagnosis has been actively sought in developing countries measles was found to be a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection accounting for 621 of its morbidity and 850 of its mortality26 radiographic evidence of pneumonia is common also in clinically uncomplicated measles the effects of the virus on the respiratory tract can be direct giant cell pneumonitis in any part of the respiratory tract or indirect the latter includes the suppressive effects of the virus on the host immune system stores of vitamin a and overall nutritional status all of these may lead to an increased risk of super-infection with other viral or bacterial pathogens measles pneumonitis can be especially severe in immunocompromised patients27
 human nipah virus infection was first recognized in a large outbreak of 276 reported cases in peninsular malaysia and singapore from september 1998 through may 1999 most patients had contact with sick pigs patients presented primarily with encephalitis 39 died large fruit bats of the genus pteropus are the natural reservoir of nipah virus in the 10 years following no further human cases were noted in malaysia but annual human outbreaks have been reported in bangladesh from may to december the clinical presentation is dominated by respiratory symptoms and the case fatality has been over 70 the most frequently implicated route of infection is ingestion of fresh date palm sap date palm sap is harvested from december through march particularly in west central bangladesh a tap is cut into the tree trunk and sap flows slowly overnight into an open clay pot infrared camera studies have confirmed that pteropus giganteus bats frequently visit the trees lick the sap during collection thus transmitting infection humans can also become infected through direct contact with bat secretions contact with domestic animals that become infected by eating partially eaten bat-saliva-laden fruit or infected date palm sap or by human-to-human transmission through infected saliva28
 human coronavirus hcov strains 229e and oc43 have been long recognized as the second main cause of the common cold 1025 more recently two other viruses associated with similar presentation were detected in humans nl63 and hku1 these four viruses are ubiquitous and regularly detected in respiratory specimens of a small proportion 110 of children hospitalized with acute respiratory disease in many parts of the world infection with these human coronaviruses may present as an upper respiratory tract infection asthma exacerbation acute bronchiolitis pneumonia febrile seizures and also as croup especially nl63 reinfection is common due to rapidly decreasing antibody levels in 20022003 a novel severe form of pneumonia of unknown aetiology emerged in guangdong china and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome sars after smouldering for several months the disease then spread to hong kong and rapidly across the world facilitated by international air travel and a few so-called super-spreaders with most notable outbreaks in hong kong and toronto canada of affected cases 21 were healthcare workers the rapidly identified culprit sars coronavirus is thought to have jumped to humans in live animal markets in guangdong the precursor virus is present in wild rhinolophus bats29 civet cats and other small mammals sold as delicacies in wet markets provided a reservoir and amplifier for the virus and the opportunity for adaptation to humans the epidemic of sars with 8096 cases and 744 deaths in 29 countries across five continents started in november 2002 and came to an end in july 2003 few sporadic community- and laboratory-acquired infections including limited person-to-person transmission have been recorded since30
 sars was characterized by fever and myalgia rapidly progressing to a respiratory syndrome of cough dyspnoea followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome mortality was significantly lower in children sars is primarily spread by the respiratory route but oralfaecal transmission has also been implicated why the sars epidemic did not continue to spread is subject to much speculation explanations may include the fact that sars is most infectious in a later stage of infection allowing for timely containment and an extraordinary worldwide public health effort to control spread31
 with the new interest in coronaviruses more and more closely related coronaviruses from distantly related animals have been discovered many of which were the result of recent interspecies jumping coronaviruses are implicated as a likely candidate for future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases and - indeed - a novel coronavirus emc is currently associated with sporadic transmission to humans in the middle-east hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps is a rare but important cause of severe respiratory illness in the north and south american continents it was first recognized in may 1993 during an outbreak of severe and frequently fatal respiratory disease in the four corners region of the usa where the four states arizona colorado new mexico and utah abut32 the causative agent was found to be a hantavirus and was later named sin nombre virus the natural host was found to be the deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus the local population of which had recently increased rapidly the hantaviruses are transmitted to humans by inhalation of aerosolized dried excreta closely related viruses have since been isolated in north eg new york bayou black creek canal viruses and south eg andes virus americas with different rodent hosts but all associated with hps these viruses all belong to the same hantavirus genus as those causing haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs in the old world hantaan seoul and puumala viruses both hfrs and hps have a similar febrile prodrome with thrombocytopenia and leucocytosis in hps the key differences are that the capillary leakage which follows is localized to the lungs and that with sin nombre virus renal dysfunction is minimal there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak but there is evidence that some of the south american hantaviruses causing hps may be transmitted between humans in a nosocomial setting33
 
varicella pneumonitis can occur as a severe complication of chickenpox or in the absence of classical symptoms it occurs more commonly in adults an estimated 1  400 and can be life-threatening if it occurs during pregnancy or in immunocompromised patients although relatively rare radiographical abnormalities of the lungs without respiratory symptoms are reported in more than 15 of adults with chickenpox34
 pneumonitis can also rarely occur as a complication of cytomegalovirus or epsteinbarr virus mononucleosis27 cytomegalovirus is an opportunist pathogen in immunocompromised patients in whom it can cause serious or even fatal respiratory complications it is more important as an opportunist pathogen of transplant recipients especially bone marrow transplants than those immunocompromised through aids perinatal cytomegalovirus infection may occasionally present as pneumonitis in the newborn the diagnosis of atypical bacteria has traditionally been undertaken in virology laboratories because these agents cause syndromes that overlap partially with viral respiratory infection and they were diagnosed serologically before the polymerase chain reaction was added to our diagnostic arsenal see below they do not cause the typical clinical picture of lobar pneumonia caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria hence the name atypical these include mycoplasma pneumoniae chlamydophila pneumoniae and psittaci and coxiella burnetii the related legionella bacteria are also discussed here 
mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important cause of upper respiratory tract infection and bronchitispneumonia usually as sporadic infections or outbreaks through human-to-human transmission among families or in closed environments in the developed world it has the highest attack rates among 520-year-olds and it is one of the major causes of pneumonia in young adults a wide spectrum of extra-pulmonary manifestations and post-infectious syndromes has been described but fall beyond the scope of this book the chest radiographical patterns of mycoplasma pneumonia are nonspecific and variable and can be indistinguishable from those of bacterial and viral pneumonia35 systematic data from tropical areas are scarce but its distribution is worldwide36
 
chlamydophila are obligate intracellular bacteria chlamydophila pneumoniae is a common human respiratory pathogen and causes a similar clinical picture to mycoplasma it is frequently isolated from animals but their role in transmission is unclear and spread is thought to be human to human serosurveys also show worldwide distribution for this bacterium37
chlamydophila psittaci is the causative agent of psittacosis a rare zoonotic infection related to exposure to birds which usually presents with fever headache and myalgia and sometimes causes pneumonia38
 
coxiella burnetii causes q-fever it is an obligate intracellular bacterium with a spore stage making it highly resistant to environmental conditions humans are infected by aerosol inhalation and develop an acute febrile illness that is either self-limiting or develops into pneumonia or less frequently endocarditis or a systemic chronic syndrome cattle sheep and goats are the main reservoirs and when infected shed bacteria in urine faeces milk and especially when giving birth placentas contain high concentrations of bacteria and people exposed to these are at risk given the environmental resilience of this organism less direct contact with infected animalsplacentas may also cause disease there is no human-to-human spread39
 
legionella bacteria are naturally occurring aquatic bacteria these may grow to high concentrations in warm water eg in cooling towers heaters and drinking water plumbing especially when associated with free-living amoebae aerosolization and inhalation of legionella pneumophila may lead to outbreaks of a self-limited febrile illness called pontiac fever or a more severe systemic illness with pneumonia called legionnaires disease40
legionella and coxiella belong to the same family of bacteria and both are associated with a syndrome of long-lasting post-infectious fatigue these bacteria are under-reported in most parts of the world however as they are usually susceptible to macrolidesazalides tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones it is important that they are diagnosed and treated the methods of choice to detect these pathogens revolve around nucleic acid amplification techniques on respiratory specimens a rapid urinary antigen test is available for detection of legionella pneumophila detection of mycoplasma specific igm is useful in acute settings mycoplasma and legionella can also be cultured but this may take 12 weeks detection of seroconversion may provide a diagnosis retrospectively or in chronic disease and may be useful for epidemiologic purposes empiric treatment protocols for uncomplicated pneumonia usually consist of penicillins such as amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid and do not cover these bacteria however most severe pneumonia treatment protocols do tend to include antimicrobial agents such as macrolides that cover these organisms for any pneumonia of unknown aetiology that does not respond to empiric treatment adding antimicrobial agents that cover atypical bacteria is recommended over the last 5 years there has been an increase in the number of studies using multiplex rt-pcr to investigate pathogen prevalence in acute respiratory infection most of these have been in pre-school children in whom getting respiratory samples particularly nasopharyngeal aspirates is routine and relatively easy in some studies viruses and atypical bacteria have been detected in over 80 of samples detection rates much higher than in studies using traditional culture techniques41 however as has been mentioned these studies should be interpreted with some caution pathogens such as bocavirus and adenovirus persist for weeks and sometimes months after acute infection and thus their significance during an acute episode especially when detected with other pathogens may be uncertain this increase in reported prevalence has been mirrored by an increase in the rates of viral co-infection or probably more accurately co-detection in recent studies two or more viral pathogens have been found in up to 44 of upper respiratory samples from young children with acute respiratory infection21 41 42 43 44 45 co-infection rates appear to vary depending on age country and living conditions as well as the number of pathogens tested table 191
 some of the highest viral detection and co-infection rates have been reported in pre-school children from low-income families living in brazil vietnam and jordan21 41 42 a number of groups has suggested co-infection as a risk factor for severe disease however there is no real consensus in the literature supporting this premise which is perhaps not surprising given that most of the published studies have investigated very different populations and looked for different numbers of pathogens table 191 for some conditions a link between viral and bacterial infection is well established for instance data reassessed from the influenza pandemics of 1918 1957 and 1968 suggest that most deaths during these periods were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia approximately four weeks after the acute infection47 overall however the significance of contemporaneous bacterial and viral co-infection in acute respiratory infection is difficult to assess particularly if analysis is limited to upper airway secretions while it is often inferred that viral pathogens detected in the upper airways are also in the lower airways of children with chest symptoms the same cannot be said for bacteria where upper airway detection is as likely to be due to asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage however in studies where lung aspirates have been obtained from children with clinical signs of severe pneumonia both viral and bacterial pathogens can be detected in a study from the gambia on 74 children with community-acquired pneumonia one-third of the 45 with pneumococcal pneumonia had rsv infection48 in contrast in children from malawi with a high prevalence of hiv only 9 of those with pneumococcal infection had a viral co-infection the commonest being with adenovirus49 it is also worth considering that in the uk one-fifth of infants with severe rsv bronchiolitis have bacteria in their lower airways at the time of intubation and length of time spent ventilated correlates to bacterial carriage50
 rsv is the commonest cause of bronchiolitis and is detected in 4374 of cases51 upper respiratory tract symptoms usually precede lower respiratory tract involvement by a few days dyspnoea subcostal recession and feeding difficulties characterize lower respiratory tract infection in bronchiolitis wheeze may be present with a prolonged expiratory phase and crackles52 air trapping results in a rapid respiratory rate a palpable spleen and liver and a typical radiographic pattern of hyperinflation with diffuse interstitial markings and peribronchial thickening segmental atelectasis is often seen bronchiolitis may lead to acute respiratory failure with severe bronchospasm moderate to severe hypoxia and carbon dioxide retention apnoea tends to occur in infants under 2 months of age and often in those born prematurely supportive measures are still the mainstay of treatment for bronchiolitis symptoms associated with clinically significant bronchiolitis particularly rsv are not limited to the acute episode with many children wheezing for years afterwards two key risk factors for getting bronchiolitis are age 6 months and exposure to tobacco smoke particularly antenatally52 other factors increasing the risk of getting more severe disease include male gender prematurity an underlying heart or lung condition and never having been breast-fed also poverty living in a crowded environment and having siblings who attend school or child-care increase the risk of getting bronchiolitis cases of viral pneumonia generally occur during seasonal epidemics of influenza and rsv and are normally preceded by upper respiratory tract infection53 whereas symptoms of bacterial pneumonia include a rapid onset of fever rigors malaise cough and dyspnoea symptoms of viral pneumonia tend to be of slower onset and while including cough and dyspnoea are just as likely to present with rhinitis and wheezing biomarkers of sepsis such as white-blood cell count c-reactive protein and procalcitonin are often normal and chest radiograph findings likely to show bilateral interstitial infiltrates rather than lobar changes children with viral pneumonia respond slowly or not at all to antibiotics in marked contrast to those with bacterial pneumonia similar to bronchiolitis risk factors for severe disease include household smoking and cessation of breast-feeding before 6 months poverty malnutrition hiv and other immunosuppressive disease the asthma epidemic experienced by developed countries over the past three decades is now being mirrored in developing countries as they become more urbanized environmental factors appear to be a key factor behind these changes in prevalence54 global associations which positively correlate with asthma symptom prevalence include gross national product trans-fatty acids paracetamol and women smoking whereas inverse associations include a diet with food of plant origin pollen immunizations tuberculosis notifications air pollution and men smoking54
 there is clinical overlap between childhood asthma and episodic viral wheeze in both conditions cases tend to be preceded by a viral urti 12 days before wheeze develops55 episodic viral wheeze is a series of discreet episodes of respiratory distress characterized by wheeze occurring in pre-school children whereas asthma later develops into a chronic disease with exacerbations of sudden deterioration in airway function day-to-day variation in airway function and fixed or persistent airway obstruction56 in developed countries one-third of children with episodic viral wheeze as a young child go on to develop atopic asthma57 rhinovirus appears to be a particularly common viral cause of asthma exacerbations especially rhinovirus c but other viruses commonly isolated include rsv hmpv and pivs overall the viruses that cause acute respiratory infection worldwide are the same table 191 but there are local variations particularly during outbreaks of unusual organisms nipah virus in bangladesh and india in temperate parts of the world there is a clear seasonal pattern in the prevalence of viral respiratory tract infection with peaks occurring over the cold winter months in tropical regions where average temperature is higher and seasonal temperature change less variations in prevalence are still seen this has been best demonstrated for rsv strong rsv seasonal patterns which correlate with rainfall have been found in vietnam21 india58 papua new guinea59 north-east brazil41 kenya and the gambia60 61 a possible explanation for this is that children tend to be kept indoors during the rainy season and the resultant crowding in damp humid environments prolongs viral survival and encourages spread this is probably not the whole story however as in some parts of the world rsv activity shows no pattern at all taiwan62 or peaks during the summer months when ambient temperatures are highest hong kong63 similar patterns are found for influenza virus infection64 thus for studies large enough to detect such variations influenza activity peaks in india north-east brazil and senegal during the months with the highest rainfall and humidity similar seasonal variations have also been described for hmpv and pivs in contrast rhinovirus adenovirus and bocavirus infection appears for the most part to be endemic throughout the year one recent study in north-east brazil reported peaks in mycoplasma pneumoniae infection that were unrelated to the rainy season41 in this study the authors found that at its peak mycoplasma pneumoniae infection accounted for 17 of hospitalized pneumonia cases in pre-school children a finding with clear implications for management given that current treatment guidelines for pneumonia in this age group do not include macrolidequinolone antibiotics there are several approaches to this that include demonstration of 1 viral antigens by immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassays67 2 viral infectivity by growth in cell culture or 3 viral nucleic acid by various techniques details of the techniques are not given here but the advantages and disadvantages of each are indicated in table 192
 when setting up a diagnostic laboratory its purpose should be clearly thought out if the catchment population is very large the number of specimens may also be large and the advantages of automation eg in machine-based nucleic acid amplification or enzyme immunoassays may be significant most specimens are likely to come from hospitalized patients because of the practical difficulties in collecting and delivering specimens from the community virology specimens are perishable and must be delivered to the laboratory without delay the quality of the specimen is paramount to obtaining meaningful results it is easier to take a bad specimen than a good one and close cooperation with the laboratory will help to raise the positivity rate this at present means demonstrating an antibody response in the serum to the stimulus provided by the virus seeking responses in cellular immunity or antibody in other body fluids remain research techniques only for a valid diagnosis a convalescent specimen of serum usually taken after at least 2 weeks is needed but may be difficult to collect this is particularly true with children nevertheless unless an antibody response can be demonstrated seroconversion or a rising titre some uncertainty over the validity of the result will remain an alternative is to demonstrate an igm-class response but this suffers from the twin disadvantages that igm antibodies and thus the corresponding results are relatively non-specific compared to igg and such tests are not routinely available for all viruses supportive care with fluids and oxygen remain the mainstay of treatment for most respiratory viral infections for some individuals respiratory support on high-dependency units or intensive care is needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo is sometimes required to maintain oxygen saturation in individuals with severe viral pneumonia the adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine were options for prevention in outbreaks within closed communities of high-risk individuals and less convincingly for treatment of influenza virus a infections68 however these therapies have now become obsolete as h3n2 resistance to them has been increasing since 2003 and h1n1-pdm09 and most avian h5n1 viruses are completely resistant neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir tamiflu zanamivir relenza and peramivir rapiacta which inhibit the viral enzyme neuraminidase in both influenza virus a and b are effective for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in the 20072008 influenza season an influenza virus a h1n1 lineage emerged that was naturally resistant against oseltamivir and soon became the dominant lineage worldwide this was a cause for serious concern but in 2009 the oseltamivir-susceptible h1n1-pdm09 virus replaced the resistant lineage for treatment of uncomplicated influenza neuraminidase inhibitors have to be given within 48 hours of onset for apparent clinical benefit for severe influenza influenza in the immuno-compromised and avian influenza benefit can still be found if these drugs are administered after 48 hours and so treatment should not be withheld in these cases they are expensive and are best used on those most at risk of serious illness  those at the extreme ends of life while both zanamivir given by inhaler and oseltamivir given orally can be used for prophylaxis against h5n1 influenza disease the systemically active oseltamivir is the preferred option for treatment given the potential for dissemination of h5n1 beyond the respiratory tract however experience with human cases of h5n1 avian influenza has shown that resistance may develop rapidly and may be a major problem in widespread prophylactic or therapeutic use ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analogue that is believed to interfere with viral nucleic acid function it is expensive difficult to deliver and teratogenic therefore potentially toxic to both patient and treating team systematic reviews have failed to show any convincing evidence for its use in either acute bronchiolitis or in more severe disease69 given the high cost safety concerns challenges in delivery and weakness of trial data ribavirin is generally reserved for use with immunocompromised children in a picu setting ribavirin may have some effect in influenza but evidence to support its use is minimal it has also been used in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome but again the evidence of efficacy is minimal cidofovir is available for severe adenovirus infections but causes severe side-effects and needs to be administered simultaneously with probenecid intravenous acyclovir and oral valacyclovir are effective in the treatment of varicella or herpes simplex infections of the respiratory tract in the immunocompromised patient it should also be used in an immunocompetent patient usually an adult with varicella pneumonia ganciclovir and foscarnet are useful in cytomegalovirus infection in the immunosuppressed but a detailed discussion of this problem is beyond the scope of this chapter in many parts of the world especially south-east asia antibiotics are extensively used to treat any form of mild respiratory illness although there may be some benefit to the use of antibiotics in preventing secondary bacterial sinusitis otitis media or pneumonia over-the-counter availability of antibiotics self-medication or medication by untrained pharmacy workers should be strongly discouraged because of the selection and subsequent spread of resistant pathogens and of multidrug resistant commensal bacteria in oral and intestinal flora with the cells of the target organ immediately accessible to viruses it is proving difficult to produce effective vaccines to respiratory tract viruses70 other than in measles which has a systemic phase vaccines have had only limited success in the tropics even the measles vaccine has limitations as much of this virus impact is during infancy when existing vaccines lack effectiveness at inducing immunity in the presence of passive maternal antibody yearly influenza vaccination is recommended in many countries for persons at high risk eg patients with underlying heart respiratory or immunocompromising diseases patients on dialysis the elderly and contains antigens from two current influenza a virus subtypes h3n2 and h1n1-pdm09 and from influenza virus b the constituents are modified annually for each hemisphere as the prevalent strains drift and shift see above the conventional influenza vaccine is formalin-killed egg-grown virus and has provided useful protection particularly in the elderly and those with pre-existing lung damage in whom even minimal protection may be enough to prevent death an alternative approach of a live attenuated vaccine containing cold-adapted influenza strains has shown some efficacy and such vaccines are also available the possible emergence of an h5n1 avian strain adapted to man has stimulated research into new ways to produce vaccines eg using reverse genetics or a disabled adenovirus as a vector for influenza antigens and for new antiviral drugs currently at time of writing h5n1 vaccines are licensed for use in the usa and the eu but these are not available in endemic countries earlier attempts at production of formaldehyde inactivated rsv vaccine were associated with more severe forms of disease in vaccinees prevention of rsv severe measles and varicella in susceptible immunocompromised or severely malnourished contacts may also be achieved by passive immunization monoclonal antibodies such as palivizumab provide some protection to rsv infection in vulnerable infants eg premature babies but it is very expensive and administration is in the form of monthly intramuscular injections over the rsv season71
 normal human gamma globulin is effective in preventingattenuating measles if administered within 3 days of contact for the prophylaxis of varicella high-titre varicella-zoster human immune globulin zig must be used maximum protection from severe disease but not from infection follows administration within 48 hours of contact but some benefit may accrue if given within 10 days of exposure respiratory viral disease like diarrhoeal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world and has significant economic consequences much respiratory disease particularly in childhood is either totally due to viruses or is virus-initiated with similar organisms found in tropical and temperate regions viral and atypical bacterial epidemiological data are incomplete everywhere but more so for the poorer parts of the world and come mostly from hospitalized patients rsv is a universal childhood pathogen found everywhere the numbers of virologically confirmed diagnoses each year in hospitalized children in the newcastle and tyneside area in the uk population about 1 million and from hong kong island population about 07 million are remarkably similar 500600 and 500700 cases respectively there are likely to be many more rsv cases in the larger cities of asia and south america in overcrowded environments where the potential for severe disease will be exacerbated by malnutrition air pollution poor sanitation minimal medical care etc a new pandemic of influenza a similar to the one that swept the world in 19181919 could be a major health problem of the future but when and if this will happen is unknown we have learnt from the 2009 pandemic that pandemics can be mild but there is still fear of h5n1 crossing the species barrier and causing a pandemic with a high case fatality rate current preparative measures such as stockpiling oseltamivir and vaccine development may help to reduce its impact there is a very real clinical and economic need to develop effective treatments and vaccines against the common causes of viral and atypical bacterial respiratory disease but this will require an enormous commitment of resources  pulmonary infections in the returned traveller ashleigh trimble v moffat a collins m   international travel has steadily increased over the last few decades and is no longer only for the wealthy and healthy the number of travellers reached more than one billion for the first time in 2012 and continues to rise 1 there are many risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing a travel-related illness and this review will focus on pulmonary-related infections table 1 24 many illnesses are self-limiting and are a result of common pulmonary viruses that are prevalent worldwide 3 5 but in certain circumstances travel-related pulmonary infections are serious and have potentially fatal implications and can even cause epidemics
 air travel has shown how efficiently pulmonary infections can be transmitted data suggests the risk of disease transmission to a symptom-free passenger within the aircraft cabin is associated with sitting within 2 rows of a contagious passenger for a flight time of more than 8 h this association is mainly derived from investigations of in-flight transmission of tuberculosis tb 6 aircraft cabin ventilation appears to be a key factor enabling disease transmission this was highlighted by the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars during a short-haul flight in 2002 5 with sea travel especially cruising becoming more popular the ageing population of travellers with multiple pre-existing conditions is also a concern clinicians should be aware of particular diseases that may present in the returned traveller and rank their diagnostic likelihood based on destination length of stay and symptom duration tables 2 and 3

 pneumonia is a frequent cause of fever amongst returned travellers 7 awareness of travel locations may be key to identifying the organism responsible and polymerase chain reaction pcr testing is very important to look for atypical etiologies routinely patients are started on antibiotics based on local guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia it is unlikely these regimens will contain appropriate first-line therapy or be of sufficient duration to cover for pneumonias caused by coxiella burnettii q fever 8 or burkholderia pseudomallei melioidosis which have been isolated in recent outbreaks that have occurred in europe and south east asia 9 pulmonary infections are diagnosed in up to 24 of returned travellers with fever making it as common as travellers diarrhea with influenza being the most common vaccine-preventable infection acquired vaccine protective against h1n1 h3n2 and two influenza b virus strains 10 11 pre-travel advice should be that travellers with co-morbidities should be vaccinated against both seasonal influenza virus and pneumococcus 12 it should be noted that the influenza vaccine does not currently offer protection against the most recent strains causing epidemics h5n1 h7n9 and the risk of acquiring the illness depends on season of travel and length of stay in affected areas 13 in this review we will discuss various pulmonary infections that are more common in returned travellers a clear and thorough approach to a symptomatic returned traveller is an essential skill for the acutegeneral physician and general practitioner table 4 particular attention should be given to infections that may spread by human-to-human transmission clinicians should be aware of where to source information should they suspect a travel-related infection or if they have concerns for public health infections related to travel are constantly evolving and it is important for clinicians to remain up to date with current disease outbreaks and management recommendations
 particular attention should be paid to travellers returning from influenza-endemic areas taking into account newly reported sub-types the burden of influenza occurs in the winter months in temperate regions in the northern hemisphere from november to april and the southern hemisphere from april to october in the tropics the virus circulates at a low level all year round 17 influenza is diagnosed from viral throat swabs using real time pcr rt-pcr that can differentiate particular influenza subtypes 18 avian influenza sub-type h5n1 virus has caused death in humans since 1997 predominately in asia and north east africa with a current upsurge of cases in egypt from 2003 to october 2015 there have been a total of 844 laboratory-confirmed cases with mortality rates of more than 50 19 h7n9 is the most recently reported sub-type it was first diagnosed in march 2013 in china and is characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia pulmonary failure and acute pulmonary distress syndrome ards 18 as of october 2015 there have been 679 laboratory-confirmed cases with 275 reported deaths 19 treatment of influenza remains a controversial topic but generally supportive management is adopted current recommendations are early administration of a neuraminidase inhibitor eg oseltamivir to the affected individual and their close contacts 18 a recent meta-analysis of the h1n1 pandemic showed that hospitalized patients treated with a neuraminidase inhibitor had a lower mortality and that this was further reduced by early instigation 20 prevention of avian influenza has proved difficult due to the antigenic diversity of the circulating viruses which has hampered vaccine development 21 healthcare professionals should take post-exposure prophylaxis eg oseltamivir after a patient has been diagnosed with avian influenza and personal protective equipment is highly recommended like influenza other viral epidemics are gathering publicity heightening awareness and recognition worldwide mers and sars are zoonotic coronavirus infections with regular media coverage due to their symptom severity associated mortality rates and anxiety regarding potential human-to-human transmission bats are thought to be the main intermediate host for both viruses while there is compelling evidence that camels are also responsible for transmission of the mers coronavirus 22 23 sars was first reported as an atypical pneumonia to the world health organization who in november 2002 in china and subsequently spread worldwide the first reported epidemic occurred in a hong kong hotel in february 2003 the virus was transmitted to 16 hotel guests who were staying on the same floor as an infected individual and the virus spread through international air travel thereafter who identified the coronavirus responsible through nasopharyngeal culture within 2 weeks of this event more than 30 countries reported affected individuals with more than 8000 confirmed cases worldwide and a 96 mortality rate 24 the pulmonary symptoms associated with sars typically non-productive cough and subsequent dyspnea did not present until several days after initial exposure to the virus as sars is caused by an airborne virus the risk of transmission was greatest amongst those involved in the direct care of an infected individual since no medications effectively treated sars interrupting transmission was the key to controlling the outbreak simple public health measures such as wearing surgical masks offered the most effective protection against transmission and there were no further confirmed cases as of july 2003 24 the public health lessons learned during the sars epidemic have proved invaluable in limiting the spread of mers cases worldwide mers was first recognized in september 2012 and as of october 2015 1611 cases have been reported with more than 570 related deaths 25 to date the largest cluster of cases to occur outside of the middle east was reported in south korea in may 2015 the index case was a businessman who developed pulmonary symptoms upon returning from a trip to the middle east a total of 185 cases were identified with 36 deaths 195 mortality rate 26 this proved the migrating capabilities of the virus and potential for outbreaks worldwide any clinician who sees an individual returning from the middle east presenting with fever and pulmonary symptoms within 14 days of travel should consider mers as a diagnosis and prompt investigations diagnosed by nasopharyngeal culture and public health control methods should be initiated no specific treatments or vaccine have been developed to date as with most infections the groups with the poorest outcomes related to mers infection are the young 12 years the elderly 65 years immunocompromised patients and those with multiple co-morbidities 22 clinically presentation is similar to sars but mers has a longer incubation period and greater severity of pulmonary symptoms and an even higher mortality risk all cases of mers confirmed worldwide to date have had a direct or indirect link with the middle eastpredominately saudi arabia it has proven to be less contagious than sars so far although it is expected that a more virulent virus will evolve where sars and mers have attracted much media coverage it should not be forgotten that the plague bacillus yersinia pestis still affects a great number of people each year 27 the pneumonic plague has seen endemic outbreaks in certain parts of africa with sporadic cases occurring worldwide historically there have been 3 pandemics involving the bubonic swollen painful lymph nodes and pneumonic plague in the 6th century the 14th century and the 19th century however it also re-emerged in the 1990s with a more limited distribution 27 the pneumonic plague occurs as a complication of the bubonic plague and is the only form capable of transmission from human-to-human via pulmonary droplets clinical sequelae are a dry cough within 24 h of first exposure which becomes productive before hemoptysis occurs with the sputum becoming increasingly more bloodied within the next 2448 hthis is a sign of certain mortality the major clinical clues in diagnosing the pneumonic plague are travel history rapid onset of symptoms sometimes hours from being asymptomatic to fever and coughhemoptysis and bilateral pneumonia 27 28 the patient is most contagious when hemoptysis develops simple protective measures such as wearing masks help prevent transmission 28 the last reported outbreak of the pneumonic plague was in madagascar in september 2014 there were 263 reported cases with a 269 mortality rate the plague has been endemic on the island for the past 30 yearsit is the most severely affected country in the world 29 while developing countries are at most risk of outbreaks of the disease sporadic cases can occur elsewhere four patients were diagnosed in july 2014 with pneumonic plague in colorado united states of america usa the index patient contracted the disease from his pet dog no deaths occurred and all patients rapidly responded to antibiotic treatment streptomycin tetracyclines and sulphonamides are used as the standard antibiotics with gentamicin and fluoroquinolones as alternatives 30 all close contacts should be given prophylactic antibiotics and monitored for symptoms the plague bacillus has previously been used in biological warfare during the 20th century yersinia pestis is an attractive agent due to easy accessibility simple culture needs and transmission via aerosol 31 it is important point to note that a plague outbreak can be easily controlled with simple public health measures and readily available antibiotics however if inappropriately managed the pneumonic plague is almost certainly fatal two viral infections noted to be causing outbreaks throughout the world are the hantaan causing hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hps and nipah viruses both diseases were microscopically discovered in the 1990s and are zoonotic they are transmitted to humans via rodents and via bats and pigs respectively both have a range of clinical symptoms and may present with flu-like symptoms continuing onto encephalitis with nipah virus or pulmonary failure and cardiogenic shock in hantavirus-related infections 32 33 the first nipah outbreak was in malaysia in 1999 a total of 276 cases were diagnosed with a 384 mortality rate 34 the outbreak spread into singapore and it was discovered that the virus was transmitted to humans from pigs this resulted in a cull of more than 1 million pigs to control the outbreak since then outbreaks have occurred in bangladesh and india with a mortality rate of around 75 35 most cases presented with pulmonary symptoms cough dyspnea and bilateral opacities covering the majority of the lung fields on chest radiograph and there was a higher human-to-human transmission rate in comparison to the malaysian outbreak 36 the nipah virus was readily identified in the saliva of infected patients allowing easy disease transmission there have only been outbreaks of the nipah virus in south east asia to date but there is potential for this disease to occur in other countries the intermediate host fruit bats from the pteropodidae family has an extensive habitat distribution and is native to parts of africa and northern australia 37 the treatment is limited to supportive carecontrol methods to prevent human-to-human transmission are very important to stop rapid spread studies have shown the antiviral drug ribavirin may reduce mortality from the infection 33 at present more than 21 hantaviruses from the bunyaviridae family have been identified as causing illness in humans signs of infection range from proteinuria to pulmonary edema and frank hemorrhagic illnesses 32 hps is most likely to occur in the americas although there are sporadic case reports from europe 38 the disease is most likely to be transmitted in areas where sanitation is poor or in rural farming areas rodents shed the virus in their urine droppings and saliva and the virus is transmitted between humans via pulmonary droplets 32 the first reported outbreak occurred in 1993 in the usa although retrospectively it seems the hantaviruses have been causing fatal pulmonary illnesses since the 1950s 39 the cluster of around 30 cases in 1993 occurred in an area of southwest usa known as the four corners clinicians identified a series of cases of a severe and acute pulmonary illness affecting young healthy adults where non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema developed rapidly to date more than 600 cases of hps have been reported in the usa 40 in 2012 the virus was discovered at yosemite national park where potentially hundreds of travellers were exposed to the infection ten cases of hps were confirmed 3 of which were fatal 41 treatment for hantavirus remains supportive intravenous fluids should be used with caution as aggressive fluid resuscitation is likely to accelerate the progression to pulmonary edema and failure due to capillary leakage 32 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo treatment has dramatically reduced mortality rates 42 the benefits of ribavirin therapy remain undetermined due to small trial numbers 43 to date only one hantavirus has evolved to transmit via human-to-human contact the andes virus named after its geographical discovery location in 1996 accurate diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion and should be considered in an individual presenting from a recent stay in north or south america with rapidly progressing pulmonary symptoms andor signs 32 the risk to a traveller in contracting any of the above outbreak diseases remains small given their limited geographical distribution at present the risk of exposure may be increased by several factors table 1 such as activities undertaken close contact with an infected individual and not seeking appropriate pre-travel information or recommendations as a clinician it is important to have up-to-date knowledge on current outbreaks occurring worldwide and their relevant geography as prompt recognition and diagnosis may prevent an epidemic q fever caused by c burnettii is a worldwide zoonotic disease outbreaks in humans have been linked to abattoirs and carriage of c burnettii by wind from farms of affected animals ticks can also act as a reservoir it is not strictly a travel-related illness but it is most likely found in areas where contamination with animal waste is common it presents as an acute febrile illness with non-specific signs such as atypical pneumonia 8 rural travelling is the greatest risk factor for acquiring the disease most recently q fever outbreaks have occurred in hungary where 70 cases were confirmed by micro-immunofluorescence testing and treated with 3 weeks of a tetracycline no deaths occurred efforts to reduce the spread of q fever after an outbreak include elimination of manure and disinfection of affected farms 8 legionella l pneumophila is a bacterium that can cause anything from a mild febrile illness to the potentially fatal form of pneumonia known as legionnaires disease the bacterium is ubiquitous in the environment and the same agent causes sporadic cases and outbreaks outbreaks are typically linked to contaminated water systems where conditions are ideal for rapid growth of the organism 44 in 2014 the who confirmed 302 cases of legionellosis in lisbon portugal that were related to a contaminated industrial cooling tower with 5 deaths as a result of the disease 45 most cases are reported after travel to developed countries in europe or north america at risk individuals are those with co-morbidities the elderly smokers and the immunosuppressed it is caused by inhalation of aerosols containing the bacterium and accounts for 215 of hospital admissions for community-acquired pneumonia with a summer or autumn peak 45 identification of affected individuals is by urinary pcr and treatment is with a macrolide antibiotic 46 pertussis and diphtheria are vaccine-preventable pulmonary infections poor vaccine uptake has led to a recent increase in cases in developed countries it is important therefore to take a full vaccination history in returned travellers who present with pulmonary symptoms 47 pertussis is a worldwide endemic-epidemic disease with outbreaks most likely during summerautumn time pertussis is thought to still cause around 63000 deaths per year in children under 5 years of age although there is uncertainty over these estimates in view of the paucity of reliable surveillance data 48 recently there has been an increase in the number of adolescent and young adults being diagnosed in some high-income countries likely due to decreased vaccination uptake rates and a change in the vaccine itself it is thought that the acellular vaccine currently used appears to have a short-lived immunity leading to increased infection rates 49 macrolide antibiotics are given to affected individuals to prevent further spread of pertussis 49 diphtheria presents as an acute infectious disease affecting the upper pulmonary tract caused by toxins produced by the bacterium characteristic features are membranous pharyngitis with fever enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes and edema of the soft tissues of the neck 50 this manifestation may lead to airway obstruction the bacterium has a short incubation period but untreated individuals may remain infectious for up to 4 weeks both pertussis and diphtheria are potentially fatal but easily preventable leptospirosis is contracted either through direct contact with infected animal urine or urine-contaminated water 10 it can be found worldwide but is predominantly found in tropical and subtropical countries during rainy season those taking part in water sports are most at risk an outbreak was reported among canyoning participants in martinique france 51 increased cases are also found in rural parts of a country where drinking water can be easily contaminated with the bacteria for example where wells have been poorly constructed 52 lately there has been an increase in the number of cases noted in europe with 97 cases identified in the netherlands in 2014 46-fold increase in comparison to previous years dutch tourists reported 33 cases of leptospirosis and most of these tourists acquired the disease in thailand 53 the clinical course of leptospirosis is variable with symptoms from myalgia to fever with cough and shortness of breath weils disease is its severest form and may develop in 15 of cases patients progress from mild flu-like symptoms to signs of organ failure jaundice and spontaneous bleeding 54 where there is a high degree of clinical suspicion for leptospirosis treatment should be instigated diagnosis is serological via microscopic agglutination test mat for antibodies or pcr urine antigen test but it may take around 10 days after the onset of symptoms for these tests to become positive 10 in early mild disease penicillin and tetracycline antibiotics are effective 55 where the clinically more severe weils disease is manifest patients may require organ support and there is little evidence that antibiotic use is of any benefit at this stage 56 in 2014 there were a total of 76 confirmed cases of leptospirosis in england and wales of which 22 were acquired overseas the majority of these were related to recreational water exposure 57 recreational activities such as camping and visiting rural and agricultural areas lead to increased risk to exposure to the bacterium that causes tularemia 58 typically found in the northern hemisphere the number of infected cases are underestimated and underreported 58 outbreaks have been reported on marthas vineyard massachusetts usa sweden and finland in the last 15 years 58 
francisella tularensis is the bacterium responsible for what is a potentially fatal multi-systemic disease reservoirs of transmission are via ticks biting flies aerosol water exposure and food 58 there are 4 identified subtypes and clinical presentation depends on biotype method of transmission and port of entry there are 6 major clinical presentations ulceroglandular glandular oculoglandular oropharyngeal pneumonic and typhoidal 58 pulmonary features may consist of lobar pneumonia pulmonary effusions infiltrates and hilar lymphadenopathy mortality in untreated pneumonic tularemia can be up to 60 59 early diagnosis and treatment is key to prognosis but isolation of the bacterium is hazardous and time consuming and most laboratories do not accept samples for culture 60 agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa tests are the diagnostic tests of choice 58 aminoglycosides are bactericidal against f tularensis and who recommend a 10-day course 61 as an aside f tularensis subspecies tularensis type a is one of the most infectious pathogens known to man and these properties have led to tularemia being identified as a potential weapon of bioterrorism 60 in south east asia and northern australia a particular gram-negative organism called b pseudomallei is responsible for an endemic of melioidosis disease 62 most commonly the initial presentation is with low-grade fever and atypical pneumonia rapidly progressing to multi-organ dysfunction the mortality rate is very high ranging from 14 to 40 in general and up to 80 with inappropriate antimicrobial therapy 9 difficulties in culturing the bacterium responsible mean that under-reporting is likely the bacterium resides in soil and water with transmission occurring mainly from percutaneous inoculation and inhalation exposure is most likely to occur during the wet seasons in affected areas or after natural catastrophes such as tsunamis sporadic cases of the infection are now being reported worldwide and manifestations of latent forms of the disease are appearing some tens of years after initial exposure 63 as the number of international travellers continues to rise particularly to more rural parts of south east asia and northern australia this could lead to an increase in the number of travel-related melioidosis cases in the future early recognition of melioidosis is essential as the bacterium is resistant to nearly all drugs given for community-acquired pneumonia 63 current treatment recommendations are ceftazidime or a carbapenem followed by eradication therapy with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for at least 3 months there has been recent interest in vaccine development due to both public health and bioweapon concerns 64 mouse model vaccination has proved successful but to date there has been no testing on humans 64 tb is a commonly found disease in certain parts of the world the risk of tb as a travel-related disease has not been well established a study from italy in 2005 concluded that over half of returned travellers with pneumonia or tb presented with a febrile illness but no pulmonary symptoms 65 tb can be transmitted on airplanes a flight from baltimore to honolulu showed 4 of 15 passengers had a positive tuberculin skin test after sitting in close proximity to a passenger with pulmonary tb 6 an overall probability of infection is 1 in 1000 when a symptomatic source is present in close proximity 6 risk is linked to longer-term travel to areas of higher prevalence and proximity to affected individuals those most at risk would be healthcare workers or individuals visiting relatives 66 tb risk in long-term travellers of greater than 3 months is the same as the local population in high endemic areas a dutch study showed there was substantial risk to long-term travellers with an overall incidence rate of 35 per 1000 person-months travelled however no-one in this study had received a bacillus calmettegurin bcg vaccine prior to travelling therefore incidence amongst those who have been vaccinated is likely to be lower 66 in recent years multidrug-resistant tb mdr-tb and extensively drug-resistant tb xdr-tb have become increasingly important public health problems in many countries eastern europe parts of asia and southern africa 67 the potential risk of transmission of particularly dangerous forms of tb requires renewed vigilance since 2006 who have been informed of several incidences of patients travelling short-haul by air with mdr-tb and xdr-tb in these cases only close family members have been later diagnosed with the disease but a potential risk to other travellers is possible given the infectious nature of these strains of tb 67 who have since published guidelines for tb and air travel to prevent the spread of the disease 67 the main advice to clinicians is that the number of tb infections is increasing as are mdr-tb and xdr-tb disease the risks to most travellers in contracting tb are small but increase depending on vaccination status length of travel mode of travel and travel destination if pulmonary symptoms persist despite negative standard microscopy culture and sensitivity testing tb should be added to the differential diagnosis list and should be investigated appropriately histoplasmosis should be considered in travellers returning from the midwest and central states of north america throughout latin america and central and western africa 6870 in 2013 approximately 300 cases were reported in the south west region of china the first to be reported in asia 68 coccidioidomycosis valley fever has long been recognized as a travel-related mycosis endemic areas are in southern california arizona and central and south america 69 in returned travellers when common causes for flu-like illness non-productive cough and pleuritic chest pain have been ruled out but symptoms continue to persist an underlying fungal infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis 
histoplasma capsulatum is endemic in north and latin america while h dubiosii is mainly found in central and western africa 70 the organism grows in soils enriched with bat and bird droppings and human infection generally occurs after dust inhalation of disturbed soil the incubation period is relatively short and symptoms develop within 2 weeks of exposure 69 reticulonodular shadowing on chest radiograph is common often with mediastinal lymphadenopathy detection of the histoplasma antibody in urine or serum is the most sensitive and widely used diagnostic method 70 detection of coccidioidomycosis coccidioides immitis is similar but radiologically a cavitating pneumonia may be seen 69 in healthy individuals fungal infections are generally self-limiting in those who are immunocompromised andor go on to develop severe infection with systemic complications antifungals have been proven to be effective 70 in contrast to histoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis infection generally leads to acquired immunity therefore recurrence is unlikely 69 pulmonary symptoms such as wheeze breathlessness and hemoptysis and an eosinophilia in a returned traveller should prompt investigations for helminths these infections may present as loefflers syndrome a result of larval migration through the lungs or tropical pulmonary eosinophilia hypersensitivity to lymphatic filarial worms specific to schistosomiasis infections katayama syndrome should be suspected in travellers returning from africa or south east asia with fresh water exposure presenting with fever eosinophilia dry cough and urticarial rash other rare pulmonary presentation of helminths infections such as paragonimus toxocariasis and dirofilariasis should be considered depending on travel destination and incubation period 71 treatment of these infections is generally straightforward once the causative helminths have been identified in 20 of hydatidosis echinococcosis tapeworm there are pulmonary infiltrations the majority of cases are asymptomatic but following a leaking hydatid cyst in the liver patients may present with pleuritic chest pain breathlessness and cough a water lily sign may be seen on chest radiograph 72 surgery aspiration and anti-parasitic drugs are required to fully treat the infection we identified references for this review by searches in different databases pubmed ovid medline embase and cochrane and references from relevant articles the following mesh headings were used pulmonary respiratory tropical disease travellers travel returning traveller the references were all further assessed by reading the title and abstract only articles published in english were included we further assessed the references of all selected publications the final reference list was generated on the basis of relevance to the topics covered in this review  old and new pestilences andrew arata a   there has been much popular interest in as well as technical concern over newly emerging diseases and there is a fear that heretofore unknown virulent pathogens will create new global epidemics at the time of this writing two such pathogens are active warranting such concern a cases of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus appeared in china in november 2002 and has spread to western and central europe and north america b a strain of avian influenza virus n5h1 first identified in hong kong in 1997 reemerged in 2002 in southeast asia other avian flu strains found simultaneously in poultry in north america have underscored the concern of local and international health authorities both sars and avian flu demonstrate high mortality rates but to date the number of cases has been only in the hundreds so are these pestilences what constitutes a pestilence is the term synonymous with newly emerging diseases two definitions of pestilence have near unanimity but are not very specific a any fatal epidemic disease affecting man or beast and destroying many victims the oxford universal dictionary 3 rd edition 1955 oxford press 2515 pp b a contagious or infectious epidemic disease that is virulent and devastating webster s seventh new collegiate dictionary 1965 g  c merriam co springfield mass 1221 pp accordingly a pestilence should be an infectious disease devastating killing a large number of people or animals the truly epidemic diseases are usually of viral or bacterial origin although we will make a case for some other types of pestilences the classification of that may have been bubonic plague continuing until ad 750 the black death of the fourteenth century which continued to appear in chronic pockets of europe and the middle and near east for centuries thereafter is by far the best-known plague and the one that produced the greatest mortality and social impact on the affected populations consider that as a conservative estimate 2533 of the european population died and maybe more this death rate reduced the available work force so that for the first time peasants and landless people could sell their labor which introduced freedom of movement and resulted in economic changes that eventually contributed to the decline of the feudal system the 3 rd pandemic of plague began in the 1850s and continues to this date although reduced in more recent years a major characteristic of this epidemic has been the dissemination of plague from its traditional homes in africa and asia into areas previously plague free especially north and south america by the inadvertent transport of rats and their fleas by boat the infection is now well established in africa gerbils central asia gerbils ground squirrels or susliks and marmots southeast asia various rattus species north america ground squirrels and some native field mice and south america introduced rattus the last major urban outbreak was in surat india in 1994 more than 6500 cases and 56 deaths were reported however the impact of this outbreak was also seen in the number of people who fled the plague zone and the over two billion dollar loss that ensued only a few outbreaks are reported to who each year indochina and burma frequently report as well as sites in africa ovamboland on the frontier between namibia and angola the united states has a vast infected area in the west of the country but only 8-10 cases per year are reported with 1-2 deaths on average every 10 years many other sites of infection are known and should be monitored as some rodent species are highly susceptible to serving as effective amplifying reservoirs whereas others maintain low-level infections for long periods of time allowing much time to pass between outbreaks environmental measures rat-proofing rodent and flea control etc are the first measures of control surveillance prompt diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics eg streptomycin and tetracycline are recommended yellow fever is the best known of the arboviral arthropod-borne virus diseases there are some 500 known arboviruses of which about 100 produce disease in man both the yellow fever virus and the primary mosquito vector aedes aegypt are of african origin -the species name aegypti refers to classical africa in general not specifically modern egypt most cases in africa occur east to west along the transition zone ecotone between the savannas and the rain forests inhabited by numerous aedine vectors as well as a aegypti the disease has two cycles a jungle cycle involving various tree dwelling mosquitoes and nonhuman primates as reservoirs and an urban cycle with a aegypti as the vector and humans as reservoirs the last reported major african outbreak vectored by a aegypti occurred in nigeria and involved some 20000 cases and over 4000 deaths between 1986 and 1991 yellow fever was introduced into the americas one or more times most likely during the age of sail the virus can be transmitted vertically transovarian passage in a aegypti the mosquito s eggs can easily be laid in water barrels and withstand desiccation for months only to hatch and develop when submersed at a later date epidemics of yf raged throughout the caribbean and tropical america until the end of the 1800s when the transmission cycle was elucidated by the team led by walter reed confirming the role of a aegypti which had been proposed by but not confirmed by carlos finlay epidemics occurred as far north as philadelphia in the united states and the last epidemic in north america occurred in new orleans as late as 1905 with over 3000 deaths cases with 25-50 mortality continue to occur sporadically in brazil and in the foothills of several andean countries bolivia peru ecuador and colombia  often the victims are young indigenous males from the highlands who were temporarily working in the coca processing plants in the forests these infected areas are only kilometers from large cities with populations of more than 1 million people such as santa cruz bolivia which are accessible by public transportation and are heavily infested with a aegypti although the yf vaccine is one of the oldest safest and most effective available and immunological protection is rated for at least 10 years vaccination coverage in many of the affected areas of africa and south america is low the cholera pathogen vibrio cholera originally described by robert koch was one of the first human pathogens along with anthrax and tuberculosis to be identified in the late 1800s shortly after pasteur s publication of the germ theory koch and his students studied material they collected in alexandria egypt during an 1883 outbreak it was difficult to determine the origin of cholera andor to distinguish it historically from other diarrhetic diseases except by the severity and rapidity of onset health historians such as mcneill suggest an origin on the indian sub-continent associated with dense populations poor hygiene and certain religious practices such as communal bathing thus the term asiatic cholera by which the disease became known in europe in the 1800s the disease s appearance in europe and the americas london and new york in 1832 and again in 1854 were clearly associated with intercontinental traffic it was during the 1854 epidemic in london that a physician john snow noted the clustering of cases and deaths in people using the same water source and proposed what turned out to be the correct action to stop the epidemic take the handle off the broad street pump although he had no idea of the actual cause of the disease however it was such observations along with structural hygienic and administrative changes in major cities particularly in europe and north america that established the public health measures that we tend to take for granted in this early part of the 21 st century cholera is still with us various serotypes of the vibrio have spread since the early 1960s affecting over 25 countries in asia 21 in the americas and into the west pacific in 1993 approximately 400000 cases and 6800 deaths from cholera were reported in 1991 the el tor strain of cholera was reported in lima peru by 1994 almost a million cases had been reported in the western hemisphere measles is one of the oldest known and most widespread infections of man epidemics ascribed to measles appear in the oldest literature although they are often confused with smallpox however in 622 ad ad ahrun a christian priest living in alexandria egypt described the pox lesion and in 910 ad the arab physician al-razi distinguished between the two diseases prior to widespread immunization measles was common in childhood-more than 90 of people were infected by age 20 although endemic in large communities measles became epidemic every several years with the severity of infection decreasing with the frequency of the epidemics in his study of the history of plagues mcneill makes mention of the importance of animal husbandry and zoonotic diseases in the area measles he claims is probably related to both rinderpest in hoofed-mammals and canine distemper because dogs sheep and goats have been domesticated for at least 10000 years measles may have been among the first viral diseases to have jumped the species barrier as we will see most if not all of the new pestilences are or may be derived from animal wild or domesticated reservoirs measles was responsible for or contributed to along with smallpox the decimation of the indigenous amerindian populations first in central and south america at the time of the spanish conquest 1500s and later 1700s and 1800s in north america amerindian populations lacked immunological protection from these and other imported infectious diseases some attribute this immunological navet to the comparatively small number of domesticated animal species-dogs ducks and turkeys guinea pigs and cameloids llamas and relatives in the andes and few if any in large number prior to the european invasion in any case the attack and mortality rates were staggering by one estimate a pre-conquest amerindian population of perhaps thirty million by 1556 was reduced by 90 down to only 3 million this catastrophe occurred in less than 50 years after the spanish entered the american mainland influenza is another viral disease that has many unstable varieties infecting a host of mammalian and avian species both wild sylvatic and domestic epidemics with symptoms similar to modern influenza were noted by hippocrates as early as 412 bc and later in rome by livy various medieval and renaissance writings describe influenza-like illnesses robert johnson of philadelphia is credited with the first modern description of an influenza epidemic which occurred in that city in 1793 his description was applied to subsequent epidemics in 1833 1837 1847 1889-90 and 1918 antigenic shifts in the structure of the influenza virus may change the virulence of the strains increasing the likelihood of epidemics the most severe flu epidemic ever recorded 1918 1919 -also known as the spanish flu although it did not originate there-first struck world war i troops of all combatant nations while in northern france and it continued on to become a global pandemic conservative estimates of mortality range between twenty and forty million persons and other estimates more than double these figures the ease with which the various influenza strains infect domestic mammals pigs and poultry chickens and ducks producing huge reservoirs of potentially infectious material often proximate to human habitations is a major public health concern especially worrisome are the conditions under which millions of such animals are raised and brought to market the old diseases examined above are only a few of those which might be used as examples of the old pestilences others might prefer to include schistosomiasis typhus murine andor louse-borne and several of the classic childhood diseases diptheria pertussis tetanus rubella as well as leprosy yaws the leishmaniases and certainly smallpox fortunately many of those mentioned here schisto and others are being controlled rather well in some areas by vaccines specific drugs andor antibiotics when applicable at least in the more developed countries even polio which had been a major epidemic threat for centuries has been virtually eliminated as a threat in areas where the politics and health infrastructure allow the efficient application of this very effective vaccine much of the fear engendered by specific diseases depends on the time place and severity of the local outbreaks as well as the knowledge and perception of the community for example i was raised in new orleans in the southeast of the united states during the 1930s although i and my brothers were normal well nourished children our parents were fearful of dogs rabies cuts on unshod feet tetanus and any summer colds or stiffnessweakness of the extremities polio and they preached cleanliness as a means to prevent anything bad happening these diseases are old but at present each has developed certain new characteristics that make their modern expression different from their historic ones and decreases our ability to control them in the last 50 years malaria parasites have developed resistance to chloroquine the most common globally used anti-malarial drug at the same time the anopheline mosquito vectors of malaria have progressively developed a parallel resistance to the insecticides used to control them dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf have spread globally infecting vast new areas especially urban areas where the human living conditions are substandard but readily suited for vector breeding finally tuberculosis whose incidence was slowly reduced in the late 1800s and early 1900s by improved public health housing conditions and nutrition has again surfaced as a secondary infection to immuno-compromised persons especially those suffering from hiv infections at the same time the causative agent mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to develop resistance to the most economic and readily available antibiotics malaria is caused by blood parasites of the genus plasmodium and vectored by anopheline mosquitoes there are four species of human malaria parasites p falciparum p malariae p vivax and p ovale as well as a number of related species infecting other mammals non-human primates rodents etc historians note that malaria-like symptoms were discussed in the chinese canon of medicine 2700 bc and malaria-like illnesses were described in 6 th -century bc cuneiform literature from nineveh now part of iraq hippocrates made a connection between stagnant water and fevers in the local population it is estimated that there are still several hundred million unreported cases each year resulting in 1-2 million deaths per annum mostly children although malaria is still endemic in asia latin america and africa 90 of the cases are found in africa where p falciparum is the most common malaria parasite such huge figures mask the focal and sometimes epidemic nature of malaria which may be brought about by natural or man-made environmental conditions some of the human activities that may enhance malaria transmission may be development projects for agriculture eg irrigation schemes other water and land use projects as in the amazon basin converting forest areas through resource extraction such as mining and logging into marginal livestock and farming areas often such environmental changes bring about changes in malaria transmission from stable endemic to unstable epidemic in highly endemic areas severe malaria and death is concentrated in the younger age groups whereas in the areas of unstable epidemic transmission severe malaria and death is more evenly distributed throughout all age groups needless to say prevention and or case control strategies must be different for each transmission type in many parts of the world the anopheline vectors of malaria have developed resistance to the insecticides used for their control frequently this is due to the use often excessive of the same or similar insecticides for control of agricultural pests in the same geographic areas such resistance not only hinders control operations directly but also indirectly by increasing the need for greater quantities andor more costly insecticides broadscale usage of insecticides has also become limited on environmental grounds because some donors have reduced funding insecticide purchases by far the most serious setback to malaria control in recent decades has been the emergence and spread of chloroquine-resistant strains of p falciparum the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria and the most common in africa emerging in the 1950s in southeast asia and south america resistance spread rapidly from these focal points it was not noted in africa until 1979-80 but spread rapidly in the ensuing ten-fifteen years chloroquine-resistant strains of p vivax have been identified in some areas of southeast asia new guinea and indonesia efforts to produce a malaria vaccines have been under way for over 25 years a number of candidate vaccines have been produced but none are operational in humans as yet like yellow fever described earlier dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever are vector-borne diseases transmitted primarily but not exclusively by the mosquito aedes aegypti classical dengue is caused by infection with one of the four serotypes of the dengue virus dhf may occur following a subsequent infection with a different serotype the following quotation is from an article written by the author in 1999 r lennox and a arata dengue fever an environmental plague for the new millennium capsule report environmental health projectusaid 8 pp with 25 billion people at risk and estimated cases in the tens of milllions dengue is considered by many to be the second most important vector-borne disease in the world surpassed only by malaria classical dengue and its more lethal form dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf now circle the world with endemic illness and continuing threats of epidemics dengue is very much an environmental disease affecting urban and periurban settlements in more than 100 countries it is characterized by seasonal outbreaks of illness carried by mosquitoes that thrive in household containers which collect water such as flowerpots and washtubs and in the detritus of human consumption such as bottles tin cans and old bottles children specially in asia are most frequently and seriously affected by the severe form of the infection dhf mosquito control is the only effective approach to prevention although effective case management will reduce mortality insecticides targeted at larval mosquitoes are effective but resistance of mosquitoes to affordable and environmentally safe chemicals as well as declining will and infrastructure have all but eliminated this approach in most countries vaccines are in the pipeline but a system which could deliver them to half the world s population is probably at least a decade away community action-to protect containers from becoming havens for mosquito breeding and to dispose of empty containers and trash along with surveillance and personal protection-is the best hope for transmission risk reduction tuberculosis is another ancient disease that has bridged the old to new definition the tb bacillus mycobacterium tuberculosis was among the first to be scientifically identified and described by robert koch in 1882 the disease is transmitted by airborne droplets from people with pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis this mode of transmission is most effective in dense populations and hence tb became widespread with the development of urban centers in the middle ages europe and was very common from the 14 th century until recently in europe with improvements in housing and nutrition tb rates continued to decline except for periods of war until the first half of the 20 th century at that time two conditions emerged the development of multiple drug resistant tb mdrtb and the emergence and spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids upon which tb is an opportunistic infection prior to 1984 about 10 of tb bacilli isolated from patients in the us were resistant to even one antibacterial drug in 1984 52 were resistant to at least one drug and 32 were resistant to more than one drug in the us the cost of treatment of ten cases of mdrtb in texas in 1990 was us 950443 who lists tb as one of the major causes of mortality in the world a new major funding effort who and world bank and various bilateral donor groups is focusing on hivaids tb and malaria as the most serious and intractable causes of death other forms of tb including non-pulmonary cases and those associated with other species of mycobacterium sp eg m bovis are sporadic but suggest the possible very early animal origin of the pathogen group diseases such as chagas disease and schistosomiasis are examples of diseases that do not easily fit the epidemic definitions of a pestilence mentioned earlier in this chapter but they do heavily impact the affected populations not only through mortality rates but especially through morbiditydisability there are several forms of schistosomiasis caused by different species of schistosoma a blood fluke trematode-this is an ancient illness known from egyptian antiquity infections occur in fresh water where people work andor wash and children play larval worms known as cercaria developed in a snail intermediate host pass through the skin and penetrate diverse organs according to species the most important effects are those that arise from chronic and cumulative infection chagas disease has a very different etiology mode of transmission and pathology than does schistosomiasis by definition it could be new because it was first described in 1907 by the brazilian carlos chagas who subsequently described the pathogen a flagellate protozoan trypanosoma cruzi and the vectors bloodfeeding triatomine bugs the disease is also know as american trypanosomiasis and occurs only in the western hemisphere from mexico to argentina-a few cases have been reported in north america this form is very different from african trypanosomiasis sleeping sickness the initial acute phase of the disease usually occurs in children there is then a long latent phase 20 years or more culminating later in life in a chronic phase which may include irreversible cardiac andor intestinal manifestations and shortened life spans in the victims paho and who consider chagas disease to be the most serious parasitic disease in latin america and the main cause of heart disease in the region there is no adequate medical intervention the infection can be transmitted by vectors congenitally or by transfusion of blood or blood products an estimated 100 million persons in the region are at risk and in some countries eg bolivia 25 of the 8 million inhabitants have been shown to be seropositive in addition in bolivia one study demonstrated that the burden of chagas disease in terms of disability adjusted life years dalys was 4 million dalys or estimated loss of 494 million bolivianos equal to more than 100 million us dollars at the time of the report 1994 the purpose of this brief segment is to emphasize that pestilences need not carry with them only high mortality very high morbidity and sustained disability with all the concurrent social and economic implications can be a tremendous burden on a population-or a nation puerperal fever a forgotten pestilence is caused by a streptococcal infection and is an iatrogenic disease induced by a physician that was once the scourge of pregnant women before physicians learned to wash their hands before examining pregnant women andor assisting at childbirth improved hygiene in hospitals was concurrent with the development of the germ theory and mortality rates dropped quickly this disease also called childbirth fever was never reported as one of the great pestilences however a few figures reveal the state of scientific knowledge regarding any infectious diseases both endemic and epidemic it is frightening that not only was the incidence of puerperal fever higher in the hospitals but so was the associated mortality 35  of the patients died if the disease occurred after a home delivery but 80-90  died if the disease was contracted in a hospital although we have no crystal ball to predict what if any new pestilences are in store for mankind in the future several groups of zoonotic viruses include likely candidates table 2  also included is hivaids truly a new pestilence that already in a relatively brief period has taken its place among the worst pestilences ever known to man as mentioned above there are over 500 arboviruses isolated and characterized-about 100 are capable of infecting humans from nonapparent infections to very severe ones two of these have already been mentioned above dengue and dhf and yellow fever but the arboviruses as a group represent the source of many potentially new diseases-or put more correctly existing zoonotic diseases that emerge when humans accidentally become involved in their cycles a good example is the recent outbreak of west nile encephilitis in the us in 1999 and 2000 the virus was isolated fromaround new york city from large numbers of dead birds especially crows and jays 21 human cases and two deaths were confirmed by 2001 the disease moved west toward the mississippi river infecting 55 people and killing nine in 2002 there were over 2400 cases 117 fatal by 2003 the virus and human cases were found in all 48 contiguous states excepting alaska and hawaii the virus has been found in mammals birds and mosquitoes throughout the us but is this a new disease or just a disease new to us west nile virus has been found in over 50 countries since its discovery in 1937 in uganda and has been most of the above are mosquito-borne and the major mosquito vector genera culex aedes and anopheles have global representatives from which a competent vector might be found the same is true of ticks sandflies and other potential vectors rodents or other local vertebrates may serve as reservoir hosts while infected migratory birds may provide distribution of the infection although many arboviral infections have broadly similar transmission cycles the ecology and dynamics of each may differ widely arboviruses do not belong to a single viral family but rather to severalwhich increases their diversification although the potential for increased arboviral epizootics or epidemics is high the most recent episodes have not been high on the pestilence scale rather the most severe arboviral epidemics have been yf and denguedhf the oldest of the group the arenaviruses were thought for years to be monotypic a single species lymphocytic choriomeningitis lcm occurring primarily in the house mouse laboratory mouse mus musculus the virus first described in 1933 has been isolated in numerous locations but human disease is known only from europe and the americas a second arenavirus was isolated from a phyllostomatid fruit-eating bat from trinidad but there was no associated human disease severe hemorrhagic cases in argentina and later in bolivia in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the discovery of new viruses and diseases in these countries-junin virusargentine hemorrhagic fever ahf and machupo virusbolivian hemorrhagic fever bhf more recently additional arenaviruses found in brazil sabia virus and venezuela guanarito virus produce similar hemorrhagic symptoms ahf is the most common 200-4000 recorded annually between 1958 and 1995-the others are only sporadic but mortality rates are high in all these diseases in each of these transmission is by contact with infected rodent excreta dust and other substances associated with grain harvesting and storage there are another five arenaviruses in the americas that are not known to cause any illness in humans or their rodent hosts all of the rodents associated with these viruses belong to only one of the 13 rodent families currently inhabiting south america these rodent genera calomys sigmodon oryzomys et al  are very closely related and share a common ancestry paleontological evidence indicates that the isthmus of panama was a bridge connecting north and south america more than 2-3 million years ago allowing a faunal interchange the sigmodont rodent progenitors entered south america at that time and rapidly evolved into the modern genera and species presumably the ancestor virus tagged along co-evolving into the situation that now exists by far the most important arenaviral disease is lassa fever discovered in nigeria in 1970 it is known from 15 african countries mostly in west and central africa but also zimbabwe and mozambique the natural host of lassa virus is the multi-mammate rat mastomys natalensis one of the most common and widely distributed african field rats like their south american counterparts the ahf and bhf hosts mastomys is basically a grassland species easily adapting to the man-made grasslands of maize sorghum millet sugarcane and other cultivated grasses cases of lassa are generally associated with agricultural activities and food storage transmission is by contact with excreta of infected rodents without laboratory facilities for confirmation it is difficult to distinguish lassa fever from ebola yf or even severe cases of malaria there are an estimated 500000 cases a year with more than 15 mortality rate in hospitalized cases the disease is more severe in pregnancy with fetal mortality reported at more than 80 in the early 1970s and before ebola outbreaks occurred lassa caused great consternation in europe and the americas over the possibility of introduction of this disease these concerns still exist and have been heightened after the appearance of these other groups of viral hemorrhagic diseases the hantaviruses are comprised of two large groups of viruses all transmitted by rodents and producing a range of hemorrhagic renal andor pulmonary complications the old world hantaviruses are comprised of over 20 different viruses several known for some time under a different classification eg hanta virus is the cause of korean hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome an important military disease in the 1950s most cases still occur in agrarian and military populations and occur in over 50 countries in asia africa and europe each year approximately 200000 cases occcur in eurasia with more than 50 of these reported in china case fatalities range from 01 to 100 depending on the virus the 15 or so new world hantaviruses produce a pulmonary rather than a renal syndrome since being described as a group in 1993 approximately 1000 cases have been reported in the americas with a high case fatality rate 45-50  the natural hostsreservoirs for the hantavirus groups are mostly muroid rodents old world group and cricetid rodents new world group this is not surprising as these two are amongst the largest and most widely distributed mammalian families however the manner and zones of transmission are similarrodent contamination of grain crops in the field and storage where people come in contact with rodent excreta the two closely related filoviruses marburg and ebola are among the most virulent viruses yet described with an overall fatality rate of more than 75 and higher in several outbreaks possibly augmented by use of dirty syringes and needles to give injectable chloroquine an anti-malarial drug to the patient s friends who carried himher to the hospital marburg virus was first described 1967 among monkeys sent from east africa to european laboratories there killing laboratory technicians subsequent outbreaks have occurred in africa ebola virus appeared in 1976 in simultaneous outbreaks in zaire democratic republic of congo barry 2004 one ebola strain was implicated in an outbreak in an animal holding facility in reston virginia usa several humans seroconverted but showed no disease symptoms the repeated outbreaks of ebola and marburg virus mostly in central africa have been described as commencing with rapidity and devastation during an epidemic transmission is generally by contact with contaminated blood or other tissues from infected persons most outbreaks have been in rather remote areas with poor health care facilities so that patients are seen only with advanced symptoms we have not been able to find reservoir organisms there have been subsequent better equipped expeditions than the one described in the footnote but none have been successful nor do we know the mechanisms of transmission in the wild one distinct ebola virus strain from ivory coast was isolated from a chimpanzee primates are hunted and eaten by humans in parts of africa and this may serve as the link at which the viruses are able to cross the species barrier and enter the human population barry 2004 the government of sudan requested who assistance and the government of zaire requested the same from the us government cdc representatives of who and cdc met in the next few days at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine to work out details and coordination who was represented by dr paul bres and the author and cdc by dr karl johnson we had all thought of lassa and marburg viral fevers and were surprised when dr johnson said it was neither he then showed us electron photomicrographs of tissue taken from an early case-the stringlike 6 and 9 figures were just like marburg but he explained this one was serologically distinct from marburg and they proposed to name it after a river in the area the ebola we agreed that i aaa and a virologist dr bruce johnson from the lshtm would go to the site in sudan to sample potential reservoirs andor vectors bruce would bring the supplies needed for taking tissue samples and the liquid nitrogen containers needed to return the samples to the uk i was to gather the animal collecting materials who had no such equipment in geneva of course so i borrowed mist nets for collecting bats from the british musum natural history and the muse d histoire naturelle in geneva and borrowed sample rodent traps from the swiss agricultural research station in nyon near geneva we had the traps made in nzara one of the sites of the outbreak in sudan to autoclave the dissecting instruments we purchased two household pressure cookers at the local super market migros in geneva placed on stones over an open fire they served well an experimental ebola vaccine has been reported to be successful in trials with non-human primates human trials will be conducted soon two previously unknown and unrelated human viral infections severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and an asian avian influenza strain h5n1 originating in southeast asia have received a great deal of popular attention and public health concern in november 2002 cases of a respiratory illness subsequently labeled sars appeared in china a delay in timely reporting of the initial cases allowed it to spread to other southeast asian countries australia the americas and at least 10 european countries reports of the actual number of persons infected varied but cases numbered in the thousands and mortality rates of up to 15 were indicated surveys of wild animals captured for human consumption quickly showed that ferrets civets related to mongooses and raccoon dogs shaggy fox-like carnivores were positive for harboring the virus but it is not known if any of these are the true reservoir in nature the who has reported that the chain of transmission may have been broken no new cases reported in a period of time equal to two consecutive 10 day incubation periods this is clearly a case of a virus species jumping in the world s largest most densely populated country this could spell disaster especially if the reporting network is compromised the asian avian influenza strain initially appeared in poultry in hong kong in 1997 when it jumped the species barrier and killed 6 out of 18 infected persons this recent outbreak spread to korea december 2003  then japan and vietnam january 2004 hong kong reportedly slaughtered 14 million chickens and ducks and as many as three million slaughtered through the southeast asia region but other reports indicate that there are nonspecific wild variants of this strain in wild birds that serve as natural reservoirs of major concern is that outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza are increasing in frequency and severity reportedly in the 40 years from 1959 to 1998 there were only 17 outbreaks but in the past six years from 1997 to 2003 there have been six not including the most recent incidents if bubonic plague was the quintessential pestilence of the ancient and medieval worlds acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the human immunodeficiency virus aidshiv is the chief pestilence of the modern world and it is still growing not receding there is also a vast literature that will not be reviewed here but the following 2003 data points describe the severity of the pandemic pestilence r aids is gaining a firmer foothold in the large populations of india and china r world wide 40 million people are infected with hiv r 25-28 million of these infected people live in sub-saharan africa r 5 million persons became infected this year 700000 are children r 3 million persons died of aids this year 500000 of them less than 15 years old r existence of simian immunodeficiency virus siv suggests animal origin the social damage accompanying this pandemic is not reflected in the bare figures given above especially the orphaned children destroyed family structures and so forth it has been estimated that 10 billion dollars us per annum is required to provide the prevention and treatment facilities and services needed to date less than one-half 47 billion per annum has been made available some of the old category diseases are still strongly with us eg malaria tb influenza and by adapting traits such as drug-resistance and crossing or jumping species they expand their reservoir-host base as such they could be considered new some other old diseases are rather well controlled in the developed countries where the surveillance systems are efficient and vaccination and other preventive services are readily available and properly used these would include smallpox eradicated polio eradicated in some areas and childhood illnesses such as pertussis diptheria tetanus measles and so on even bubonic plague could be characterized as being under control-it is widespread but also well understood and with vector control and appropriate antibiotics outbreaks are not severe and mortality is low on the other hand some of the new most recently discovered diseases like ebola and hivaids are hard to handle we know little about the natural history of ebola lassa or the south american hemorrhagic fevers and our knowledge of hivaids in the laboratory probably exceeds our understanding of the socioeconomic impacts it is having on whole cultures when lassa virus jumped from the field rat mastomys to humans it was dreadfully virulent and it seemed to come from nowhere but after a few years we know that with one exception from a bat all arenaviruses are well adapted to particular rodent groups most rodents are grass eaters and lots of crops are grasses wheat maize sugarcane rice etc therefore the arenaviral fevers are seen primarily in agricultural settings and with stored grain yet for the more recently known hantavirus group or even less with the multiferous arboviruses we do not have good data on ecological determinents or even host-reservoir relationships at the same time people are modifying environmental conditions rapidly and extensively and we have little information indicating whether such changes will eliminate potential disease cycles or exacerbate them this may be even more important for diseases like influenza if they have obligate or opportunistic vertebrate hosts and these are coincidentily reduced in number or eliminated what selection pressures are set in action on the virus population to select new hosts and when it comes to modifying environments man has no equal yet we know that this microbial evolution is going on at a rapid pace-just look at how fast drug-resistance develops and spreads in reading articles and researching references for this document i was amazed to discover again how many human illnesses have their direct animal zoonotic counterparts or were vectoredhosted by arthropods rodents or snails and how an avian influenza can become a mammalian influenza very quickly and how a bat or an oppossum can do the same for the chagas disease trypanosome it is in this context that i feel that we know very little of the natural history or the ecological dynamics of the disease transmission cycles we teach especially disturbing is to read of a new strain of asian avian influenza and the necessity around the world to kill millions of birds if one was to dream up a model pathogen incubator and dissemination engine the perfect model would be a modern chicken farm of 500000 birds defecating as birds do and that at a constant temperature and with residues of organic chicken feed all about and we wonder why new diseases emerge any farmer worth hisher salt knows that monoculture breeds pests this is a good place to bring up one other difficult subject-bioterrorism it is difficult for one dedicated to public health principles to imagine why anyone would even consider using infectious diseases as a weapon but it is being done and we need to be able to distinguish between a natural epidemic and one orchestrated by man again knowledge of the natural history of the organisms their natural hosts and reservoirs will help already the usa is stockpiling smallpox and anthrax vaccines in large quantities one final point most people concerned with new versus old pestilences work as epidemiologists infectious disease specialists hospital officials and so forth but public health work is broader than the study and treatment of infectious diseases and the study the global burden of disease sponsored by the who world bank and harvard university based on measuring dalys predicts that fewer infectious disease will be as important in the future as they are at present for example the next two decades will see dramatic changes in the health needs of the world s populations and non-communicable diseases such as depression and heart disease    are replacing the traditional enemies such as infectious diseases and malnutrition maybe toxic smog and non-communicable diseases will replace pestilences both old and new  demographic and environmental drivers of metagenomic viral diversity in vampire bats laura bergner m richard orton j julio benavides a daniel becker j carlos tello roman biek daniel streicker g   viruses occur across all environments that support life where they play crucial roles in ecosystem function and in the health of their hosts manrique et al 2016 suttle 2005 additionally viruses have played foundational evolutionary roles by introducing novel diversity into host genomes feschotte  gilbert 2012 which has for instance contributed to the development of mammalian placentas chuong 2013 mi et al 2000 and enhanced antiviral defence through host domestication of viral proteins arnaud et al 2007 yan bucklerwhite wollenberg  kozak 2009 our understanding of the factors that influence viral diversity in nature currently derives primarily from comparisons of viral communities between different host species these studies have revealed that viral communities are shaped by host traits including body mass and geographical range overlap with other species luis et al 2013 olival et al 2017 turmelle  olival 2009 at the population level however ie among populations of the same host species the degree to which viral communities are structured by variation in demography and environmental heterogeneity stochastic forces or host evolutionary history remains unclear understanding whether spatial and ecological variation among populations can explain viral diversity is an important first step if we ultimately aim to forecast changes in viral communities in response to environmental changes or disease control interventions anthony et al 2015 johnson roode  fenton 2015 such communitylevel changes may be important due to direct immunological or ecological interactions between viruses dapalma doonan trager  kasman 2010 dazmuoz 2017 rohani green mantillabeniers  grenfell 2003 under a null model geographically proximate populations would be expected to have more similar viral communities than distant populations alternatively viral communities could be structured by demographic or environmental factors that are largely independent of distance these include established determinants of single viral species such as host population size age structure and crossspecies transmission keeling  rohani 2008 largescale biogeographical factors such as latitudinal gradients influence the diversity of human pathogens guernier hochberg  gugan 2004 and analogous factors such as elevational gradients may create nonlinear relationships between viral communities and distance over smaller spatial scales but these relationships have never been tested finally viral communities may be so strongly influenced by stochastic factors that prediction is intractable in most natural systems using either spatial proximity or ecological variables that can be realistically measured in the field with the exception of studies focused on humans manrique et al 2016 minot et al 2011 roblessikisaka et al 2013 comparisons of viral communities across populations or time points remain rare anthony et al 2015 wille et al 2018 a key barrier has been our inability to characterize unbiased viral communities the predominance of single pathogen diagnostics financial constraints and a priori uncertainty of which pathogens are likely to be detected have created ascertainment biases toward certain viral groups young  olival 2016 metagenomic sequencing is an alternative data source that enables the simultaneous characterization of entire viral communities edwards  rohwer 2005 but is rarely applied across multiple populations of the same host species applying metagenomic sequencing to spatially replicated data sets therefore offers a new opportunity to understand how host ecology and biogeography influence viral diversity particularly if applied to host species that occur across habitat types or environmental gradients the common vampire bat desmodus rotundus is a widespread species that inhabits tropical rainforests highelevation mountains and coastal deserts across north central and south america and thrives in both native and anthropogenically transformed ecosystems martins templeton pavan kohlbach  morgante 2009 quintana  pacheco 2007 this habitat generalism means that vampire bats live in colonies with extensive variation in climate anthropogenic food resources and presence of other bat species colonies also vary in demographic traits that might impact viral community structure such as population size age structure and sex ratio delpietro

differences in total faecal virus community composition while the proportion of adults and elevation were variably significant according to the permanova and glm analyses figure s10 table s13 multispecies comparative analyses and snapshot surveillance of selected viral groups have revealed how interspecific variation in host life history influences viral diversity anthony et al 2015 luis et al 2013 olival et al 2017 turmelle  olival 2009 wille et al 2018 the extent and determinants of variation in viral communities among populations of the same species have remained largely unexplored but have implications for understanding how viral communities will respond to environmental change or human disturbance using shotgun metagenomic sequencing of viruses in vampire bat populations across peru our study showed extensive variation in viral communities across populations of the same species and rejected a null model of viral similarity being purely driven by spatial proximity of host populations instead an elevational gradient host age structure and anthropogenic food resources but not bat colony size influenced the richness of viral communities in faecal samples in contrast the communities of viruses found in saliva were not strongly explained by any tested variables highlighting major challenges in predicting viral distributions which may depend on virus taxonomy or transmission route the richness and community composition of viruses detected in vampire bat saliva was highly variable and largely unpredictable by any spatial demographic or environmental factor indeed saliva viruses were largely unique to each bat colony while faecal viral communities were more conserved within ecoregions with greater similarity among increasingly genetically and geographically proximal bat colonies figures s5 and s6 this difference between sample types suggests the possibility that routes of transmission specific to saliva eg biting licking grooming may restrict the extent to which viruses spread across the landscape relative to transmission routes involving faeces eg environmental faecaloral the only factor correlated with saliva virus diversity was longitude figure 3 figure s7 table s13 in peru increasing longitude corresponds to a northwestsoutheast gradient such that sites in the northwest cajamarca and amazonas departments had the highest saliva viral diversity while these sites do not correspond to a single ecoregion our previous work has highlighted northwest peru as a corridor for gene flow of vampire bats and rabies virus between the coast and andesamazon streicker et al 2016 and as a hotspot of mitochondrial haplotype richness bohmann et al 2018 we therefore hypothesize that unusually high mixing of bats from different ecoregions creates a melting pot for saliva viruses importantly northwest peru is also a hotspot of vampire bat depredation on humans making regular human exposures to the high diversity of vampire bat salivary viruses encountered here virtually guaranteed gilbert et al 2012 stonerduncan streicker  tedeschi 2014 it is unclear whether the lack of batborne zoonoses reported from this area apart from rabies virus reflects the host specificity of most bat viruses an absence of reporting or insufficient diagnostics for novel human viruses we observed a decline in faecal viral richness with increasing elevation figure 4 and found that colonies in the lowelevation amazon rainforest had higher richness and distinct community composition figure 2 similar elevational gradients have sometimes been observed in bacterial and macrofaunal communities fierer et al 2011 lomolino 2001 wang et al 2011 but to our knowledge have not been described for viruses although the total viral community probably reflects environmental viral taxa as well as those infecting bats increased viral diversity in the amazon was also observed in vertebrateinfecting viruses figure s8 suggesting this effect is not only driven by environmental viral diversity an elevation effect in vampire bats could be explained by the declining diversity of prey alternative host species or vectors at high elevations or by factors correlated with elevation that influence the survival of environmentally transmitted viruses in humans local climate variables such as temperature and precipitation range which are correlated with elevation have been associated with reduced viral richness on a global scale guernier et al 2004 however that elevation itself was more strongly correlated with vertebrateinfecting viral richness than environmental variables suggests that other factors that covary with elevation ie community composition of bat species prey or both may be more important for viruses actively infecting bats indeed crossspecies transmission is thought to be an important driver of bat viral diversity luis et al 2013 2015 and bat species richness declines with elevation patterson pacheco  solari 1996 while our study did not find effects of other bat species on viral richness it was only possible to measure the presence or absence of other bat species within the same roosts rather than bat diversity which might have a stronger effect our results also imply that given expected range shifts towards higher elevations under climate change we might anticipate novel interactions between hosts vectors and environmental conditions that could eventually increase diversity in highelevation viral communities harvell altizer cattadori harrington  weil 2009 zamoravilchis williams  johnson 2012 we also found that colonies with a higher proportion of juveniles consistently had more diverse faecal viral communities figure 4 the importance of juveniles in viral dynamics is well established births introduce immunologically nave individuals that facilitate pathogen transmission amman et al 2012 dietrich et al 2015 van dijk et al 2013 hayman 2015 while higher infection rates in juveniles are widely observed at the level of individual pathogens anthony et al 2017 streicker et al 2012 volokhov et al 2017 to our knowledge ours is the first report of an age effect on the richness of viral communities this communitylevel effect may be driven by bat demography eg birth pulses or maternal stress or differential exposure rates among age classes cross et al 2009 for example independent but subordinate juvenile bats might have elevated exposure to many viruses if they are forced to roost in suboptimal positions within caves amman et al 2012 however in vampire bats juveniles remain dependent on their mothers until they are adults 910 months making this exposure effect unlikely greenhall et al 1983 consequently we suggest that the importance of juveniles reflects many pathogens responding similarly to the influx of susceptible individuals either through heightened transmission following a birth pulse or increased viral shedding by nursing females plowright et al 2008 an effect of susceptible juveniles on viral communities is consistent with observed seasonal variation in individual vampire bat viruses streicker et al 2016 due to birth pulses delpietro et al 2017 and could have implications for viral spillover if shedding of many pathogens simultaneously results in more opportunities for exposure there are also implications for the use of culling to control vampire bats and their pathogens as culling is thought to results in a juvenilebiased age structure streicker et al 2012 and could therefore inadvertently increase viral community richness vampire bats readily exploit livestock as a food source and this has been associated with larger vampire bat populations and colony sizes delpietro et al 1992 streicker et al 2012 we therefore predicted that colonies with greater access to livestock would have had higher viral diversity potentially owing to either densitydependent transmission or exposure to livestock viruses surprisingly we found the opposite that vampire bat colonies in areas of high livestock density had lower faecal viral richness figure 4 moreover colony size was unrelated to viral richness suggesting that the transmission of many bat viruses may not be densitydependent lloydsmith et al 2005 if confirmed this finding would have important implications for managing bat pathogens through culling because artificial reduction of colony sizes would not be expected to reduce prevalence blackwood streicker altizer  rohani 2013 one possible explanation for the observed lower viral diversity could be that the lower diversity of wildlife prey available in areas of high livestock density streicker  allgeier 2016 voigt  kelm 2006 might reduce vampire bat exposure to a diverse set of viruses alternatively the abundance and availability of livestock prey could enhance bat immunity leading to lower viral diversity as hypothesized for bacterial infections becker et al 2018 the weak associations of both faecal and saliva viral communities with spatial or genetic proximity implies that predicting the distributions of viruses or changes to the viral community purely from this null model is unlikely to succeed as a consequence snapshots of viral diversity from single locations will not be representative at the host species level and may not even inform whether the virus is present in nearby populations adding environmental and demographic variables was able to explain significantly more variance in total saliva and faecal viral richness respectively 50 and 45 table s8 although some of the explanatory power for saliva samples was attributable to sequencing effort this demonstrates that the overall ecological context governing viral exposure plays a key role in shaping viral communities in vampire bats and emphasizes the value of broadscale ecological sampling to understand viral community predictability however whether the presence of specific viruses can be predicted across populations remains doubtful anthony et al 2015 one possibility would be to include additional variables such as seasonality because the prevalence of some bat viruses varies seasonally amman et al 2012 here however logistical constraints prevented us from sampling most andean and amazon sites during the wet season furthermore although our study intended to assess populationlevel drivers of viral communities understanding the individuallevel impacts of factors including age reproductive status or stress might provide a more complete picture of the determinants of viral diversity although we did not test the ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation in viral diversity in this study it is probable that some members of the vampire bat viral community identified here have functional importance for example viral metagenomics has identified specific viral taxa associated with disease duerkop et al 2018 hannigan duhaime ruffin koumpouras  schloss 2018 ly et al 2014 norman et al 2015 and the critical contributions of certain viral groups to overall ecosystem function emerson et al 2018 sunagawa et al 2015 thurber payet thurber  correa 2017 followup analyses could include targeting individual viral taxa that are linked with health or disease in other systems examining associations between variation in viral diversity and host fitness or testing interactions between viral communities and other components of the host microbiome in conclusion our analysis demonstrates a variety of broadscale patterns supporting existing theories from population behavioural and community ecology which have been derived from studies of single pathogens or multispecies comparative analyses viral communities were distinct across vampire bat populations suggesting that analyses focusing on single individuals or single populations are unlikely to capture the full extent of specieslevel viral diversity and that predicting changes in viral communities is likely to be challenging our results illustrate the power of metagenomics as a new approach for finding ecological effects on viral communities at the intraspecific level and demonstrate a combined ecological and metagenomic

golden syrian hamsters christopher hammerbeck d rebecca brocato l todd bell m christopher schellhase w steven mraz r laurie queen a jay hooper w s perlman   hantaviruses are enveloped members of the family bunyaviridae that contain a trisegmented negative-sense single-strand rna genome the three gene segments l s and m encode the rna polymerase nucleoprotein np and envelope glycoproteins g1 and g2 respectively while these pathogens are carried chronically and asymptomatically in rodent hosts in humans hantaviruses cause two unique vascular-leak syndromes that cover a spectrum of severity ranging from proteinuria to pulmonary edema and frank hemorrhage 14 old world hantaviruses including puumala virus puuv dobrava virus dobv seoul virus seov and hantaan virus htnv have been associated with a mild-to-severe disease known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs hfrs has a case-fatality rate between 01 and 15 and is characterized by fever vascular leakage resulting in hemorrhagic manifestations and renal failure new world hantaviruses have been associated with a highly lethal disease hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps hps caused by the most prevalent north american and south american hantaviruses sin nombre virus snv and andes virus andv respectively has a case-fatality rate of 30 to 50 and is characterized by fever and vascular leakage resulting in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema followed by shock hantaviruses alter the barrier properties of the microvascular endothelial cells that they infect causing vascular leakage in the kidneys or lungs 5 the specific mechanism underlying this endothelium dysfunction remains unknown but hantavirus infection of endothelial cells is nonlytic suggesting that other factors possibly host derived render the endothelium unable to regulate barrier integrity leading to pulmonary edema 6 while hantaviruses are known to cause disease by multiple routes of infection 5 the predominant route of human exposure is thought to be inhalation of excreta from infected rodent hosts reviewed in references 6 and 7 suggesting that cells in the alveoli may play an important role in clearing or alternatively contributing to disease caused by aerosolized hantaviruses alveolar macrophages am are found in the alveoli and alveolar ducts of the lung and represent the first line of defense against many airborne pathogens 8 not only are they crucial regulators of immune system activity through their secretion of either pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines but also they are vitally important in the maintenance and remodeling of lung tissue via the production of growth factors cytokines and proteinases and can play a key role in the generation of protective cellular immune responses following intranasal vaccination 911 activated am are known to provide a critical element of protection against pathogens 12 13 by releasing chemokines that recruit other innate immune cell types to areas of infection and secreting antiviral cytokines however activation of am can also contribute to pathology by releasing the same cytokines that are important in providing protection from pathogens 1417 alveolar macrophages secrete multiple cytokines when activated including interleukin-1 il-1 il-6 il-8 transforming growth factor  tgf- inducible nitric oxide synthase inos and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- notably the production of tnf- further upregulates the release of other proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and il-8 which contribute to the initiation of adaptive immune responses 18 while these cytokines and chemokines act locally to choreograph immune responses that are important for protection against pulmonary pathogens a number of these cytokines have been shown to promote vascular permeability and pulmonary edema which are the hallmarks of pathogenic hantavirus infection 1923 correspondingly studies of humans infected with hantavirus have detected high titers of proinflammatory and vasoactive cytokines in lung tissue of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome patients and high numbers of cytokine-producing cells correlated with the severity of hps pathology 24 moreover systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines have also been reported in plasma of patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal symptoms 25 suggesting a role for these cytokines in disease pathogenesis alveolar macrophages are known to be permissive to hantavirus infection 26 27 but do not appear to be primary targets of infection as hantavirus replication in alveolar macrophages is less efficient than in endothelial cells furthermore am have been found to be associated with hantavirus antigen in cases of human hps 28 caused by snv or in cases of european hps following puuv infection 29 but it isnt clear if that is a result of direct infection of alveolar macrophages or a result of phagocytosis despite these associations hantavirus infection of human am induced only modest antiviral responses and cell culture supernatants from snv-infected am failed to cause increased permeability of endothelial cell monolayers 27 suggesting that soluble mediators secreted by infected am do not contribute to hantavirus disease andv causes a lethal disease in adult syrian hamsters 30 that resembles hps in humans including the clinical signs of dyspnea fluid in the pleural cavity histopathology in the lungs and spleen the disease incubation period and the rapid progression from first signs to death 31 to determine if am contribute to hantavirus disease in hamsters we depleted am using clodronate-encapsulated liposomes delivered prior to andv challenge clodronate treatment significantly reduced the percentage and number of am in hamster bronchial alveolar lavage bal fluid during intramuscular im and intranasal in andv challenge but had little effect on disease pathogenesis depletion did result in a slightly more rapid and uniform disease course during intranasal infection suggesting that am may provide some protection against exposure to airborne andv but overall these data suggest that am do not directly contribute to hantavirus disease pathogenesis in the syrian hamster model of human

care international and adheres to the principles stated in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals national research council 2011 liposomal clodronate has been used extensively to deplete am in many animal models including the syrian hamster 34 in the syrian hamster am were identified as high forward light scatter high side light scatter fschisschi marco-expressing cells in hamster bal fluid fig 1a and intratracheal administration of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes was found to effectively reduce the number of am in hamsters during andv infection as determined by a reduction in either marco cells fig 1b and d or fschisschi cells fig 1c and d and histolopathologic analysis of hamster lung tissue fig 1e during andv infection of hamsters to begin to understand the role that am play during andv disease pathogenesis hamsters were treated intratracheally with clodronate-encapsulated liposomes clodrosomes or control pbs-encapsulated liposomes encapsomes on days 3 and 1 one group of hamsters was left untreated hamsters were then challenged with 80 pfu 10 ld50 andv im ten days later the number and percentage of am in hamster bal fluid were determined control liposome treatment did induce an increase in the number of alveolar macrophages fig 2a but by comparison clodronate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the total number of alveolar macrophages fig 2a macrophage depletion did not prevent disease in hamsters fig 2b or significantly alter the mean time to death liposomal clodronate 1288 days control liposome 1313 days untreated 1138 days the mean time to death following control liposome treatment was significantly longer than that in untreated animals 1313 days versus 1138 days p  005 but not longer than that in clodronate-treated animals depletion of am also did not result in increased andv titers in the lung as measured by pcr fig 2c these data suggest that despite becoming activated am are not important for protection against an intramuscular andv challenge nor do they contribute to disease pathogenesis following intramuscular challenge serial sections of lung tissue from these groups further revealed the presence of andv antigen colocalized to cd31-positive endothelial cells in both capillaries and larger vessels fig 3a to d regardless of treatment no differences were observed in the pathogenesis of hps-like disease in andv-infected hamsters hamsters in all groups exhibited signs of mild to moderate inflammation interstitial pneumonia alveolar fibrin deposition and edema characteristic of andv infection also noticed were multifocal foci of neutrophilic inflammation along with mesothelial hypertrophy and atelectasis the presence of necroticapoptotic debris was rare consistent with the detection of viral genome by pcr immunohistochemistry analysis revealed little to no difference in overall viral load within endothelial cells following clodronate treatment interestingly all identifiable alveolar macrophages found in andv-infected hamsters were negative for andes virus although positive for cytoplasmic cd31 staining fig 3e alveolar macrophages are more likely to be involved in the defense against airborne pathogens to understand the protective or pathogenic responses that am elicit to inhaled hantaviruses am were depleted prior to intranasal andv challenge groups of hamsters were treated intratracheally with liposomal clodronate or control liposome on days 3 and 1 one group of hamsters were left untreated hamsters were then challenged with 4000 pfu 42 ld50 andv in ten and 17 days later the number and percentage of am in hamster bal fluid were determined similar to what was seen after intramuscular challenge 10 days after intranasal challenge the percentage and total number of am in untreated or control liposome-treated animals were comparable fig 4a control liposome treatment resulted in a trend toward increased numbers of am compared to untreated animals but this difference was not significant by comparison liposomal clodronate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in both the percentage and total number of am the percentage of am remained significantly reduced following liposomal clodronate treatment 17 days after intranasal challenge fig 4b surprising though was the observation that the number of am at day 17 in the untreated group was significantly lower than the number of am in the untreated group at day 10 fig 4c this phenomenon was seen only in the untreated groups as the number of am in the control liposome-treated animals remained similar between days 10 and 17 although the total number of am in the liposomal clodronate-treated animals was lower on day 17 than on day 10 the difference between the number of am in the liposomal clodronate-treated animals and untreated animals on day 17 was not significant however the difference in the number of am in the control liposome-treated animals and untreated animals on day 17 was significant the reduction in am did not prevent disease in hamsters fig 4d but depletion did result in a more uniform and slightly more rapid disease course mean time to death liposomal clodronate 1475 days control liposome 2143 days no treatment 1913 days andv titers in the lung were not significantly different in liposomal clodronate-treated hamsters at either day 10 or day 17 as determined by the presence of viral genome measured by pcr fig 4e however there was a trend toward increased andv m copy number in the lungs of liposomal clodronate-treated animals 10 days postchallenge tnf- levels in hamster bal samples were significantly higher at the peak of disease than at earlier time points fig 5a day 17 versus day 10 but am depletion affected tnf- expression only early after infection interestingly treatment with either liposomal clodronate or control liposome resulted in an increase in detected tnf- compared to that in untreated hamsters which could reflect the higher numbers of neutrophils and am present in the bal samples from these groups respectively fig 4b and 6d the reduction in am did not reduce the amount of tnf- detected in bal samples 10 days after intramuscular challenge fig 5b which was similar to the amount of tnf- detected in bal samples 10 day after intranasal challenge remarkably tnf- levels at the peak of disease following intranasal challenge day 17 were nearly twice those detected at the peak of disease following intramuscular challenge possibly reflecting the differences in am activation when virus is administered directly to the lung these data suggest that am do not contribute to disease pathogenesis but may contribute some degree of protection against intranasal andv challenge alveolar macrophages coordinate many aspects of immune responses to airborne pathogens including the recruitment of other immune cell types such as neutrophils at the peak of hantavirus disease following intramuscular infection with andv day 10 we observed a decrease in the neutrophil chemoattractant mip-1 in bal samples from am-depleted hamsters compared to untreated andv-infected hamsters suggesting that am may be an important source of mip-1 during hantavirus infection in the lung fig 6a however the expression of the neutrophil chemoattractant mip-2 in bal samples from all hamsters remained unchanged fig 6b and correspondingly there was also little significant change in the number of neutrophils found in hamster bal samples 10 days after intramuscular challenge fig 6c by comparison when we investigated the role of am in the recruitment of neutrophils following intranasal challenge we found that early in disease pathogenesis day 10 mip-1 and mip-2 expression were reduced in both liposomal clodronate- and control liposome-treated hamsters compared to untreated andv-infected hamsters fig 6d and e we also found that control liposome treatment resulted in increased numbers of recruited am fig 4b while liposomal clodronate treatment resulted in an increased number of neutrophils fig 6f at the peak of disease following intranasal andv challenge day 17 the expression of mip-1 and mip-2 was reduced approximately 50 compared to the expression seen on day 10 moreover the expression of mip-1 and mip-2 was not dependent on treatment as equivalent amounts of mip-1 and mip-2 were detected in bal samples from all hamsters fig 6d and e neutrophil numbers were reduced in liposomal clodronate-treated animals by day 17 compared to the numbers observed on day 10 but neutrophil numbers in the control liposome-treated and untreated hamsters remained virtually unchanged between days 10 and 17 fig 6g in contrast am numbers in control liposome-treated hamsters remained elevated on days 10 and 17 despite an overall drop in am numbers in untreated hamsters fig 4a and b these data suggest that am may regulate neutrophil recruitment to the lung early after hantavirus infection but do not contribute significantly to neutrophil recruitment toward the peak of disease pathogenesis recently vascular endothelial growth factor vegf has been hypothesized to play a role in hantavirus disease pathogenesis moreover am are known sources of vegf we therefore asked whether vegf expression in the lungs of hamsters infected with andv was dependent on the presence of am compared to normal uninfected hamsters vegf-a expression in the bal of hamsters 10 days after intranasal andv challenge was only slightly but not significantly elevated fig 7 interestingly at the time of peak disease on day 17 there was almost a 2-fold increase in vegf-a protein macrophage depletion did not further enhance vegf-a in bal samples late into infection day17 as we observed no difference in vegf titers in andv-infected hamster bal samples in the presence or absence of am however when am were depleted vegf-a expression in the bal fluid on day 10 was equivalent to the amount of vegf-a detected in all hamster bal samples on day 17 a similar increase in vegf was observed in control liposome-treated hamsters these data demonstrate that vegf expression is enhanced in hamsters infected with andv but suggest that while am may regulate the expression of vegf by other cell types in the lung they are not a major source of vegf during hantavirus disease pathogenesis the human lung has a surface area of approximately 70 m2 and contains on average 480 million alveoli 35 which are in constant contact with the outside world in this environment homeostasis along the endothelialepithelial border must be maintained to allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to freely exchange however these homeostatic mechanisms must remain pliable enough to allow immune responses to clear invading pathogens often considered the first line of defense against respiratory pathogens the estimated 2 billion am residing in the alveoli of the human lung 36 are uniquely juxtaposed to maintain lung homeostasis as well as orchestrate protection against airborne viruses and bacteria 37 in the case of hantaviruses the predominant route of human exposure is thought to be inhalation of excreta from infected rodent hosts reviewed in references 6 and 7 suggesting that alveolar macrophages may play an important role in clearing or alternatively contributing to disease caused by aerosolized hantaviruses albeit rare several cases of hantavirus disease have been reported in humans following parenteral exposure resulting from the bite of infected rodents in these cases the disease resulting from parenteral infection is virtually identical to the disease following aerosol infection the only differences being slight differences in disease kinetics similarly syrian hamsters experimentally infected with andv by intramuscular challenge develop a disease that is indistinguishable from the disease exhibited following intranasal exposure the only differences being slight differences in disease kinetics and the number of pfu needed to develop uniformly lethal disease given the extensive similarities in disease it is likely that the mechanism of disease or the cell type responsible for disease is identical regardless of the route of exposure consistent with this hypothesis we demonstrate here that alveolar macrophages play only a marginal role in protecting hamsters from lethal hantavirus infection but do not contribute to the disease caused by either intranasal or intramuscular hantavirus infection alveolar macrophages contribute to the defense against many aerosolized pathogens and in many cases these responses are critical for host protection in models of vaccinia virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv and influenza virus infection the depletion of alveolar macrophages results in greater viral replication and dissemination and an overall increase in the severity of infection 9 3840 in some cases the reduced levels of protection in the absence of alveolar macrophages are likely due to the impaired initiation of antiviral responses that result in abolished early cytokine and chemokine release and inhibited immune cell activation and recruitment 40 41 in addition schneider et al 42 demonstrated that when alveolar macrophages were depleted in mice prior to infection with influenza virus the mice exhibited lower percent oxygen saturation so2 and oxygen partial pressure po2 arguing that am are important for maintaining lung function during infection however the same mechanisms that alveolar macrophages use to protect against pathogens have also been implicated in causing disease and increased vascular permeability in models of acute lung injury caused by infectious disease agents such as human metapneumovirus hmpv 43 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 44 as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 45 and nonischemic inflammatory lung injury 46 alveolar macrophages may also serve as a reservoir for pathogens such as hmpv 43 measles virus 47 and legionella pneumophila 48 and may indirectly contribute to the pathogenesis of the different diseases caused by these pathogens by allowing their replication and dissemination still the enhancement of disease in the presence of alveolar macrophages may not always reflect a direct contribution by am by way of proinflammatory cytokines or angiogenic factors but may indirectly be the result of increased immune cell recruitment by am as seen in mouse models of mouse hepatitis virus type 1 mhv-1 infection 49 the role that am play in disease caused by classical hemorrhagic fever viruses is less well understood alveolar macrophages express the primary and secondary receptors 50 for both hantaviruses v3 integrin 51 and complement receptors 3 and 4 cr3cr4 52 and ebola virus dc-sign and dc-signr 53 and correspondingly are known to be permissive to hantavirus 26 27 and ebola virus infection 54 however in these cases infection is less efficient than or fails to induce a sustained inflammatory response compared to the primary targets of infection for these viruses and there is no evidence that hantavirus infection of am induces apoptosis antigens of yellow fever virus which is transmitted by the bite of the aedes aegypti mosquito can be found inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum and golgi complex of am suggesting that viral replication can occur in these cells 55 56 but it is unknown whether am play any role in disease pathogenesis other than acting as a virus reservoir it is also unknown whether other hemorrhagic fever viruses that commonly target monocyte lineage cells such as dengue virus and crimean congo hemorrhagic fever virus target am in a way that contributes to human disease alveolar macrophages are known to be permissive to hantavirus infection 26 27 but it has been less clear to what extent am act as a reservoir for hantaviruses in some of the earliest characterizations of hps mori and colleagues described finding viral antigen in only a low number of large cells identified as macrophages in the lung 24 similarly li and klein further demonstrated that while norway rat alveolar macrophages could be infected with seoul virus their ability to support efficient replication of the virus was significantly reduced compared to endothelial cells 26 our analysis of andv nucleoprotein np associated with am was limited to intramuscular challenge but a similar trend has been reported by safronetz and colleagues who noted that even during the end stages of hantavirus disease in hamsters infected intranasally with andv only occasional alveolar luminal cells most likely alveolar macrophages were found to stain positive for hantavirus antigen 57 coupled with this we see no difference in hps pathology in hamsters following either in or im challenge and our analysis was done at the peak of disease pathogenesis following im challenge day 10 when andv np staining of the lung endothelium was nearly continuous suggesting that the likelihood of andvam interactions would be as high as that following intranasal challenge taken together our observation that the depletion of am resulted in no significant change in lung andv titers fig 2c and 4e and our inability to detect the presence of andv np associated with hamster am fig 3e suggest that am do not serve as a primary reservoir for hantavirus replication and am dysfunction due to direct hantavirus infection is unlikely how hamster am respond to andv infection is not entirely clear alveolar macrophages in general need to walk a fine line between homeostasis and host defense to protect the host while preventing catastrophic inflammation one way am contribute to lung protection is by phagocytizing most of the particulate matter that enters the lungs this suggests that they may also contribute to the clearance of andv from the lungs of hamsters early after intranasal andv challenge we saw a trend toward increased detection of viral genome in hamsters that were depleted of am although depletion of am does not significantly alter the amount of live virus or viral genome detected in lung tissue at late time points after infection fig 3e and f hamsters devoid of am also developed disease faster than untreated or control-treated andv-infected hamsters interestingly the highest number of surviving animals was found in control liposome-treated animals fig 3d correspondingly this group also had greater numbers of am than liposomal clodronate-treated or untreated animals fig 3a to c like other models this could suggest that early after infection am help prevent the spread of infection by reducing infectious virus in the lung and by so doing may help control the rate at which disease pathogenesis progresses at later times after infection similar levels of viral genome andor infectious virus were found in the lung of all hamsters supporting the argument that am contribute more substantially to the immune response against andv early after infection but less so at later times once andv is primarily replicating in endothelial cells this is also consistent with the reduced numbers of am detected on day 17 compared to day 10 a second way am contribute to lung protection is by modulating immune responses in the lung 37 58 in the presence of harmless particulates such as dust they may go as far as suppressing antigen-specific adaptive immune responses either by directly suppressing tissue-resident t cells 59 60 or by suppressing lung-resident dendritic cells 61 thus preventing them from migrating to draining lymph nodes and initiating immune responses however in the case of aerosolized pathogens activation of am results in a change in phenotype from a regulator of lung homeostasis to that of a cell capable of coordinating and participating in inflammatory immune responses 62 63 human am make little tnf- when exposed to snv compared to lipopolysaccharide lps 27 suggesting that hantavirus may be ineffective at activating am correspondingly we noticed little difference in the amount of tnf- in the bal fluid of hamsters in the presence or absence of am following infection with andv intramuscularly fig 4a or at late times after intranasal infection fig 4b in the case of intramuscular injection of virus it is not clear whether am would be effectively stimulated since it is assumed that infection of the endothelium would occur directly via the blood and not by inhalation we did observe an increase in the amount of tnf- in bal samples between day 10 and day 17 postintranasal challenge indicating that an inflammatory response was occurring however at late times depletion of macrophages did not reduce the amount of tnf- detected suggesting that am are not a major source of tnf- that late in infection somewhat surprisingly at early times day 10 after intranasal challenge the depletion of am resulted in an increase in tnf- in bal samples one explanation is that in hamsters am are more prone to an immunosuppressive phenotype and by depleting them other cell types including neutrophils endothelial cells t cells and epithelial cells are no longer prevented from producing tnf- the fact that control liposome-treated animals also had increased levels of tnf- may be reflected in the increased numbers of am induced by control liposome treatment resident am at the time of control liposome treatment may retain their immunosuppressive phenotype but any newly recruited am could be expected to have a markedly different phenotype prior to adopting suppressive functions 64 as immune sentinels one of the primary roles of am is to orchestrate immune responses by recruiting other immune cell types to the lung in some models of acute lung injury 46 65 66 including pneumonia induced by lps or p aeruginosa pneumonia infection depletion of am attenuates the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung indicating that am can be a key source of neutrophil chemoattractants conversely in other models am appear to play a greater role in the negative regulation of neutrophil migration in that the depletion of am amplifies neutrophil recruitment 38 44 6771 neutrophils migrate in response to a number of chemoattractants 72 including cxcl2 mip-2 mousegro human and ccl3 mip-1 of which am can be a major source 40 7375 liposomal clodronate treatment resulted in a decrease in mip-1 detected in bal samples on day 10 following intramuscular andv challenge fig 5a and also resulted in a decrease in mip-1 and mip-2 on day 10 following intranasal challenge fig 5b surprisingly the decrease in mip-1 and mip-2 in liposomal clodronate-treated animals following intranasal challenge was accompanied by an increase in bal neutrophils fig 5d moreover control liposome treatment also resulted in decreases in mip-1 and mip-2 but recruitment of new am rather than neutrophils one possible explanation for this apparent paradox is that am are an important source of mip-1 and mip-2 in the hamster but hamster neutrophils preferentially respond to other chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 or kc that may be more abundant in the absence of mip-1 and mip-2 alternatively mip-1 and mip-2 are preferentially secreted by cell types other than neutrophils in the hamster and the presence of am suppresses neutrophil migration when alveolar macrophages are depleted neutrophils freely migrate to the lung and act as a mip-1mip-2 sponge that soaks up free chemokine and reduces the overall levels of bioavailable mip-1mip-2 a similar explanation could hold true for the decreased abundance of mip-1 and mip-2 following control liposome treatment in which newly arrived am act as the chemokine sponge a closer analysis of the kinetics of mip-1 and mip-2 expression following alveolar macrophage depletion would be necessary to elucidate these possibilities the expression of mip-1 and mip-2 on day 17 following intranasal andv challenge was similar across all treatment groups and substantially lower than that detected in andv-alone hamsters on day 10 whether this reflects decreased numbers of am at day 17 versus day 10 or whether this is a natural attempt by the hamster to downregulate lung inflammation has yet to be determined il-8 cxcl8 is another potent neutrophil chemoattractant that can be produced by a number of cell types in the respiratory tract including activated alveolar macrophages airway epithelial airway smooth muscle and airway endothelial cells responding to inflammatory stimuli 76 77 but like mip-1a mip-2 and mcp-1 there are only limited data on how these chemokines are regulated during human hantavirus infection neither sin nombre virus nor hantaan virus induces il-8 mcp-1 mip-1a or mip-1b within 72 h of in vitro infection of human lung microvascular endothelial cells 78 and only htnv induces il-8 at times later than 72 h 79 suggesting that il-8 may be more relevant to hfrs than to hps analysis of sera from human hps cases failed to detect changes in mip-2 mip-1a il-8 or mcp-1 although significant increases in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf and m-csf were detected 80 as myeloid cell differentiation growth and activation factors gm-csf and m-csf could implicate such as macrophages and dendritic cells in disease 81 82 although these results suggest that it is not necessarily due to the recruitment of other cell types by macrophages intriguingly higher concentrations of il-8 and gm-csf in serum are found in female hfrs patients infected with puuv than in their male counterparts potentially linking il-8 expression with hfrs severity 83 however more males than females are likely to develop clinical hfrs following puuv infection 84 85 and there is no difference in hfrs disease severity in humans infected with puuv 86 rendering the link between il-8 and hfrs disease suspect whether chemokines such as mcp-1 mip-1a or mip-2 follow a similar pattern of expression during human hfrs has yet to be determined we believe that this is the first report of hamster-specific elisa kits from a commercial vendor to be used with the syrian hamster animal model given the relatively short time interval between the publishing of the syrian hamster genome and the commercial availability of these elisa kits we cannot discount the possibility that the cytokine expression patterns that we see following liposomal clodronatecontrol liposome treatment of andv-infected hamsters are related to the specificity of these kits as such while these measurements are reproducible they should be interpreted within the context of the other parameters measured in these experiments eg survival and am numbers until verified by other independent reports the potential role of vegf in hantavirus disease pathogenesis has recently received a great deal of attention in vitro hantavirus infection sensitizes endothelial cells to vegf rendering them hyperpermeable 87 in a process involving ve-cadherin 88 89 and potentially 3 integrin 90 similarly increased levels of vegf can be detected in pleural effluent from patients with acute hps 91 or in serum samples of acute-phase hfrs patients 92 alveolar macrophages are known to express vegf during pulmonary infection and other forms of acute lung injury 9398 suggesting that am may respond similarly to hantavirus infection still the fact that all hamsters infected with andv developed disease fig 2e and 3d suggests that am do not significantly influence the expression of vegf in hamsters a significant increase in vegf expression in the bal fluid of andv-infected hamsters late after infection day 17 was observed compared to what was seen in normal hamsters but as expected the levels of vegf detected in the bal fluid of andv-infected animals were nearly identical at later times after infection day 17 regardless of the presence or absence of am fig 6 however contrary to our expectations the depletion of am resulted in a significant increase in the level of vegf in the bal fluid of andv-infected hamsters at early times after intranasal challenge interestingly when macrophages were depleted in animals prior to intranasal challenge those animals developed disease faster than either untreated andv-infected animals or animals receiving control liposome treatments this would seem to support the suggestion that vegf contributes to hantavirus disease but it would argue that am are not the sole source of vegf pulmonary epithelial cells 99 100 and neutrophils 101 102 are other known sources of vegf in the lung and could be contributing to the increased levels of vegf seen in andv-infected hamsters epithelial cells are not the primary targets of hantaviruses and are thus unlikely to be expressing vegf as a result of direct infection but expression could be induced by inflammatory cytokines produced by other cells during infection or by hypoxia caused during hps 103 recently a role for neutrophils in vascular leakage caused by htnv infection of scid mice has been suggested 104 correspondingly liposomal clodronate treatment resulted in a significant increase both in bal fluid vegf and in neutrophil numbers early after infection day 10 whether the depletion of neutrophils in hamsters alters hantavirus disease pathogenesis and the expression of vegf in hamsters remains to be determined the role that immune cell types may play in disease pathogenesis may not be limited to direct antiviral responses or cytokines as cells such as neutrophils monocytes and lymphocytes are recruited to sites of infection they undergo the process of transendothelial cell migration which is highly regulated by integrins cadherins and junctional adhesion molecules to prevent vascular leakage during the process 105 106 hantaviruses inactivate and dysregulate beta 3 integrins and ve-cadherin 88 89 making it possible that infected endothelial cells may not be able to reform junctional complexes following paracellular diapedesis leading to vascular leakage presumably this would lead to visible gaps between endothelial cells not borne out in electron microscopy em analysis of hantavirus-infected endothelium from humans or hamsters 28 33 alternatively neutrophils also possess the ability to migrate directly through endothelial cells via transcellular migration during this process endothelial cells form a dome controlled by rhoa and f-actin 107 over the neutrophil to prevent vascular leakage endothelial cells to which polymorphonuclear leukocytes pmns adhered often display many vesicles that can extend continuously between the cell membranes of the endothelial cells 108 similar to those seen in endothelial cells from hantavirus-infected hamsters 33 dysregulation of dome formation could potentially allow for the direct flow of serum proteins through infected endothelial cells in a manner irrespective of noticeable gap formation in the endothelium small-animal models are invaluable tools to study the pathogenesis of diseases caused by neglected infectious disease agents such as andes virus however the utility of the hamster model as well as the role of the immune response in hantavirus disease pathogenesis is contentious previously we and others have demonstrated that the ablation of adaptive t and b cell responses to andv infection in hamsters does not alter the course of disease 109 110 here using the syrian hamsterandes virus lethal disease model we demonstrate that another component of the immune system is not directly responsible for the hps-like disease cause by andv in hamsters the mechanism by which hantaviruses cause disease in humans and hamsters alike is not clear and many mechanisms of disease both immune related and virus intrinsic have been proposed making this more difficult is that aspects of the immune response to hantavirus infection are likely to be important for protection and viral clearance even as they are viewed as contributing to disease still it will be necessary to continue to evaluate other immune cell types as we seek to understand their role in contributing to disease or protection following hantavirus infection  keeping track of viruses jack hietpas laura mcmullan k holly hanson l charles rice m david mindell p roger breeze g bruce budowle steven schutzer e   viruses are ubiquitous in nature they prey on all forms of life from archaea and eubacteria to fungi plants and animals it has been estimated that viruses that target sea-dwelling organisms such as algae turn over half of the worlds biomass each day as such viruses are an important part of the ecological balance on earth of the vast collection of ribonucleic acid rna and deoxyribonucleic acid dna viruses research has focused on the tiny fraction that cause disease in humans domestic animals and crops modern virology coupled with public health initiatives has seen many triumphs including the development of effective vaccines against yellow fever poliomyelitis smallpox mumps measles rubella hepatitis a and b and papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer the global eradication of smallpox and poliovirus as well as the prediction and successful prophylactic vaccination against influenza represent tremendous gains for public health antiviral therapy against human immunodeficiency virus hiv and some herpesviruses as well as rapid detection and containment of emerging viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov illustrate the successful application of viral research programs as well as the need for ongoing efforts focused on rapid identification and elucidation of viral distribution kinetics and pathogenesis with the growth of knowledge about replication transmission and disease viruses have also taken the stage as possible biowarfare bioterrorist and criminal agents 
in our unpredictable world viral diagnostics and forensics are becoming increasingly important and sophisticated the purpose of this chapter is to introduce basic concepts in virology and to provide several examples of how current technology has been used to identify and track viral pathogens the first part of the chapter discusses virus structure replication strategies classification and evolution the second part highlights the varied modes of transmission infection and disease manifestations as they relate to the different diagnostic methods for virus identification we follow this with examples of how emerging viruses were identified and tracked sin nombre nipah west nile sars coronavirus and monkeypox with regard to viral forensics the schmidt case is a fascinating example illustrating how the study of rna virus evolution and relatedness was used in a criminal investigation finally we provide a few snapshot views into new technologies that allow the creation of manmade or engineered viruses some exciting new frontiers in viral diagnostics and a few thoughts on the future of virology viruses are extremely simple life forms without metabolic capacity organelles translational machinery or autonomous replicative potential the essential elements of a virus are consequently minimal virus particles are either enveloped or nonenveloped enveloped viruses contain one or more envelope glycoproteins embedded in a lipid bilayer that is acquired by budding through host cell membranes nonenveloped viruses are made up of a tight protein shell in both kinds of viral particles the envelope or protein shell serves to protect the viral genome from the hazardous extracellular environment since without such protection the fragile nucleic acid genome would be vulnerable to physical chemical andor enzymatic destruction surface proteins also harbor functions required for virus entry into host cells inside the virus particle the viral genome is associated with one or more proteins to form a complex usually referred to as the nucleocapsid in addition to nucleic acid binding proteins some viruses also carry enzymes required to initiate replication like polymerases although not all virus particles are highly structured two kinds of symmetry are common helical symmetry is reflected by the arrangement of the protein subunits in a spring-like or stacked lock-washer fashion whereas icosahedral symmetry comprises 20 triangular faces that form the surface of a sphere in the simplest icosahedral capsid one protein subunit is at each triangular point of the 20 faces requiring 60 total subunits 
while host organisms use only dna for their genetic material a viral genome may be composed of either dna or rna the size of viral genomes varies greatly the genome of variola major the dna virus that causes smallpox is 190 kb the rna genome of the sars-causing coronavirus is 297 kb those of ebola and marburg viruses are each 19 kb while the hiv and poliovirus are 92 kb and 74 kb respectively among the enormous variety of host cell types how does a virus choose which cell to commandeer for its own replication and propagation the surface of an enveloped virus particle contains virus-specific proteins that mediate viral recognition of host cell targets the membrane surface of a host cell is riddled with numerous macromolecules including glycoproteins glycolipids and carbohydrate residues that have specific host functions serving as transport channels mediating signaling pathways and assisting in antigen presentation while these macromolecules may be essential for host cell survival and function some of these macromolecules also serve as receptors for virus particles the presence of the host cell receptor is essential for viral attachment but the mere presence of the receptor does not confer upon the cell the ability to support virus replication some viruses such as hiv require a coreceptor for viral entry without which the virus may be able to bind to the host cell membrane but remain unable to enter the cell if the virus is not enveloped or is a naked particle the viral capsid undergoes a conformational change upon binding that releases energy used to breach the host membrane allowing viral entry delivery of viral nucleocapsid and hence the genome rna or dna occurs via fusion of the virus particle with cellular membrane either at the cell surface or after endocytosis virus genome replication can occur either in the cytoplasm or the nucleus and all viruses usurp the host cell translational machinery to produce virus-specific proteins in 1971 david baltimore divided viruses into seven groups based on genetic material polarity and mrna synthesis1 insight into the replication strategy of a virus can be gained by understanding how other well-studied viruses in the same group replicate the following is a brief description of the seven groups included where possible are examples of viruses belonging to each given group note that in the following sections nucleic acid genomes will be discussed in terms of strand polarity where positive  strand nucleic acid has a 53 polarity identical to mrna and negative  strand nucleic acid is complementary to mrna in cases of  strand polarity the virus must synthesize a complementary  strand for gene expression to occur a simplified schematic is presented in figure 41
 double-stranded dna viruses class i viruses of this class have double-stranded dna genomes and are subdivided into two groups the first contains viruses that require replication to take place in the nucleus the second class contains viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm variola major the cause of smallpox is an example of an enveloped double-stranded dna virus that replicates in the cytoplasm its linear dna genome is directly transcribed to mrna which is then translated by host machinery to produce viral proteins in contrast genome replication of herpesviruses occurs in the nucleus single-stranded dna viruses class ii these viruses have single-stranded dna genomes host proteins transcribe mrnas from the viral genome which are subsequently translated to viral proteins double-stranded rna viruses class iii viruses in this class contain double-stranded segmented rna genomes mrna is synthesized by a virally encoded rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp that is like the rna genome contained within the capsid most eukaryotic cells do not encode rdrps so in order for the virus to replicate itself it must provide this enzyme for rna replication the common etiologic agent causing severe infectious diarrhea in children rotavirus has a double-stranded segmented rna genome positive-strand rna viruses class iv these viruses have single-stranded -strand rna that is directly translated by the host cell to produce viral proteins the -strand genomic rna from these viruses can be infectious in contrast to -strand rna which cannot to generate multiple copies of the genome these viruses synthesize -strand complementary rna species that are subsequently transcribed by viral rdrps to produce more  strands examples of viruses in this class include poliovirus west nile virus the sars coronavirus and hepatitis a virus negative-strand rna viruses class v in contrast to class iv viruses of this group contain negative polarity single-stranded rna molecules as their genome these viruses are all enveloped and can have genomes that are either segmented or continuous some members have ambisense genomes with portions of the genome acting as  strands and other portions of the genome having  polarity all members of this class such as influenza virus hantavirus and ebola virus package both genome rna and an rdrp into their virion retroviruses class vi this unique class of viruses uses a totally novel scheme for replication and expression these viruses have two identical copies of single-stranded -polarity rna molecules as their genome these rna molecules are reverse transcribed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase rt generating complementary dna molecules from their rna templates members of this class are called retroviruses reflecting the fact that their replicative cycle is retrograde rnadnamrnaprotein relative to the central dogma of modern biology in which the dna is transcribed to mrna which is then translated to protein dnamrnaprotein a very important virus in this class is the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids hepadnaviruses class vii members of this group have partially double-stranded dna molecules as their genome these viruses replicate via an rna intermediate similar to the retroviruses rna is packaged into immature particles where reverse transcriptase uses the rna template to generate the dna genome an example is hepatitis b virus an important human pathogen that can cause chronic infection and consequent liver damage once the genome of a virus has been amplified it must be packaged into infectious particles this is a complicated process that is well understood for only a few viruses the exact mechanisms that allow selective packaging of viral nucleic acid and particular virus-specific proteins are not completely elucidated the site of assembly can be in the nucleus in the cytoplasm in association with membranous organelles endoplasmic reticulum or golgi bodies or at the cell surface the process of virion release occurs through budding or in the case of naked nonenveloped viruses through host cell lysis virus order is a collection of phylogenetically related virus families that have similar properties at present there are only two recognized orders mononegavirales
and nidovirales the mononegavirales order is comprised of viruses that have a single-stranded negative-sense rna molecule as their genome there are three families in the order mononegavirales filoviridae rhabdoviridae and paramyxoviridae the nidovirales order comprises the families coronaviridae and arteriviridae the virus that causes sars is a member of the coronaviridae virus order names are discerned from the other classification level names by ending with the suffix -virales
 a virus family is a phylogenetically related collection of genera that share similar properties families are given names that end with the suffix -viridae virus particle morphology genome characteristics andor strategies of replication are used to group viruses into families due to the diversity and complexity of the families paramyxoviridae poxviridae parvoviridae and herpesviridae each is further classified into subfamilies subfamilies are given names that end in -virinae
 species is a highly specific classification given to a virus that has met many selective criteria in 1991 the ictv defined a species as a polythetic class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular niche3 this definition allows for some plasticity in the properties required for species classification allowing emphasis in some cases to be on genome properties in others on structural physicochemical or serological properties the term quasi-species refers to a population of closely related viral sequences this is often used to describe rna virus isolates where essentially every genome sequence is different due to the high error rate of rna-dependent rna replication the highly structured and formal classification system set up by the ictv gives the virologist clinician technician epidemiologist and first-responder access to valuable information once a virus is identified and its classification is defined information about the virus or similar better-studied viruses such as the kinetic characteristics of virus spread tissue tropism disease pathogenesis associated clinical symptoms treatment and level of required biocontainment can be quickly realized this system also allows for classification and characterization of a new unknown virus for example sars was a previously unknown virus that was quickly analyzed and placed into the coronaviridae family although the classification system facilitates virus identification the constant emergence of new diverse viral populations continues to challenge scientists three major mechanisms give rise to viral diversity mutation reassortment and recombination depending upon the replication strategy of a particular virus the relative contribution of these pathways differs nucleotide misincorporation leading to mutation occurs for all viruses but is dramatically different for viruses with rna versus dna intermediates errors are made both by dna and rna polymerases but while dna polymerases have proofreading capacity rna polymerases do not consequently errors generated by rna polymerases are incorporated into the newly generated viral genome at a very high rate the error rates of dna polymerases can be as low as one base substitution per every 1081011 nucleotides whereas the rna polymerases have error rates as high as one base substitution per every 103106 nucleotides4 in the case of rna viruses virus population studies of patient and tissue culture isolates have shown the coexistence of numerous viral genomes with slightly different sequences or quasi-species homologous or nonhomologous recombination is another mechanism by which new viruses are generated and has played a significant role in virus evolution large dna viruses can not only recombine with each other but also contain genes usurped from the host rna tumor viruses have incorporated cellular oncogenes that lead to transformation in some cell types for rna viruses recombination probably occurs via incomplete synthesis and template rna switching during negative-strand synthesis this process occurs with high frequency in poliovirus infection with an estimated 1020 of poliovirus genomic rna recombining in a single growth cycle5 in polio eradication efforts a live virus preparation consisting of three separate attenuated poliovirus strains was used despite the safety of each attenuated strain some vaccinated patients did develop poliomyelitis through genetic testing of patient isolates it became clear that the recovered virus was not the same as the administered vaccine and that neurovirulence had been restored by recombination among the three attenuated strains6

 reassortment can also occur when two related viruses with segmented genomes infect a single cell for example reassortment is responsible for generating new influenza a strains that are antigenically different enough from previous strains to infect and cause disease besides the annual flu season severe pandemics have occurred such as the spanish flu of 1918 the asian flu of 1957 the hong kong flu of 1968 and the russian flu of 19778 influenza virus infects several animal hosts including humans pigs horses and its natural reservoir waterfowl the two major antigenic proteins of this virus hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase np can be reassorted between different influenza viruses generating new strains different from the two parental strains called antigenic shift each influenza strain is given a code which identifies its ha and np proteins the spanish flu was caused by the h1n1 strain the asian flu was strain h2n2 the hong kong flu was strain h3n2 and the russian flu was strain h1n19
 an incubation period is the time between exposure to virus and the manifestation of symptoms of infection initial symptoms may be slight such as a rash or fever and may not initially prompt patients to seek medical care diagnostic samples are taken when people seek medical treatment therefore the presence of virus and virus-specific antibodies depends on the incubation period this observation has important implications for the identification of new viral infections or epidemics virus may be detected and isolated for infections with short incubations however antibodies may not yet have developed see figure 42
 for example infections with influenza and adenovirus have very short incubation periods 12 days before myalgias and fever manifest many viruses have invaded the body for over a week before symptoms become apparent dengue measles and rotavirus are relatively asymptomatic during the first 58 days but may rapidly progress to severe illness soon after longer incubation
periods may be caused by chronic infections for example rabies virus may remain silent for 30100 days after an animal bite before causing sudden disease demanding medical treatment other stealth viruses such as hiv hepatitis b and c and papilloma viruses may bring about a mild ailment initially that may gradually progress to a fatal disease patients with chronic infections may seroconvert and have detectable virus even in the presence of antibodies others may be persistently infected by a virus yet never develop symptoms these carriers may have low levels of virus which could potentially be transmitted to other individuals despite being below the level of assay detection an understanding of how the host responds to viral infection aids investigators and health care workers in identifying and treating infection the immune system typically recognizes the invading pathogen at the site of entry where it launches a generalized innate immune response signal molecules recruit inflammatory cells to the area which engulf cell debris and released virions virus proteins are presented to the adaptive immune system in local lymph nodes allowing the host to create a directed defense against the virus effector t cells specific for virus antigen stimulate b cells to secrete virus-specific antibodies there are two predominate types of antibodies produced in response to virus infection igm and igg the first antibody produced is the igm isotype and is present in the blood within days and remains in circulation for several months as the adaptive response develops b cells switch antibody isotypes to secrete the igg form investigators use the detection of antibodies as indicators of virus exposure and can utilize knowledge of the presence of specific isotypes to discern acute infection from past or chronic infection detection of igm or rising titers of igg points to a recent virus exposure virus-specific antibodies are also used as tools in numerous serological assays the specificity of the antibody is useful to distinguish between different virus types and to detect virus protein in clinical samples most virus infections cause an acute infection with viral particles rapidly cleared from the body examples of acute infections are influenza rhinoviruses and rotaviruses where infections are brief and virus is eliminated completely from the host other viruses are capable of establishing a long-term persistent infection and may be present for years or throughout the life of the host during a persistent infection some viruses are continuously present in the body with a constant level of viremia or virus detectable in the blood for example lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is noncytopathic even while actively replicating other viruses such as epstein-barr virus regulate their replication programs to avoid detection by the immune system while still others establish infection in certain areas of the body that are immunoprivileged sites including the central nervous system cns and the eye where once present viruses may propagate undetected viruses may evade the immune response by infecting the immune cells themselves such as in hiv infection of cd4 t cells and dengue virus infection of dendritic cells some viruses enter a latent stage where replication temporarily ceases reactivation of virus replication can occur weeks to years later multiple times in the life of the host finally viruses may reduce the rate of virus production so that little or no virus is detectable as the immune system struggles to control but not eliminate the infection virus may be measured in a cyclical pattern with titers alternately rising above and falling below the threshold of detection the types of samples and the manner of collection depend upon the capabilities of the diagnostic laboratory the chance of obtaining an active virus sample depends on many factors the virus concentration varies in the body over the course of infection and may actually not be present when symptoms bring the patient to medical attention the virus may have been cleared from the area of disease or the symptoms may reflect damage induced by the immune system rather than direct virus pathology it is therefore critical to obtain samples early in the infection and from multiple locations in the body the most common site to look for virus is in the blood other clinical samples are generally collected near the site of virus-induced disease or based on known routes of virus transmission mosquitoes can deposit west nile virus and dengue into the skin poxvirus and papillomavirus replication can create lesions and warts the perfuse spread of ebola allows detection even in the skin for respiratory infections samples may include nasal and throat swabs as well as nasopharyngeal aspirates and bronchial lavage fluids urine and stool samples are collected for enteric disease and cerebral spinal fluid is obtained when neurological symptoms are present viruses may be very labile and care must be taken to avoid exposure to harsh treatments such as extreme ph direct sunlight and freezing temperatures in order to preserve the potential for identification and study generally samples are transported on ice and evaluated in the lab as quickly as possible if delays are expected samples can be frozen but the recovery of infectious virus may be reduced or eliminated historically viruses were cultivated in the laboratory utilizing human samples to directly inoculate susceptible animals or embryonic chicken eggs tissue culture allows virus to be isolated quantified and amplified to produce a large stock for further analysis primary cell lines derived from animal tissues have a limited lifespan in tissue culture yet are necessary to initially isolate some viruses continuously replicating cell lines are the most convenient with an infinite capacity to be passaged human specimens are clarified and treated with antibiotics before addition to cell culture the inoculated cells are monitored for any detectable morphologic changes and periodically harvested for other serological assays there are specific culture conditions for particular viruses for instance viruses from the conjunctiva nasal and respiratory tracts are incubated at cooler temperatures resembling the exterior of the body and viruses entering cells via fusion proteins requiring cleavage need to have trypsin added to the culture media some viruses cannot be cultivated in cell lines but require that clinical samples be injected into suckling mice by specially trained personnel and examined for virus using serological methods other culture conditions are being established that involve the use of whole-organ cultivation some viruses are even more difficult hepatitis c virus can only be grown in chimpanzees in the early days of virology researchers and clinicians could only identify and classify a virus based on its infectivity and associated pathology viruses could not be more closely described because of their extremely small size virion particles can range from tens to several hundred nanometers nm the light microscope which is a valuable instrument for the identification and study of fungi bacteria mold and spores does not have the resolving capacity to visualize virus particles virologists were limited in their investigations until the 1930s when the electron microscope em was invented this instrument uses instead of visible light a beam of electrons to form an image of the specimen the instrument not only produces extremely large magnifications up to 1000000 but also resolves fine structure at such magnifications virus morphology is as diverse as that seen in other microscopic organisms because of this viruses can be identified based on their appearance under the microscope the researcher is able to examine both the external and internal structure of the virus particle morphology has been observed to appear ribbon-like rabies rod-shaped measles spherical poliovirus and filamentous ebola figure 43
 many viruses show multiple morphologies under the microscope and are referred to as pleomorphic an example of a very pleomorphic virus is influenza a which can appear kidney bean-shaped or filamentous some viruses have very characteristic spikes club or pin-like projections present on the viral envelope a very interesting example of spikes is seen in the emerging sars virus 
there are two main types of visualization for virus identification using em the first is negative stainingcontrast which was a revolutionary visualization technique designed in the late 1950s due to the low level of electron scatter by viral particles direct contrast and visualization are difficult however using the negative contrast technique the virus particle is visualized on a black electron-opaque background the degree to which the heavy metal salt stain electron-rich penetrates into the virus particle determines the contrastresolution of virus structure this procedure provides very useful information on the external structure of the virus but is somewhat limited in resolving internal structure thin sectioning is a very important sample preparation technique that allows internal structure to be visualized tissue samples are embedded with an epoxy-resin and thin slices are prepared using an ultramicrotome these slices are then examined using various electron-dense stains and antibodies that can be used to tag specific cellular organelles and virus proteins a virus may kill an infected cell creating characteristic cytopathic damage or may replicate in cells without any visible effect the type of changes induced by a virus can be significant for the type of virus and can be observed by the light microscope the cytopathic effect cpe can be focal diffuse through the cell monolayer or at the edge of the culture cells may appear to be rounded or enlarged growing in grapelike clusters indicating adenovirus or herpes simplex virus influenza and mumps cause cells to fuse together creating syncytia that detach from the surface cells may fuse and form multinucleated giant cells with granular cytoplasm typical of measles infection vaccinia and poxviruses create foci of fused cells whereas picornaviruses induce proliferation of membranes in the cytoplasm and shrinkage of the nuclei pyknosis however many viruses such as members of bunyaviridae arenaviridae and retroviridae fail to produce obvious cpe and can replicate in culture without any noticeable change the specific affinity of antibody-antigen recognition is widely used in virus diagnostics polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies can be raised against recombinant virus proteins and virus produced from infected cells if a virus can be isolated in cell culture cell lysates and slurries can be used as virus antigens infected cell cultures can also be used to test for antiviral reactivity present in patient serum recombinant virus proteins produced in e coli and baculovirus expression systems are also used as antigens to detect antibodies present in human serum cerebrospinal fluid csf and tissues finally convalescent serum proven to react with infected cells in culture can be used as a source of antibodies for additional assays antibodies produced during an infection often have the ability to bind the virus and reduce infectivity these protective neutralizing antibodies recognize epitopes on the surface of the virus and prevent virus from infecting a cell neutralizing antibodies are often used to classify virus into serogroups closely related virus families have similar virus coats and neutralizing antibodies that can bind viruses within a group are said to cross-react in a neutralization assay dilutions of neutralizing antibodies are mixed with virus and assayed for remaining infectivity an unknown virus may cross-react with antibodies from a known serogroup revealing an antigenic relationship and an initial clue to the genetic identification more specific and focused assays can then be performed to identify the virus an extensive bank of serotype-specific antibodies in the diagnostic laboratory increases the chance of discovering a novel virus the hemagglutination assay uses the ability of virus proteins to bind and aggregate erythrocytes virus is mixed with an erythrocyte suspension in serial dilutions and added to a microtiter plate with v-bottom wells unabsorbed red blood cells fall to the bottom point of the well forming a dot whereas aggregated blood cells uniformly coat the well the hemagglutination inhibition assay is used to classify virus families that share that ability to bind to erythrocytes antibodies specific for a virus family may prevent aggregation of erythrocytes and are assayed by hemagglutination inhibition complement fixation uses known virus-specific antigen rather than known anti-virus antibodies interactions between virus antigen and antibody cause fixation of complement and result in membrane lysis briefly patient sera are incubated with antigen and a standardized amount of complement red blood cells are coated with anti-red blood cell antibodies that are recognized by complement and added to the sample if antibodies specific to the virus antigen are present and fix complement the red blood cells will be protected from lysis using group-specific virus antigens allows a patients virus to be identified antibodies can be used to detect virus antigen in patient tissues and in infected cell cultures an antibody is linked to a fluorescent dye or enzyme and allowed to bind virus antigen the complex is visualized under a microscope allowing location of the virus proteins to be seen inside the cell cross-reactive sera can be used to serologically identify an unknown virus as a member of a known family polyclonal sera can identify a wide range of viruses whereas monoclonal antisera can give a specific diagnosis additionally the direct visualization of virus antigen in a cell can provide interesting clues of virus properties beyond the diagnosis the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa provides a fast method to detect the presence of virus antigen or antibody from a large number of samples because of its reproducibility and flexibility it is the most common serological assay used in the viral diagnostics lab the general scheme is to capture virus antigens or virus-specific antibodies on a solid surface and to expose the bound complex with a substrate elisas specific for igm and igg antibodies can distinguish between recent infection and previous exposure or vaccination detection of virus antigen indicates an acute stage of virus infection the microtiter plate format can test multiple patient samples with different dilutions of antibodies to determine a serological titer and sequential sampling of patients serum over the course of an acute infection can allow detection of seroconversion an increase in titers of igg antibodies twofold to fourfold over 2 weeks is diagnostic of an active primary infection elisas are frequently used in serosurveys where populations are screened to determine the efficacy of immunization programs or previous exposure to a newly identified virus the detection of virus nucleic acid has revolutionized diagnostics the use of molecular techniques has identified viruses that cannot infect cells in culture or inoculated animals most specimens such as blood tissues urine stool csf and respiratory secretions can be treated and the nucleic acid extracted inactivating the virus and reducing concern about transport or contact in the laboratory detection of virus in the blood is diagnostic of an active infection and the sensitivity of pcr has enhanced our capability to detect very low levels of virus in persistent infections the universal genetic code allows investigators to detect virus sequence from host insects animals bacteria and fungi where serological reagents may not be available the specificity of pcr is dependent on the selection of the primer sets primers are designed to anneal to conserved regions in a virus genome genes that encode proteins essential for the virus life cycle such as polymerases helicases and integrases as well as rna elements in untranslated regions are maintained even in viruses with high mutation rates there are good pcr amplification targets to identify a new virus universal primer sets are designed based on alignments of virus family sequences and selected to minimize base pair mismatches primers containing degenerate bases are used to widen the net and find a genetically distant virus for dna viruses pcr can be applied directly rna viruses require an initial reverse transcription rt-pcr reaction before amplification complex variations on the basic technique of pcr including utilization of multiplex primers taqman probes and molecular beacons can enhance the ability to identify viral sequences pcr products are either sequenced directly or cloned into intermediate vectors for sequencing multiple pcr isolates are sequenced in order to verify the authentic virus sequence as mutations arise during pcr amplification sequencing virus directly from clinical samples without amplification in cell culture minimizes cell culture adaptation artifacts the unknown virus sequences are entered into sequence databases to search for any similarity with known virus genomes the database should include sequences from clinical isolates field samples from the natural hosts and nonpathogenic viruses to assist identification of a novel emerging virus as with any assay molecular diagnosis of virus nucleic acid is confirmed with other diagnostic methods such as serology and virus isolation traditional epidemiology relies on the combination of clinical presentation of disease identification of the pathogen and anecdotal circumstances to explain where the infection began and how it spread throughout a population common features are established to link the transmission to the source of infection the addition of molecular tools to the investigative effort allows the infectious agent to be identified at the genetic level and enhances our understanding of virus origin emergence and transmission molecular epidemiology uses phylogenetic methods to reconstruct a path of virus transmission based on heredity as a virus replicates and moves through a population mutations accumulate the genetic variability displayed by the viruses is compared to deduce common ancestors and explain how one virus sequence gave rise to another viruses evolve sometimes very quickly to adapt to new hosts and environments the genetic makeup of the pathogen may increase in variability with time and passage closely related virus sequences therefore correlate with recent infection and transmission using pcr and molecular tools virus sequences are collected during an outbreak from infected human animal or insect reservoirs these new virus sequences are then compared with a database of known virus sequences the comparison is not a simple match of nucleotides between the virus genomes rather it involves sophisticated algorithms creating clusters of virus sequences sharing a common evolutionary ancestor phylogenetic trees display how a set of virus sequences might have been derived during evolution and provide guides in the placement and classification of an unknown virus the trees are a graphical illustration of the evolutionary linkage of newly isolated virus sequences with known virus genomes figure 44
10 the outer nodes of the tree display existing virus sequences the inner branches represent theoretical ancestral virus sequences that gave rise to the recently isolated virus genome the length of each branch corresponds to the amount of genetic change between the ancestral virus and the currently circulating virus additional algorithms may be applied to place a temporal scale with the amount of evolutionary change a viral sequence that is very distantly related may be used as an outgroup to orient the tree with a direction of evolutionary change phylogenetic analyses revealing ancestry enable initial hypotheses about its basic life history including the virus hosts and transmission patterns as close relatives tend to be similar in their biology the phylogenetic tree can be interpreted as clusters of virus sequences that are used in classification schemes and often these groupings complement traditional methods broad virus families can be defined using sequences from conserved genes such as polymerases and other enzymes required in the virus life cycle finer distinctions are noted by using sequences from genes that are more specialized for a particular virus for example envelopes and genes encoding structural proteins are often used to define virus subgroups within larger families these subgroups often correspond to traditional serogroups defined by traditional serological methods that define groups by their ability to cross-react to a particular antibody entire genes or portions of genes can be used in the phylogenetic analysis but complete virus genomes are rarely used as the sequence length is restricted by the amount of computational time epidemiological questions can be resolved with phylogenetic trees the most fundamental questions in epidemiology are the mode of transmission and the origin of an outbreak as the virus is passed through a population genetic differences accumulate more recent infections generally correspond to more shared derived genetic changes and the most closely related will cluster on a tree transmission patterns are revealed as virus sequences from isolates are compared with sequences from a database and the clusters of sequences reveal a common ancestor an immediate question to solve during a virus outbreak is the mechanism by which the virus spreads viruses frequently infect animal or insect vectors that serve to pass the virus to humans by identifying the virus through sequence analysis a hypothetical reservoir can be predicted by the placement of the sequence on the phylogenetic tree since viruses that share a mode of transmission often cluster together more than one type of vector may be used within the same family of viruses but individual members depend on a particular vector viruses from the family bunyaviridae can be transmitted to humans by such pests as ticks mosquitoes flies and rodents the particular vector utilized often distinguishes individual subgroups within the family phylogenetic trees have been instrumental in proving virus transmission through family members hospital settings and susceptible members of a population by comparing the virus sequence isolated from a patient to virus sequences isolated from individuals in the population transmission routes can be deduced for example it can be concluded that a doctor became infected from a patient seen at a hospital rather than from the general community if the virus sequences from doctor and patient are more similar than sequences found in the population the geographic location of virus infection can also be predicted by the use of phylogenetic trees viruses isolated from reservoirs in different geographic locations can define where people became infected arenaviruses are carried by rodents but domestic rodents are often responsible for causing infections rather than rodents found in the fields or forests by analyzing virus sequences obtained from infected patients and from house field and forest mice the group of mice serving as a reservoir can be determined and public health measures to prevent rodents from entering homes can be implemented the origin of a virus outbreak can involve larger geographic areas as the sars outbreak demonstrates importation of new viruses is an increasing global health concern by accessing a database of virus genomes from around the world a new virus outbreak could be rapidly identified as having been imported from another land as viruses travel some viruses become endemic and it is necessary to distinguish between endemic and imported outbreaks to allow appropriate control measures to function viruses may also cause seasonal outbreaks influenza varies its genome with each year of infection by understanding the extent to which the virus alters its genome from year to year phylogenetic analysis assists in predicting the next years strain and allows scientists to begin production for the upcoming yearly vaccine in may 1993 a clinician reported a cluster of cases presenting with nonspecific illness fever headache and cough that rapidly progressed to respiratory distress the patients were young previously healthy and lived in rural areas in the four-corners region bordering arizona colorado new mexico and utah by early june 1993 24 cases had been reported with a mortality rate approximately 7511
12 patient blood and autopsy tissues were sent to the centers for disease control cdc for investigation diagnostic assays failed to identify known causes of respiratory illness however patient samples cross-reactived with antibodies to four different hantaviruses using hantavirus sera immunohistochemistry detected hantavirus antigen in autopsy tissue from the lung and other involved organs13 hantaviruses are rna viruses with a genome in three segments and a member of the family bunyaviridae previous outbreaks of hantaviruses involved patients with renal disease leading to hemorrhagic complications not respiratory distress hantaviruses are classified into four antigenic groups and each strain of hantavirus is tightly associated with a specific rodent host although hantaviruses have a worldwide distribution the dependence on a particular species of rodent host restricts the geographical range hantaan htn is associated with the field mouse in korea china and eastern russia and causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs seoul seo causes moderate disease in korea and china and is associated with urbanized rats a milder form of hfrs is caused by the serogroup puumula puu in scandinavia and europe and is transmitted by the bank vole at the time of the four-corners outbreak the only north american hantavirus identified was prospect hill ph which was detected in two rodent isolates of meadow voles and not associated with any human illness patient samples from the us four-corners region cross-reacted with hantavirus antigen and allowed epidemiologists to expand their assays to include rt-pcr and narrow the search for the host to local rodents the virus was unable to be cultured from patient samples therefore molecular identification was crucial for identification partial sequences were available for htn seo puu and ph in a database and used to design pcr primers based on conserved areas of the virus glycoprotein nucleic acid was extracted from autopsy tissue and a pcr product was detected in two cases using primer pairs based on puu and ph the pcr product was sequenced revealing a 70 sequence similarity between the new virus and ph and puu14 new primers were designed and could detect products in all current cases the sequence of the new virus was identified and the nucleocapsid protein was expressed in bacteria and purified and used as a recombinant antigen in other serological assays15 the new virus was eventually named sin nombre virus snv rodents were trapped in areas in and surrounding patient houses the predominant species was the field mouse peromyscus maniculitis and approximately 30 had anti-hantavirus antibodies detected in an igg elisa pcr revealed that 82 had detectable virus in the blood indicating high viremia even in the presence of circulating antibodies sequences from rodent and human cases isolated in the four states were aligned and identical nucleotide substitutions were present in the rodent and human cases from the same location indicating that transmission occurred from the field mouse to the human cases14 transmission occurred by inhalation of aerosolized rodent urine ecologists reported an increase in the population of field mice during that year due to a surplus food supply the arid conditions of the southwest and the close proximity of the mice and the patients also contributed to transmission in this outbreak there were no reports of human-human transmission16
 the discovery of snv led to a heightened awareness and search for other american hantaviruses field investigations and retrospective serological studies identified additional hantaviruses in north america17 the north american viruses show an 8095 similarity but are always found only in their specific rodent species18 the detection of the new hantaviruses is enhanced by the use of diagnostic reagents developed in this outbreak and refined as new viruses are identified additional cases have also been detected in south america in 1995 andes virus was isolated in argentina the only documented case of human-human transmission19 hantavirus outbreaks have also been identified in chile paraguay bolivia and brazil causing both respiratory illness and some renal hemorrhagic disease south american cases show higher virus titers and also persistently infect a distinct rodent species as a natural reservoir after the snv outbreak efforts increased to study the relationships between hantaviruses and the rodent hosts worldwide phylogenetic analysis of rodent and human virus sequences has shown a close evolutionary relationship and hantaviruses are often used as models of coevolution a particular genotype of hantavirus persistently infects one species of rodent even though other rodent hosts may be present in the same environment this remarkable coexistence has been mapped through changing landscapes as a rodent species radiates farther away into another habitat it may evolve into a separate but genetically similar species the hitchhiker hantavirus also evolves with the rodent host becoming genetically distinct from viruses associated with the ancestral species this ancient relationship has been mapped using phylogenetic trees which display common ancestral species as clusters that diverge and separate with geographical and genetic distance the topology of the rodent tree can be compared and reveals similar patterns with topology of the associated hantaviruses20 phylogenies have been performed on rodent family subfamily genus and species using mitochondrial dna phylogenetic trees of hantaviruses reveal a similar branching pattern to the rodent tree viruses that infect the same subfamily of rodents form identical clades and closely related hantaviruses are grouped in the same tree pattern as their rodent reservoirs although rare there have been instances of transmission of one virus to another rodent species this provides another example of molecular evolution where virus segments can mix in the host and form reassorted viruses containing combinations of different virus segments this can contribute to genetic diversity reassortment of the segmented genome has been found in nature and in mixed virus infections in tissue culture but only between very closely related viruses21 phylogenetic analysis performed on more than one virus segment tests for the chance of reassortment even in geographical locations where different rodent species may overlap virus-host switching and reassortment are very rare events each hantavirus is associated with a primary rodent host and usually a particular rodent species will be the primary reservoir of a single hantavirus the tight correlation of virus and rodent host in the phylogenetic trees supports the concept of coevolution between virus and host all subfamilies of the family muridae have a hantavirus-rodent relationship fossil records estimate the rodent families muridae to have split into the current subfamilies during the miocene period indicating that hantaviruses have been associated with their rodent hosts for 30 million years an association that began before the division of the rodent family22 the coevolutionary relationship and worldwide distribution of hantavirus illustrates that the 1993 snv outbreak was not due to the emergence of a new virus or virus with an increased virulence but simply the detection of an ancient virus between the autumn of 1998 and spring of 1999 an outbreak of acute fever with encephalitis occurred in peninsular malaysia and singapore with 265 cases resulting in 105 deaths the outbreak was associated with a respiratory illness of pigs and the primary human cases were individuals who had close contact or occupational exposure to pigs23 the initial report was released in late september 1998 attributing the cause of illness to mosquito-borne japanese encephalitis virus je je is endemic to the region and was believed to involve pigs as amplifiers of virus ministries of health began mosquito control measures and vaccination campaigns to block je infection24 by february 1999 the outbreak continued to spread as pigs were moved from the western-central region in the state of perak to three other farms located in the southern states of selangor and negri sembilan the largest pig-rearing areas in southeast asia pigs were also exported to two farms in singapore and resulted in 11 cases and two deaths singapore suspended pig importation from malaysia and no more cases were reported epidemiological analysis discredited je as the infectious agent of the outbreak since communities located near the pig farms did not become infected and immunization and vector control programs were having no effect on the increase of cases as the outbreak continued new attempts were made to find the pathogen25 in march 1999 a virus was isolated by inoculating csf obtained from fatal cases into vero cells the presence of multinucleate syncytia in infected cell culture implicated a paramyxovirus thin-section em detected filamentous nucleocapsids with the hallmark herringbone pattern and also captured virus budding from the plasma membrane both characteristic of paramyxoviruses26 the new virus was named nipah a fortuitous event in the identification of the virus was the observed cross-reactivity between sera against nipah and the paramyxovirus hendra virus no other paramyxovirus sera reacted with nipah samples25
 hendra virus was identified in 1994 as the cause of respiratory illness in three regions of queensland australia resulting in the deaths of thoroughbred horses a horse owner also died of respiratory distress and a stable-hand was infected but survived another individual who assisted with a horse autopsy became ill with a meningitis-like infection and recovered temporarily but one year later developed progressive neurological complications and eventually died27 hendra virus was isolated from his csf to test for other potential infections reagents for an igm and igg elisa and antibodies for ihc were developed hendra-specific antibodies and antigen were used to screen initial nipah cases eventually nipah-specific reagents were developed for larger serosurveys in pig tissues the major source of antigen and pathological damage was seen in the epithelium of the upper and lower airways most of the pigs in case farms were igg-positive for nipah yet only a minority displayed any illness and only 5 were fatal28 pigs had a definite respiratory disease comprising a distinctive cough with some developing encephalitis the primary mode of transmission was suspected to be from respiratory secretions and aerosolized droplets from infected pigs domesticated dogs and cats a few ponies and bats also tested positive for nipah human autopsy results revealed that the primary pathology was secondary to multiorgan vasculitis due to infected endothelium where multinucleate syncytia with viral antigen were detected the cerebral cortex and brainstem were also damaged and neurons were found to have virus inclusion bodies nipah antigen was also detected but to a lesser extent in the lungs heart kidney and spleen consistent with a systemic infection26
 
an rt-pcr assay was developed using degenerate paramyxovirus primers annealing to the p gene sequencing revealed a 78 similarity between nipah and hendra but less than 50 identity to other members of the paramyxovirinae subfamily29 the paramyxoviridae family is divided into two subfamilies the paramyxovirinae and the pneumovirinae the paramyxovirinae is separated into three genera however phylogenetic analysis did not cluster nipah and hendra into any one of the three genera the paramyxovirinae have a genome size around 15 kb while both hendra and nipah have genomes of 182 kb due to a long untranslated region at the 3 end of the genome30 the genome size and phylogenetic differences place nipah and hendra into the newly created henipah genus the origin of the outbreak was traced to large fruit-eating bats which are typically named flying foxes virus was isolated from urine collected under roosting areas and saliva from dropped fruit by the island flying fox pteropus hypomelanus antibodies have also been detected in the malaysian flying fox pteropus vampyrus pig farms have fruit trees located near open pig stalls31
32 flying foxes may transmit virus by urine droplets near the pig stalls or food source or the pigs eat fruit contaminated with flying fox saliva the outbreak was stopped after culling 11 million pigs the west nile virus outbreak illustrates several important points first it illustrates the difficulty in identifying a virus especially one that had never been seen before in the us second it shows that even with an initial misidentification state and federal agencies were still able to act effectively knowing how similar viruses could be controlled and last this case illustrates that virus distribution can be tracked by monitoring those infected as well as its vector in late august 1999 eight concurrent cases of patients having encephalitis andor profound muscle weakness surfaced in queens new york geographically the reported cases were traced to a two by two-mile area of a residential neighborhood immediately sparking exposure concerns by the end of the year 59 patients were hospitalized in new york city and seven deaths were reported33 cases presented with a mild 36-day symptomatic period including sudden onset of malaise nausea vomiting headache rash cough and sore throat less than 1 of those infected developed neurologic disease ie encephalitis34 reported deaths were among the young elderly or immunocompromised also during this initial period it was noticed that several birds throughout the new york area were dying the birds seemed to be dying from a neurological condition samples were sent to the cdc for identification 
shortly after initial cases were reported the cdc believed that the infectious agent was likely to be the endemic st louis encephalitis sle virus the cdc based their conclusion on serologic igm-capture elisa findings which tested for the presence of patient antibodies to sle antigens the laboratory findings of sle as the infectious agent were consistent with the symptoms of those infected as well as the fact that sle was responsible for 4478 confirmed cases in the us from 1964199835 sle is an arbovirus or a virus transmitted to human via arthropods such as mosquitoes steps were quickly taken to monitor and control mosquito populations however shortly after their initial assessment the cdc changed their conclusion and stated that the infectious agent was west nile virus wnv not sle they based this on the more discriminating method of sequencing viral rna isolates via rt-pcr as well as results from specific monoclonal antibody detection of wnv-specific antigens envelope glycoproteins the controversy continued as other independent researchers believed the virus to be kunjin virus another closely related arbovirus36 it was later confirmed that the agent was indeed wnv through independent genetic testing by the us army medical research institute for infectious diseases usamriid33
 the cause for confusion was due to the close relationship between wnv and sle both flavivirieses share significant similarity in their envelope proteins and some antibodies cross-react another compounding factor was that wnv had never been seen before in the us although it was responsible for outbreaks in other geographic locations including africa europe and the middle east the diagnosis of wnv infection is made by both clinical findings and serologic tests which detect patient igm antibodies present in csf or serum34
37 direct virus isolation has been used but due to limited sensitivities is not a primary diagnostic procedure rt-pcr methods for detecting wnv-specific rna have been used extensively for detection in tissues and csf blood banks now use rt-pcr to screen the blood supplies due to the high incidence of asymptomatic wnv-infected donors 23 persons have been reported to have been infected with wnv after receiving transfusions from 16 wnv-infected blood donors38
39
 west nile virus was also identified as the agent responsible for the deaths of birds observed throughout the new york area this has become a very important observation for geographical mapping of the dead birds is valuable for tracking wnv infection as it continues to spread to other states and countries the cdc stated dead-bird-based surveillance has proven to be the most sensitive method for detecting wnv presence in an area however the cdc goes on to state mosquito-based surveillance remains the primary tool for quantifying the intensity of virus transmission in an area and should remain the mainstay in most surveillance programs for wnv and other arboviruses
in addition to mosquito and dead-bird surveillance the cdc as well as state organizations tracked live birds equine wnv infections and obvious human infections these data showed that the virus was continuing to spread westward figure 45
 computer-assisted tracking services like arbonet and the us department of the interior website40 provide up-to-date tracking information such data allow for efficient knowledge acquisition regarding geographic distribution and changes in virus intensity which gives the public the ability to take necessary precautions wnv continues to be a problem with over 4000 cases reported in the us in 2002 accurate up-to-date tracking of infected humans animals and mosquito populations will continue to provide extremely valuable information about virus spread locations at risk and the efficiency of controlling arboviruses through mosquito control surveillance efforts must be supported to allow effective action against wnv and against future arbovirus epidemics as they occur the following case illustrates how trace-back investigations can determine how an african virus infected 81 people across the midwest in the us on may 20 2003 in wisconsin a young girl was taken to the hospital with a rash and raised fluid-filled bumps on her hand that formed after a bite from her pet figure 46
 the doctor who treated her suspected that the girl may have been infected with either the plague or tularemia shortly thereafter both the mother and father became infected with the unknown agent on may 30 2003 upon viewing em micrographs of the mothers biopsy as well as cell culture state doctors believed the infectious agent was a member of the orthopoxvirus genus the em micrographs figure 46 were useful in identifying the genus of virus but were also of limited use for species identification because all members of the orthopoxvirus genus have similar morphology the agent could have been any member such as cowpox vaccinia monkeypox or even smallpox on june 6 2003 local clinicians were able to culture the orthopox virus obtained from the pet prairie dogs lymph nodes samples were quickly sent to the cdc in atlanta georgia for identification while samples were awaiting identification several more cases were reported these were predominantly from midwestern states including wisconsin illinois indiana missouri ohio and kansas patients showed signs of rash fever cough and headache among other symptoms as the patients were interviewed and information gathered a common feature became apparent most patients had contact with exotic pet prairie dogs on june 8 2003 the cdc positively identified the virus as monkeypox by july 2 2003 a final total of 81 monkeypox cases were reported spanning several states the cdc confirmed cases using a variety of laboratory techniques including propagation in tissue culture pcr immunohistochemical testing andor em48 monkeypox virus got its name when it was first discovered in 1958 after several laboratory monkeys became infected with the virus there have been few reports of this virus which is native to rainforest regions of central and western africa however in 19961997 an outbreak occurred in the democratic republic of congo drc where monkeypox was positively identified in 72 cases spanning thirteen villages49 the virus has been found to infect native squirrels shrews monkeys and gambian rats among other animals representing 14 species48 the cause of the epidemic is a result of handling or consuming contaminated bush meat and foodstuffs the virus was spread most likely through person-to-person contact due to close-quarters habitation of the cases documented six deaths occurred accounting for a 3 case-fatality rate49
 in the us outbreak several states linked the purchases of the prairie dogs to particular pet stores the trace-back investigation revealed all of these pet stores purchased prairie dogs from a distributor in illinois through pcr-based genetic testing the cdc uncovered prairie dogs at the illinois dealer tested positive for monkeypox how did these prairie dogs become infected with a virus native to africa this distributor on april 21 2003 received a shipment of african gambian rats and dormice these were then tested by the cdc and found to be infected with the virus investigators then were able to track the rodent shipment to a texas distributor which was the initial point of entry for several rodent species imported from ghana on april 9 2003 several of these imported animals were infected with monkeypox finally a source for the monkeypox entry into the us was located a schematic illustration of the trace-back investigation is shown in figure 47
 very quickly case investigators reconstructed the events of the outbreak their trace-back investigation concluded that the method of virus spread to human populations was through contact with monkeypox-infected prairie dogs animals body fluids or skin rash this was in contrast to the outbreak in the drc where monkeypox spread predominantly via person-to-person contact the prairie dogs were infected by the monkeypox-carrying rodents at the illinois animal distributor because pet stores from many different states purchased from one distributor the geographic region that became susceptible drastically expanded the value of phylogenetic analyses in forensics is well illustrated by the recent and curious criminal case of the state of louisiana versus richard j schmidt50 the uncontested facts in this case are that a gastroenterologist from lafayette louisiana broke into the home of his former mistress and office nurse late at night on august 4 1994 and that he argued with her and gave her an intramuscular injection he claimed it was a vitamin b shot she claimed it was hiv she had begun feeling ill several months after the injection and a blood test in january 1995 revealed that she had become infected with hiv she was a periodic blood donor and based on tests of those previous blood donations had a clear record without prior infection she did not engage in any behaviors placing her at high risk for infection and her sexual contacts over the previous nine years all tested negative for hiv he was a community leader and vietnam war veteran schmidt admitted to having a long-term affair with her but maintained the infection was not his doing she went to the district attorneys office to file charges on learning that she was hiv-positive moving quickly the das detectives obtained a search warrant and proceeded to the accused physicians office where they seized his record books for blood samples drawn from patients and a vial of blood sitting in the refrigerator in a back room in his office this was unusual patients blood samples were sent to the lab soon after being drawn and none were routinely stored there the physician claimed that this sample drawn from one of his hiv-positive patients was for his own use and research was the physician telling the truth might this blood sample link the physician to his nurse assistant and former mistress infection the next logical step in the investigation would clearly be phylogenetic analyses phylogenetic analyses of viral dnas showing little or no relationship between hiv lineages from the nurse and the alleged source the blood vial seized from the physicians office could help demonstrate the physicians innocence whereas a close sister relationship among those lineages in the context of an epidemiological sampling of hiv would be consistent with the physicians alleged role in transmission are phylogenetic analyses better than other more routine methods of forensic analyses in some instances yes analyses based on similarity alone such as comparison of genetic fingerprinting data in which restriction fragment patterns for hypervariable dna sequences are compared are subject to greater bias from similarity due to chance known as homoplasy rather than similarity due to common ancestry known as homology by contrast phylogenetic analyses attempt explicitly to show the pattern of common descent among samples analyzed rather than simple similarity phylogenetic analyses have the potential to show homoplasious similarity for what it is convergence and not to be misled when the desired information is evolutionary relationships portions of the hiv env gp120 gene and the rt genes were specifically chosen to be sequenced in an attempt to maximize the phylogenetic information in the dataset the env gene evolves relatively quickly being selected upon by hosts immune systems and is capable of recovering relationships among recently diverged hiv lineages the rt gene evolves more slowly due to greater functional constraints and can provide insight into relatively older divergences using both sequences thus provides a broader range of evolutionary rates than either does alone initial phylogenetic analyses were conducted using maximum parsimony with the software program paup51 and final analyses were conducted using an explicit model for sequence evolution seeking to account for heterogeneity in rates of change across nucleotide sites and across virus lineages this was done using the maximum-likelihood optimality criteria in a bayesian context with the program mrbayes52 all analyses of the hiv env gp120 sequences from the nurse the alleged source and the epidemiological sampling of hiv patients were congruent in showing the hiv sequences from the victim to form a single monophyletic clade in showing the alleged source to form a single monophyletic clade and in showing those two clades to be closest relatives sister taxa relative to the epidemiological sample this is consistent with the accusation that the physician used the blood sample from one of his patients to infect the nurse although this rapidly evolving sequence provides no information regarding the direction of infection the more slowly evolving rt sequences also indicate their close evolutionary relationship but with an additional and valuable piece of information based on rt sequences viruses from the victim arose from within the clade of viruses from the alleged source that is the alleged source viruses are paraphyletic incomplete in this case unless the victims viruses are included and nested within that group this analyses does provide more direct evidence about the direction of infection with the clear implication that viruses from the alleged source were used to infect the victim viral lineages from the alleged source diverged prior to divergences among the victims viruses this difference from the tree topologies based on env sequences can be traced to the slower rate of rt sequence change with longer associated coalescence times for gene lineages showing an earlier set of divergence events as expected the phylogenetic analyses and rationale above are mainstream methods among evolutionary biologists however phylogenetic thinking and explicit use of evolutionary trees to track genealogy and transmission of virus or bacterial strains between individuals is not yet common in the us courts the case of the state of louisiana versus richard j schmidt set a precedent in this area a pre-trial admissibility hearing was held regarding the proposed use of phylogenetic analyses in the criminal trial accusing schmidt of attempted murder despite the efforts of the defense to block their admissibility based on arguments that the viruses were evolving too rapidly to allow tracing of their shared ancestry they were not the judge ruled that phylogenetic analyses did meet judicial standards of admissibility being subject to empirical testing published in peer reviewed sources and generally accepted within the scientific community though not a panacea phylogenetic analyses will prove useful in a range of forensic investigations as with other molecular forensic approaches they can be particularly effective in demonstrating the innocence of accused individuals they can be also be useful in tracing sources for any transfer of infectious materials whether viral bacterial or protozoan involving accidental contamination or intentional infection in personal crimes or acts of terrorism however these applications are potentially limited by rates of sequence change which must be sufficiently fast to provide a record of phylogenetic relatedness but slow enough to preserve sufficient phylogenetic signal prior to its being overwritten with multiple substitutions at individual sites application of phylogenetic analyses can also be complicated by the propensity of some viruses to recombine the defendant was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 50 years in prison the maximum allowable under the law in this particular case tried by jury the phylogenetic evidence was consistent with the prosecutions case however there was other evidence that the jury may have found even more compelling this included the physician having hidden the notebooks of his blood sampling and having a history of threats against the victim as she tried to end their affair on march 4 2002 the us supreme court rejected an appeal of the verdict thus establishing precedent for use of phylogenetic analyses in us courts of law as mentioned earlier viruses in nature depending upon their replication strategy and host range have many ways to evolve through mutation recombination reassortment and selection these innate properties have been used as tools in virology for decades examples include cold-adapted and attenuated live vaccine strains of influenza cross-species rotavirus reassortants as vaccine candidates and the attenuated yellow fever virus 17d vaccine strain that was derived by serial passaging in cell culture over the last 30 years the recombinant dna revolution has changed virology forever besides its impact on our ability to study specific viral nucleic acids and proteins recombinant dna technology and pcr sped up our ability to determine complete viral genomic sequences and create specific viral variants the ability of scientists to engineer novel viruses varies greatly small positive-strand rna viruses of bacteria plants and animals provided some of the first examples where infectious virus was produced via recombinant dna more recently it has also become possible to engineer the 29-kb rna genome of coronaviruses and both monopartite and segmented negative-strand rna viruses viruses in the family reoviridae with double-stranded rna genomes have proven more difficult for herpesviruses whose genomic dna is infectious the same technologies used for cloning large pieces of chromosomal dna have been applied successfully to propagate overlapping fragments of entire herpesvirus genomes for the poxviruses whose genomic dna is not infectious recombinant viruses are generated within infected cells by homologous dna recombination between a plasmid containing the engineered segment and an infecting parental virus typically recombinant dna manipulations of viruses begin with viral nucleic acid rna or dna that is then cloned and amplified in bacteria using plasmid vectors or in vitro using pcr once the genome sequence of a virus is known however it becomes possible to create this sequence artificially using overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides and gene synthesis techniques that have been available for many years an example of this which received a great deal of attention from the media and the scientific community was recently published for an attenuated form of poliovirus53 while the poliovirus case came as no surprise to virologists and molecular biologists it did bring several issues to the forefront if an infectious virus can be created by synthetic methods can it ever really be eradicated in light of potential bioterrorist or biowarfare agents should there be a restriction on making the genome sequence available in public databases should research on these agents be banned classified or otherwise regulated these and other questions will continue to be debated in the years to come the ability to engineer viruses raises the concern about modifying existing viruses to make them more virulent the bulk of examples in virology run counter to this idea viruses are usually highly adapted to a particular niche and most mutations are deleterious propagation of pathogenic viruses in cell culture often leads to adaptation to that environment and attenuation in their animal host recombinants or chimeras between even closely related viruses are usually impaired relative to either parent we do see examples however of viruses that are benign in one animal host but highly pathogenic in another species this is often the case in epizootic emerging viruses an extreme example of host species-specific pathogenesis is the myxoma poxvirus which causes a benign cutaneous fibroma in wild rabbits of the americas but a highly lethal disease in the european rabbit this virus was used for biological control of feral european rabbits in europe and australia in 2001 an australian group published a paper describing the construction of recombinant mousepox virus expression interleukin-4 il-4 and its pathogenesis in mice54 this study provides a striking and sobering example of an engineered virus with enhanced pathogenicity il-4 is a cytokine that regulates the immune response at various levels the recombinant mousepox virus suppressed both innate and adaptive immune responses that normally control infection and was lethal for otherwise genetically resistant mice moreover even animals that had been previously vaccinated and protected from virulent mousepox were susceptible to lethal infection by the mousepox-il-4 recombinant virus this study raises obvious concerns about the efficacy of current vaccination against modified versions of the smallpox virus viral replication mutation and evolution both help and hinder determination of the origin of a virus in the case of naturally occurring emerging viruses sequence comparisons of isolates linked temporally to disease geography and species can help pin down the virus origin cases involving deliberate dissemination of a naturally occurring isolate as in the schmidt case require not just phylogenetic comparisons but also other forensic evidence the ability to engineer viruses makes the situation even more complex while there are numerous laboratory strains of different viruses for which we know the exact sequence the sequence of an isolate does not prove that it originated from a particular source viruses can be transferred and propagated or as noted above functional viral genomes can be created synthetically to mimic or diverge from a publicly available sequence in many ways virology and viral forensics are still in their infancy we know very little about the vast spectrum of viruses in nature although we should continue to pursue studies on known human pathogens we need to broaden our efforts in virus isolation viral genomics and bioinformatics a comprehensive database of viral sequences is critical for rapid identification of emerging viral pathogens and new diagnostic platforms such as oligonucleotide arrays55 in addition to viral genomics global proteomic analysis of viral disease processes may uncover molecular signatures that can be used to implicate a particular etiologic agent or class of agents even in the absence of viral nucleic acid or serology the global eradication of smallpox ranks as one of humankinds greatest accomplishments in the wake of this triumph many viral challenges remain hiv hepatitis b and c influenza dengue rotavirus and many other viral diseases continue to affect tens of millions it is distressing that in the face of these undeniable challenges we are back to discussing the deliberate use of existing or modified viruses for harm not good work by dpm was supported by the national science foundation dbi-9974525 jh lkm hlh and cmr are supported by grants from the public health service

salomn hocsman patricia escola nora maidana i   the middletolate holocene ca 80003500 cal yr bp was a period of significant cultural dynamics as well as environmental and climatic changes in the highlands of the southcentral andes this region known locally as the altiplano or puna with its salt flats dried lakes paleosols glacial deposits and archaeological sites provides a number of crucial archives from which to tease out this complex interrelationship paleoenvironmental studies performed on several puna wetland areas have stimulated debate on climatic variability during this period some suggest that middle holocene environmental conditions were dry changing to more humid conditionssimilar to those of modern timestoward the late holocene eg veit 1996 grosjean et al 1997 2003 2007 valerogarcs et al 2000 abbott et al 2003 tapia et al 2003 morales 2011 tchilinguirian  morales 2013 contrariwise others have noted a predominance of humid environmental conditions during the middle holocene before a drier spell during the late holocene eg betancourt et al 2000 latorre et al 2002 these disparities may relate to local geography eg latitude longitude and altitude resolution scales sensitivity of the analyzed proxy chronological problems eg 14c reservoir effect see geyh et al 1999 differential preservation and finally environmental heterogeneity and its complexity in relation to climate garreaud  aceituno 2001 grosjean et al 2003 consequently the chronology intensity and duration of these environmental shifts in different parts of the andean highlands of northern chile northern argentina southern peru and southern bolivia highlight a more complex paleoenvironmental picture and therefore the need to generate regional and local environmental models grosjean 2001 yacobaccio  morales 2005 nuez cartajena  grosjean 2013 tchilinguirian  morales 2013 middletolate holocene climate change influenced human settlement adaptation and culture change in the southcentral andes archaeological research on middle holocene sites associated with puna wetlands indicates a series of highly complex social responses to existing environmental conditions for instance in the salar de atacama the extreme aridity postulated for this area during the middletolate holocene transition would have provoked a decline andor hiatus in human occupation a period traditionally referred to as the archaeological silence nez cartajena  grosjean 2013 however patchesenclaves with more stable hydrological resources persisted during this time in places such as the puripica gorge chile or in susques argentina these areas served as ecological refugia exploited by huntergatherers providing localized higher floral and faunal concentrations within the broader desert environment yacobaccio  morales 2005 nez cartajena  grosjean 2013 in time the intensive management of some of these enclaves engendered significant cultural change associated with increased social complexity in effect laying the basis for the transition from huntergatherer to agropastoral societies in the late holocene grosjean et al 1997 nuez grosjean  cartajena 2010 thus a thorough understanding concerning the development of these varied socioeconomic changes during the middle holocene and transition to the late holocene requires a detailed study of the cultural processes involved and the environmental history that underlies specific areas taking an interdisciplinary perspective here we focus on a combination of paleoenvironmental and archaeological data to elucidate the impact of local environmental changes on huntergatherer procurement strategies and their transition to foodproducing societies in antofagasta de la sierra southern argentine puna during ca 70003000 cal yr bp to this end we present a paleoenvironmental reconstruction of two rivers las pitas and miriguaca and the surrounding area our reconstruction of streamflow history for these two rivers is based on crosscorrelations between geomorphological sedimentological and diatomological proxy data we focus on these two rivers given that there has been intense archaeological research in this area this past research shows that archaeological sites dating to the period addressed here are mainly associated with the paleowetlands of these two rivers additionally other archaeological data such as rock art aschero 2010 and lithic assemblages hocsman 2014 reveal cultural differences between the human occupations along these two rivers we believe that a comparative analysis combining paleohydrology and archaeological evidence from these two river basins is relevant to our understanding the role of extreme for example arid and high altitude environments in the process of sociocultural change the puna

plains in connection with the areas primary drainage the punilla river the central basin of antofagasta de la sierra is bounded by higher elevations that include the calalaste mountains 5350 m asl to the west and galn crater to the east 5900 m asl the adjacent miriguaca and las pitas river basins share several geomorphological and geological characteristics both are tributaries of the punilla river with catchments that reach to 5900 m asl along the border of galn crater located in the toconquis mountains figure 1 the miriguaca and las pitas river basins lack evidence of glacial action however the upper reaches of the basins contain certain periglacial features such as debris flow and solifluction lobes that cover the side slopes also the flood plains of both rivers above 4800 m asl contain wetlands with soil mounds resulting from soil frost and riparian flora along the middle reaches of the two basins 48004000 m asl the rivers have downcut into the ignimbrite plateau forming canyons 80120 m deep with sheer vertical sides susceptible to rockslides finally along the lower reaches 40003200 m asl both rivers end in broad valleys inset 2030 m into pleistocene conglomerates that form a veneer over pediments five late pleistocene to holocene fluvial terraces are evident along both rivers along with an active flood plain occupied by wetlands vegas despite the arid environment both rivers are permanent due to greater precipitation in the higher parts of their basins orographic precipitation infiltrates into fractured volcanic rocks located above 4500 m asl and supports baseflow the high elevation watershed for the las pitas river covers an area of ca 100 km2 and contains a greater number of springs compared to the miriguaca river whose high elevation watershed is restricted to ca 60 km2 figure 1 variations in upland seasonal flooding is minimal and water tables lie less than 05 m from the surface allowing for the development of organic soils and riparian vegetation cushion peat land squeo et al 2006 streamflow slightly increases during the winter due to lower atmospheric temperatures and reduced evapotranspiration rates salminci tchilinguirian  lane 2014 seasonal streamflow variability increases in the lower basin probably as a consequence of water loss due to infiltration and higher evapotranspiration rates compared to the higher basin furthermore irrigation activities are another factor reducing streamflow in the lower basin tchilinguirian 2009 previous paleoenvironmental analyses in the study area define the middle

during the early holocene figure 2 with huntergatherer settlement recorded in the lower stratigraphic level of the peas de las trampas site that dates to ca 10190 cal yr bp martinez 2014 during the period between 80004000 cal yr bp we have evidence in the southern andes highlands for sporadic occupation of huntergatherer sites in some areas such as northern chile and argentina the evidence suggests that certain areas that had been occupied during the early holocene were abandoned nez et al 1999 however the archaeology from antofagasta de la sierra shows greater habitation stability during this period mondini et al 2013 in fact between ca 8500 and 6000 cal yr bp there is evidence of considerable residential activity in areas above 3600 m asl that had high potential resource productivity mondini et al 2013 these huntergatherer groups undertook mobility strategies that entailed regular visits to certain sites where they engaged in the intensive exploitation of guanaco lama guanicoe and vicua vicugna vicugna thereby maximizing use of wild resources aschero and martinez 2001 the archaeological evidence recovered from sites in the area dating 55003500 cal yr bp reveals a process of intensification and increased social complexity involving a local transition from a huntergatherer to foodproducing way of life this transition is characterized by a progressive reduction in residential mobility framed within increasing sedentism hocsman 2002 2006 aschero  hocsman 2011 crucially important socioeconomic changes occur during this period such as the domestication of

quinoa oxalis tuberosa solanum tuberosum and zea mays babot 2011 aschero and hoscman 2011 proposed that the commencement of productive strategies was not due to the influence of nuclear areas but rather to local factors within huntergatherer groups themselves their proposal for this new social dynamic is based on systematic research of 11 archaeological sites supported by 26 radiocarbon dates

reichardt jung binocular microscope with nomarsky interference contrast and 100 immersion planapochromatic objectives relative abundance was calculated counting between 300 and 500 valves and the density of the total valves g1 of dry sediment was estimated by the aliquot method battarbee 1986 we follow bradburys 1988 proposal that diatom assemblage samples with less than 100000 valves g1 of dry sediment should not be considered reliable for paleoenvironmental inferences taxonomical identification was based on monographs by rumrich langebertalot and rumrich 2000 and other related articles servant and servantvilary 2003 indicated that the relationships between diatoms and habitat type provide a good indicator of changes in water depths for a number of rivers in the bolivian puna according to these authors habitats are divided into two large groups group 1 is represented by facultative planktonic benthic and epiphytic species and indicates shallow aquatic habitats and high water tables associated with mesic conditions group 2 on the other hand is mainly characterized by aerophilous species and indicate the expansion of hydromorphic soils and humid meadows that is low water tables and less humid conditions information concerning ecological references are based on standard texts such as lowe 1974 van dam mertenes and sinkeldam 1994 among others the relative abundance of significant species was plotted using tiliatgview version 204 software grimm 1992 additionally diatom stratigraphic biozones were determined with optimal partition using the sum of squares criterion optimal partn calculated with zone v 12 juggins 1991 finally the statistical significance of the different zones was evaluated employing the brokenstick model with the bstick v 10

paleofluvial and cultural changes are based on radiocarbon ages some previously obtained during earlier investigations in the region accelerator mass spectrometry ams radiocarbon dating of eight fluvial sediment samples was performed on bulk organic matter from paleowetland sediments table i the dated layers were mainly composed of complete and broken plant epidermis remains this terrestrial

multifunctional fluvial terraces located along the lower reaches of the las pitas and miriguaca rivers are defined by elongated level surfaces flanking the borders of ignimbrite canyons and piedmonts figure 3 eight terraces have been identified terraces i to v have a maximum height of ca 20 m above the river channel and date to the pleistocene we interpret these as fill terraces sensu bull 1991 formed by episodic downcutting and backfilling terrace vi contains alluvial gravels and sands with peats interbedded with diatomaceous silts the peats date to between 6730 and 3500 cal yr bp along the las pitas river and ca 6630 to 1400 cal yr bp along the miriguaca river see below closer to the modern river channels are unpaired terraces vi vii and viii terraces vii and viii are located 2 and 1 m above the channel respectively and composed of sands and gravel that postdate 1400 cal yr bp the lower reaches of both rivers form valleys inset 2030 m into the pleistocene piedmont that is conformable with pleistocene terrace iii farther upslope the inset flood plains are occupied by marshes figures 3 and 4 modern fluvial processes vary within and between the basins in the higher cryoandean belt zone of both rivers 4950 m asl channels are indistinct and plant cover diminishes considerably with altitude between 49504000 m asl streamflow is conducted in slightly meandering 2 m wide and 1 m deep channels that transport mediumsized gravels to coarse sands channels occupy 510 of the active flood plain or fluvial belt while the remaining surface is covered by typical intrazonal altoandean cushion peatland these plants comprise compact primarily circular cushions formed by closely packed shoots with short internodes sometimes occupied by shallow pools associated with the peatland are organic and mineral soils affected by paludization ironreduction and freezethaw processes along the middle reaches of both rivers 40003350 m asl channels occupy 7080 of the fluvial belt these channels are smaller than in the upper reaches of the high basins and the dominant grain sizes are coarse to very coarse sands indicating a downstream reduction in grain size and stream competence the cushion peat is degraded or has flat and thin shapes associated with distichia muscoides surrounded by stands of tussock grass mineral sandy soils with agc profiles and redox features are common evidence of freezethaw processes is absent and soil humification is limited in the lower river basins the channels cover 7080 of the fluvial belt the lower reach of the las pitas river has braided channels with coarse sandy and fine gravel today streamflow is ephemeral due to diversions for irrigation the lower reach of the miriguaca river however is permanent and has flood plain characteristics similar to its middle reach both rivers form a tributary alluvial fan covering a 1 km2 area at their junctions with the punilla river depositional histories can vary between river reaches due to intrinsic geomorphic controls that generate equifinality problems knox 1983 schumm 1991 church 2008 harvey  pederson 2011 both the las pitas and miriguaca rivers share some geomorphic attributes for example their flood plains have shallow hydrogeological basements 10 m and quaternary gravel substrates likewise the stream valleys have similar stream gradients and lithologies and lack visible evidence of neotectonics or dams caused by tributary holocene debris flows the main difference between these two river basins lie in the size of their high altitude catchment areas the las pitas river has a high altitude catchment that is 20 larger and has more springs providing for greater baseflow figure 1 there are also local differences between the las pitas river and miriguaca stratigraphic localities although both localities are downstream from major tributaries within their hydrological basins the las pitas river locality is situated within a bedrock canyon with a more confined flood plain compared to the miriguaca river locality the latter located on the piedmont figures 3 and 4 geomorphic differences between these two closely spaced rivers are likely to result in somewhat different fluvial responses to possible climatic forcing the basal section of the las pitas river stratigraphic locality dated to 5963  50 14c yr bp 6730 cal yr bp is characterized by bedded gravels in a sand matrix with reddish iron mottles overlain by horizontally stratified sands fa1 this facies is interpreted as highenergy braided channels devoid of paleomarshes these gravels occur in tabular layers laterally extending  200 m these are overlain by layers of massive matrixsupported gravels separated by an erosive discontinuity and are interpreted as debris flow deposits fa2 root traces suggest the existence of flood plain vegetation however it was probably not abundant enough to form organic peatlands interspersed within the debris flow deposits are thin and discontinuous lenses of stratified gravels and finer laminated sediments with diatoms fa3 indicating that there were at least two debris flow events cutandfill unconformities are common in the middle and upper sections where the profile is dominated by a gravelstratified facies with subordinate laminated organic and diatomaceous sediments fa3 diatom layers are between 5 and 15 cm thick forming lenses that laterally extend 10 and 50 m these layers have been dated to between 4365  40 14c yr bp and 3584  40 14c yr bp 4890 and 3800 cal yr bp respectively in the upper section a tabular and thicker 25 cm diatom layer with laminated organic matter fa4 laterally extends 200 m and dates 3800 cal yr bp figure 5 the lower part of miriguaca river stratigraphic locality is exposed in a few places and contains two mineral paleosols of dark gray color interbedded with thin diatomite lenses and thin laminations of organic matter and fine gravels with strong stratification fa3 these deposits date 5880  40 and 5641  45 14c yr bp 6630 and 6370 cal yr bp and are interpreted as a perennial highenergy fluvial environment with episodic mineral soil formation facies fa1 characterized by bedded gravels with thin lenses of white silt devoid of organic matter appears above an erosive discontinuity that extends across the entire middle section of the profile and in turn is overlain by debris flow deposits of facies fa2 within the debris flow deposits a 1020 cm thick discontinuous lens of white fine ashy sediment was identified and interpreted as fluvially redeposited volcanic ash fewer root traces occur within the ashy sediment facies fa1 and fa2 compared to the lower profile the middle section is thus interpreted as an ephemeral fluvial environment dominated by episodic debris flow and highenergy floods figure 6 a discontinuity bounds the upper contact of these deposits and is overlain by a 1 m thick sequence of fa4 sediments that laterally extend  200 m these sediments include organic sands and diatomaceous silts interbedded with organic matter organic sediment was dated to 3060  40 14c yr bp 3200 cal yr bp and an overlying laminated silt to 2690  40 14c yr bp 2760 cal yr bp figure 6 the top of the stratigraphic sequence contains an erosional contact overlain by a 2 m thick succession of tabular bedded gravels that fine upward to finer grained deposits fl fm this section corresponds to facies fa3 organic matter from the upper finer deposits dated 1560  40 14c bp 1400 cal yr bp tchilinguirian 2009 a total of 34 samples from the las pitas river stratigraphic exposure contained sufficient quantities of diatoms for paleoenvironmental reconstruction in these samples 38 genera were identified including 94 infragenera taxa planothidium lanceolatum and fragilaria capucina complex sensu langebertalot 1980 are dominant throughout the stratigraphic sequence followed by humidophila gallica and gomphonema punae both frequent in andean rivers seeligmann  maidana 2003 statistical analyses indicate four distinct biostratigraphic zones figure 7 although the beginning of biozone b1p 358190 cm deep has not been clearly identified this biozone likely developed during the middle holocene ca 6730 cal yr bp biozone b1p is characterized by the dominance of the aforementioned species and a lesser presence of staurosirella pinnata 10 nitzschia gracilis 83 staurosira venter 76 and nitzschia palea 33 most of these are species that prefer group 1 habitats in effect moist river bank environments higher in the profile two biozones b2p 181 cm and b3p 171 cm are both defined by one sample each and significant changes in diatom assemblages when compared to the other biozones biozone b2p predates 4890 cal yr bp and is characterized by a significant increase and dominance of aerophilous species such as h gallica 317 it implies a prevalence of group 2 species and less humid conditions at ca 4890 cal yr bp biozone b3p develops with a strong increase of g punae 423 and an important peak in the relative frequency of nitzschia liebetruthii 97 gomphonema punae is an endemic species in the andes although its autecology is still unknown it could have been an epiphyte a common characteristic of the gomphonemataceae family that adhered to a variety of algae bryophytes and vascular aquatic plants associated with periphyton round crawford  mann 1990 kociolek  spaulding 2003 these conditions identify biozone b3p as a probable humid river margin environment with riparian vegetation after 3800 cal yr bp the development of biozone b4p 16310 cm is characterized by a diatom assemblage similar to biozone b1p except for the dominance of fragilaria vaucheriae between 152 and 55  this species is an efficient colonizer commonly found in the tychoplankton communities of rivers and lakes krammer  langebertalot 1991 consequently an increase in group 1 species is evident on the other hand a significant rise in diatoms contents is observed in the samples analyzed suggesting higher paleoproductivity thus it could be inferred that this biozone represents higher water tables that in turn allowed the development of a tycoplanctonic community sediment samples collected at 154 133 125 117 86 69 60 30 and 22 cm depth from the miriguaca river stratigraphic exposure yielded densities lower than 100000 valves g1 of dry sediment and thus provide less robust paleoenvironmental inferences at a depth of 69 cm a stratum of volcanic ash sterile in diatoms was visible in the remaining samples a total of 60 genera were identified comprising 81 infrageneric taxa such samples were subdivided into three statistically discernible stratigraphic biozones figure 8 biozone b1m 212173 cm deep begins at ca 6370 cal yr bp and is characterized by a predominance of the aerophilic h gallica 59 with smaller percentages of typical fluvial species such as p lanceolatum 13 frankophila similoides 9 denticula elengans 14 and denticula valida 8 the fluctuation of species throughout biozone b1m may represent river bank conditions with variations in humidity surfaces may have been shaded as large concentrations of h gallica are found in high altitude environments where limited light intensity prevails morales 2011 biozone b2m 167522 cm deep includes most of the stratigraphic exposure including the volcanic ash layer spanning a time of approximately 63003200 cal yr bp this biozone is characterized by fluctuations in diatom abundances ranging from 100000 valves g1 of dry sediment to significantly lower densities implying significant changes in available moisture through time diatom assemblages are characterized by a reduction in the abundance of h gallica with a strong decrease in group 2 species the lower part of this biozone is mainly conformed by pseudostaurosira brevistriata 58 f similoides 27 navicula lauca 16 and pseudostarosira catarctarum 28 contrariwise above the 45 cm level s pinnata 21 and s venter 14 are recorded all these species belong to group 1 and grow in riparian habitats but they appear discontinuously throughout the biozone biozone b3m 95 cm below the surface dated ca 32002760 cal yr bp contains anomoneis sphaerophora var 1 20 and n lauca 12 as the dominant species together with benthic forms such as nitzschia perminuta 115 and n aff liebetruthii 115 it is interesting that h gallica and d valida reappear in this biozone although in low percentages 8 and 4 respectively in comparison with biozone b1m hence despite the increase of aerophilous species group 2 the ones related to group 1 habitats are dominant it would therefore indicate a more humid environment than represented by biozone b1m paleoecological and sedimentology data indicate that the paleoenvironmental changes recorded along the las pitas and miriguaca rivers may be divided into two distinct phases within the overall arid framework of the middle holocene these phases however present local chronological discrepancies and different magnitudes of environmental change along both rivers figure 9 paleoenvironmental phase i pi is defined by relatively less humid conditions compared to later phase ii pii phase i for the las pitas river dates ca 67004800 cal yr bp and ca 66003000 cal yr bp for the miriguaca river figure 9 prior to 6700 cal yr bp streamflow conditions associated with highenergy braided channels would have been common to the las pitas river beginning at ca 6700 cal yr bp periodic debris flows separated by episodes of marsh formation are recorded major sedimentary facies fa1 fa2 and to a lesser degree fa3 and diatom evidence indicate a fluvial system with more stable paleohydrological conditions as compared to the miriguaca river las pitas streamflow during this phase is associated with thick gravel layers suggesting a higher streamflow capacity than the miriguaca river on the other hand the large dominance of adnate diatom taxa also depicts a riparian zone with strong abrasion events generated by rapid water velocities these taxa produce and grow on large quantities of mucilage and are highly resistant to fluvial abrasion hill 1996 hence their presence indicates stable streamflow where flooding events did not prevent the development of diatom communities along the river banks during this phase except for two flood events recorded at the base of the profile figure 7 in contrast the paleohydrological history of pi is more complex for the miriguaca river initially streamflow was shallow and ephemeral fa1 with shaded margins b1m associated with paleosols and localized lenses of facies fa3 toward 6300 cal yr bp debris flows were deposited fa2 along the river bottom generating inadequate conditions for the development of diatom communities due to hydrological and thus ecological instability b2m a thick white and biologically sterile volcanic ash lens is interpreted as a volcanic air fall deposit above this lens are thick alluvial and mass wasting deposits containing retransported ashes resting directly upon an erosive discontinuity this sequence suggests a limited introduction of tephra into these deposits probably due to limited fluvial transport and lack of surface stability and soil formation in the flood plain nearby it has been observed that cycles of volcanic activity culminated with the dome collapse of cerro blanco ca 5480  40 yr 14c bp montero lopez et al 2010 however as the ash lens in the study profile is redeposited it does not allow precise age correlations regardless of the age of this deposit both the ash and rapid alluvialmass wasting deposition may have had a considerable impact on the aquatic community ecologically and hydrologically modifying this part of the river and transforming it into an unstable wetland this situation could explain the low diatom abundance in the middle part of the profile and in the recorded sedimentological facies both rivers contain evidence for more humid environmental conditions during pii diatom analysis indicates an increase in water table levels associated with more sustained baseflow resulting in more extensive wetland formation figure 9 the beginning of this more humid phase is diachronic along the las pitas river it starts after ca 4890 cal yr bp with the deposition of extensive lenses associated with facies fa3 as opposed to the previous phase pii is represented by laminated deposits with abundant diatoms and organic matter that alternate with bar and swale stratified gravels these gravels are thicker and more laterally extensive than in the previous pi common red iron mottles in alluvial sands and gravels indicate a shallow phreatic table favoring localized pools 210 m2 with greater organic and diatom sedimentation diatoms assemblages indicate areas marginal to the channel that are susceptible to frequent inundation b2p toward ca 4800 cal yr bp deposits suggest greater surface stability possibly vegetated b3p and later dominated by tychoplanktonic species indicating rising water table levels and more humidity b4p until ca 3800 cal yr bp diatom composition coincides with facies interpreted as highenergy channels across the flood plain but with areas of high biological productivity fa4 and fa3 increases in effective moisture are also recorded between ca 4270 cal yr bp and 4100 cal yr bp at laguna colorada representing short pulses of moisture during an otherwise arid period in antofagasta de la sierra tchilinguirian 2009 grana 2013 finally after 3600 cal yr bp the las pitas river downcuts and creates a 5 m deep incised channel resulting in a drop of the local base level tchilinguirian 2009 evidence for pii begins later for the miriguaca river starting ca 3000 cal yr bp and continuing until 1600 cal yr bp this is indicated by the dominance of facies fa4 and fa3 which contain organic soils and reflect a shallow phreatic table and highly productive pools within the flood plain additionally diatom analyses indicate the existence of puddle marshes bm3 thus pii along the miriguaca river can be correlated with increases in humidity ca 3000 cal yr bp that were registered regionally within the antofagasta de la sierra laguna colorada mojones river curuto river and farther north on the puna salar de atacama negro francisco lake titicaca lake grosjean et al 1997 2007 tapia et al 2003 in sum the evidence presented here indicates that the las pitas river was a permanent watercourse throughout the middletolate holocene although with diminished discharge and more limited formation of organic and puddle marshes during pi the following phase pii is characterized by greater discharge and marsh formation meanwhile the miriguaca river had a more stable baseflow only after 3000 cal yr bp pii between 6600 and 3000 cal yr bp streamflow was more irregular the diatom and alluvial stratigraphic evidence allow us to infer hydrological changes within the catchments of the las pitas and miriguaca rivers the quantity energy and seasonality of runoff depend on the dimensions altitude soils vegetation and geology of the catchment areas as well as local geomorphic controls schumm 1991 the geology vegetation climate and soils of the two adjacent hydrological basins are similar differing primarily in the greater catchment area elevation and number of springs in the las pitas watershed the lower reaches of the las pitas and miraguaca rivers both contain shallow alluvial fill over bedrock however the las pitas river is more entrenched and confined figure 4d the two rivers hydrological response to climate change may differ due to a combination of local geomorphological controls and contrasting size and morphometry of their watersheds the higher altitude las pitas catchment area exceeding 4500 m asl along its eastern perimeter experiences greater orographic rainfall thus the effects of increased moisture during the local humid events of pi were likely greater for the las pitas river than for the miriguaca river upland precipitation supplies the high mountain aquifers that discharge into lower elevation springs and subsequently into wetlands favoring elevated water tables the confined nature of the las pitas flood plain reduces the effect of evapotranspiration facilitating a more stable baseflow consequently the development of more stable wetlands cushion peats mitigated the overall aridity of the region for the miriguaca river however and its lower elevation upper basin the hydrological input was smaller resulting in shallower andor more unstable water tables also the open and wide flood plain of the lower miriguaca river permits a more spatially dynamic and exposed alluvial reach facilitating greater evaporation losses compared to the confined canyon of las pitas consequently the lower miriguaca river contained poorly developed wetlands during pi marked by ephemeral streamflow minor humidarid cycles between ca 8000 and 3600 cal yr bp have been identified elsewhere in the region grosjean et al 1997 2007 morales 2011 tchilinguirian et al 2014 veit 1996 argues that wet periods during the middle holocene while recharging local aquifers were not sufficient to generate the geoecological conditions needed to produce extensive and longlasting marshes in effect these wet cycles had restricted local consequences thus increasing aridity during the late holocene gave rise to diminished baseflow and greater seasonal discharge variability for the miriguaca river in contrast short episodes of increased moisture during the middle holocene generated a greater hydrological response for the las pitas river more sustained baseflow reduced discharge variability and enhanced peat formation paleohydrological changes between ca 7000 and 3000 cal yr bp in the antofagasta de la sierra seem to have triggered different local environmental responses that favored the development of a huntergatherer landscape aschero  hocsman 2011 mondini et al 2013 paleoenvironmental evidence indicates that changes in effective moisture were not spatially homogenous resulting in locally variable expansion and development of wetlands within and between hydrological basins this situation likely played a key role in middletolate holocene human occupations of this region figure 10 archaeological sites identified so far that date ca 70006800 cal yr bp are located in the high and middle reaches of the las pitas river 39003600 m asl cueva salamanca 1 and quebrada seca 3 respectively these sites are defined as huntergatherer residential bases located near wetlands and within rock shelters with favorable protectionhiding conditions within the las pitas ignimbrite canyon however no sites date to the period between ca 6700 and 6300 cal yr bp figure 10 although some settlements such as quebrada seca 3 eg levels 2b6 and 2b7 could not be properly dated aschero 1988 this apparent absence has been interpreted as a reduction in occupational intensity relative to earlier periods along the river pintar 2014 between ca 6100 and 5400 cal yr bp settlements in the higher parts of the las pitas watershed eg quebrada seca 3 present structured spaces with evidence of space preparation and maintenance activities aschero elkin  pintar 1991 this has been interpreted as a mobility strategy based on regular returns to certain places possibly associated to wellestablished seasonal roundscircuits aschero  hocsman 2011 paleoenvironmental data from las pitas indicate that during this period the rivers hydrological behavior was characterized by shallow perennial flow and limited development of organic and stagnant marshes within an otherwise regional arid context pi in addition to water availability other factors may have favored settlement in the area such as a preference for shrub land archaeological evidence suggests a change in human activities at the quebrada seca 3 site between ca 5600 and 4900 cal yr bp during this period we see evidence for multiple intrasite spaceresidential base activities as well as symbolic and ritual practices figure 10 at approximately 4900 cal yr bp the site seems to have been abandoned and living areas were covered by sediments aschero 1988 toward the end of this period as quebrada seca 3 is abandoned there is evidence of new settlements along the middle reaches of the las pitas river namely cueva salamanca 1 and punta de la pea 4 these two sites also present evidence of settlement dating back to 7000 cal yr bp and 10000 cal yr bp respectively hocsman 2002 mondini et al 2013 pintar 2014 we believe that local huntergatherers organized their settlementsubsistence and mobility systems within the rich mosaic of this environmental framework toward ca 4600 cal yr bp a new change in settlement patterns is noted for the las pitas river coinciding with the more humid pii environmental phase this change occurs at a time of increased spatial variability in moisture in a regional context during which the environmental conditions along the miriguaca river remain typical of pi figures 9 and 10 it is possible that greater effective moisture along the las pitas river provided for a more intensive and expansive use of the hydrological basin figure 10 not only are a larger number of possibly contemporaneous sites recorded for this period but they are also associated to specific insite activities such as residential bases ritual practices including the intentional disposition of objectsburials and sites for other activities this greater number and diversity of sites include punta de la pea 4 punta de la pea 11a peas chicas 11 peas chicas 13 peas chicas 15 peas de las trampas 11 hocsman 2006 aschero  hocsman 2011 moreover the first evidence for an openair residential settlement for this period can be seen in the peas chicas 16 site located along the las pitas river dating to ca 3900 cal yr bp aschero  hocsman 2011 in contrast surveys conducted in the miriguaca river basin have not reported the presence of early huntergatherer occupations to date escola et al 2013 escola et al 2015 the earliest evidence for human occupation in this basin postdates 3800 cal yr bp and occurs at the site of alero sin cabeza a residential base located in a rock shelter and defined by semipermanent occupations with strategies of space use similar to that of las pitas river escola aguirre  hocsman 2013 escola et al 2013 alero sin cabeza dates to the end of pi for the miriguaca river where ecological conditions were characterized by discontinuous riparian zone development figures 8 and 9 more humid conditions and perennial streamflow occur later ca 30002700 cal yr bp that may have facilitated more intensive use of the flood plain including food production after ca 2000 cal yr bp escola et al 2013 escola et al 2015 it should be noted that hydrological fluctuations for this river during pi would have influenced occupations prior to 3800 cal yr bp apart from differences in use of space across both river basins a social circumscription process has been postulated for the region during the period between 3800 and 3000 cal yr bp associated with a more strict demarcation of territories aschero 2010 this circumscription coincided with the prevailing extremely arid conditions predominant at the regional puna level these conditions would have created environmental barriers to huntergatherer mobility hocsman 2006 aschero  hocsman 2011 furthermore during this period preexisting local environmental factors such as the differential availability of wetlands between river basins would also have played an important role in human settlement within antofagasta de la sierra for example the las pitas river had different reaches with favorable environmental conditions for food procurement this ecological situation supports our proposal that the river reaches with more wetlands may have been favored by huntergatherers an interpretation that is supported by the human occupation strategies recorded in archaeological sites along the river during this period the reduction of residential mobility develops as part of an overall process of sedentism aschero  hocsman 2011 however the increasing settlement stability in the landscape within our study area did not necessarily lead to a reduction or cessation of regionalmacroregional mobility given recurrent evidence for movement of exotic materials and certain raw materials from distant regions throughout the archaeological record of these sites hoscman 2006 escola aguirre  hocsman 2013 in the las pitas river there were longlived settlements possibly associated with quinoa aff c quinoa cultivation archaeological evidence for harvesting of this domesticated pseudocereal occurs at peas chicas 13 babot 2011 the presence of stalks of this crop in the residential base may be interpreted as a local experimentationdomestication process or alternatively as the incorporation of an already consolidated practice aguirre 2007 aschero  hocsman 2011 babot 2011 several microthermal cultigens such as tubers babot 2011 are also present probably more humid conditions with a sustained baseflow and peat formation associated with pii for the las pitas river would have generated the appropriate background to conduct initial experiments or introduce cultigens into the study area at this early period consequently it is possible that it represents the beginning of local horticultural practices by huntergatherers in their process toward full food production aschero  hocsman 2011 modifications in the relationship between huntergatherers and faunal resources through time have also been noted in the area this is evident for both the las pitas river at ca 4200 cal yr bp and the miriguaca river at ca 3800 cal yr bp where osteometric changes indicate the presence of a transitional morphotype between wild guanacos and herded llamas aschero izeta  hocsman 2014 grant lettbrown 2014 such changes would have resulted from the implementation of a new strategy for protecting the herd leading to a gradual domestication process grant lettbrown 2014 pastoralism would have developed in areas with hydrological resources including wetlands within a regional context of generalized aridity consequently huntergatherers close interrelation with the environment is not only defined in terms of their search for and exploitation of available wetlands rather they should also be seen as active agents in their environment generating changes and impacting their surroundings at the same time for instance through the domestication of plants and animals grana 2013 all in all there would have been a permanent interrelationship between huntergatherer societies and the environment generating important changes in socioeconomic dynamics and the emergence of agropastoral societies our research supports the hypothesis that human settlement in the puna was closely related to environmental and hydrological changes during the middletolate holocene through analysis of las pitas and miriguaca alluvial stratigraphy including diatom assemblages we infer that landscape elements such as topography hydrogeology and geomorphology have conditioned the effects of broadscale climate change on local environments minimizing the impact of aridity during the middle holocene for example the high altitude catchment of the las pitas river basin collected more water from seasonal orographic precipitation during middletolate holocene minor humid pulses resulting in more springs and larger wetlands than along the miriguaca river the higher elevation catchment facilitated the development of a more stable flow regime indicated by the presence of more fa3 and fa4 sedimentary facies along the lower las pitas river differences in the paleohydrological behavior of these rivers in relation to the occupations and functionality of local archaeological sites suggest that the las pitas and miriguaca hydrological basins played different roles in the huntergatherer occupation of the area hydrological differences produced differential concentrations of resources between the basins related to primary productivity and water availability both during the arid conditions of phase i and in the diachronic development of the more humid phase ii this likely led to a territorial demarcation at the familial group or lineage level in and between rivers as evidenced in the access to specific lithic resources and in the characteristics of both art and projectile point design that follow distinctive stylesfeatures specific to certain areas along both rivers aschero  hocsman 2011 the differential availability of water associated with andean wetlands within our study area favored the systematic occupation of certain spaces in the longterm these spaces may have functioned as a catalyst for landuse intensification processes stimulating sedentism hence hydrological variability facilitated the development of new sociocultural contexts in this case animalplant domestication and the development of increasing social complexity this social complexity set the basis for later agropastoral societies in this area of the southeastern atacama puna these results highlight the importance of interdisciplinary studies in defining environmental changes at localregional scales sensu dincauze 2000 that in turn help us to better understand the complex interrelation between environment and humans in desert areas  hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the united states marilyn fabbri melanie maslow j   an outbreak of an acute febrile illness characterized by respiratory failure hypotension and shock was reported by physicians in the four corners region of the united states in may 1993 a previously unknown hantavirus was subsequently identified as the cause 1  unlike the previously characterized hantaviruses which cause fever hemorrhagic manifestations and acute renal failure hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome the newly named hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps presented with a brief prodromal illness followed by rapidly progressive noncardiogenic pulmonary edema 2  the earliest known case of hps to be confirmed by serology occurred in utah in 1959 3  the mortality rate associated with hps is 40 to 60 although mild and even asymptomatic cases are now recognized in the united states hps is caused by at least four hantaviruses the sin nombre virus snv responsible for the four corners outbreak the black creek canal virus isolated from the florida cotton rat 4  the bayou virus in louisiana 5  and the new york 1 hantavirus 6  several other closely related viruses have been identified in canada and south america an estimated 1000 to 2000 cases of hantaviral infections occur each year worldwide hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a febrile illness characterized by bilateral diffuse interstitial edema on chest radiography in a previously healthy person respiratory compromise develops within 72 hours of hospitalization the syndrome should be suspected in cases of unexplained fatal respiratory illness in which autopsy examination shows noncardiogenic pulmonary edema without an identifiable cause clinical suspicion is confirmed with serology detection of hantaviralspecific rna by polymerase chain reaction or detection of hantaviral antigen by immunohistochemical testing of clinical specimens table 1  hantaviruses are lipid-enveloped tri-segmented negativesense rna viruses belonging to the bunyavirus family the genus hantavirus was named for the first virus isolated in 1976 from a striped field mouse near the hantaan river in south korea unlike other members of the bunyavirus family that are transmitted to humans by arthropod vectors hantaviruses are transmitted via inhalation of viruscontaminated aerosols of rodent saliva urine and feces the hantavirus genome consists of three segments the large l segment encodes a protein with replicase transcriptase and endonuclease activity the medium m segment encodes a precursor protein that is processed to form the surface glycoproteins g1 and g2 one or both of which play a role in viral neutralization fusion of infected cells and hemagglutination the small s segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein which forms the filamentous helical nucleocapsid of this virus and elicits the humoral immune response hantaviruses have been characterized by genetic and antigenic methods point mutations appear to account for most of the genetic drift among hantaviruses 7  rna viruses with segmented genomes such as influenza virus since the first outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps in 1993 understanding of the vast distribution and potential impact of hantaviruses has grown at least 277 cases of hps have been documented in the united states the full clinical spectrum has yet to be elucidated and one outbreak suggested the possibility of person-to-person transmission new research has identified the -3 integrins as cellular receptors for hantaviruses and has determined the pivotal role of the immune system in pathogenesis rapid diagnosis has been facilitated by a new immunoblot assay to detect sin nombre virus infection treatment remains primarily supportive however a placebocontrolled trial of ribavirin is ongoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be a potential therapy in severe cases inhaled nitric oxide needs further study vaccines developed against hantaviruses associated with hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome might be effective against hps-associated strains can reassort their rna segments when dual infection of a target cell occurs genetic reassortment has been demonstrated in nature and in vitro for bunyaviridae that cause arthropod-borne disease but little information is available about hps-associated strains two previous studies analyzing genomic snv rna sequences from humans and rodents suggest that the rna segment has been reassorted in nature between snv genetic variants 8 9  rodriquez et al 10 analyzed progeny virus from co-cultures of closely related snv strains with identical rodent hosts and of snv and black creek canal virus which have different rodent hosts reassortants were observed frequently between closely related strains but were rare between hantaviruses with different rodent hosts these data suggest that genetic reassortment in nature may contribute to the emergence of new hantaviruses hantaviruses are subdivided into genogroups on the basis of nucleotide sequence analysis of s and m segments each genogroup usually infects a single rodent species the new world hantaviruses are more closely interrelated than the old world viruses and vice versa the hps-associated hantaviruses belong to the new world group these include sin nombre bayou black creek canal new york and andes viruses  table 2  the old world group includes hantaan dobrava seoul and puumala viruses which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs each hantavirus is maintained in nature by asymptomatic infection of a single rodent species hantaviral infection has been documented in cats birds and bats but these hosts play no documented role in human transmission 11  rodents shed infectious virus in saliva urine and feces for prolonged periods despite the presence of neutralizing antibody 12  rodents are infected horizontally through biting and scratching other rodents as reflected in a higher prevalence of infection in older male mice 13  phylogenetic relationships between virus and rodent host demonstrate a co-evolution over thousands of years studies in which hantaviral gene sequences are compared to rodent mitochondrial gene sequences allow nearly identical phylogenetic trees to be constructed 14  several hantaviruses can be found in one geographic area each circulating within its specific rodent host human transmission usually occurs after inhalation of aerosols of infected rodent excreta the virus may also be transmitted after rodent bites after inoculation of infected rodent excreta through skin lesions or eyes and possibly through ingestion of contaminated food or water 15  the incubation period ranges from 4 to 42 days mean range 12 to 16 days the risk for human disease is proportional to the frequency of exposure to infected rodents rodent populations may vary seasonally and can increase tenfold in 2 months navajo oral tradition recognized outbreaks of a disease similar to hps when large rodent populations were present 16  in the fall of 1992 heavy precipitation in a previously drought-stricken area expanded the deer mouse population tenfold by the time of the may 1993 outbreak 17  vertical transmission of hantaviruses in pregnant women with hps has not been demonstrated in a recent review of five cases of hps in pregnancy 18  there was no pathologic or immunohistochemical evidence of hps in placental and fetal tissue from two in utero deaths or serologic evidence of hantaviral infection in the two live births this review identified one potential case of perinatal transmission of hfrs from korea no evidence suggests transmission via breast feeding in humans or animal models the issue of person-to-person transmission is controversial in a study of 266 health care workers exposed to patients to patients body fluids or to laboratory specimens during the 1993 outbreak serologic testing done within 6 weeks of exposure found no evidence of infection 19  serosurveys performed on household contacts of patients with hps revealed no igm antibody reactive with snv 20  person-to-person transmission may have occurred during an outbreak of hps caused by the andes virus in el bolson argentina in 1996 polymerase chain reaction products of partial sequences of m and s viral rna segments were studied from clinical samples to assess homology samples from 16 epidemiologically linked cases from this outbreak were fig 1 and in canada and south america the overall us mortality rate is 38 compared with 52 in the first 100 us cases 3  table 3  the mean patient age is 38 years men make up 59 of the total cases caucasians account for 77 of cases and native americans for 20 three quarters of the cases come from rural areas children represent few cases of hps in the united states but account for a larger proportion of cases in south america 23  after the 1993 four corners outbreak a serosurvey was done to identify milder unreported cases outpatients presenting with a syndrome of fevers and myalgias resembling the hps prodrome were surveyed no patient had igm antibody reactive with snv 24  recently however five cases of acute snv infection documented by serology were identified with a clinical illness less severe than hps 25  several mild and even asymptomatic cases of hps have also been reported in south america 23  risk factors for hps identified from a case-control study during the 1993 outbreak included peridomestic cleaning or agricultural activities more rodents were trapped around the homes of case patients than the homes of controls 20  the clinical manifestations of hps can be divided into prodromal cardiopulmonary and convalescent phases fig  2  in the prodromal stage which usually lasts 3 to 6 days the most frequent symptoms are fever chills and myalgias abdominal pain nausea vomiting headache and dizziness may occur respiratory symptoms are often absent sore throat coryza and meningismus are uncommon and their presence may be useful in differentiating hps from other viral infections physical examination laboratory data and chest radiographs may be normal in this stage the cardiopulmonary stage heralded by cough and dyspnea can progress rapidly pulmonary edema and respiratory failure may develop within hours of presentation physical examination is notable for tachypnea tachycardia and hypotension chest radiographs usually show interstitial edema and basilar or central air space disease these findings contrast with those for acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in which interstitial edema is rare and air space disease is usually peripherally distributed early in the course hemodynamic measures are characterized by low initial pulmonary artery occlusion pressure high systemic vascular resistance and depressed cardiac output consistent with a noncardiac cause of pulmonary edema 26  pleural effusions may occur in up to 78 of patients 27  the pleural fluid is initially transudative but may become exudative during recovery because fluid shifts as cardiac function normalizes severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction appears to predict a poor prognosis in fatal cases the cardiac index progressively decreases with severe oxygen debt and elevated lactate levels survivors can be extubated as early as 24 to 48 hours but extubation generally takes place between 4 and 6 days the classic laboratory findings in hps are hemoconcentration and thrombocytopenia other laboratory findings are leukocytosis with a left shift and atypical lymphocytosis elevated coagulation indices disseminated intravascular coagulation is uncommon and elevated aminotransferase levels serum creatinine levels can be elevated  25 mgdl in severe cases but frank renal failure is uncommon metabolic acidosis with lactic acidemia can be seen in severe cases moolenaar et al 28 compared the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with hps with those of patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia influenza and unexplained ards the presence on hospital admission of dizziness nausea or vomiting and absence of cough in association with thrombocytopenia hemoconcentration and acidosis identified all patients with hps and excluded hps in at least 80 of patients with unexplained ards the convalescent phase of hps is marked by diuresis with improvement in oxygenation and decrease in hematocrit complete recovery can be rapid even in patients on maximum ventilatory and inotropic support cognitive impairments especially involving memory have been described in two hps survivors 1 year after recovery 29  it is unclear however whether this is a consequence of anoxic brain damage or viral-induced brain injury terajima et al 30 used a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for snv to analyze samples from 26 patients with hps twenty of the initial 26 samples were positive for viral rna the mean virus copy number in positive cases was 10 6114 ml fatal cases had one log 10 higher mean rna copy number compared with survivors the viral rna copy number correlated with the peak hematocrit value and lowest platelet count viremia decreased promptly after resolution of fever in eight survivors studied show some clinical variations in black creek canal bayou and andes viruses renal insufficiency and elevated creatinine kinase levels were more frequent 31  in andes virus infection bleeding manifestations and petechiae were also reported 23  cases of acute seropositive snv infection that do not fit diagnostic criteria for hps have been reported 25  these patients presented with classic prodromal symptoms but did not progress to severe pulmonary involvement several of the laboratory findings associated with hps including thrombocytopenia atypical lymphocytosis and elevated aminotransferase levels were seen possible explanations for the milder clinical illness include a weaker immune response to the virus altered receptors and virologic factors the differential diagnosis of hps depends on the clinical stage of infection the prodromal phase is indistinguishable from many other viral infections once infection progresses to the cardiopulmonary stage the differential diagnosis includes leptospirosis legionellosis chlamydial infection mycoplasma infection meningococcemia influenza q fever pneumonic plague tularemia and disseminated fungal infections the diagnosis of hps is confirmed in a clinically compatible illness with serology or detection of hantaviral antigen in tissue by immunohistochemical or polymerase chain reaction hantavirus can be cultured but this is time consuming and requires at least category iii containment facilities serology detects igm and igg antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant nucleocapsid proteins of different hantaviruses serum samples from acute and convalescent phases in patients 33  among snv-specific igg antibodies reported in one study 34  the most prevalent were igg3 97 igg1 70 igg2 30 and igg4 3 it is postulated that the cytokines produced in snv infection may preferentially stimulate production of igg3 subclass antibody in this study antibody titers were similar in patients who died and those who survived igg antibody persists for years reinfection with homologous hantaviruses is not known to occur in humans the major difficulty with serologic diagnosis is the delay in obtaining results a rapid antibody test for snv in the form of a strip immunoblot assay has been developed this test takes about 5 hours to complete the assay incorporates antigens derived from synthetic peptide and recombinantexpressed forms of snv glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein as well as recombinant-expressed seoul virus nucleocapsid protein in studies this assay identified all patients with acute snv infection from the earliest clinical samples with no false-positive results in controls 33  gross pathologic examination of the lungs from patients with hps shows edema and large serous pleural effusions microscopic examination reveals intra-alveolar edema and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates minimal hyaline membrane formation and rare neutrophils help distinguish hps from ards a viral cytopathic effect is notably absent 17  immunohistochemical analysis has demonstrated viral antigen distributed in the capillary endothelium of multiple organs most markedly in the pulmonary vasculature 35  the pulmonary endothelial cells and pneumocytes show no evidence of direct viral injury which may account for the rapid recovery observed in survivors the increased pulmonary capillary permeability with structurally intact cells and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates suggests a pathogenic role for the immune system activated t cells primarily cd8  cells are prominent in lung lesions and blood it is postulated that t cells recognize and act on the heavily infected pulmonary cells resulting in the secretion of inflammatory mediators such as interferon- and tumor necrosis factor these lymphokines may mediate the reversible increase in vascular permeability resulting in pulmonary edema 31  mori et al 36 demonstrated specific localization of cytokine-producing cells in the lungs of patients with hps paralleling the distribution of hantaviral antigens testing detected cells that produced both monocyte-derived cytokines including interleukin-1 interleukin-1 interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor- and lymphocyte-derived cytokines including interferon- interleukin-2 interleukin-4 and tumor necrosis factor- cytokine production by both activated t lymphocytes and monocytes probably contributes to the pathogenesis of the capillary leak syndrome in hps and the renal failure observed with hfrs the cellular receptor for pathogenic hantaviruses has recently been identified as the -3 integrins 37 integrins help regulate vascular permeability and platelet function specific integrins expressed on platelets and endothelial cells permit entry of hps-associated hantaviruses the hantavirus-integrin interaction by altering normal endothelial cell barrier functions may be responsible for the abnormal vascular permeability associated with hps in tissue culture the entry of hps-associated hantavirus into cells was partially blocked by antibodies to the integrins suggesting a possible future therapeutic intervention 37  variation in receptor molecules is one explanation for the spectrum of illness observed with hps 25  others include specific viral differences inoculum differences and host factors such as hla haplotype 38  immunologic responses mediating viral clearance and recovery from hps may also be important in one study of patients with hps of varying clinical severity neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission were lower in patients with severe disease requiring intubation than in patients with mild disease suggesting a role for immunotherapy 39  in animal models passive administration of immunoglobulin after exposure protected against infection but no human trials have been performed 15  the prodrome of hps is indistinguishable from other viral infections serologic testing is usually not performed until respiratory symptoms develop at which point progression to death can be rapid treatment remains primarily supportive including attention to proper fluid administration and cardiopulmonary support antimicrobial therapy is often initiated for other potentially treatable diseases in the differential diagnosis an open-label trial of ribavirin for suspected hps was conducted between june 1993 and september 1 1994 ribavirin was selected on the basis of a prospective double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of ribavirin for hfrs in china 40  this study suggested that mortality was lower if the drug was administered within 4 days of diagnosis 40  the investigators also reported that the drug had an acceptable safety profile and they showed in vitro susceptibility to ribavirin the study enrolled 140 patients hantavirus infection was confirmed in 30 patients and the mortality rate was 47 the investigators could not assess the efficacy of intravenous ribavirin but comparison of the 30 study patients who had hps with 34 untreated patients with hps who were not enrolled in the study showed no difference in survival between the groups anemia developed in 71 of patients 19 of whom had transfusion in 1995 a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of ribavirin sponsored by the national institutes of health was initiated to evaluate efficacy in hps patients with suspected hps in the prodromal as well as cardiopulmonary stages are eligible 15 40  the observation that severe cardiopulmonary failure in hps is reversible led to treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo 41  the characteristic rapid recovery in the convalescent stage would only require a short duration of ecmo which has its own related complications inclusion criteria for ecmo therapy were risk factors that have been shown to be associated with a 100 predicted mortality rate in a series of hps-related deaths including a cardiac index less than 25 lminmm lactate level greater than 4 mmoll ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia pulseless electrical activity or refractory shock patients with irreversible neurologic or multiorgan failure or those on prolonged ventilation were generally excluded between 1994 and 1995 ecmo successfully provided support in two patients with hps a third eligible patient developed ventricular fibrillation before transfer to the ecmo unit and died the hemodynamic improvement in the two survivors was dramatic in the first 12 hours of ecmo both patients were weaned off the ventilator within 4 to 5 days early transfer of patients with hps to a center offering ecmo should be considered a 16-year-old boy with hps was successfully treated with inhaled nitric oxide 42  oxygenation in this patient rapidly improved and the boy was extubated 43 hours after initiation of therapy nitric oxide is a potent vascular relaxant local administration delivers it directly to the pulmonary vascular epithelium leading to reduced pulmonary artery pressure this may be the mechanism that improves pulmonary edema although it is difficult to reach any conclusions about efficacy of nitric oxide on the basis of a single case report this may be a modality for future study limiting exposure to rodents and excreta is the most effective way to decrease the risk of hps elimination of food sources and nesting sites for rodents is crucial rodenticides are useful but fleas should be eliminated first in plague-endemic regions areas where rodent infestation is suspected should be well ventilated before humans enter brooms or vacuums should be avoided to prevent aerosolization of potentially infected rodent excreta the centers for disease control and prevention has published detailed recommendations for the prevention of hps 43  vaccines for hantavirus infections have been developed against strains associated with the hfrs form of disease an inactivated hantaan virus vaccine is licensed for use in korea in one study 75 of patients receiving this vaccine produced neutralizing antibody after the first booster dose however the humoral response was short-lived 44  hantaviral g1 g2 and nucleocapsid proteins are known to be immunogenic this finding has prompted interest in developing recombinant vaccines using baculovirus and vaccinia-expressed glycoproteins in rodents these vaccines could elicit neutralizing antibody responses and protect against hantaan virus infection 45 46 47  additional studies using recombinant dna vaccines in animal models have shown similar success in rodent studies use of either seoul virus m or s genome segments in dna vaccines elicited seoul-specific neutralizing antibody responses however only m segment vaccination protected rodents from infection 48  dna vaccines against hantaviruses that cause hps are being developed 7  the discovery of hps in 1993 was followed by a rapid accumulation of information within weeks of recognition of this syndrome the etiologic agent and its reservoir in nature were identified and a trial of a potential therapeutic agent was initiated new viruses continue to be discovered in both humans and rodents throughout the americas and milder forms of disease are now recognized with the discovery of new viruses questions continue to arise about the spectrum of clinical illness routes of transmission the role of the immune system in pathogenesis and future treatment papers of particular interest published recently have been highlighted as  of importance  of major importance  biodefense and special pathogen vaccines phillip pittman r stanley plotkin a stanley plotkin a walter orenstein a paul offit a kathryn edwards m   the two vee vaccines available for human use as inds vaccinesthe live attenuated product tc-83 and a formalin-inactivated product c-84both derive from the same lineage the live attenuated tc-83 virus a subtype i-ab strain was isolated from a donkey brain in trinidad and was passaged 13 times in embryonated eggs15 the virus was attenuated by 78 passages in fetal guinea pig heart fgph cell cultures plaque-picked in chick embryo fibroblasts cefs and passaged four additional times in fgph cell cultures16 the vee tc-83 virus designation is a direct reference to the 83 passages in cell culture vee c-84 vaccine is formalin-inactivated and is made from the tc-83 production seed tc-82 that has undergone one additional passage in cefs17 this c-84 production seed is passaged once more in cefs to derive the c-84 vaccine which is inactivated with 01 formalin and then freeze-dried the inactivation procedure is based on that used by salk and colleagues18 to inactivate the poliovirus tc-83 and c-84 contain streptomycin and neomycin each at a concentration of 50 gml laboratory infections with epizootic veev strains closely related to the parent strain have essentially been eliminated since the introduction of these vaccines and improvement in personal protective equipment at usamriid immunologically nave people at risk for exposure to vee receive a single dose of the live attenuated tc-83 vaccine those who seroconvert prnt80 titer 1  20 receive a single booster of c-84 as needed based on their titer prnt80 1  20 nonresponders to tc-83 receive a booster with c-84 the response rate to tc-83 alone is 824 when tc-83 is followed by a single boost with c-84 a combined response rate of well over 90 is observed female responders to tc-83 tend to have titers similar to those of male responders but the frequency of nonresponders tends to be higher among women than men in one study the initial response rate among recipients of a single dose of tc-83 was 74 and 85 respectively for women and men the nature of this sex difference is not understood approximately 23 of persons receiving the live attenuated tc-83 sustain adverse reactions including headache sore throat malaise fatigue myalgias arthralgias chills and fevera suite of symptoms similar to those seen following natural veev infection but less severe4 the local reaction rate is less than 5 the inactivated vaccine c-84 has a local reaction rate of approximately 5 but essentially no systemic reactions are associated with its administration diabetes mellitus abortion and teratogenesis have been associatedepidemiologically andor in animal studieswith natural wild-type veev infection19 20 21 before pregnancy testing prior to vaccination became available three cases of spontaneous abortion or stillbirth were temporally related to the administration of tc-8322 however veev was not recovered from culture of tissues in either case though they were reported to fda these cases were never published as case reports since the advent of pregnancy testing great care has been used to ensure that women are not pregnant before administration of tc-83 out of an abundance of caution persons with a family history of diabetes mellitus are considered ineligible for vaccination with tc-83 despite the lack of evidence for a causal association between diabetes mellitus and veev infection or vaccination with tc-83 the ideal vee vaccine would have a high seroconversion rate 95 and a low reaction rate 5 by these standards tc-83 is reactogenic and has a moderate response rate as measured by neutralizing antibody in addition tc-83 does not protect adequately against distantly related veev subtype i-ab variants or the other enzootic veev subtypes ii through vi finally the manufacturing process for tc-83 requires the manipulation of infectious viral particles in a biosafety level 3 containment laboratory10
 a new-generation live attenuated vaccine candidate v3526 uses twin site-directed mutagenesis of the full-length complementary dna clone of the virulent virus rna23 v3526 has two deletion mutationsa lethal deletion at the pe-2 cleavage signal site and a suppressor mutation at site 253 of the e1 glycoproteinthat should prevent reversion to wild-type veev this vaccine candidate also has limited potential for transmission by mosquitoes and elicits cross-protection against different viral strains10 after showing promise in preclinical studies24 v3526 elicited the development of impressive neutralizing antibody levels in human volunteers during phase i clinical trials however the vaccine was associated with a high frequency of fever and other flu-like symptoms thus further development was discontinued25 26
 because of the long history of frequent adverse reactions related to live attenuated vee vaccines the manufacturer decided to inactivate v3526 and further develop it as an inactivated vaccine to be used as a priming vaccine that would replace c-84 testing has shown reduced infectivity by both formalin inactivation fv3526 and gamma-irradiation gv3526 for example both inactivated vaccine candidates showed a loss of neurovirulence after intracerebral inoculation of suckling balbc mice suggesting that the vaccines were completely inactivated both fv3526 and gv3526 elicited robust immune responses furthermore protection was demonstrated by both vaccine candidates against subcutaneous challenge with veev i-ab trinidad donkey strain following two doses of either vaccine recently researchers have been testing these vaccine candidates using various adjuvants and routes of administration against subcutaneous and aerosol challenge24 27 28
 in addition to fv3526 and gv3526 other technologies are being evaluated for the production of vaccines against vee for example sharma and colleagues29 found that the hydrophobic alkylating compound 15-iodonaphthylazide can effectively inactivate virulent veev strain v3000 the resulting inactivated vaccine candidate was efficacious in protecting mice from virulent veev challenge and its efficacy was enhanced by the use of adjuvants rossi and colleagues30 31 developed a live attenuated vaccine using an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site iresa construct that inhibits translation of viral proteins in mosquito cells thus preventing transmission by the natural veev vector this ires-based vee vaccine fully protected mice and macaques from clinical disease after aerosol challenge with virulent veev dna vaccines are also under development and in protective efficacy studies have shown promise in both mice and guinea pigs32 one dna vaccine candidate has also demonstrated protection against aerosol challenge with wild-type veev in nonhuman primates33 34 a candidate based on a novel approach to dna vaccine development infectious dna idna was protective in one balbc mouse challenge study35
 an inactivated wee vaccine tsi-gsd 210 has been used at fort detrick since the 1970s to immunize at-risk laboratory personnel the wee vaccine is a lyophilized product derived from supernatant fluids of primary cef cell cultures infected with the attenuated cm4884 strain of weev36 37 the supernatant fluid is harvested and filtered the virus is inactivated with formalin and the final product is lyophilized for storage at 20c the vaccine contains 50 gml of neomycin the primary end point used to measure immunogenicity of the wee vaccine is the prnt80 with a titer of at least 1  40 considered indicative of a response in an analysis of data from 363 volunteers who received 05 ml of inactivated tsi-gsd 210 vaccine subcutaneously at days 0 7 and 28 151 subjects 416 responded with a prnt80 titer of 1  40 or greater whereas 212 subjects 584 failed to achieve this neutralizing antibody titer of 115 initial nonresponders 76 661 converted to responder status after a single booster kaplanmeier plots showed that a regimen consisting of three initial doses and one booster induced a prnt80 titer of at least 1  40 lasting 16 years in 50 of initial responders local and systemic adverse events are uncommon with this vaccine among 363 vaccinees receiving three initial injections of the wee vaccine only 5 reported local or systemic reactions pr pittman ph gibbs and tl cannon unpublished data no instances of occupational wee have been documented among laboratory workers who develop neutralizing antibodies following vaccination wee vaccine continues to be administered as part of phase ii clinical trials however no efficacy trial has been conducted a new lot of the wee vaccine western equine encephalitis vaccine inactivated tsi-gsd 210 lot 3-1-92 was found to be safe and immunogenic in a recent phase i clinical trial dr robert rivard usamriid personal communication 2015 in this study wee vaccine was administered in 05-ml doses subcutaneously in the upper outer aspect of the triceps in a three-dose primary series days 0 7 and 28 with a mandatory boost day 180 all 10 subjects were classified as responders at day 56 for 4 of 10 subjects the titers had waned below the acceptable level by month 6 following the month 6 boost all 10 subjects developed titers above 1  40 and all remained above this level for at least 1 year dna-based vaccines against wee have shown promise in challenge models in mice one such study evaluated a dna vaccine pvhx-6 expressing the 26 s structural gene of weev strain 71 v-1658 all mice receiving four intraepidermal doses of pvhx-6 survived challenge with a homologous strain but only 62 and 50 survived challenge with fleming and cba87 strains respectively38 other studies have demonstrated in a murine model the efficacy of dna vaccines expressing the capsid and envelope proteins of weev in challenge models in two studies a replication-defective human adenovirus serotype-5 had5 was used as a vector for vaccine delivery in the first study a had5 vector encoding e2 and e1 administered as a single dose conferred protection against challenge with homologous and heterologous weev strains39 40 in the second study a had5 vector encoding e1 alone designated adenovirus ad serotype-5-e1 ad5-e1 provided total protection against homologous and heterologous strains of weev in mice41 a potential drawback of this approach in humans is the widespread prevalence of antibodies against adenovirus the eee vaccine tsi-gsd 104 is a lyophilized product originating in primary cef cell cultures infected with the attenuated pe-6 strain of eeev the seed for the eee vaccine is passaged twice in adult mice and twice in guinea pigs then passaged nine times in embryonated eggs followed by three passages in cefs42 the supernatant fluid which is harvested and filtered contains 50 g each of neomycin and streptomycin and 025 wv weight per volume of human serum albumin usp us pharmacopoeia the virus is then inactivated with 005 formalin when inactivation is completed the residual formalin is neutralized by treatment with sodium bisulfite the final product is lyophilized for storage at 20c among 255 volunteers who received the two-dose primary series of eee vaccine administered subcutaneously between 1992 and 1998 197 773 responded with a prnt80 titer of 1  40 or greater of initial nonresponders 66 subsequently seroconverted following receipt of an eee vaccine booster which is administered intradermally among initial responders whose titers waned over time 986 responded to a booster dose of eee vaccine local and systemic side effects are infrequent occurring in less than 1 of vaccinees after the primary vaccine series and in 37 after the first booster kaplanmeier plots show that two primary doses and one intradermal booster of tsi-gsd 104 provide satisfactory neutralizing anti-eeev antibodies in 50 of initial responders for up to 22 years43
 among recent findings regarding next-generation eee vaccines a single subcutaneous dose of an eee vaccine candidate attenuated via an ires protected 100 of vaccinated mice against intraperitoneal challenge44 in addition an eeev replicon and a combined veevweeveeev replicon protected macaques from aerosol challenge11
 chikv can cause an acute viral syndrome in humans characterized by fever rash and arthritis45 some people especially those who are human leukocyte antigen hla-b27positive may develop long-term joint involvement46 although documented epidemics have occurred since the late 18th century the virus was first isolated during the 19521953 tanzanian epidemic47 during 20042006 an epidemic ravaged the indian ocean islands east of madagascarla runion mauritiusseychelles and mayotte48 more than 2 million people have been affected since the start of the epidemic which has since spread to the caribbean and india with cases also occurring in persons from the united states europe and elsewhere who traveled to the caribbean49 50 51 52 in december 2014 kendrick and colleagues53 reported on the first 11 cases of chik originating in the united states florida genomic sequencing of six isolates from the indian ocean outbreak suggests that the strain responsible for the outbreak is related to east african isolates49 in addition evidence from the sequence data suggests that the chikv strain responsible for the indian ocean outbreak evolved during the course of the outbreak into several distinct variants one mutation may have allowed the chikv to be efficiently transmitted by the most abundant mosquito species on la runion aedes albopictus this may help explain the noted robustness of the epidemic49 52 54
 several attempts were made with variable success to develop an efficacious inactivated vaccine using chick embryo cell cultures suckling mouse brain and african green monkey kidney55 a live attenuated vaccine was made from the seed of the african green monkey kidney vaccine using chikv strain 15561 which had originally been isolated from an infected patient during a 1962 chik epidemic in thailand55 56 the 11th african green monkey kidney passage of chikv strain 15561 made at the walter reed army institute of research was transferred to usamriid and passaged in medical research council mrc5 cells after 18 passages in mrc-5 cells chikv 181clone 25 was selected as a vaccine seed strain based on biomarkers chikv 181clone 25 was efficacious in challenge models in suckling mice and in nonhuman primates55
 a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the chik 181clone 25 vaccine documented a seroconversion rate of 98 among alphavirus-nave volunteers56 one year after immunization 85 of vaccinees remained seropositive injection site and systemic symptoms including flu-like symptoms were similar in vaccine and placebo recipients however the vaccine was temporally associated with arthralgia in 8 of vaccinees one volunteer in the vaccine group developed a pruritic eczema-like rash at the injection site interference between the chik 181clone 25 vaccine and the live attenuated vee tc-83 vaccine is discussed above this live attenuated chik vaccine requires additional phase ii and phase iii clinical testing current epidemics in the caribbean indian ocean and india offer unique prospects for phase iii clinical testing of this vaccine additional strategies for the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine for chik are being pursued these include chimeric alphavirus vaccine candidates using veev attenuated vaccine strain tc-83 a naturally attenuated strain of eeev or sindbis virus as a backbone with the structural protein genes of chikv wang and colleagues57 found that each of these chimeras produced robust neutralizing antibody responses and vaccinated mice were fully protected against disease and viremia after chikv challenge one dna vaccine candidate expressing a component of the chikv envelope glycoprotein produced neutralizing antibodies in mice and macaques58 a second dna vaccine candidate uses a plasmid coding for the chikv-capsid e1 and e2 when injected into mice this construct induced broad cellular immunity and produced antibodies detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa that recognized native antigen59 another group is evaluating a formalin-inactivated vero celladapted vaccine candidate prepared using a strain from the india epidemic60 most recently a promising virus-like particle vlp vaccine containing the viral envelope has elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies in nonhuman primates and in human volunteers61 62 63 in addition a single immunization with a measles virusvectored chik vaccine candidate induced high chikv antibody titers and protected mice from a lethal chikv challenge64
 rrvd or epidemic polyarthritis was first recognized in australia in 1928 ross river virus rrv its causative agent was first isolated in 1963 from a pool of mosquitoes65 66 67 rrvd is essentially limited to australia fiji and the surrounding islands including american samoa and the cook islands where several thousand cases occur per year68 69 in humans polyarthritis may be followed by fever rash and lethargy symptoms generally resolve after 3 to 6 months69 70 in 1997 us marines participating in operation tandem thrust in queensland australia had an infection rate of 15 rrvd developed in nine individuals71
 a vaccine candidate was derived from a virus isolated from a human case of classical rrvd using the c6-36 cell line a albopictus72 the candidate underwent four serial passages in mrc-5 human fetal lung cells followed by two passages in vero cells cell cultures contained penicillin 100 uml and streptomycin 100 gml the virus was inactivated using binary ethyleneimine in mice the vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies and conferred protection against viremia after intravenous challenge with live rrv73
 more recently a vero cellgrown formalin-inactivated benzonase-digested to digest host cell dna sucrose gradientpurified vaccine candidate induced neutralizing antibodies in mice74 immunized mice and guinea pigs failed to develop viremia following intravenous challenge with the prototype strain of rrv t48 in a phase iii dose escalation study75 in 382 healthy rrv-nave adults this vaccine was safe and immunogenic when administered as three immunizations at days 0 and 21 and month 6 at four dose levels with or without aluminum hydroxide added as an adjuvant the adjuvanted 25-g dose stimulated the highest immune response this group recently completed a phase iii study in 1755 healthy younger adults ages 1659 years and 209 healthy older adults ages 60 and older76 the vaccine was well tolerated neutralizing antibody titers 1  10 were achieved by 915 of the younger adults and 760 of the older adults after the third vaccination the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement of disease which has been described for rrv in vitro will need to be considered during the development of vaccines against rrv69 77
 rvf is a mosquito-borne infection endemic to sub-saharan africa and primarily affecting ruminant animals under appropriate climatologic conditions however explosive epizootics among animals and epidemics in humans occur with considerable morbidity and mortality in recent years rvf has demonstrated its ability to spread northward to egypt and into yemen and saudi arabia on the asian continent the consequences of further spread into nave animal and human populations are potentially devastating78 the spread of west nile virus wnv has demonstrated that viruses once bounded by the atlantic ocean have the potential to overcome that barrier thus the development of a vaccine or other countermeasures against the rvf virus is important for the protection of human and animal populations in africa and the middle east us military personnel involved in campaigns in those regions and livestock and people in the united states and elsewhere the us army has developed two vaccines to combat this threat an inactivated rvf vaccine tsi-gsd 200 and more recently a live attenuated product rvf mp-12 tsi-gsd 223 the entebbe strain of rvf isolated from a mosquito pool in bwamba county uganda is the source for the inactivated vaccine79 the virus was passaged 184 times in adult mice followed by two passages in fetal rhesus lung frhl cells to form the production seed although the original vaccine was produced in primary african green monkey kidney cells the current vaccine lots are produced in frhl cells80 81 the vaccine is inactivated in 005 formalin following verification of viral inactivation the residual formaldehyde is neutralized with sodium bisulfite to less than 001 a study of the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated rvf vaccine in humans during a 12-year period showed that the vaccine was safe and immunogenic when the three-dose primary series and one booster are administered82 83 in particular 540 90 of 598 volunteers given three 10-ml doses of tsi-gsd 200 subcutaneously on days 0 7 and 28 responded with a prnt80 titer of 1  40 or greater three-fourths of the initial nonresponders developed a prnt80 titer of 1  40 or greater after a single booster however approximately 10 of recipients of the inactivated rvf vaccine require repeated boosting in these individuals a booster typically results in an adequate titer which wanes over the next year to 1  40 prompting another booster pr pittman unpublished data an isolated rvf strain recovered from a nonfatal human case that occurred during the first egyptian epidemic in 1977 was used to derive the live attenuated rvf vaccine the virus zh548 was passaged twice in suckling mouse brain then once in frhl cells it was then attenuated by 12 serial alternating passages in human lung cell cultures mrc-5 cells certified for vaccine use by previously described methods84 in the presence or absence of 5-fluorouracil the resulting rvf mp-12 vaccine is a lyophilized product originating from supernatant fluids harvested from the final mutagenesis passage the vaccine has undergone extensive safety testing and challenge studies in several animal species rodents sheep including pregnant ewes and nave neonatal lambs cattle including in uterovaccinated bovids and monkeys85 86 87 88 89 furthermore miller and colleagues90 showed that rvf mp-12 vaccine administered to sheep results in long-lasting immunity and has limited potential to be transmitted to mosquitoes feeding on vaccinated animals rvf mp-12 has undergone clinical evaluation in human volunteers at usamriid in a phase i randomized double-blind dose-escalationroute-seeking study 56 healthy nonpregnant subjects were randomly selected to receive rvf mp-12 1047 plaque-forming units pfu subcutaneously n  10 1034 pfu intramuscularly n  6 or 1044 pfu intramuscularly n  27 or placebo n  1391 only infrequent and minor side effects were seen among placebo and mp-12 recipients one volunteer had a titer of 13 log by direct plaquing in cell culture six vaccinees had transient low-titer viremia detected by amplification only all six of these volunteers were from the group receiving 1044 pfu intramuscularly neutralizing antibodies measured by prnt80 titer as well as rvf-specific immunoglobulin ig m and igg were observed in 40 93 of 43 vaccine recipients the highest peak geometric mean antibody titers were observed in the group receiving 1044 pfu intramuscularly overall 28 82 of 34 rvf mp-12 recipients available for testing remained seropositive prnt80  1  20 at 1 year following inoculation91
 a joint program between the university of texas medical branch and usamriid for further development of the rvf mp-12 vaccine has been completed this study funded by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases involved the administration of a single intramuscular dose of rvf mp-12 vaccine to 19 nave male and nonpregnant female subjects the vaccine was safe and immunogenic in this vaccine trial a total of 18 95 of 19 subjects developed neutralizing antibodies against rvf virus as determined by a prnt80 titer of 1  20 or more results suggested that the vaccine resulted in at most only low-level viremia no virus was detected by direct plaque assay however during the first 14 days after vaccination nine mp-12 isolates were recovered from five subjects with the use of amplification by blind double passage in vero cells no single-nucleotide polymorphisms or reversions were observed in the attenuating mutations of the parent virus92
 another rvf live attenuated vaccine candidate is clone 13 this vaccine candidate is a plaque-purified clone of rvf virus that contains a large deletion in the small s genome segment that disrupts the biological functions of the nonstructural proteins nss clone 13 has proven highly immunogenic in mice sheep and goats although it has demonstrated only moderate immunogenicity in cattle93 94
 other approaches to the development of vaccines against rvf virus all of which are at the preclinical stage include vaccines based on viral vectors95 96 97 dna vaccines with molecular adjuvants98 subunit vaccines based on purified proteins99 100 101 102 103 and vaccines based on single-cycle replicable vaccine mutants104
 hantaviruses causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs have been and continue to be significant endemic disease threats to us military forces on the korean peninsula and throughout europe105 at least 14 distinct viral strains of hfrs-causing viruses are distributed worldwide106 three viral proteins are able to induce protection two surface glycoproteins g1 and g2 also called gn and gc and the n nucleocapsid protein neutralizing antibodies are protective although t-cell responses may also be useful107 in addition to hfrs hantaviruses are responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome106 108 the hantavirus causing this syndrome in the southwest united states is called sin nombre virus snv humans become infected with hantaviruses via inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta109 the prototype hantavirus hantaan was first isolated in korea and the first vaccine also was developed there to protect against hfrs108 110 111 this inactivated vaccine the rok84105 strain harvested from suckling mouse brains is concentrated by protamine sulfate precipitation and centrifugation the concentrate is then exposed to formalin inactivation and purified by ultrafiltration and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation aluminum hydroxide is added to the vaccine as an adjuvant thimerosal as a preservative and gelatin as a stabilizer the final product produced by rhein biotech reportedly has less than 001 ngml of myelin basic protein the recommended regimen for this product hantavax is two doses of 5120 elisa units 05 ml given 1 month apart by the subcutaneous or intramuscular route little has been published on the vaccine but the manufacturer reports that tolerance is good although allergic reactions occur presumably as a result of mouse brain antigens a serologic response measurable by indirect fluorescence is seen in nearly all vaccinees neutralizing antibodies are usually absent after one dose but are measured in approximately 75 of subjects after the second dose112 they decrease to 16 at 12 months at which time a booster is recommended although placebo-controlled data on the efficacy of the vaccine are not available a similar vaccine made in north korea reportedly showed 88 to 100 efficacy and hantavax itself has been effective in uncontrolled epidemiologic studies done in south korea and yugoslavia113 114 although neutralizing antibody responses were not persistent and not stimulated by a booster dose107 115 a case-control study conducted in the republic of korea estimated efficacies of 46 for two doses and 75 for three doses but with wide confidence limits116
 vaccines made in cell culture against hantavirus and seoul virus strains are licensed in china the substrate is cell cultures of golden hamster kidney or mongolian gerbil kidney the efficacy of these bivalent vaccines is reportedly better than 90 with fewer reactions than after the use of mouse brainderived vaccine113 114
 another korean company has developed a hantavirus vaccine made in vero cells that protected challenged animals by eliciting strong responses to the g1 g2 and n proteins of the virus117
 at usamriid advances in technology fueled the development of bioengineered hantavirus vaccines two experimental approaches included recombinant vaccinia-vectored hantaan virus vaccine carrying envelope and nucleocapsid genes118 119 and the same genes inserted into bacterial plasmids as dna vaccines the recombinant vaccinia-vectored hantaan virus vaccine was efficacious in the hamster infectivity model even if preexisting immunity to vaccinia virus was present it could be overcome by a second intramuscular injection of the vaccine candidate118 a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 142 volunteers using two subcutaneous injections 4 weeks apart showed that for vaccinia-nave volunteers neutralizing antibodies to hantaan virus or vaccinia virus were detected in 72 or 98 respectively whereas neutralizing antibodies to hantaan virus were detected in only 26 of vaccinia-immune volunteers showing the effect of prior vector-directed immunity119 this vaccine has been abandoned dna plasmids coding for the g1 and g2 proteins protected monkeys against challenge with a south american hantavirus and elicited antibodies that exerted passive protection in hamsters120 boosting the monkeys 1 to 2 years later showed that immunological memory had been induced121 alphavirus replicons baculovirus-produced proteins and chimeric hepatitis b vlps are all under study as additional hantavirus vaccine candidates113 122 123
 boudreau and colleagues124 report on a phase i clinical trial that evaluated hantaan virus and puumala virus m-segment dna vaccines for preventing hfrs each volunteer received either hantaan dna vaccine n  9 puumala dna vaccine n  9 or both vaccines n  9 three doses containing 8 g dna4 mg gold per dose administered 4 weeks apart were provided to volunteers by particle-mediated epidermal delivery the single vaccines elicited neutralizing antibodies to hantaan virus or puumala virus respectively in 30 and 44 of vaccinees neutralizing antibodies to one or both viruses were detected in 56 of volunteers who received the combined vaccine in an attempt to increase seroconversion hooper and colleagues125 conducted a phase i clinical trial of these two dna vaccines delivered by intramuscular electroporation similar to the boudreau study volunteers three groups of nine individuals each received three doses 28 days apart of either the hantaan dna vaccine the puumala dna vaccine or a mixture of both vaccines each dose of vaccine contained 2 mg dna in a total volume of 1 ml saline the combined vaccine contained 1 mg of each dna vaccine neutralizing antibodies were found in 56 and 78 of volunteers who received the hantaan or puumala dna vaccines respectively results of the combined vaccine showed that 78 of vaccinees developed neutralizing antibodies against puumala virus the three volunteers with the highest antibody levels against puumala also developed neutralizing antibodies against hantaan no serious adverse events resulting from the vaccines were noted in either study hooper and colleagues126 127 also found that dna vaccines encoding the virus envelope glycoproteins of snv or andes virus both of which cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome elicit high-titer neutralizing antibodies in animal models hamsters vaccinated with three doses of the snv dna vaccine were fully protected from lethal challenge with snv further a pan-hantavirus vaccine using andes virus snv hantaan virus and puumala virus plasmids elicited neutralizing antibodies against all four viruses126
 the spread of the flavivirus wnv from its introduction into new york city in 1999 across the united states has been a dramatic example of an emerging infection wnv is an arbovirus of birds for which it is often lethal and is transmitted by multiple mosquito species although the incidence of human infections has recently decreased wnv frequently causes febrile illness with the complication of meningoencephalitis in about 1 of infections128
 wn-vax a formalin-inactivated wnv vaccine derived from a strain isolated in new york city in 1999 has been tested in a number of animal models this vaccine administered intraperitoneally in two doses protected 100 of 4-week-old mice against a lethal challenge with wnv129 more recently muraki and colleagues130 found that mice passively immunized with serum from wn-vaximmunized mice were also protected from lethal wnv infection when administered to macaques wn-vax elicited neutralizing antibodies130 clinical trials on this vaccine are planned several phase i and phase ii clinical trials have been completed on wnv vaccine candidates the chimerivax west nile vaccine candidate containing a yellow fever virus backbone and expressing the premembrane and envelope proteins of wnv was reported to be safe and induced neutralizing antibodies in a phase i clinical trial131 132 in a phase ii clinical trial chimerivax was well tolerated and more than 96 of vaccinees seroconverted133
 in a phase i clinical trial a dna vaccine candidate elicited neutralizing antibodies against wnv134 a recombinant subunit vaccine candidate consisting of an envelope protein truncated at the c-terminal end and containing 80 of the n-terminal amino acids of the native wnv protein wn-80e mixed with adjuvant produced antibodies detectable by elisa and neutralizing antibody assays in the challenge experiment all control rhesus macaques had detectable viremia for at least 3 days after challenge whereas none of the vaccinated animals showed viremia135 a phase i trial assessing the safety of this vaccine was recently completed junin virus is the causative agent of ahf which is endemic to the pampas of north-central argentina humans become infected with the junin virus by inhalation of infected rodent secretions and excretions138 139 140 death occurs in 15 to 30 of untreated patients afflicted with ahf for several decades attempts were made in argentina to develop an efficacious vaccine against ahf the resulting inactivated and live attenuated vaccine candidates all failed for various reasons136 the product developed at usamriid candid 1 is a descendant of the prototype xj strain junin virus isolated in guinea pig from a fatal ahf case following another passage in the guinea pig the virus underwent 44 newborn mouse brain passages then was cloned and passaged 19 times in certified frhl cells136 141 142 candid 1 proved effective in preventing disease in guinea pigs and rhesus macaques after lethal junin virus challenge140 143 144 in phase i and phase ii clinical testing in humans candid 1 was safe and immunogenic145 146 more than 90 of volunteers developed antibodies against junin virus although at lower levels than those seen after mild natural infection147 and 99 developed a junin virusspecific cellular immune response in a pivotal efficacy study 3255 volunteers were randomized to receive the vaccine and 3245 were randomized to receive a placebo during the trial 23 volunteers developed an illness that met the clinical case definition for ahf148 149 of these 22 had received a placebo and 1 had received the vaccine vaccine efficacy by intent-to-treat analysis was 95 95 confidence interval 8299 p  001 argentinas national institute of human viral diseases produced its own junin vaccine also called candid 1 against ahf and tested it in 946 human volunteers to compare its safety and immunogenicity with that of the candid 1 vaccine produced in the united states and used in previous studies150 the vaccine was comparable to the us-produced vaccine in terms of safety and efficacy no severe adverse events were related to the vaccine as a result of this study argentinas national regulatory authority anmat licensed the locally produced candid 1 vaccine151 152
 vaccination with candid 1 is recommended for persons at risk of occupational agricultural or laboratory exposure to the junin virus the development of this vaccine represents a successful collaboration between usamriid and the argentine ministry of health and social action under the auspices of the united nations development programme and the pan american health organization over the years hundreds of thousands of people in argentina and other countries have been inoculated with an excellent record of safety and effectiveness153
 another important arenavirus is lassa virus transmitted by rodents in west africa where there has been a recent large epidemic several candidate vaccines have shown protection in nonhuman primate models including reassortants vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored recombinants and alphavirus replicons153a
 the middle east respiratory syndrome mers viruslike the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus that spread from china and caused a worldwide outbreak in 20022003is a coronavirus154 155 the reservoir for mers is camels particularly young animals which acquire a respiratory illness that can be transmitted to humans156 157 in addition human-to-human transmission has been repeatedly observed in saudi arabia and in south korea158 all coronaviruses possess a glycoprotein spike that induces neutralizing antibodies both monoclonal antibodies and vaccines based on the spike have shown good protection in experimental challenge models including macaques159 development of vaccines for camels and for humans is proceeding novavax has developed 02-m nanoparticles consisting of mers spike protein which together with iscomatrix adjuvant have been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies in mice160 german workers have used the mva vaccinia virus as a vector for the mers spike protein and induced neutralizing antibodies and protection in a mouse challenge model161 the vaccine research center at the national institutes of health has developed plasmids and recombinant proteins representing the full-length mers spike or the s1 domain of the spike when both antigens were administered to mice or macaques neutralizing antibodies were induced and animals were protected from challenge with the virus162 the further development of these candidate vaccines will depend on epidemiology and market size q fever is a highly infectious zoonotic disease of humans usually caused by aerosol transmission of c burnetii from infected sheep or goats163 the organism was thought to be a rickettsia but is now considered to be related to legionella bacteria fever and pneumonia are the most frequent clinical manifestations of q fever although hepatitis endocarditis and a variety of other complications may develop164 antibiotics are effective but may act slowly and chronic fatigue syndrome after q fever has been reported presumably as a result of cytokine dysregulation165
 mechanisms of immunity to q fever are complex although antibodies are important to clear extracellular organisms it is sensitization of t-cell lymphocytes to q fever antigen and secretion of lymphokines that clear intracellular infection and provide immunologic memory166
 in the development of a q fever vaccine c burnetii was adapted to grow in the chick embryo yolk sac and an early vaccine was made by formalin inactivation of organisms produced in eggs167 this vaccine was effective in humans including in those subjected to experimental challenge but it also occasionally resulted in severe local reactions that sometimes progressed to abscess formation eventually it was shown that reactions were associated with preexisting immunity to q fever accordingly the practice of screening prospective vaccinees was adoptedusing serology for q fever antibodies and observation for local induration after inoculation with a skin test antigen made from diluted vaccine advances in coxiella biology and vaccinology led to a new generation of vaccines for example evidence showed that only phase i q fever organisms analogous to smooth forms of bacteria were protective and that a transition to phase ii rough would occur if the organism was passaged too many times in chick embryo therefore q fever vaccines are based on phase i organisms only168 in addition researchers recognized that purification to remove chicken protein and lipid and isolation of whole inactivated coxiella by extraction filtration or centrifugation would result in a cleaner less reactogenic and highly immunogenic product two whole-cell vaccines came into use in high-risk subjects an australian vaccine made and licensed by commonwealth serum laboratories166 169 and a vaccine ind 610 made and tested by the us army170 both are administered as a single 30-g subcutaneous injection the australian vaccine q-vax is purified using high concentrations of nacl to remove nonprotective antigens the us army vaccine whole-cell inactivated q-fever vaccine ndbr 105 ind 610 is also extracted with nacl then subjected to ethanolfreon 113 extraction finally it is purified further on a cahpo4 2h2o brushite column despite these purification processes however skin testing of prospective recipients remains necessary to prevent serious reactions in persons who have experienced prior infection whole-cell vaccines have undergone considerable clinical testing in australia a placebo-controlled trial171 and an open trial in abattoir workers172 173 showed efficacy approaching 100 table 123
 from 2002 to 2006 during a vaccination program funded by the australian government the incidence of q fever in australia declined by more than 50166 174 the us army vaccine was subjected to a controlled challenge in volunteers this trial also proved highly successful175 two meta-analyses found that q-vax was respectively 97 and 83 to 100 effective but the data were considered to be of only moderate quality176 177 a q fever outbreak apparently caused by dairy goats occurred in the netherlands between 2007 and 2011 affecting more than 4000 individuals178 control measures that included q-vax vaccination of individuals at high risk for developing chronic q fever were effective in containing the outbreak despite limited coverage of the vaccination campaign179 180 181
 to eliminate the problem of reactions third-generation acellular q fever vaccines have been prepared in the united states182 183 and in the former czechoslovakia184 these vaccines extracted with chloroformmethanol or other lipid solvents to remove lipid a thought to be the chief offending substance in c burnetii have not yet undergone sufficient clinical testing to determine whether they are equivalent to whole-cell q fever vaccine in protection of humans in addition it is not yet clear if these vaccines overcome the problem of serious reactions in preexposed individuals185 186
 a live attenuated q fever vaccine produced in chick embryo yolk sac has been developed in russia but its safety has been questioned other vaccine approaches under investigation are based on the p1 29-kda protein a 67-kda antigen and dna plasmids coding for various proteins187 188 189
 better q fever vaccines are needed that induce antibodies and t-helper type 1 th1 cell responses and yet are well tolerated by individuals with preexisting immunity elucidation of the key protective antigens is required185 189
 tularemia a bacterial bioterrorism threat can be a significant endemic and epidemic human disease190 the causative bacterium of tularemia francisella tularensis was isolated in 1912 in 1919 edward francis made the association with the human disease then known as deer fly fever191
 andersson and colleagues192 describe the transcriptional response in peripheral blood following ulceroglandular tularemia in humans the authors identified seven genes whose changes in expression predict the early phase of tularemia in addition to identifying how the host defense develops or is turned off by f tularensis invasion these data are important in identifying potential diagnostic markers for tularemia infection many of the more than 200 cases of f tularensis documented in the american medical literature resulting from laboratory exposure occurred in laboratory personnel who had received one or more injections of a phenol-killed vaccine andor acetone-prepared vaccine193 194 195 196 one of these early inactivated products the foshay vaccine showed incomplete protective efficacy against tularemia organisms introduced by the respiratory and intracutaneous routes197 198 although circulating antibodies could be demonstrated following administration of these vaccines the antibodies generated were not protective it was concluded that the protective antigen of f tularensis was destroyed in the inactivation procedures used to prepare the vaccines although now antibodies alone are considered insufficient partly as a result of the experience with killed vaccines an effort to develop a live vaccine against f tularensis was undertaken by avoiding destruction of the protective antigen live vaccines which cause actual infection are thought to produce an immunity closer to that caused by the disease itself in particular by generating persistent antibodies and cd8-mediated cellular immunity both of which are required for protection against disease soviet investigators initially developed a live tularemia vaccine in 1942199 ampoules of this viable tularemia vaccine were brought to the united states from the russian institute of epidemiology and microbiology gamaleia institute by shope200 in 1956 from an ampoule of this product eigelsbach and downs201 derived a vaccine strain which they designated lvs studies done at fort detrick in the early 1960s showed that lvs was protective for mice and guinea pigs after a challenge201 this protection was subsequently found to be the result of cell-mediated immunity when passively transferred spleen cells from immunized mice provided protection to nonimmune recipients202 similar immunization studies were done in monkeys which also demonstrated a significant immune response to vaccination with lvs203
 lvs initially was given by scarification to volunteers at fort detrick in 1958204 the vaccination procedure and adverse events after vaccination were evaluated in 29 subjects198 only a pink scar remained 1 month after vaccination transient axillary lymphadenitis was observed in approximately half of the subjects but none of the 29 men exhibited fever or other systemic reactions following immunization with lvs all persons showed bacterial agglutinin antibodies peak titers were observed 29 to 59 days after vaccination and were sustained205
 after challenge doses of up to 2500 organisms a significant protective effect was seen in the volunteers vaccinated with lvs with only 20 of vaccinated persons showing clinical illness compared with 85 of the unvaccinated control subjects none of the vaccinated persons developed symptoms severe enough to require treatment at higher challenge doses however immunity was overcome after challenge with 25000 organisms 90 of vaccinated persons showed some symptomatology compared with 85 of the control subjects however lvs modulated illness severity such that only 60 of vaccinated volunteers had symptoms severe enough to require treatment compared with 100 of those in the control group205
 the efficacy of the live tularemia vaccine when administered by aerosol has also been evaluated206 207 in one study207 aerosol vaccination with lvs protected 6 of 16 subjects against challenge with the virulent schu-s4 strain of f tularensis all protected subjects had measurable circulating antibodies while only one of the 10 subjects who developed disease had circulating antibodies lvs also referred to as ndbr 101 has been used since the mid-1960s and has been associated with a significant decline in the rate of laboratory-acquired infections at fort detrick208 in the absence of firm knowledge concerning the attenuating mutations in lvs and its residual virulence the vaccine remains investigational and is administered only under protocol and with written informed consent the lots undergo lot-release and potency tests as required by fda for ind products efforts are underway to develop new-generation vaccines against tularemia using modern technologies lipopolysaccharide from f tularensis gives partial protection through the induction of antibodies but clearly cell-mediated responses to other antigens will be necessary for an optimal vaccine against highly virulent strains209 210 in addition aerosol delivery may give better protection than peripheral inoculation211 much work is underway to create new live attenuated mutants211 212 213 214 215 216 217 and novel subunit vaccines218 in one promising approach the oxidant-sensitive emra1 mutant of f tularensis lvs elicited a strong humoral immune response in mice without causing adverse effects mice vaccinated with a single intranasal dose of the emra1 mutant of f tularensis lvs were protected against a lethal respiratory lvs challenge this vaccine also provided partial protection against lethal challenge with the virulent f tularensis schus4 strain219
 primarily a disease of animals brucellosis first was described in humans in 1859 as mediterranean gastric remittent fever or malta fever220 the consumption of unpasteurized goat milk was found to be the source in the malta epidemic182 bruce221 isolated the etiologic agent in 1886 from a fatal case of brucellosis initially named micrococcus melitensis the genus later was named for its discoverer and is currently known as brucella melitensis brucella species are nonspore-forming gram-negative coccobacilli that exist worldwide several animal species become infected with brucella species humans become infected on contact with infected animals by consuming unpasteurized infected milk or other dairy products and by working with the organism under laboratory conditions brucellosis manifests with nonspecific flu-like symptoms that are often much more prominent than the gastrointestinal symptoms222 the feasibility of infection by aerosol makes brucella a possible agent of biowarfare effective vaccines both live and killed are available for animals use of these vaccines has led to decreases in human disease where animal infection is enzootic nevertheless an estimated 500000 annual human cases still occur worldwide223 a live vaccine brucella abortus s19 was extensively used in russia and gave more than 50 protection although it was somewhat reactogenic224
 ongoing research seeks to further attenuate live vaccines used in animals and to develop subunit vaccines based on membrane and ribosomal proteins or dna plasmids coding for those proteins225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 for example protection in animals has been achieved with an outer membrane protein and its gene235 236 with periplasmic protein bp26237 by intranasal administration of brucella lipopolysaccharide complexed with neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein238 239 and a recombinant glucokinase protein brucella vaccine candidate240
 
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen in ventilated patients and in those with burns however it also causes life-threatening infections in people with cystic fibrosis owing to its production of a thick mucoid capsule although antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide develop in people with cystic fibrosis after infection they are of low affinity and do not protect in contrast artificial immunization with lipopolysaccharide from eight different strains coupled chemically with the pseudomonas exotoxin a elicited high-affinity igg antibodies241 242 studies of cellular immune responses showed induction of antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation and a th1-like cytokine secretion243 during a 10-year period people with cystic fibrosis immunized with o polysaccharide conjugated to toxin a had fewer pseudomonas infections and a tendency toward less colonization with mucoid strains herzog c personal communication to s plotkin november 26 2002244 245 importantly lung function was also better in vaccinees244 246 247 in a phase iii trial patients with cystic fibrosis who received four doses of a bivalent p aeruginosa flagella vaccine were significantly less likely to have one or more acute p aeruginosa infections than were those who received placebo 196 vs 307 among vaccinees and placebo recipients respectively248 however additional antigens are expected to provide better protection249 a vaccine containing formalin-inactivated whole pseudomonas bacteria has been administered orally to healthy volunteers without adverse reactions and with significant serum iga responses250
 many other experimental vaccines are under development including ones based on flagellar antigens outer membrane proteins such as oprf and opri and exotoxin a251 252 253 254 for example one dna vaccine encoding pseudomonas exotoxin a and pcrv has shown promise in mice255 and a p aeruginosa hybrid outer membrane protein oprei ic43 vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic in a recent randomized placebo-controlled phase i study256 the mucoid exopolysaccharide of p aeruginosa has been conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin and found to elicit opsonophagocytic antibodies in mice257 an attenuated salmonella vector expressing the o antigen of p aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide given intranasally protected mice against challenge258 interestingly th17 responses as in the case of other mucosal bacteria may be necessary for protection259 and mucosal routes of administration may improve efficacy260 261 262
 the virulence factor alginate is produced by mucoid forms of p aeruginosa one strategy in pseudomonas vaccine development is to raise opsonic antibodies against alginate one group conjugated alginate to the outer membrane vesicle of n meningitides immunization of mice with this conjugate provided protection against intranasal challenge with p aeruginosa263 thus validating the concept 
helicobacter pylori which colonizes the stomach early in life but exerts its effects in adults is the cause of gastritis peptic ulcers and low-grade gastric lymphomas264 265 the mechanisms of disease involve stimulation of th1 regulatory t and possibly th17 cells antibody and cellular mechanisms seem to be involved in the protection demonstrated in animal models clinical trials have tested urease which is secreted by h pylori the caga pathogenicity island the vaca cytotoxin and the neutrophil-activating protein266 the results in the past have not been promising more recently however an aluminum-adjuvanted combination of the latter three antigens stimulated strong antibody and cellular responses in volunteers and will undergo further clinical development267 other approaches such as vlps268 epitope-based vaccines269 270 271 alkyl hydroperoxide reductase and mannosylated ahpc272 and thiolperoxidase273 have shown promise in single- and multicomponent vaccine studies using murine models botulism is a neurologic intoxication caused by botulinum neurotoxin the most poisonous agent known it is produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum seven toxin types a through g have been recognized all but g cause human disease274 botulinum neurotoxin is a significant biowarfare and bioterrorism threat the neurotoxin binds to the presynaptic membrane and prevents acetylcholine release resulting in a symmetric descending flaccid paralysis with classical bulbar palsies characterized by diplopia dysphonia dysarthria and dysphagia275 as paralysis progresses generalized weakness occurs if untreated death occurs from airway obstruction and diaphragmatic muscle paralysis interestingly this toxin has many therapeutic uses as wellnotably but not limited to treatment of blepharospasm strabismus cervical torticollis and various dystonias276 277 278
 pentavalent abcde botulinum toxoid pbt was available as a prophylactic countermeasure to botulism from 1959 until november 30 2011 when the centers for disease control and prevention stopped providing the vaccine under ind 161 because of reduced potency and increased reactogenicity3 although the old methodology for producing toxoids ie the methods used to produce pbt can be improved by reducing formalin concentrations and increasing the purity of the botulinum proteins the most advanced candidates are recombinant nontoxic proteins the hc subunits of toxin types a and b were immunogenic in a clinical trial and are proceeding in development279 280 281 282 other peptides of the toxin including the light chain and the n terminal of the heavy chain are also being tested283 fig 121
 a nonreplicating adenovirus-vectored monovalent c vaccine given intranasally or orally has also been shown to induce serum and secretory antibodies and to protect animals284 285 a recombinant bivalent vaccine rbv ab has completed phase ii safety and immunogenicity testing in humans286 inevitably new vaccines against botulism will have to be licensed through a demonstration of efficacy in animals although a titer of antibodies correlating with efficacy is not known for humans studies in guinea pigs suggest that very low levels 01 u will be protective287
 in march 2013 the fda approved a heptavalent equine abcdefg botulism antitoxin to treat individuals with symptoms of botulism after exposure or suspected exposure to botulinum neurotoxin288 289 babybig has been available in california to treat infant botulism since 2003290 however no vaccines for prophylactic protection against botulism are currently available in the united states 
clostridium difficile is an inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal tract that under certain conditions produces toxins that cause diarrhea the precipitating cause of c difficile infection cdi seems to be the elimination of other intestinal flora by antibiotic treatment incidence of the disease has increased considerably in recent years291 292 293 294 antibodies against both of the toxins produced by c difficile a and b are needed to prevent illness295 296
 much work is in progress to develop and use monoclonal antibodies against the toxins for prophylaxis and treatment297 298 299 300 vaccines against cdi are currently under clinical development at sanofi pasteur301 and pfizer301a both candidate c difficile toxoid vaccines are composed of a highly purified formalin or genetically inactivated toxoids together with aluminum adjuvants delivered by intramuscular injection early clinical data suggest a relationship between an immune response to toxins a and b with protection against a primary or recurrent case of cdi297 302 303 304 305 after colonization a systemic anamnestic response to toxin a as evidenced by increased serum igg antitoxin a levels is associated with asymptomatic carriage of c difficile serum igg antitoxin a levels have also been significantly correlated with igg levels against toxin b antigens which were also higher in asymptomatic carriers303 in patients with cdi higher igg antibodies to toxin a are associated with protection against recurrence303 in an initial phase i study the candidate vaccine induced igg antibodies to toxins a and b with resolution of recurrent diarrhea304 in a more recent phase ii study the sanofi candidate given in a high dose elicited functional antibody responses in adult and elderly volunteers for at least 180 days without safety issues306
 in addition work has begun on the use of colonization factors as vaccine antigens these include a protease cwp84 that is an adhesion molecule307 308 and a cell wall polysaccharide conjugated to the diphtheria toxoid variant crm309 in another approach to vaccine development baliban and colleagues310 created a synthetic dna vaccine encoding receptor binding domains from c difficile toxin a and toxin b in mice and nonhuman primates this vaccine demonstrated robust immunogenicity and immunized mice were protected from a challenge with c difficile spores from homologous and heterologous strains we thank elizabeth s brown phd for critical review of this manuscript george r french contributed to this chapter in prior editions

hernndez-pinsn hugo mantilla-meluk jorge gmez-marn enrique   toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite with a worldwide distribution and the capacity to infect a wide variety of warm-blooded animals and humans through the infections of oocysts in the environment by the consumption of tissue bradyzoites in infected intermediate hosts or by congenital transmission 1 t gondii infections have been reported for many warm-blooded animals around the globe but have been scarcely reported in bats and several attempts failed to detect t gondii in brown bat eptesicus fuscus red bat lasiurus borealis and evening bat nycticeius humeralis by sabin-feldman and mat-t techniques 2 3 bats are considered an important natural reservoir of many zoonotic viruses 4 carrying a wide range of pathogens and potentially disseminating them among wild and urban areas 5 including the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 actually generating a pandemic producing more than 1773000 infected people and 111600 deaths in 185 countries and territories 6 and presumably bats serve as reservoirs hosts for its progenitor 7 the first report of t gondii in bat species occurred in 1965 by galuzo and collaborators through parasite isolation in two insectivorous bats noctalus noctula and vespertilio serotinus in kazakhstan 8 later in south america the first report dates from 1969 in brazil obtained through the isolation of t gondii parasite in four bats by bioassay in mice 9 toxoplasmosis has been reported in captive flying-foxes pteropus conspicillatus and p scapulatus being the first symptomatic cases of these diseases in a wild species 10 the first case of t gondii isolation and genotyping by sequencing of sag1 gene occurred in 2013 4 raising the interest of researchers of detecting t gondii in bats and trying to describe prevalences parasite acquisition and infection source distribution and genetic relationships prevalences between 61216 table 1 have been reported being the most prevalent genotype related to the clonal type 1115 despite its fundamental importance as a scientific repository of biological information potentially useful for health surveillance purposes little work has been conducted on this issue within mammals scientific collections in colombia further research activities of the collection of mammals of the university of quindo cmuq colombia include bat collections in every natural region of the country as part of the museology protocols established at the cmuq internal organs lungs liver heart kidneys small and large intestine are preserved along with information on voucher specimens taxonomy and ecology so we took advantage from the creation of the centro de estudios de alta montaa center for highland studies ceam an initiative in which 27 research groups from different disciplines converge to start a transdisciplinary research on health surveillance of wild vectors of t gondii at the central andes therefore the objective of the present study was to detect t gondii dna from internal bat organs from quindio colombia lungs heart liver kidneys stomach small and large intestine from each captured and euthanized bat were extracted the organs were stored in 2 ml eppendorf tubes with 09 saline solution and they were stored at  20 c until used approximately 50 mg from each organ were cut and placed in a new 2 ml eppendorf tube with 1 ml of cell lysis solution promega we added 50 l of proteinase k 20 mgml-invitrogen and incubated the sample at 65 c for 23 h in shaker and the wizard genomic dna purification kit was used according to the manufacturer to detect t gondii dna we used conventional nested pcr as described previously 1618 amplifying a 97-bp fragment of the b1 gene genbank accession number af179871 from t gondii described first by burge and collaborators in 1989 because its sensitivity and specificity 19 we used 15 agarose gel electrophoresis to analyze pcr products which were defined as positive or negative for pcr reactions the positive control was dna from the t gondii control rh strain and negative control was distilled water in the presence of primers the pcr experiments were done in triplicate pcr products were purified using the ammonium acetate protocol 20 and later sequenced on an abi 3130xl genetic analyzer applied biosystems foster city ca usa using the bigdye terminator v31 cycle sequencing kit applied biosystems dna sequences were edited and aligned with a b1 reference sequence af1798711 and the rh positive control using chromas 151 httpswwwtechnely-siumcomauchromashtml and bioedit 7052 21 in the present study out of three silky short-tailed bat specimens collected in the wild the kidney tissue from one individual 063 collection number resulted in b1 sequence pcr positive for t gondii and it was confirmed by triplicate fig 1 representing 333 13 of the samples we used pcr to detect t gondii because it is sensitive enough to detect low quantities of parasites and are accessible for routine analyses 14 although we have a low number of samples it could represent a high t gondii dna percentage in bats by pcr in contrast different studies realized until today table 1 the positive sample was confirmed to be from t gondii dna through sequencing and alignment fig 2 and blast with our positive control b1 sequence from t gondii dna of rh strain and a reference sequence reported in genbank with accession number af179871 19 the few differences presented in alignment should be interpreted with precaution because it is not necessarily a different genotype or strain from t gondii to obtain the circulation of specific genotypes one needs multi-locus analysis using different genes like rop18 22 with a good amount and quality of dna 16 the individual that tested positive for t gondii in this study had no symptoms of infection at the moment of its capture infected bats by t gondii remain most of the times without symptoms like hindlimb paralysis respiratory distress panting and anorexia 4 10 acting as vectors and transmitting the infection to other animals although little is known on the behavioral changes associated with toxoplasmosis for most bat species individuals on the ground or exposed out of their refugia may represent a potential public health threat 23 the warm and humid environments like the one from the natural reserve in which we captured the positive bat individual are more suitable for the survival of t gondii oocysts 24 routes of infection of t gondii in bats remain broadly unknown 25 and potential hypotheses explaining the infection can change according to roosting behavior and diet of said species carollia brevicauda is abundant in premontane and montane andean forests in which it feeds from a wide variety of fruit resources 26 it is possible that the food resource acted as the source of parasite acquisition which could had been in contact with contaminated water and the low dietary selectivity of c brevicauda 27 reinforces this possibility another possibility can be given by a direct contact with contaminated water bats could drink frequently from ponds and other water sources which could be potentially contaminated with t gondii oocysts some reports in quindo have confirmed the presence of dna t gondii in water samples before plants treatment with a frequency of 769 1013 16 t gondii infection in insectivorous and frugivorous bats also suggests that the caves where bats live are contaminated with t gondii oocysts 28 the warm and humid environments like the one from the natural reserve in which we captured the positive bat individual are more suitable for survival of t gondii oocysts 24 across carollia brevicauda geographic distribution from panama to southern bolivia and brasil the species presents a wide array of plant items in its diet which significantly overlaps those found in some congeneric species 29 as well as in other phyllostomid bat species such as sturnira erythromos and s ludovici 26 the overlap in diets and the possibility of food items as a source of infection likely exposed other frugivorous bats to t gondii acquisition bats are one of the second most abundant widely distributed and diverse group of mammals in the neotropics and the first in colombia 30 they may represent an interesting group to evaluate highly parasite transmission 31 furthermore some bat species are considered staples in the diet of several species of wild felids as well as domestic cats which can disseminate oocysts into the environment previous studies have shown that the rate of t gondii infection in felids is related to predatorprey relationships and therefore dependent on the availability prey species 32 detailed understanding of how a virus parasite or bacteria can infect different species including humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events  syrian hamsters as a small animal model for emerging infectious diseases advances in immunologic methods giovanni rezza giuseppe ippolito bryce warner m david safronetz gary kobinger p   the need for a reliable and representative animal model for the study of a particular disease is critical for expanding our understanding of the disease and for developing therapeutics and ultimately a cure the first steps in developing intervention strategies involve establishing a small animal model for study of the disease typically in rodents where mice are the most common model due to their low cost ease of handling availability of reagents and potential for genetic manipulation despite their prominence and widespread use there are many instances where mice are not suitable candidates for a disease model and alternative model is necessary the guidelines for selecting an appropriate animal model have been outlined by the canadian council for animal care ccac animal care 1997 and the united states food and drug administration fda fda 2015 a model should be chosen such that the disease is pathophysiologically similar to the human condition in terms of onset progression symptoms pathology and disease outcome fda 2015 additionally the challenge agent should reliably cause disease in the model animal consistent with the parameters above and the host should be susceptible to a realistic challenge of the disease agent fda 2015 due to the ability of syrian golden hamsters mesocricetus auratus hereafter referred to as hamsters to satisfy many of the conditions outlined by the ccac and the fda they have been used as an alternative to mice in many disease models there are many advantages to using hamsters as a disease model they are outbred animals allowing for disease modelling with more genetic diversity than inbred mice also the requirements for housing of hamsters is similar to that of mice and rats and facilities designed for housing rodents can typically accommodate hamsters without the need for additional equipment hamsters can be cohoused in small cages which is a significant advantage over other alternative disease models such as guinea pigs and ferrets these advantages are why many consider hamsters a superior alternative to other small animals for use in research for the development of vaccines and therapeutic approaches some consider hamsters a higher standard as small animal model than mice and as such hamsters have been utilized in a wide range of models from those examining diabetes atherosclerosis neural plasticity to cancer table 1 bhathena et al 2011 dillard et al 2010 jov et al 2013 staffend and meisel 2012 woods et al 2015 vijayalingam et al 2014 however the use of hamsters for models of pathogenic human diseases may be the most valuable due to comparable disease progression seen in hamsters to that of humans for many infectious diseases including bacteria viruses and parasites dondji et al 2008 da silva-couto et al 2015 kuehne et al 2014 safronetz et al 2012 specifically hamsters are used as a disease model for many high consequence pathogens such as bunyaviruses arenaviruses henipaviruses flaviviruses alphaviruses filoviruses and sars-corona virus table 1 safronetz et al 2009 2012 2013 brown et al 2011 schountz et al 2015 debuysscher et al 2013 gowen and holbrook 2008 steele and twenhafel 2010 ebihara et al 2012 gowen et al 2010 roberts et al 2010 additionally hamsters can be used for the evaluation of vaccines and therapeutic treatments against these viruses in some cases as with andes virus hamsters are the only lethal model of the disease safronetz et al 2012 the value of hamsters as an animal model is research is only recently being realized the popularity of hamsters used for infectious disease research has increased significantly the last several years fig 1 this growing use of hamsters highlights the need for the development of hamster-specific reagents for a wide range of applications including immunological assays

 in spite of the growing use of hamsters as disease models there remains a lack of available immunological reagents developed for assessing immune responses in these animals often researchers are left with examining clinical signs of disease progression and pathology zivcec et al 2011 for the study of disease progression and pathophysiology this is of little concern but for the development of vaccines therapeutic drugs and determining correlates of immune protection for infectious diseases evaluating the immune response is critical fundamental tools for the study of both innate and adaptive host immune responses commonly used in other models such as mouse and non-human primates have not yet been developed the result is that researchers who are using or plan to use a hamster model of disease need to use alternative methods for evaluating the immune response the widespread use of laboratory mice over the course of the last century has led to great advances in many fields the combination of whole genome sequencing for mus musculus being complete and the nearly universal use of mice for many decades have led to the development of countless mouse-specific reagents used in many disciplines chinwalla et al 2002 the complete sequencing of the hamster genome has been performed at the broad institute ncbi bioproject 77669 and assembly of the hamster genome only recently completed httpwwwgenomegov27557963 this recent completion will hopefully lead to a surge in the development of hamster specific research tools currently there are 874 cdna sequences or expressed sequence tags ests available from the hamster genome in the ncbi-dbest database boguski et al 1993 the lack of available sequence data and resulting insufficient tools for molecular biology in hamsters has hamstrung scientists who are looking to use them as a disease model in addition to the insufficient sequence data for hamsters until very recently the characterization of many immune-specific markers in the hamster remains to be done the number of these markers that have been described in the mouse including cell surface markers transcription factors signaling proteins cytokines chemokines and even secreted effectors molecules dwarfs the work that has been done in almost every other species including hamsters additionally monoclonal antibodies against nearly all of the described immunological markers in mice can be readily found commercially whereas monoclonal antibodies against hamster specific immune markers are almost completely non-existent the considerable lag in the time taken to sequence the hamster genome coupled with an almost non-existent commercial collection of monoclonal antibodies developed against hamster specific proteins and immunological markers has limited the advancement of hamster models from an immunological perspective despite the scarcity of available reagents for immunological assays in hamster models there have been significant advances in the methods used to characterize the immune response in hamsters and there are still many reasons why hamsters are a good choice as an animal model of disease the development of assays to evaluate immune responses in hamsters has been critical in their use as a model for infectious disease and vaccine development in addition to the aforementioned ability of hamster models to closely mimic the human condition of many diseases and satisfy requirements of a suitable animal model in this review we focus on how the progress of immunological assay development in hamsters from determination of cross-reacting antibodies against hamster markers hamster specific elisas and qrt-pcr to transcriptome analysis and microarrays we discuss how the assays that have been developed to this point are being utilized in current hamster models to assess immune responses as well as advantages and disadvantages of these currently available assays in the context of particular models finally we address how recent advances in developing immunological tools for use in hamsters can potentially influence future progress along with what remains to be resolved in this area providing ideas of what we think would be valuable additions to a growing resource for researchers who plan to use hamsters as an animal model while quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr has been a technique of choice in diagnostics detection of pathogens and determination of viral loads the potential for utilizing qrt-pcr for determination of immune responses in tissues has been realized in many models for example in human models qrt-pcr has been employed for the detection of innate cytokines and transcription factors involved in immune responses in cells infected with sars-coronavirus the detection of upregulated genes implicated in immune escape in circulating tumor cells and evaluating immune responses generated in patients given the live attenuated yellow fever vaccine zielecki et al 2013 steinert et al 2014 gaucher et al 2008 similarly in mice qrt-pcr has been used to describe the mechanisms of immune activation in certain vaccine models to determine the transcription factors involved in dendritic cell mediated presentation of antigen and the subsequent activation of t cells to investigate the mechanisms behind macrophage polarization and to evaluate the role of certain subsets of t cells in infectious disease models pollard et al 2013 seillet et al 2013 davis et al 2013 stross et al 2012 despite the fact that in many models qrt-pcr is used to determine the relative gene expression of both innate and adaptive cytokines and chemokines zivcec et al 2011 safronetz et al 2011a prescott et al 2013 overbergh et al 2003 the examples above illustrate that the ability to detect mrna of other non-cytokine and non-chemokine genes such as transcription factors and cell surface markers can play a valuable role in evaluating immunity generated in certain instances gaucher et al 2008 seillet et al 2013 the fact that qrt-pcr is used in models such as human and mouse models whereby immunological reagents are readily available and many aspects specific immunity can be analyzed with relatively ease using other methods shows the value and relevance of qrt-pcr among todays available assays in hamsters qrt-pcr is currently the method of choice for many in evaluating immune responses in infectious disease models recently a panel of taqman primeprobe assays for 51 specifically targeted genes in the hamster that were chosen out of a set of more than 800 reference mrna sequences in genbank was described zivcec et al 2011 each are involved in either pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory innate immune responses t cell responses as well as non-immune pathways such as apoptosis cell junction or coagulation responses in the hamster zivcec et al 2011 additionally the validation of an appropriate housekeeping gene for use in qrt-pcr assays in the hamster was simultaneously performed with ribosomal protein l18 rpl18 identified as the most stable of the housekeeping genes tested among -actin -2-microglobulin and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase zivcec et al 2011 consequently the use of qrt-pcr in hamster models as an immunological tool has increased greatly qrt-pcr has been utilized in hamster models studying disease caused by andes virus safronetz et al 2011a b prescott et al 2013 ebola virus hemorrhagic fever ebihara et al 2012 nipah virus debuysscher et al 2013 and leishmania spp da silva-couto et al 2015 among others the development of specific primerprobe sets for use in qrt-pcr in hamsters has improved upon the limited options that are available for researchers who are looking to use hamsters as a small animal model this advancement allows for detection of a broad range of immune and cellular factors and has been crucial to expanding the use of hamsters as an animal model that said while qrt-pcr is in all likelihood the best immunological tool available in hamsters currently it is still an assay that has its considerable disadvantages first the number of immune-related genes that have been sequenced and their mrna sequences entered into genbank is still relatively low the panel of primers that was validated contained only 51 genes that played a role in host immune responses table 2 zivcec et al 2011 while many of the genes reported by play an important role in host immunity the number of immune factors that can be assays pales in comparison to what is available in mouse and human assays second while the study of the immune-related genes involved in disease systems can provide valuable insight into the class of immunity generated or what type of immunity is needed for protection against certain pathogens the relative amount of mrna present does not always correlate directly with the amount of expressed protein overbergh et al 2003 in many instances the presence of expressed protein will be very small whereby qrt-pcr and relative gene expression must be used instead in these instances and particularly in using qrt-pcr for analyzing the expression of immune-related genes in hamsters a discrepancy between mrna and protein levels should be considered overbergh et al 2003 in spite of this there is evidence that there is a good correlation between mrna and protein levels in some instances hein et al 2001 blaschke et al 2000 finally the methods used for collection of tissues in hamsters for analysis by qrt-pcr in most models do not allow for the evaluation of specific gene expression in individual cell types perhaps the most important flaw to consider when using qrt-pcr for analyzing the expression of immune-related genes is that hamster tissues are often harvested and total rna is extracted from the tissues for analysis by qrt-pcr safronetz et al 2011a prescott et al 2013 chattopadhyay et al 2014 a lack of hamster specific antibodies does not allow for the isolation of individual cell types for analysis of gene expression therefore the detection of antigen-specific immune responses at the individual cell level is nearly impossible leaving only systemic responses and total cytokine chemokine and other markers to be detected this can cause issues when attempting to detect primary and secondary immune responses what types of innate cells play a role in protection against pathogens and determining what the correlates of protection are against certain diseases
 until more hamster specific monoclonal antibodies become commercially available qrt-pcr for determining the relative expression levels of immune response genes is one of the best tools at the researchers disposal today despite certain flaws such as the number of existing analytes to test and inherent issues with the assay like discrepancies between mrna and protein levels and an inability to distinguish between certain cell types qrt-pcr has become a standard immunological method for use in hamster models it allows for the simultaneous detection of a large number of immune markers table 2 and is a reliable and sensitive assay with a typical limit of detection between 106 and 108 ng of gene-specific rna corresponding to approximately 9900 rna copies chattopadhyay et al 2014 qrt-pcr is one of the most valuable methods we have for immunological analysis in hamster models enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa have become standard practice for the detection of cytokines antibodies and other proteins since being described in 1971 by engvall and perlmann engvall and perlmann 1971 although originally described as a method for the detection of igg antibodies elisas have subsequently been developed and optimized for detection of a wide variety of proteins the most common being cytokines that can be detected in biological samples hornbeck 1991 for species like mice non-human primates and humans a large number of commercially available kits can be obtained for a reasonable price for the detection of nearly every important cytokine or chemokine alternatively antibodies against cytokines from these species are readily available as well including antibodies with enzymatic conjugates allowing for the optimization of individual protocols to each researchers liking in hamsters however these antibodies for the detection of cytokines are not available a study examining cross-reactivity of hamster proteins reported that out of 64 antibody-based assays including luminex and elisa for the detection of cytokines and chemokines in various species 14 showed significant cross-reactivity with hamster proteins zivcec et al 2011 out of eight elisa kits that were tested only three showed an acceptable level of cross-reactivity with hamster proteins zivcec et al 2011 due to the high level of sequence homology of the genes for these proteins in the species tested compared with hamsters this low percentage of cross-reactivity is surprising the authors concluded from these experiments that elisa kits and kits for the detection of cytokines and chemokines from other species such as mice and rats were of little value for use in hamsters zivcec et al 2011 because of the lack of antibodies for the detection of hamster cytokines it follows that another valuable and related immune assay the enzyme-linked immunospot elispot assay is also of little value when using a hamster model this assay detects individual cytokine producing cells in culture rather than the presence of cytokines in a culture supernatant or serum but similarly utilizes anti-cytokine antibodies to detect cytokine secreting cells the lack of antibodies that can detect hamster specific cytokines limits the use of both elisa and elispot for cytokine detection in hamster models development of monoclonal antibodies against various cytokines from hamsters would greatly improve the number of assays that could be utilized for examining immune responses in hamsters despite the inability to use elisas for detection of cytokines in hamsters elisas can still be a valuable tool for the detection of antibodies in hamster models true to its original use elisas can be used to quantify the presence of hamster igm and igg out of the limited number of commercially available anti-hamster antibodies anti-hamster igm and igg are available and have been used to show the presence of antigen specific antibodies in various hamster models safronetz et al 2009 prescott et al 2015 de wit et al 2013 in general the use of a direct elisa assay is ideal for detection of antibodies in the serum of hamsters therefore a recombinant or purified antigen is necessary to coat elisa plates before the detection of specific antibodies in serum can be achieved this has been performed in models for hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome caused by andes virus safronetz et al 2009 ebola hemorrhagic fever prescott et al 2015 and mers-cov de wit et al 2013 among others this has provided a valuable tool for the evaluation of humoral immunity in hamsters in response to infectious agents despite the value of being able to detect igm and igg in hamsters these are the only two isotypes for which there are currently available antibodies against the detection of different isotypes such as igg1 and igg2 would be invaluable to researchers in evaluating the immune response given the other limited options available in hamsters additionally being able to detect ige iga and igd also important players in many immune models would increase the value of using hamsters as an animal model once again the lack of hamster specific reagents limits the ability to examine the full scope of the immune response currently we are left determining titers of hamster specific igm and total igg until further detection antibodies are developed using flowcytometry for the detection of specific cell types has become standard immunological practice flowcytometry can identify the presence of specific markers on cells the activation status of lymphocytes whether specific subsets of cells are present in tissues and what cell subsets are producing certain cytokines in addition fluorescence activated cell sorting facs can sort cell types upon recognition of fluorescent markers bound to cells via specific antibodies the specificity and sensitivity of flowcytometry along with the advent of large panels capable of recognizing over a dozen fluorescent markers on cells make it one of the most valuable tools for immunological analyses for hamsters there are currently no monoclonal antibodies against cell surface markers specific to hamster cells for use in flowcytometry however many studies have used cross-reactive antibodies against cell surface markers of mice and rats for use in flowcytometry prescott et al 2013 hammerbeck and hooper 2012 hammerbeck and hooper reported that out of a panel consisting of 52 commercially available antibodies for use in flowcytometry four were able to identify hamster cells hammerbeck and hooper 2012 the four cross-reactive antibodies included anti-mouserat mhc ii i-ek anti-mouse cd4 anti-rat cd8 and anti-mouse thy12 hammerbeck and hooper 2012 confirming some which had been reported to cross-react with hamster cells previously dondji et al 2008 liu et al 1990 antibodies against hamster igm and igg can also be used to detect hamster b cells in flowcytometry as well hammerbeck and hooper 2012 the limitations regarding flowcytometry use with hamster cells is that there are only these very few antibodies available with many antibodies developed for use with mouse and rat cells non cross-reactive another issue is that each specific clone should be tested to confirm cross-reactivity with hamster cells as the clones generated by different companies may not react with the same specificity with hamster cells in every case additionally the few antibodies that are available that cross-react are limited to cell surface proteins on t and b cells this results in an inability to determine activation status cell subset or identify other non-t and b cells like macrophages dendritic cells neutrophils and nk cells as with elisa and elispot assays in hamsters the lack of antibodies against hamster-specific cytokines prevents using flowcytometry to detect cytokine producing cells by intracellular staining for phenotyping of the immune response this is a major limitation on the use of flowcytometry in hamster models finally the use of anti-mouse cd4 and anti-rat cd8 antibodies for use in hamsters must be done in conjunction with anti-mouserat mhc ii to allow for the exclusion of myeloid lineage cells expressing either cd4 or cd8 which has shown to be the case in mice hammerbeck and hooper 2012 fortunately the combination of these antibodies has been shown to be effective in identifying cd4 and cd8 t cells in hamsters due to the lack of binding of cells by both anti-mouse cd4 or anti-rat cd8 and anti-mouserat mhc ii hammerbeck and hooper 2012 overall the use of flowcytometry in hamsters in severely limited due to the lack hamster-specific antibodies the identification and possible sorting of b cells and cd4 and cd8 t cells is possible due to the cross-reactivity of anti-mouse and anti-rat antibodies but should be done with caution and optimization of protocols by individual researchers to determine cross-reactivity levels of specific clones related to the use of monoclonal antibodies against mouse and rat cell surface markers that are able to cross-react with hamster proteins for use in flowcytometry these antibodies have been shown to be effective at depletion of cd4 and cd8 t cells in vivo in hamsters prescott et al 2013 2015 hammerbeck and hooper 2012 the ability of these antibodies to recognize hamster t cells and mediate depletion in vivo allows for depletion studies and for determining the importance of cd4 or cd8 t cells in infectious disease models the ability of cross-reactive antibodies to deplete t cell in vivo is a considerable advantage in examining host immune responses in disease models with the limited ability to assess certain immune parameters ex vivo in hamsters this provides a critical tool for immunological studies in hamsters the same caveats exist for the use of these antibodies for depletion of cells in vivo as for their use in flowcytometry but this provides an interesting avenue for researchers to pursue when evaluating the immune response against certain pathogens or testing drug and vaccine efficacy immunohistochemistry has been a powerful method for the detection of specific antigens within formalin-fixed tissues for decades schacht and kern 2015 since the advent of hybridomas for the production of monoclonal antibodies in 1975 immunohistochemistry has adopted the use of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of specific antigens with great specificity schacht and kern 2015 khler and milstein 1975 the use of specific antibodies allows for the detection within fixed tissues of bacteria viruses certain cell types such as lymphocytes and cellular markers of disease pathology while immunohistochemistry has important applications in diagnostics in animal models of disease it is particularly useful for assessing pathology in affected tissues and can detect the present of tissue infiltrating immune cells that may be causing immunopathogenesis during the course of disease immunohistochemistry in hamsters for assessing disease pathology has been a popular technique due to the lack of reagents available for classical immunological methods it has been used to examine the course of disease in many infectious disease models including andes virus sin nombre virus chikungunya virus nipah virus and ebola virus safronetz et al 2013 debuysscher et al 2013 ebihara et al 2012 safronetz et al 2011b bosco-lauth et al 2015 it is also useful in non-infectious disease models in hamsters such as cancer and encephalopathic diseases woods et al 2015 clouse et al 2015 elder et al 2013 while the use of this technique in hamsters is typically limited to examining preserved tissues that display disease pathology the advantages are that cross sections of entire tissues can be visualized to give a more representative image of disease tropism and the presence of immune cells or of particular pathogens can easily be detected schacht and kern 2015 as with other immunological methods in hamsters the detection of most immune cells is limited to few cross-reactive antibodies available and antibodies against common cell surface markers found in many tissues are not available or their cross-reactivity with antibodies against these markers in other species has not been assessed other inherent limitations of immunohistochemistry include the alteration of antigens during the fixation process the relative insensitivity of the assay as compared to other techniques like elisa and pcr and the technical demands involved in the procedure schacht and kern 2015 particularly in the case of pathogens that require high containment facilities the procedure for fixation of tissues can be up to several weeks long increasing the possibility of altered tissues when best results are obtained as soon after euthanization as possible despite these issues the value of using immunohistochemistry in hamster models is the ability to examine multiple tissues that impacted during the course of disease determining specific tissue tropism of pathogens by visualizing pathogens in infected tissues and studying possible immune cells infiltration into tissues that could be contributing to immunopathogenesis during certain diseases in recent years transcriptome sequencing and analysis has been utilized to provide sets of mrna that are expressed in a given species help provide insights into the expression profiles of these species and for the development of microarrays for the detection of gene expression tchitchek et al 2014 ying et al 2015 the description of the transcriptome of mice rats and humans has been critical for the increasing use of microarray for examining expression profiles in tissues in many models yu et al 2009 okazaki et al 2002 yang et al 2010 maywood et al 2009 recently hamster transcriptome sequencing and analysis has been performed in several models ying et al 2015 yu et al 2009 yang et al 2010 maywood et al 2009 hohlweg et al 2003 schmucki et al 2013 in recent years the use of microarray analysis in hamsters has been limited to cross-reactive hybridization of hamster rna to cdna from other species such as rats mice and humans yu et al 2009 wahl-jensen et al 2012 cdnas comprising the hamster transcriptome have been sequence aligned to the transcriptome of species that have been described previously tchitchek et al 2014 this transcriptome sequencing has allowed for the identification of a large set of genes that play a role in a number of biological processes subsequently ying et al were able to sequence and annotate over 34000 sequences comprising the hamster transcriptome for the development of a custom hamster microarray ying et al 2015 the microarray that was developed from the hamster transcriptome was validated by comparing gene expression profiles in mice infected with adenovirus using the custom microarray and qrt-pcr ying et al 2015 this was one of the first descriptions of a hamster specific microarray capable of detecting changes in hamster gene expression this newly developed microarray following the sequencing and annotation of the hamster transcriptome will hopefully lead to the production of more hamster specific microarrays while rna-seq has been recently used to examine the regulation of genes in hamster in a model for arenavirus infection schountz et al 2015 the use of rna-seq has not yet become common in hamster models of infectious disease it is likely that the use of rna-seq will become more popular in coming years as the genome and transcriptome of hamsters becomes fully characterized and publicly available the description of the hamster transcriptome and its value in the development of hamster specific microarrays should not be overlooked this recent work on the hamster transcriptome will hopefully lead to beneficial tools like microarrays for researchers looking to use hamsters as an animal model of disease the ability to evaluate host responses to pathogens has historically relied upon examining gene expression or protein synthesis in the form of antibodies or cytokines since many of the intracellular pathways involved in immune cell signalling are well known and many proteins have been characterized the cell signalling proteins within host cells have become recently become a target for therapeutics the ability of kinases to phosphorylate proteins is critical in cellular signalling and allows for rapid responses to environmental stimuli such as stress or infection arsenault et al 2011 falcinelli et al 2015 only recently has the potential of examining the presence of kinases involved in cell signalling collectively called the kinome been realized the study of the kinases involved in immune signalling can give important indicators of the outcome of disease in certain models falcinelli et al 2015 kinome analysis involves synthesizing peptides representing phosphorylation sites on hundreds of proteins that are immobilized onto an array surface arsenault et al 2011 samples containing cellular kinases phosphorylate the immobilized peptides which can then be visualized to determine the level of relative phosphorylation and the activity of the kinases in the sample arsenault et al 2011 the examination of the kinome during the host response to pathogens has been used as a tool to define cellular responses and evaluate host immune responses in different disease models kindrachuk et al 2012 2014 arsenault et al 2013 kindrachuk and napper 2013 in hamsters a kinome peptide array was recently synthesized by falcinelli et al in a model for arenavirus infection falcinelli et al 2015 this hamster specific kinome was developed with peptides focused primarily on immune pathways and showed that arenavirus infection in hamsters is characterized by lung vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin responses as well as nf-kb and tlr signalling falcinelli et al 2015 this presents a novel assay for assessing hamster-specific immune responses to infection by examining the activity level of host cell kinases the ability to genetically manipulate animals for use in research has been invaluable for decades in countless disease models since the first description of genetically manipulated mice in the late 1980s by martin evans oliver smithies and mario capecchi which led to the nobel prize in physiology or medicine the use of genetically modified animals has revolutionized biomedical research manis 2007 thomas and capecchi 1987 capecchi 2005 for immunologists the use of knockout and transgenic mice has been essential for determining the roles of cell types cytokines and transcription factors as well as providing valuable insights into things like immune memory and regulation manis 2007 genetically modified mice have become so common that commercially available transgenic and knockout mice for dozens of genes are readily available until recently gene targeting in hamsters has been limited due to the lack of a completely sequenced genome however fan et al have reported a crisprcas9 system for the targeting of hamster specific genes fan et al 2014 they were able to successfully target the stat2 gene of hamsters with reliable efficiency to produce stat2 knockout hamsters fan et al 2014 these hamsters have been subsequently used by others in an adenovirus model to show that type i ifn responses are critical in controlling adenovirus infection toth et al 2015 these are the first studies to report on and employ genetically modified hamsters these results show the potential for not only using stat2 knockout hamsters in studying disease models but also the potential to knockout other genes that play important roles in immune pathways these studies will hopefully serve as the first step in developing many more knockout and possible transgenic hamsters for use as models for infectious disease the growing use of hamsters in small animal models of disease has brought to light a glaring need for the development of hamster specific reagents for use in immunological assays the study of the immune response in nearly any disease model is critical for developing therapeutic options and an understanding of the disease course the number of available reagents for use in hamster models right now is not where it needs to be for sufficient insight into how these animals are protected from or develop disease table 3 as of now the best methods for immunological assays in hamsters are qrt-pcr for detection of expression of immune-related genes and elisa for the detection of humoral immune responses despite being used as an animal model for decades immunological tools for hamsters remains years behind other animal models such as mice rats and non-human primates for the full potential of hamsters as an appropriate disease model to be realized developing of many different hamster-specific tools for assays that are specific to hamsters need to be created
 the use of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies against immune markers and cytokines from other species has given researchers using hamsters a viable option for certain assays but the development of monoclonal antibodies that are hamster-specific for a variety of immune cell surface markers and cytokines would greatly improve upon the current state of immunological assays done in hamster models the production of hamster-specific monoclonal antibodies against common immune markers and cytokines should be number one on the wish list of anyone doing immunological assays with hamsters the ability to perform a plethora of techniques from elisa elispot flowcytometry and microscopy would increase greatly with the production of only a few dozen hamster-specific monoclonal antibodies in the coming years with the ability to produce monoclonal antibodies with increased efficiency and the increase in the use of hamsters as an animal model of diseases where understanding the immune response is critical antibodies for use in hamsters will hopefully see an increase in demand and production with the sequencing of the hamster genome and transcriptome we have seen the development of novel assays for use in hamster models like microarrays and kinome analysis via peptide arrays the first use of gene knockout hamsters has been reported these advances will hopefully open the flood gates in terms of what becomes available for researchers in the near future the recent sequencing projects that have gone on have given us the ability to uncover the gene sequences of many immune-related genes and the proteins that are encoded by them the demand for the reagents available for use in other species like mice and rats should increase by a large amount as hamsters become more and more popular as animal models of disease we now have the ability to develop the repertoire of reagents that is available in commonly used species the recent advances in hamster-specific immunological tools gives us reason to hope that soon researchers will have a number of assays at their disposal when conducting experiments in hamsters the use of hamsters as an animal model has increased greatly in recent years due to their ability to recapitulate human disease in models for diseases like hantavirus ebola virus nipah virus c difficile leishmania spp as well as cancers and atherosclerosis dillard et al 2010 jov et al 2013 woods et al 2015 da silva-couto et al 2015 kuehne et al 2014 safronetz et al 2009 2012 debuysscher et al 2013 ebihara et al 2012 the realization of hamsters as valuable animal models has led to their use in studying disease course for many pathogens however the lack of immunological reagents available for use in hamsters limits their value when it comes to developing therapeutic options vaccines and determining correlates of protection or immunopathogenesis of disease the methods available currently pale in comparison to those available for use in other species like mice rats and non-human primates and the ones that are available have many inherent disadvantages for hamsters to continue to grow into a common animal model of disease and one that can hopefully lead to important therapeutic and vaccine developments in the coming years as the number of available immunological reagents in this species needs to improve greatly  using dna metabarcoding for simultaneous inference of common vampire bat diet and population structure kristine bohmann shyam gopalakrishnan martin nielsen luisa nielsen dos gareth jones daniel streicker g m gilbert thomas   vampire bats occur in central and south america and are exceptional among mammals in that they subsist exclusively on blood greenhall joermann  schmidt 1983 greenhall schmidt  joermann 1984 greenhall  schutt 1996 the common vampire bat desmodus rotundus is one of three extant species of vampire bats chiroptera phyllostomidae desmodontinae greenhall et al 1983 before the introduction of domestic animals common vampire bat populations in latin america were likely small as the bats only source of bloodmeals presumably was large wild animals however the proliferation of domestic animals following european colonization created an abundant and reliable food source which seems to support larger population sizes of vampire bats costa  esbrard 2011 delpietro marchevsky  simonetti 1992 fenton et al 1992 voigt  kelm 2006 large populations of common vampire bats impact both human and animal health vampire bats are the primary reservoir of human and livestock rabies in latin america a virus which causes a universally lethal encephalitis and has a host range spanning all mammals delpietro lord russo  gurydhomen 2009 salmnmulanovich et al 2009 schneider et al 2009 warner et al 1999 vampire bats may also transmit trypanosome parasites to domestic horses and cattle reviewed by hoare 1965 and act as reservoirs and potential vectors of pathogenic bacteria and viruses bai et al 2012 brando et al 2008 lima et al 2013 sabinosantos et al 2015 volokhov et al 2017 although culling of vampire bats is a widespread practice for rabies control recent work has questioned its efficacy and costeffectiveness and instead advocated for vaccination of susceptible species and ecological strategies to prevent exposures anderson et al 2014 blackwood streicker altizer  rohani 2013 appropriate use of either strategy relies critically on knowledge of local vampire batprey interactions however existing methodologies to study vampire bat diet are limited stable isotope analyses of bat tissues have been commonly applied and can distinguish between domestic livestock and wildlife but are unable to distinguish prey at the species level streicker  allgeier 2016 voigt  kelm 2006 other studies using dna markers have been more specific but failed to identify prey in large proportions of samples and used timeconsuming approaches that do not easily scale to large data sets bobrowiec lemes  gribel 2015 carter coen stenzler  lovette 2006 ito bernard  torres 2016 this illustrates that while genetic approaches offer an attractive solution to reconstruct vampire bat diets with high specificity existing methods have not yet reached a technical level that would make them costeffective and efficient for largescale applications a second challenge for managing vampire battransmitted rabies is that transmission to humans wildlife and livestock is underpinned by metapopulation dynamics and travelling waves of infection within vampire bats benavides valderrama  streicker 2016 blackwood et al 2013 these complex spatial dynamics challenge prediction of localities at risk of rabies outbreaks however recent work has shown that genetic inference of vampire bat population structure can identify the future geographic pathways of ongoing epizootics streicker et al 2016 genetic tools for simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure are therefore desirable to forecast which areas rabies is likely to invade next and the species that will be at risk of spillover infection such information could together guide the timing and species to be targeted for vaccination moreover tools for largescale analysis of bat diet would help to forecast changes in human rabies risk following deforestation or huntingdriven declines in preferred prey or conversely how recovery of wildlife due to conservation efforts could reduce human rabies one potential solution to the technical limitations of previous studies of vampire bat diet is to draw on recently developed advances in biodiversity assessment linked to environmental dna edna where secondgeneration sequencing is applied to dna extracted from environmental samples such as soil water gut contents and faeces bohmann et al 2014 taberlet coissac hajibabaei  rieseberg 2012a ideally this approach would be applied to samples collected from vampire bat roost environments enabling analyses to be conducted over larger geographic scales without the need for timeconsuming capture and sampling of wild bats today the principal approach for sequencing informative dna in edna mixtures is the socalled dna metabarcoding approach in which 5nucleotidetagged primers binladen et al 2007 are used to pcr amplify mitochondrial minibarcodes of taxa within a taxonomic group taberlet coissac  pompanon 2012b the amplicons are subsequently sequenced in parallel on a secondgeneration sequencing platform after processing the resulting sequences taxa can be identified by comparing the obtained barcode sequences to dna reference databases valentini et al 2009 the ability to only sequence informative dna markers and to process and sequence many samples in parallel make metabarcoding a costeffective and efficient way to assess biodiversity furthermore if the dna reference database and chosen barcode marker allow it assignments can be made for prey down to the species level given this metabarcoding has experienced increasing popularity and is now used in biodiversity assessment eg chariton court hartley colloff  hardy 2010 and animal diet studies eg bohmann et al 2011 deagle kirkwood  jarman 2009 soininen et al 2009 metabarcoding has recently been applied to determine hosts of pathogentransmitting invertebrate bloodfeeders for example mosquitoes logue et al 2016 and sand flies kocher et al 2017 metabarcoding of vampire bat diet however represents a distinct methodological challenge compared to for example carnivores or generalist predators as the primers that target mammalian prey will inevitably also amplify bat dna in such studies predator sequences are in excess to a point where they can prevent detection of prey taxa eg deagle eveson  jarman 2006 shehzad et al 2012 to optimize detection of prey taxa they are often reduced through presequencing measures such as predator blocking primers deagle et al 2009 vestheim  jarman 2008 postsequencing remaining predator sequences are used to validate predator species identity after which they are discarded eg piol san andrs clare mir  symondson 2014 coamplified predator sequences might however offer an overlooked opportunity to get insights into predator population structure simultaneously with the diet analysis in this study we aim to determine whether metabarcoding diet analyses can be used to simultaneously study predator population structure and to evaluate metabarcoding as a method for largescale common vampire batprey detection at the species level in doing so we assess common vampire bat prey and population structure across the common vampire bats range in peru bloodmeal and faecal samples were collected from common vampire bats desmodus rotundus caught between 2009 and 2013 at 15 sites across three ecoregions in peru andes amazon and pacific coast figure 1a table s1a bat capture and bloodmeal sampling followed streicker and allgeier 2016 bats were captured using mist nets andor harp traps placed outside daytime roosts caves mines tunnels and hollow trees between 1800 and 0600 hr bats were caught at daytime roosts to avoid biasing dietary inferences by sampling bats near potential prey bobrowiec et al 2015 captured bats were anaesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine 83125 mgkg and a sterile 5french nasogastric feeding tube attached to an empty syringe

which they were pooled and sequenced with 230bp pairedend chemistry on an illumina miseq sequencing platform aiming at ca 15000 paired reads per pcr replicate sequence reads were initially trimmed for adapters consecutive stretches of ns and lowquality bases after which pairedend reads were merged using adapterremoval version 2 schubert lindgreen  orlando 2016 sequences within each library were sorted according to primer and tag combinations using a modified version of dame httpsgithubcomshyamsgdame zepedamendoza bohmann carmona baez  gilbert 2016 for each primer set thresholds for filtering sequences across each samples pcr replicates followed a restrictive approach and were guided by the negative and positive controls sequenced alberdi aizpurua gilbert  bohmann 2018 de barba et al 2014 sequences were clustered using sumaclust mercier boyer bonin  coissac 2013 with a similarity score of 096 and a maximum abundance ratio of 090 a contingency table of operational taxonomic units otus by samples was created for each primer set and copy numbers of otus were normalized across samples blastn altschul et al 1997 was used to compare the otus against the ncbi genbank database httpwwwncbinlmnihgov and the output was imported into megan community edition version 65 huson auch qi  schuster 2007 otus assigned to ascomycetes were removed from the coi data set in the contingency table otus were grouped into categories according to assigned taxonomy common vampire bat vertebrate prey and for coi invertebrates within each of the categories the proportion of sequences of each otu was calculated in each sample within otus assigned to common vampire bats vampire bat assignments to samples were made if an otu had 95 16s and 99 coi of sequences assigned to vampire bat otus in the sample erroneous otus were in lower frequency for the coi marker for vertebrate prey identifications a conservative approach for removing erroneous otus was used initially otus that never had 5 of sequences in any sample within the vertebrate category were removed following this vertebrate prey otus were assigned to samples if they had 10 of sequences bloodmeals and individual faecal samples and 05 of sequences pooled faecal samples of sequences within the vertebrate prey category only one invertebrate otu was identified and all assignments of this otu were retained taxonomic assignments of otus assigned to samples were made with either primer set and the ncbi genbank database httpwwwncbinlmnihgov and barcode of life database bold ratnasingham  hebert 2007 were used for taxonomic assignment of the 16s and coi otus respectively species assignments were made if both markers had 100 match to only the same species and genus assignment if either marker had 100 matches to several species within the same genus for invertebrates remaining otus generally had poor reference database coverage and identifications were made to taxonomic family level or higher taxonomic levels against all barcode records in bold for each overall area vampire bat vertebrate prey was visualized as pie charts on a map made in ggmap version 27 to assess intraspecific variation in the common vampire bats sequences from both primer sets were clustered with sumaclust mercier et al 2013 at 987 similarity which was found to balance clustering of erroneous sequences eg arisen due to pcr and sequencing errors with retrieval of intraspecific diversity the filtered amplicon sequences for each sample were mapped back using bwa version 0715 li  durbin 2009 to the otu centres detected using sumaclust the filtered reads that mapped to the otus assigned to common vampire bat were used to explore the intraspecific diversity for each marker within samples otu assignments with 2 of all sequences assigned to the sample were retained and presenceabsence of the 16s and coi common vampire bat otus were spatially visualized using ggmap version 2 prey availability was calculated based on the livestock density in a 000833 latitude  000833 longitude rectangle obtained from geo wiki httpwwwlivestockgeo-wikiorg for each site the prey availability was computed by averaging the densities in a 5  5 square grid around the sampling site the choice of the size of the grid around each site was guided by the observation in a previous study that the common vampire bats fly a nightly distance of 34 km on average wilkinson 1985 at this latitude the 5  5 grid corresponds approximately to a 45 km  45 km square for each area the prey densities were calculated by taking a union of the grid sites for each sampling site in the area prey preference was tested using the prey densities computed for each area as the prey densities were available for only a subset of the prey species detected in our data viz cow chicken pig and sheep the prey preference analysis was limited to these species for each area and for all areas combined the expected number of each of these prey was computed using the prey densities in that area and the total number of prey detections the number of observed prey in each area was calculated as the number of prey detections using metabarcoding subsequently prey preference was calculated using a pearsons chisquare goodness of fit test testing for agreement between the observed and the expected numbers of prey individuals from each prey species note that the results should be interpreted with care given the low expected numbers of some prey species as the number of chicken prey detections was low two total detections combined across all sites the prey preference was computed for only mammalian prey species cow pig sheep using the same method as described above primer choice is crucial in metabarcoding studies as the primers principally determine which taxa will get sequenced although both the 16s and coi markers detected common vampire bat in almost all samples 983 and 992 respectively table s1b the relative abundance of common vampire bat sequences was higher for the longer coi marker both within samples figure 2a and for all samples combined figure 2b as such fewer prey sequences could be assigned when using the coi primer set figure 2b with obvious consequences for prey detection power for example while the 16s primer set detected prey in 907 of samples the coi marker only detected prey in 822 of samples table s1b furthermore while for the 98 cases in which mammal prey was detected both markers identified the same taxa the 16s primers enabled 16 additional mammalian prey detections while the coi primer set only enabled three additional mammalian prey detections figure 2c this difference was to some extent outweighed by the ability of the coi primer set to detect birds arthropods and nematodes figure 2bc the combined detections of the 16s and coi primer sets identified common vampire bat in all 118 samples and vertebrate prey in 932 of the samples table 1 in samples with no vertebrate prey detections only common vampire bat dna was detected by the 16s primer set while the coi primer set either detected only common vampire bat or common vampire bat and ascomycetes in bloodmeal and individual faecal samples with vertebrate prey detections generally only a single prey taxon was identified whereas two or three prey taxa were identified in pooled faecal samples collected from roost environments table 1 cows were the most frequently detected prey species in all sampled areas regardless of ecoregion figures 1b and 3 pigs and sheep were also preyed upon in all ecoregions while donkey horse chicken and the only wild species detected tapir were preyed upon only in specific ecoregions figures 1b and 3 tapir was detected in four of the 13 individual bats from the amazonian mdd130 site a species accumulation curve showed that vertebrate prey detections reached a plateau after around 80 samples after which adding more samples to the analysis did not increase the number of prey species detected figure s1a this suggests that at the time of sampling the vampire bats in these localities did not rely on a more diverse prey base than what was detected for all sites combined there were fewer chicken detections in the prey than what would be expected based on numbers of chicken available while cows and pigs were overrepresented in the diet compared with availability table s1d when narrowing prey preference investigations to mammals alone cow pig and sheep more cows were detected than would be expected based on abundance while sheep were underrepresented table s1e operational taxonomic units from five arthropod and one parasitic nematode taxon were detected by the coi metazoan primers in twelve common vampire bat samples table 2 arthropod dna was detected in both bloodmeal and faecal samples in a third of the collection sites in all three ecoregions and in samples with different vertebrate prey taxa table 2 we also detected a nematode in the bloodmeal from a hairylegged vampire bat diphylla ecaudata table s2 suggesting that the ability to detect nematodes likely infecting the bat might not be unique to common vampire bats as the dna reference database coverage for the south american arthropods and nematodes is not comprehensive the taxonomic level of otu assignments spanned from genus to phylum however identifications at the lowest taxonomic levels were to arthropod taxa that are ectoparasites on vertebrates or nematodes table 2 intraspecific diversity was identified among common vampire bat mitochondrial sequences for both the 16s and coi marker two haplotypes were identified for the 16s marker and three for the coi marker figure 4 the level of observed differentiation was high with 65 difference between the two 16s haplotypes 6bp difference over the 92bp fragment and 192799 pairwise differences between the three coi haplotypes 6 to 25bp difference over the 313bp fragment figure s1b within sampling locations individual bats had the same haplotypes figure 4 our results show clear phylogeographic structure of the mitochondrial coi and 16s markers in the common vampire bat in peru the 16s and coi haplotype 2 were restricted to the coastal sites while at the nine southern collection sites in the andes and amazon the 16s and coi haplotype 1 cooccurred in all bats figure 4 bats at the three collection sites in the western slopes of the andes in northern peru were the only ones to harbour the third coi haplotype figure 4 we detected a high proportion of vampire bat dna compared with prey dna and our results indicate that the prey dna was fragmented as the relative abundance of common vampire bat sequences was generally higher and prey detection lower for the longer marker coi figure 2 these observations are not uncommon in metabarcoding diet studies predator dna is generally in excess even to the point that it swamps the prey dna eg deagle et al 2006 shehzad et al 2012 one approach to reduce pcr amplification of predator dna is to use predator blocking primers deagle et al 2009 vestheim  jarman 2008 although coblocking of prey has been reported piol mir gomezpolo  agust 2015 we could not design common vampire batspecific blocking primers due to high intraspecific variation in the common vampire bat and the lack of reference sequences for potential prey species instead we optimized amplification of prey dna in the metabarcoding pcrs both low amounts of template and pcr inhibitors such as coextracted heme compounds akane matsubara nakamura takahashi  kimura 1994 can limit pcr amplification and thereby sequencing of taxa that are in low proportions andor are not well amplified by the primers chandler fredrickson  brockman 1997 murray et al 2015 polz  cavanaugh 1998 therefore we carried out an initial qpcr screening to ensure that we added the maximum template amount to the metabarcoding pcrs without causing pcr inhibition murray et al 2015 shapiro  hofreiter 2012 additionally we used the qpcr to determine the minimum number of pcr cycles to be run in the metabarcoding pcr to minimize pcr stochasticity and bias against poorly amplified taxa piol et al 2015 polz  cavanaugh 1998 furthermore we used relatively short mitochondrial markers to optimize detection of fragmented prey dna deagle et al 2006 and we used two different markers in order for their prey detections to supplement each other for each marker three pcr replicates were made per sample to reduce effects of pcr stochasticity and optimize prey detection and error removal during bioinformatic processing alberdi et al 2018 polz  cavanaugh 1998 these measures enabled us to overcome challenges in using metabarcoding to assess the diet of a bloodfeeding predator that is in the same taxonomic group as its prey without the use of blocking primers and to detect vertebrate prey in 932 of samples table 1 which far exceeds previous dnabased vampire bat diet studies that detected prey in 2550 of samples analysed bobrowiec et al 2015 carter et al 2006 ito et al 2016 consistent with earlier studies we identified both domestic and wild animals in the diet of the common vampire bats but generally found domestic animals to be the main prey eg bobrowiec et al 2015 carter et al 2006 ito et al 2016 streicker  allgeier 2016 voigt  kelm 2006 which is unsurprising given the high density and accessibility of domestic animals in our study mammal prey by far outweighed chicken detections figures 1b and 3 furthermore when comparing detected prey with numbers of available vertebrate prey we found fewer chicken detections in the prey than what would be expected based on chicken availability while cows and pigs were overrepresented in the diet compared with availability table s1d although these analyses do not account for differences in biomass these findings are in agreement with those of a study in brazilian amazonas that found that even though chicken was the most attacked prey pigs were highly preferred in relation to prey availability which suggested a preference for mammalian prey bobrowiec et al 2015 however when we compared preferences for only cow pig and sheep the bats did not have obvious preferences for pigs table s1e while avian dna was rare in common vampire bats and restricted to chickens in our study figure 3 three additionally analysed samples from hairylegged vampire bats only contained birds including both domestic chickens and two wild bird taxa the spixs guan penelope jacquacu and tinamous tinamus sp supporting information s2 to our knowledge birds other than chicken have not previously been identified in any vampire bat species bloodmeal or faeces few wildlife species have previously been identified among the prey of vampire bats and all exclusively in the common vampire bat namely sea lions catenazzi  donnelly 2008 lowland tapirs tapirus terrestris and red brocket deer mazama americana galetti pedrosa keuroghlian  sazima 2016 we identified tapir tapirus sp in bloodmeals from four of 13 analysed bats in the mdd130 site in the amazon figure 1 based on the employed markers we could not determine which tapir species the bats had fed on but geographic distributions of tapir species indicate that it can have been lowland tapir tapirus terrestris identifying tapir in about a third of the bats at this site indicates that tapirs might be a reliable and accessible food source for the vampire bats here tapirs are commonly hunted by amazonian communities where they occur and can be rapidly depleted due to their slow reproductive rates peres 2001 if the bats rely on tapir this creates a potential conflict between bats and humans for food if tapir populations are depleted by human hunting bats might shift to other wild mammals or humans which would have consequences for disease transmission patterns and risks as mentioned we also detected wildlife in two of three additionally analysed bloodmeal samples from hairylegged vampire bats table s2 which further indicates the bats dependence on wildlife in this site although we did not detect human dna a previous study at this site recorded frequent bat bites on humans streicker  allgeier 2016 currently no other method exists that can identify domestic and wild prey to low taxonomic levels across large numbers of vampire bats thereby metabarcoding enables future studies to for example assess how much vampire bats rely on cooccurring wildlife how bat diet and consequently risk of disease transmission is altered following for example hunting or environmental change and to determine vampire bat vertebrate prey taxa over large geographic scales and use it to inform projections of disease transmission apart from vertebrate prey metabarcoding allowed detection of arthropods in the faecal and bloodmeal samples although vampire bats are thought to subsist only on vertebrate blood bobrowiec et al 2015 carter et al 2006 ito et al 2016 sparse documentation of arthropods in common vampire bat stomachs does exist arata vaughn  thomas 1967 greenhall 1972 this information was obtained through invasive measures while our metabarcoding study allowed detection of arthropods without sacrificing the bats our study indicates that consumption of arthropods by common vampire bats is a widespread and relatively common phenomenon furthermore metabarcoding confirmed the arthropods to be ectoparasitic taxa when dna reference databases were sufficient to identify dna to low taxonomic resolution our high observed frequency and geographically widespread nature of this phenomenon are unsurprising given that common vampire bats have high levels of infection by ectoparasites and engage in self and allogrooming patterson dick  dittmar 2008 carter  leffer 2015 reviewed in greenhall et al 1983 detected arthropods are therefore likely ectoparasites ingested during grooming aguirre herrel  van damme 2003 greenhall 1972 however it is also conceivable that ectoparasites might be ingested while the bats feed from vertebrate prey which if confirmed would support the hypothesis that blood feeding in vampire bats might have evolved from a previous specialization on ectoparasitic arthropods of larger animals arata et al 1967 fenton 1992 gillette 1975 lastly it is worth mentioning factors which should be considered when interpreting the metabarcoding diet results first more than one individual prey can only be detected if they are different species second multiple vampire bats can consume blood from the same prey individual even on the same night greenhall schmidt  lopezforment 1971 meaning that detection of for example four tapir feeding events does not necessarily indicate that four tapirs were present and fed upon finally prey detected in an individual bat might not be prey that was directly preyed upon by the bat itself as common vampire bats regurgitate and share bloodmeals with roost mates that did not manage to feed wilkinson 1984 despite these limitations our results show that metabarcoding is an efficient tool for highthroughput molecular characterization of variation in the feeding behaviours of vampire bats and that it can reveal both vertebrate prey arthropods and gut parasites if a broad taxonomic marker is chosen whereas our study relied on secondgeneration sequencing previous studies on common vampire bat population structure have relied on sanger sequencing eg clare lim fenton  hebert 2011 streicker et al 2016 in contrast to sanger sequencing that produces one sequence per marker per sample metabarcoding produces thousands of sequences of which some carry errors such as those arising during pcr and sequencing see eg alberdi et al 2018 we used filtering approaches and otu clustering to optimize reliability of the resulting sequences alberdi et al 2018 but in contrast to otu clustering with the aim to approximate species equivalents we clustered at a high similarity to balance detection of intraspecific variation with identifying only real intraspecific variation this metabarcoding methodology can be extrapolated for simultaneous assessment of diet and predator population structure in metabarcoding diet studies of other predators in which predator dna is coamplified with the prey and where the marker has intraspecific variation for the predator in our study both employed markers had clear geographic structure for the common vampire bat figure 4 the mitochondrial markers from all bats from the coastal sites west of the andes were distinct from bats at other sites for the 16s haplotype they differed with 6 bp from the other identified 16s haplotype and for the coi they differed with 23 and 25 bp from the two other coi haplotypes figure 4 and s1b this indicates that the andes act as a barrier for dispersal at least for female vampire bats mitochondrial geographic structure has been reported in the common vampire bat in the cytochrome b ditchfield 2000 martins ditchfield meyer  morgante 2007 martins templeton pavan kohlbach  morgante 2009 streicker et al 2016 and coi region clare 2011 hernndezdvila et al 2012 for the coi the reported intraspecific sequence divergence is compared with what we detected some have suggested that high mtdna differentiation indicates the presence of cryptic common vampire bat species martins et al 2007 but less marked geographical structure in nuclear markers suggests that populations are not entirely isolated clare 2011 martins et al 2009 streicker et al 2016 the high sitespecificity in mtdna but not in nuclear markers can be explained by the social organization of the bat where female offspring stay in their natal group unless their mothers die or move while males disperse wilkinson 1985 streicker et al 2016 studied population structure of the common vampire bat in peru using a cytochrome b marker and revealed more haplotypes than the two 16s and three coi haplotypes detected in the present study figure 4 this can be explained by the higher intraspecific variability of the cytochrome b region hajibabaei singer clare  hebert 2007 tobe kitchener  linacre 2011 if a more finescaled haplotype assessment is needed in future studies a cytochrome b marker should therefore be used it is important to note that the caveat of using mitochondrial markers is that it limits inference of population structure to females in the case of the common vampire bat that has malebiased dispersal and where males have been linked to disease spread this limits the power of mitochondrial markers for prediction of spread of vampire battransmitted pathogens streicker et al 2016 for this purpose nuclear metabarcoding markers should be used to complement the mitochondrial population structure streicker et al 2016 however for other research questions and purposes the ability to use metabarcoding to simultaneously screen many samples for diet and be able to infer mitochondrial population structure free of charge can open up novel insights to achieve this obviously requires choosing a study animal and populations with intraspecific mitochondrial diversity within a relatively short marker furthermore it requires careful primer selection to choose metabarcoding markers with the desired level of intraspecific diversity for the predator while optimizing amplification of diet taxa in the present study most bloodmeal and faecal samples were collected from individual vampire bats caught in the wild which is intrusive to bats and sets a limit on how many samples can be collected however a few pooled faecal samples were collected noninvasively from underneath roosting bats and as we showed prey can be identified from such samples table 1 future studies could exploit this noninvasive sample collection technique to scale up vampire bat diet and population structure assessments to larger numbers of samples however if this method is pursued it is worth keeping in mind that pooled data will preclude conclusions about the number of individual bats represented without further analysis of bat identities using higher resolution genetic markers furthermore pooled data do not allow quantification of the relative proportion of prey consumed by individual bats exemplified by the common vampire bat we show that metabarcoding diet studies can simultaneously assess predator population structure and a wide range of prey taxa adaptation of this methodology will enable future animal ecology studies to to some extent offset the tradeoff between metagenomics and metabarcoding by harnessing the ability of metabarcoding to process many samples costeffectively while extending detections beyond presenceabsence of expected diet taxa when designed carefully this approach can thereby yield an efficient scalable and noninvasive assessment of population structure and diet which can potentially yield novel insights in future animal diet studies for the common vampire bat we showcase metabarcoding as a method for largescale screening of diet taxa importantly with a higher success rate than previous dnabased methods and for simultaneous assessment of common vampire bat population structure this methodology can be used to obtain novel and noninvasive insights into common vampire bat ecology through coupling of dietary findings and population structure and to inform projections of which species are at risk of spillover infection by vampire battransmitted pathogens such as rabies thereby this analytical tool can aid development of strategies for control of vampire battransmitted rabies to humans wildlife and livestock for instance with regard to vaccination of susceptible prey species which relies on knowledge of local vampire batprey interactions the study was

preparedness lessons learned and future directions for education results from focus groups conducted at the 2006 apic conference terri rebmann judith english f ruth carrico   the authors developed the questions for this study all members of the association for professionals in infection control and epidemiology inc apic who were registered for the 2006 national apic conference were invited to participate in the focus groups regardless of age race gender or work location within or outside the united states the only inclusion criteria were attendance at the 2006 apic conference and participation in a disaster response in the past the authors recruited potential participants via phone calls and e-mail one focus group met each day in a meeting room located in a hotel near the conference site on june 11 12 and 13 2006 a meal was provided to the participants as an incentive for their participation the nominal group method was used to elicit information on the topics of interest3 the focus group method of using opening-ended questions was used to elicit details from participants experience with disaster response as to why those categories were chosen and lessons learned from past disasters4 participants were informed that information collected would remain anonymous and that all responses were voluntary focus group sessions were audiotaped and the tapes were transcribed verbatim content analysis included identifying coding and categorizing participants response to the questions of interest in addition major themes that emerged were identified and categorized quotations that characterize the major themes are reported the words enclosed in brackets of the quotations are used to explain the respondents quotes and are not the participants words subjects demographic data were obtained for descriptive statistics the institutional review boards of st louis university national naval medical center and university of louisville approved this study apic headquarters funded the costs of the focus groups and audiotape transcription one of the most frequently cited topics of importance to disaster planning was the need for better infection control in community-based shelters focus group participants from a variety of types of disasters indicated that infection control was lacking in crowded shelters and that this contributed to secondary disease transmission 
infection control in shelters is important we had a child in a shelter in alabama not hurricane katrina but prior to that with meningitis and theyd been there for several hours and no one realized they had been there we needed fast treatment to prevent secondary spread and there were outbreaks of diarrhea in the shelterswhen they set up these shelters they really dont have any idea about what theyre going to do for hundreds and hundreds of people to accommodate handwashing and provide restroom facilities
 focus group participants listed some specific infection control issues that must be addressed in shelters such as overcrowding foodborne illness lack of restroom facilities inadequate environmental cleaning procedures and products difficulty assessing disease outbreaks in shelters inability to isolate potentially contagious patients and too few hand hygiene supplies by far lack of hand hygiene supplies or the inability to perform hand hygiene was the most frequently cited infection control issue in community-based shelters icps recommended that disaster planners arrange to have a dedicated individuals for hand hygiene and infection control in alternate care sites 
in disasters there ought to be people that are just responsible for hand hygiene i know we talk about it in the hospitals and we push it push it push it but really in a disasterhand hygiene is probably the most important thing
 icps stressed the need to perform real-time assessments during disaster response including general disaster response needs as well as disease surveillance 
in shelters and out in the community you need to go and see do they need food do they need child care do they need deceased care you know what do they need do they need an ambulance to get someone to a higher level of careyou have to come up with a list of what everyone needs to run a clinic how many bottles of disinfectant do we need how are you going to mix it where are you going to store it
 icps also discussed the difficulty in assessing disease outbreaks during disaster response even in noninfectious disease emergencies 
you know the thing about disasters is that you see a lot of diseases that you dont get normallyone of the major problems i had immediately post hurricane-katrina was trying to assess exactly what were my problems because i was trying to assess all these er emergency room patients through the influxsurveillance has to be on-going for us we had 4200 evacuees from new orleans that came to our area and very shortly after they came we started experiencing gastroenteritis among them it spread into the health care workers the people who were managing the clinic the evacuation center we needed to dig out from what the surveillance told us about what was going on and try to get everybody back on track
 many focus group participants stated that they and their hospitalfacility are extremely concerned about surge capacity 
well for our area hospitals are already at capacity theres not a hospital in my city that has the room to take people into it if theres a disasterwe were a small hospital and we literally had to go into lockdown after the disaster struck we had to be conservative in who we took otherwise we would not have been available at all
 one component of surge capacity that was stressed was staff surge capacity or the ability of a facility to have sufficient numbers of staff to handle an influx of patients comments such as staffing is going to be a major issue illustrated the importance of this issue to participants the number of available staff was mentioned as contributing to a facilitys ability to stay open and provide patient care or halt routine procedures to accommodate disaster victims 
the biggest problem ive seen after a disaster hitsand ive responded to many different kinds of disastersis the staff wanting to leave so your facility staff has just gone home to do something for their home or to be with their family and your nurses are trying to get out the doors and only a basic crew is remaining so how do you continue with your current everyday operations when your staff just leftsurge capacity is a big issue because weve got to switch over to responding to the disaster and then which of our routine services can we stop and when do we need to restart those services
 the issue of staff surge capacity was most evident in infectious disease disasters such as the 2003 sars outbreak 
lack of staff during the sars outbreak was a major issue because staff didnt want to come inbecause nobody knew what was going on except we had this unknown bug that was killing people and quite a few actually 44 of the positive corona virus infections were in health care workers so we were really having to deal quite a bit one-on-one with the staff to convince them to stay and we were there pretty long24 hours of the day
 however staffing became an issue anytime a communicable disease outbreak occurred during disaster response one participant described the difficulty in getting staff to go work at a community-based shelter after an outbreak of gastrointestinal disease had been detected there 
we had to make sure that people were willing to go back to the center after they heard about the problems we were having with the outbreaks the staff were thinking you go in there youre going to get sick 
 focus group participants discussed the importance of monitoring and managing employee health and safety issues during disaster response doing so will have the advantage of maximizing staff surge capacity by keeping staff able to continue working without contributing to secondary disease spread icps mentioned a number of employee health issues such as monitoring staffs mental health holding daily staff meetings to communicate how they were doing providing adequate time for rest and sleep having appropriate personal protective equipment and ensuring food safety one important component of employee health and safety is to teach staff to protect themselves before attempting to rescue disaster victims as one participant explained you have to take care of your staff sometimes you have to stop what youre doing which in our case was evacuating patients from flooded areas because the staff was getting injured if health care staff does not protect themselves before entering a potentially dangerous situation youve got more casualties than when you started another participant described a situation in which a physician could have potentially harmed himself by not following the appropriate procedures during a response to a possible anthrax incident 
the doctor had some white powder on himself because he wasnt following the right protocol and he didnt know what he was supposed to ask or doso he said to the patient let me see and then he got the powder on himself
 employee health and safety includes the need to monitor staff for development of infection during an infectious disease emergency infected staff can contribute to secondary spread of disease and should be furloughed if they develop signs of infection one participant described the challenge of monitoring and managing staff for infection especially during disaster response when staff shortages are common 
for pandemic flu planningtheyre talking about how do you evaluate the nurse who arrives for his or her shift febrileand even more challenging is what im hearing about influenza 30 to 50 of people who are contagious are asymptomatic youre going to be short staffed to start with and now youve got a febrile nurse so you call the employee health nurse and what happens next
 one icp described her hospitals procedure for monitoring and managing staff during the 2003 sars outbreak 
we actually had somebody at the door of the hospital every single door or port of entry into our facility and we have a 1500-bed facility so at every entrance it was either locked or there was somebody there monitoring people they took everybodys temperature coming into the facility if you were febrile you went home no ifs ands or buts about it you went home
 focus group participants discussed many problems and challenges related to the chain of authority in disaster response and use of the incident command system ics problems included a general lack of knowledge or experience with ics inability of responding agency leaders to function within ics in noncommander positions and reluctance on the part of individuals in command positions to make decisions comments such as i think that incident command is not very well-known or understood in general outside of first responder groups indicated that participants feel that hospital and public health staff needs additional training on ics a frequently heard complaint was the difficulty of trying to function within the ics when responding agency leaders were assigned to noncommander positions this led to mixed messages being communicated to staff and general confusion because no one knew who was in charge this problem was mentioned in relation to a variety of disasters 
we had the major blackout in new york city and  nobody knew who to answer to nobody knew who was responsible who was in chargei think it all goes back to  the chain of command and who really is in charge if you dont know whos in charge of your facility and 3 people are trying to make a decision and they each have their own little miniagenda its confusing  dc is a phenomenal example of a jurisdiction with many responding agencies  theres many many many chiefsafter hurricane katrina  everybody wanted to be in charge but then when they were in charge nobody knew what they wanted to do
 although the ics is intended to streamline disaster response communication and reporting focus group participants pointed out that it only works when staff know the system and everyone follows the system appropriately participants also discussed the advantages to the ics and the importance of being in compliance they stressed that responding agencies should be educated regarding why they need to follow the ics one participant suggested explaining the financial appeal of following ics to a facility to get everyone on board 
if you dont ask for supplies from logistics within the ics if you dont go through your local emergency management agency to ask for any resources you need then you lose any hope of even applying for federal disaster reimbursement
 focus group participants discussed many education topics on which icps should be trained these topics are outlined in table 3 comments such as the training is going to depend on the type of disaster it is  one size doesnt fit all and biological casualties  are very different from other disasters  you have very different issues altogether indicated that participants believe that there are some topics that are specific to infectious disease emergencies and that icps should be trained on these focus group participants frequently mentioned just-in-time training as vital to an effective disaster response participants indicated that all responding staff will require some level of training during the disaster response but they also stressed that disaster planners need to think outside the box in terms of the groups for which they plan just-in-time training one participant described it in this way 
its not going to be health care workers that were going to be just-in-time training with its probably going to be college students  so they can train the other volunteers or it  may be families teaching families how to care for each other
 participants indicated that just-in-time training can improve disaster response by decreasing dependency on the health care system allowing health care to focus on the truly ill victims they also stressed that it must involve public service announcements and should be coordinated through the ics public information officer these announcements should include information on what is recommended whether people should shelter in place whether people should go to the er or not participants felt that communicating this information and training to the public will prevent 10000 people from  showing up at your hospital focus group participants stressed that it is important to have education or reference materials that do not rely on electricity because power outages may occur after disasters they emphasized that disaster responders need education or reference tools that are rechargeable in some way other than electricity such as a personal digital assistant pda that uses batteries another option suggested by focus group participants was to have paper versions of reference materials and notebooks for recording information one participant described it this way 
when we thought hurricane katrina was coming we started bringing a bunch of notebooks and we walked out the door with those and then we were out of power for weeks those notebooks were the only things we had 
 focus group participants discussed the importance of icps partnering with public health in disaster preparedness because icps are often the liaison between public health and hospitals in a community participants indicated that establishing a partnership between hospitals and public health enhances the entire communitys ability to respond more effectively during a disaster icps who had responded to various types of disasters mentioned this lesson learned 
i think we learned from the last hurricane that infection controls interface with the county health department is so important they become your best friend i think thats a huge lesson and i think that if we learned nothing else from that hurricane we learned thati think its critical that both infection control and public health get together and start way up front knowing who the people are that are working at the health department in the kind of areas that are going to affect you and we in health departments have to find our partners in the private side so we get disaster planning done up front and we know each other and we plan together
 icps also stated that partnering with public health would bridge gaps in public healths knowledge of infectious disease emergency planning and foster the reciprocal sharing of information icps felt that some public health professionals are not very well trained on communicable disease issues because theyre so stretched in everything they have to cover they dont necessarily have the expertise in infection control and infectious diseases in all of the public health departments across the country one participant stated that public health frequently calls their hospital during a disaster and asks can you help us out with what we should tell the public about this and this and this icps felt that they should share their expertise of infection prevention and control knowledge with public health which would result in a better prepared community shared training and participating together in disaster exercises were mentioned as 2 ways that icps could share information and education with public health participants indicated that working together through disaster exercises and training programs would strengthen the relationship between public health and icps one participant described it in this way training and exercising together made everybody on the same level and everybody gets along better now after that one challenge participants identified that was unique to infectious disease emergencies was the difficulty in maintaining staff compliance and trust in the face of changing practice recommendationsstandards this was most evident in infectious disease emergencies involving a new agent such as sars or in a new situation such as anthrax used in a bioterrorism attack as opposed to naturally occurring disease icps indicated that disasters involving an element of the unknown and frequent changes to practice as likely to create an evolution of fear and mistrust in health care workers and first responders 
my facility is still trying to get rid of chemical decontamination suits thats what we used to respond to sars because on easter sunday that was the only piece of equipment that we could get a lot of in a very short period of time so of course now we have these chemical decontamination suitswhich arent used for infectious diseasesand were trying to educate our responders why they arent necessary and of course our unions and everybody is saying well were not going to be protected because now youre taking this piece of equipment away from us three years later this is what were dealing withits difficult to change health care workers way of thinking they think well we wore n95 respirators for patients with sars and now its very difficult to try and say well you dont need to do that anymore you are protected with this surgical mask 
 focus group participants indicated that the fear of a potential avian influenza pandemic is causing many education and planning challenges in their facility and community one of the biggest challenges is related to the unknown mechanism of transmission for avian influenza resulting in conflicting guidance that has been released and the recommendation to change isolation precautions midway during the response to an outbreak 
the california plan for responding to avian influenza actually says while we are not sure were going to use n95s early in the outbreak  once were sure how it is transmitted then were going to use surgical masks i just cant wait to see how our health care workers are going to take the changing standardthe first responders are also a concern in planning for avian influenza because they want to wear the full hazmat gear they look at avian influenza as an unknown ive been saying to them what do you do during seasonal flu and they respond nothing 
 focus group participants stressed that changing recommendations and standards also have legal and ethical considerations the general public does not always understand why medication recommendations such as postexposure prophylaxis for anthrax change and this can be interpreted as discrimination in that it appears that health care and public health are providing a lower standard of care for different victims one participant described the challenges and potential legal consequences of changing recommendationsstandards midway through disaster response this way 
it became a real issue after the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism attack with the lawsuits that we had lawyers said why did you do this why did you do that it was all very confusing
 another participant described the difficulty in providing adequate follow-up care for victims when the recommendations change midway through the response 
our physicians got really aggravated with changing standards because we had 3000 people affected and 100 of them would come to the hospital at a time for treatment and then they go back to their facility  and you have a health department come in and they would change the regimen and it was impossible to follow-up on earlier cases
 the focus group discussions provided several important findings information provided by the focus group participants highlights a number of educationalreference materials that are needed for future disasters most of these consist of quick reference materials such as checklists templates charts tool kits and algorithms participants recommend that these materials be available in paper versions or electronically using products such as pdas that do not require electricity so that they may be accessed during times when electricity is not available participants also provided a list of educational topics for icps mass casualty incidents infection control during disasters communication incident command physical plant needs improving health care worker basic knowledge of how infectious organisms are transmitted and business continuity issues were all identified as being essential training topics icps role in disaster preparedness and response is considered to be essential regardless of whether it is an infectious disease emergency such as outbreak of an emerging infection or bioterrorism or a natural disaster such as a hurricane or earthquake although icps are essential to disaster preparedness and response icps indicate that participation is not always easy icps role in disaster response can be complicated by a lack of supplies inability to conduct real-time surveillance difficulty in communicating information between facilities too few staff need to provide training to non-health care individuals and challenges in functioning within the ics disasters involving an element of the unknown such as an outbreak of a new or reemerging pathogen increase the difficulty in response changing standards and recommendations must be communicated carefully to prevent mistrust among the staff andor the general public failure to do so can impinge on a facility or communitys ability to mount an effective disaster response another notable finding from this study is that even natural disasters can result in significant public health crises if infection prevention and control strategies are not implemented rapidly and appropriately infectious disease outbreaks following disasters can devastate a community and icps expertise is needed to help prevent secondary spread within alternate care sites as well as their facility to be most effective icps need to partner with public health professionals in their region before a disaster and establish strong linkages between hospitals and community agencies these partnerships can strengthen facility preparedness and maximize a communitys ability to respond to a disaster they should also result in stronger health care and public health systems by strengthening surveillance communication and basic infection prevention and control needed for day-to-day duties as well as disaster situations overall the focus group method of inquiry served as a valuable tool in eliciting rich detailed information about icps opinions of lessons learned from past disasters structured surveys with closed-ended responses opposed to the open-ended questions used in this study may have revealed different opinions about references materials needed for future disasters and educational priorities for icps it is not known whether the icps who chose to participate differed from those who were eligible but chose not to participate it is also not known whether icps who have no experience with disaster response may have provided different answers compared with experienced icps in terms of preferred training topics and reference materials however this study was designed to elicit information from those who have responded to an actual disaster to identify gaps in preparedness in real situations rather than simulated events in disaster drills icp preparedness for all types of disasters especially infectious disease emergencies has become essential this study identifies lessons learned from past disasters and highlights gaps in disaster preparedness most in need of being addressed infection control in mass casualty incidents behavioral health issues communication incident command and maintaining quality of care in suboptimal situations disaster planners must continue to address gaps in disaster preparedness one way to accomplish this is through the creation and distribution of icp-specific educational tools and reference materials for disaster preparedness and response the topics identified by experienced icps should be used as the basis for these new educational initiatives  andes and prospect hill hantaviruses differ in early induction of interferon although both can downregulate interferon signaling hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps is a severe respiratory disease which is thought to result from a dysregulated immune response to infection with pathogenic hantaviruses such as sin nombre virus or andes virus andv other new world hantaviruses such as prospect hill virus phv have not been associated with human disease activation of an antiviral state and cell signaling in response to hantavirus infection were examined using human primary lung endothelial cells the main target cell infected in hps patients phv but not andv was found to induce a robust beta interferon ifn-beta response early after infection of primary lung endothelial cells the level of ifn induction correlated with ifn regulatory factor 3 irf-3 activation in that irf-3 dimerization and nuclear translocation were detected in phv but not andv infection in addition phosphorylated stat-12 levels were significantly lower in the andv-infected cells relative to phv presumably this reflects the lower level of irf-3 activation and initial ifn induced by andv relative to phv to determine whether in addition andv interference with ifn signaling also contributed to the low stat-12 activation seen in andv infection the levels of exogenous ifn-beta-induced stat-12 activation detectable in uninfected versus andv- or phv-infected vero-e6 cells were examined surprisingly both viruses were found to downregulate ifn-induced stat-12 activation analysis of cells transiently expressing only andv or phv glycoproteins implicated these proteins in this downregulation in conclusion while both viruses can interfere with ifn signaling there is a major difference in the initial interferon induction via irf-3 activation between andv and phv in infected primary endothelial cells and this correlates with the reported differences in pathogenicity of these viruses spiropoulou christina f  albario csar g

kreikemeyer peter valentin-weigand sven hammerschmidt   in recent years the human microbiota is more and more recognized to play a crucial role in pathogenesis of many diseases weinstock 2012 the upper respiratory tract is a natural niche for potentially pathogenic bacteria embedded in commensal communities forming the nasopharyngeal microbiome in particular the microbial communities of the nasopharynx hilty et al 2012 are associated with respiratory diseases ie severe pneumonia which are responsible for substantial mortality and morbidity in humans worldwide prina et al 2016 the composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiome is highly dynamic biesbroek et al 2014abc and many factors including environmental and host factors can affect microbial colonization koppen et al 2015 recent studies on neonates have shown that the respiratory microbiota develops from initially maternally transmitted mixed flora with predominance of streptococcus viridans species to niche-specific bacterial profiles containing mostly staphylococcus aureus at around 1 week of age bosch et al 2016a between 2 weeks and 6 months after birth the staphylococcal predominance declines and colonization with streptococcus pneumoniae pneumococci as a predominant pathobiont emerges miller et al 2011 bosch et al 2016ab the dynamic microbiome composition is guaranteed through the interplay between bacterial species other microbes and changing environmental conditions as well as hostbacteria interactions blaser and falkow 2009 most of the time the microbiome and its interplay with the human host are believed to be beneficial for both pettigrew et al 2008 murphy et al 2009 however imbalances in microbial composition can lead to acquisition of new viral or bacterial species and invasion of potential pathogens which in turn can become detrimental especially in elderly people and children with an exhausted or immature immune system pettigrew et al 2008 blaser and falkow 2009 murphy et al 2009 one particular example showing imbalances introduced by single dosage of antibiotics was demonstrated by ichinohe and colleagues ichinohe et al 2011 while commensal respiratory microbiota facilitated immune-support against influenza a virus infection iav oral treatment with antibiotics resulted not only in a shift of bacterial composition but also in impaired cd4 t- cd8 t- and b-cell immunity following infection with iav in mice ichinohe et al 2011 analyses of human oropharyngeal microbiomes during the 2009 h1n1 iav pandemic revealed that at the phylum level the abundance of fermicutes and proteobacteria was augmented in pneumonia patients as compared to healthy controls leung et al 2013 however another study published in the same year contradicted these results chaban et al 2013 chaban and colleagues analyzed microbiomes of 65 patients from h1n1 iav outbreak in 2009 although the phylogenetic composition of pneumonia patients was dominated by fermicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria no significant differences between the patients and healthy controls or any other variables tested including age and gender were observed chaban et al 2013 in this review we discuss secondary bacterial infections of the respiratory tract after primary infection by iav with a focus on mechanisms by which these interactions are potentially mediated and we will provide insight into the host contribution and immunological consequences we further focus on potential animal models suitable for mimicking asymptomatic bacterial colonization and disease progression and thus enabling to study adaptation strategies viral-bacterial interactions and immune responses in these highly lethal co-infections influenza a viruses belong to the family of orthomyxoviridae and based on the antigenicity of their haemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na they are classified into 16 classical ha and 9 classical na subtypes neumann et al 2009 the 8-segmented genomes of influenza a viruses are characterized by a significant plasticity due to point mutations and re-assortment events new variants or strains with epidemic or pandemic potential emerge neumann et al 2009 in addition influenza can be transmitted between animals including swine birds horses and humans making it a zoonotic disease van der meer et al 2010 seasonal influenza usually resolves without consequences in healthy individuals however it is estimated that seasonal influenza effects 510 of the worlds population resulting in about 250000 to 500000 deaths annually tjon-kon-fat et al 2016 at greater risk to develop secondary bacterial pneumonia are individuals with comorbidities elderly people age  65 pregnant women and children under the age of one rothberg et al 2008 for a long time it was considered that the h1n1 strain an avian-like h1n1 virus directly caused most of the fatalities during the 19181919 pandemic spanish flu often from a hemorrhagic pneumonitis rapidly progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death osterholm 2005 gerberding 2006 oxford et al 2006 the pandemic killed around 50 million people worldwide and remains unique in its severity compared to other big outbreaks however many of the findings have been reinterpreted in recent years brundage and shanks 2007 chien et al 2009 it is estimated that around 95 of all severe cases and deaths were attributed to secondary infections with bacterial pathogens most predominantly by streptococcus pneumoniae morens et al 2008 individual studies limited to certain regions identified also other pathogens commonly colonizing the respiratory tract including staphylococcus aureus group a streptococcus gas and haemophilus influenzae brundage and shanks 2008 during the next two pandemics h2n2 asian flu 1957-1958 and h3n2 hong kong flu 1968-1969 bacterial co-infections were less likely the cause of death compared to the spanish flu giles and shuttleworth 1957 trotter et al 1959 still pneumonia accounted for about 44 of deaths during the asian flu giles and shuttleworth 1957 most fatalities resulting from pneumonia occurred in individuals with chronic conditions ie chronic lung diseases rheumatic carditis and hypertension giles and shuttleworth 1957 in 19571958 s aureus was predominantly isolated from fatal pneumonia cases hers et al 1957 1958 robertson et al 1958 martin et al 1959 whereas s pneumoniae returned as predominant cause of severe pneumonia during the hong kong flu sharrar 1969 bisno et al 1971 burk et al 1971 schwarzmann et al 1971 forty years later in 2009 a novel h1n1 virus of swine origin emerged and caused again a pandemic dawood et al 2009 2012 in contrast to asian and hong kong flu mortality rates were rather low but most deaths occurred in healthy young individuals with no underlying conditions reichert et al 2010 monsalvo et al 2011 dawood et al 2012 about 2550 of severe or fatal cases were linked to complications due to bacterial pneumonia dominguez-cherit et al 2009 estenssoro et al 2010 mauad et al 2010 shieh et al 2010 although regional variations occurred pneumococci and s aureus were the most frequently isolated bacterial species mauad et al 2010 shieh et al 2010 rice et al 2012 group a streptococcus was absent in many local pneumonia outbreaks associated with viruses but was predominant in others brundage and shanks 2008 ampofo et al 2010 when it does appear it is typically third in incidence chaussee et al 2011 overall data on pandemic outbreaks suggest that disease severity and mortality can be linked to secondary bacterial pathogens with variations depending on regions and state of immunity of the population brundage and shanks 2008 shanks et al 2010 2011 mccullers 2013 there is increasing evidence that the nasopharyngeal microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute viral respiratory infections teo et al 2015 de steenhuijsen piters et al 2016 rosas-salazar et al 2016ab respiratory viruses including iav have been shown to alter bacterial adherence and colonization leading to an increased risk of secondary bacterial infections tregoning and schwarze 2010 pneumococci s aureus and gas are important human gram-positive pathogens all of them are frequent colonizers of the human nasopharynx and they share many features including pathogenic mechanisms and clinical aspects figure 1 however they also have unique properties staphylococcus aureus colonizes persistently about 30 of the human population and typical niches include nares axillae and skin peacock et al 2001 von eiff et al 2001 van belkum et al 2009 they cause a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from mild skin infections to fatal necrotizing pneumonia in the last decades the pathogen became resistant to an increasing number of antibiotics and methicillin-resistant s aureus mrsa is now a major cause of hospital acquired infections hartman and tomasz 1984 ubukata et al 1989 zetola et al 2005 also the rise of community-acquired s aureus strains is of special concern because certain clones are associated with very severe infections rasigade et al 2010 recent prospective studies demonstrated an increase in proportion of community-acquired methicillin-sensitive s aureus in severe pneumonia cases mccaskill et al 2007 sicot et al 2013 the pneumococcus is a typical colonizer of the human nasopharynx about 2050 of healthy children and 830 of healthy adults are asymptomatically colonized mccullers 2006 pneumococci cause diseases ranging from mild ie sinusitis conjunctivitis and otitis media to more severe and potentially life-threatening infections including community-acquired pneumonia bacteraemia and meningitis bogaert et al 2004 valles et al 2016 this bacterium is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in risk groups such as immunocompromised individuals children and elderly black et al 2010 valles et al 2016 group a streptococci colonize the mouth and upper respiratory tract in about 25 of worlds population okumura and nizet 2014 the most common non-invasive and mild infections caused by gas are tonsillitis and pharyngitis with estimated 600 million cases per year carapetis et al 2005 listed as number nine in the list of global killers with around 500000 deaths annually carapetis et al 2005 it is obvious that this pathogen can cause severe invasive infections including pneumonia sepsis streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing skin infections cunningham 2000 carapetis et al 2005 although all three pathogens are able to cause highly lethal diseases the most fatal remains the pneumococcus estimated to cause ca 10 of all deaths in children below 5 years of age obrien et al 2009 in the elderly marrie et al 2017 and in immuno-compromised individuals baxter et al 2016 influenza a virus binds via ha to either 23- or 26-linked sialic acid at the surface of epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract webster et al 1992 seasonal strains show usually affinity to 26-linked sialic acids that are expressed in the human trachea whereas avian-like viruses preferentially bind to 23-linked sialic acids of alveolar type ii cells shinya et al 2006 van riel et al 2007 2010 the release of viral genomic rna into the cytosol activates different immune response pathways binding of viral rna to retinoic acid inducible gene 1 induces the expression of type i and iii interferons and activates transcription factor nf-b which in turn activates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines durbin et al 2013 iwasaki and pillai 2014 in addition inflammasome activation leads to the release of il-1 and il-18 pothlichet et al 2013 iwasaki and pillai 2014 all these responses are supposed to promote viral clearance however the presence of viral proteins during infection induces also direct activation of the intrinsic or indirectly the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in apoptosis or even necrosis of the epithelium korteweg and gu 2008 furthermore aberrant coagulation induced by virus infection causes a hyper-inflammatory response yang and tang 2016 all these events contribute to lung tissue injury imai et al 2008 davidson et al 2014 the epithelial damage due to viral replication provides a beneficial environment for initial bacterial attachment plotkowski et al 1993 on the other hand already colonized bacteria might enhance influenza virus virulence either by directly secreting proteases that cleave and activate ha figure 2 bottcher-friebertshauser et al 2013 or indirectly by activating host proteases such as plasminogen which increases replication rates and infectivity of the virus scheiblauer et al 1992 tse and whittaker 2015 potentially pathogenic bacteria including the three species mentioned above express an arsenal of virulence factors responsible for attachment to human host structures microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules mscramms such as pspc pspa and psaa in pneumococci hammerschmidt 2006 spa fnba clfa and clfb in s aureus bartlett and hulten 2010 otto 2010 and m-protein prtf1 and prtf2 in gas cunningham 2000 respectively and so-called moon-lightning proteins expressed by all three species eg gapdh enolase or pgk fulde et al 2013 enable the bacteria to attach to damaged cells or molecules of the extracellular matrix including fibronectin fibrin fibrinogen and collagens or fibrinolytic proteins like plasminogen mccullers and rehg 2002 bergmann and hammerschmidt 2007 linke et al 2012 siemens et al 2012 voss et al 2012 once the initial attachment occurs bacterial cytotoxins including pneumolysin of pneumococci garcia-suarez mdel et al 2007 zahlten et al 2015 -hemolysin and leukocidins of s aureus mairpady shambat et al 2015 and streptolysins s and o and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b of s pyogenes tsai et al 1998 gurel et al 2013 siemens et al 2015 2016 can synergize with viral counterparts to further increase lung tissue pathology additional potential mechanisms by which the initial colonization of the lower respiratory tract and lung tissue damage might occur include potentiation of the development of pneumonia by iav neuraminidase through enzymatic removal of sialic acid from the lung thus exposing host receptors for pneumococcal adherence mccullers and bartmess 2003 the host inflammatory state in response to viral infection can alter presentation of receptors on the surface thus allowing bacterial invasion cundell and tuomanen 1994 as the patient begins to recover from viral infection secondary bacterial infections might occur louria et al 1959 due to the incomplete wound healing and exposure of host membrane components including laminin collagens type i and iv to classical bacterial mscramms louria et al 1959 puchelle et al 2006 epithelial cells are the first responders to infections in the lung followed by the tissue resident alveolar macrophages they promote viral clearance via phagocytosis efferocytosis and release of cytokines and chemokines to promote immune responses hashimoto et al 2007 kumagai et al 2007 wang et al 2012 hillaire et al 2013 respiratory viruses like iav are able to induce suppression and killing of the resident alveolar macrophages figure 2 ghoneim et al 2013 these cells are usually replaced by differentiation of recruited blood derived monocytes into macrophages of different polarization patterns this in turn creates a delay in pathogen clearance and opens a window for host susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections colloquially named superinfections ghoneim et al 2013 in addition induction of interferons as a response to viral infection compromises the immune sensing of gram-positive bacteria by neutrophils and macrophages which would normally clear the bacteria from the lungs figure 2 sun and metzger 2008 tian et al 2012 the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still not understood several studies suggested that viral rna activates toll-like receptors tlr 2 and tlr4 and consequently the production of type i interferons to promote an antiviral state shahangian et al 2009 the subsequent infection with gram-positive bacteria eg pneumococci enhances the type i interferon expression which in turn suppresses production of the ccl2 chemokine and recruitment of macrophages nakamura et al 2011 another study by shahangian et al 2009 revealed that the antiviral state leads to impaired production of neutrophil chemoattractants cxcl1 and cxcl2 which in turn promotes less effective immune responses due to attenuated neutrophil functions during the early phase of pneumococcal invasion other studies found that iav exposed lungs had impaired natural killer nk cell responses in the airway to subsequent s aureus infection small et al 2010 reduced tnf production by nk cells was identified as a crucial upstream mechanism of depressed antimicrobial activities by alveolar macrophages figure 2 small et al 2010 it seems likely that iav na is also able to activate host cell receptors in a tgf- dependent manner which in turn promotes gas invasion and subsequent lung pathology li et al 2015 in vitro studies on the interplay between iav-pneumococci and human dendritic cells revealed tlr3 as a crucial sensor of viral and bacterial rna leading to enhanced il-12p70 production which in turn might promote an anti-viral state by upregulation of interferons yamamoto et al 2004 spelmink et al 2016 however it should be noted that depending on the bacterial species the disease manifestation and underlying innate immune responses might vary sharma-chawla et al 2016 a lot of the experimental studies on disease mechanisms and immune responses are based on a subsequent bacterial infection within hours or a few days post iav infection however bacterial infiltrations of the lungs might occur much later ie during the onset of wound healing after partial clearance of iav which has been reported in most studies performed in recent years snelgrove et al 2008 hussell and cavanagh 2009 these processes are characterized by a general anti-inflammatory state and suppression of mechanisms involved in pathogen clearance due to increased interleukin-10 production van der sluijs et al 2004 metzger and sun 2013 the anti-inflammatory state suppresses the expression of pattern recognition receptors prr on professional phagocytes leading to impaired phagocytosis and killing of microbes these events might allow bacterial overgrowth in the lungs and tissue pathology sun and metzger 2008 goulding et al 2011 like other severe infectious diseases caused by single agents pneumonia is characterized by hyper-inflammatory conditions of the lungs at the onset of infection followed by a hypo-inflammatory state with immune paralysis morton et al 2014 in co-infections after initial inflammation in response to viral infection the situation might worsen due to bacterial invasion and enhanced cellular infiltration of the lungs by neutrophils leading to an increased tissue damage and cytokine storm figure 2 conenello et al 2007 mcauley et al 2007 2010 porto and stein 2016 furthermore the coagulation system becomes activated and contributes to the pathophysiological response to infection van der poll and herwald 2014 bacteria like pneumococci s aureus and gas can activate and modulate the coagulation system leading to extensive expression of tissue factor and increasing the risk of severe coagulopathy nguyen et al 2012 shannon et al 2013 walters et al 2016 bacterial pathogens also express a variety of cytolytic toxins that can contribute to inflammation and tissue pathology pneumolysin a pneumococcal pore-forming toxin with low affinity to lung epithelial cells can damage neutrophils by utilizing p2x7 receptor domon et al 2016 staphylococcal cytotoxins -toxin and leukocidins including panton-valentine leucocidin pvl are associated with severe tissue pathology strong upregulation of chemokines and increased neutrophil influx of the lungs mairpady shambat et al 2015 gas toxins including slo and speb are capable of directly causing tissue damage and promoting pro-inflammatory states through neutrophil lysis snall et al 2016 uhlmann et al 2016 the cytolytic effects caused by bacterial toxins might synergize with the outcome of iav cytotoxic accessory protein pb1-f2 mediated tissue pathology leading to enhanced cytokine production ramos and fernandez-sesma 2012 taken together most likely synergistic effects of the pathways that are involved in bacterial and viral inflammation lead to enhanced immune activation and higher morbidity and mortality joyce et al 2009 koppe et al 2012 ramos and fernandez-sesma 2012 bucasas et al 2013 kuri et al 2013 figure 2 summarizes the interplay between virus bacteria and host experimental animal models are a useful tool to study in vivo effects of different infectious agents and they represent approximately 3 of all pneumonia research published in peer-review journals hraiech et al 2015 however the constant increase of animal studies in the last decades is in contrast to their reproducibility in humans hackam and redelmeier 2006 hackam and colleagues identified 2000 articles published between 1980 and 2006 in seven leading scientific journals that regularly publish animal studies hackam and redelmeier 2006 seventy-six out of 2000 were highly cited with a median citation count of 889 out of these 76 studies 28 were replicated in human randomized trials 14 were contradicted and 34 remained untested hackam and redelmeier 2006 only 14 of the animal studies published in high-impact journals were translated in human randomized trials hackam and redelmeier 2006 whereas about 44 replication rate was reported for highly cited human studies ioannidis 2005 in pneumonia models mammalians are mostly used because of their anatomical and physiological proximity to humans hraiech et al 2015 to monitor extensive physiological studies larger mammalian species including ferrets dogs rabbits pigs and baboons are the models of choice mizgerd and skerrett 2008 however rodents and in particular mice are used more frequently as a pneumonia model organisms rapid reproductive rate small size less complicated handling the ability to reproduce and compare results with already published bacterial and viral mono-infections detailed knowledge of genetics and immune responses and a plethora of available reagents to study infections in mice are reasons for the use of these animals to avoid variations in responses due to genetic diversity inbred mice strains are useful tools for studies aiming to elucidate molecular mechanisms of diseases in addition genetic engineering allowed to generate a wide variety of mouse variants with gain-of-function loss-of-function or reporter genes mizgerd and skerrett 2008 as outlined above many in vivo mice studies on bacterial and viral co-infections provided useful insights into severe pneumonia including i the fact that viral infection primes the host for bacterial susceptibility leading to severe secondary infection hashimoto et al 2007 shahangian et al 2009 chaussee et al 2011 nakamura et al 2011 ii pathogen synergism tsai et al 1998 mccullers and rehg 2002 garcia-suarez mdel et al 2007 gurel et al 2013 mairpady shambat et al 2015 zahlten et al 2015 iii enhanced inflammatory response at the onset of infection korteweg and gu 2008 durbin et al 2013 pothlichet et al 2013 iwasaki and pillai 2014 leading to increased alveolar damage followed by immune paralysis with defective clearance of microorganisms shinya et al 2006 van riel et al 2007 2010 and iv host receptor availability for sustained bacterial infection louria et al 1959 plotkowski et al 1993 cundell and tuomanen 1994 puchelle et al 2006 korteweg and gu 2008 however mouse models for bacterial andor viral infections have several limitations most of the bacterial and viral species under study are human pathogens in recent years it was also shown that host genetic variations and sex differences have an impact on predisposition severity and outcome of infection chella krishnan et al 2015 2016 while c57bl6 and balbc mice are characterized by a higher resistance dba2 strains are more susceptible and permissive to bacterial and viral strains alymova et al 2011 chella krishnan et al 2015 2016 in addition transmission of iav and bacteria is inefficient in adult mice thus requiring alternative animal models including neonatal mice or ferrets diavatopoulos et al 2010 mccullers et al 2010 iav was shown to be essential for pneumococcal transmission from colonized mice to their naive littermates and the transmission occurred only when all mice were infected with iav diavatopoulos et al 2010 the facilitated transmission of pneumococci after iav infection was confirmed by mc cullers et al in ferrets mustela putorius furo mccullers et al 2010 the pneumococcal disease manifestation and transmission between animals was enhanced if animals had previously been infected with iav mccullers et al 2010 ferrets are naturally susceptible to iav isolated from different species including humans birds and swine thangavel and bouvier 2014 the infection of ferrets with human seasonal iav isolates results in an upper respiratory tract infection similar to human influenza infection tripp and tompkins 2009 in contrast to mice non-adapted human iav can be used for the infection unfortunately there are only few reports on bacterial and iav co-infections in this model organism a report by sanford and ramsay showed enhanced staphylococcal colonization of the upper respiratory tract in iav infected animals as compared to non-infected while no difference between both groups was observed in group b streptococcal infection sanford and ramsay 1987 in contrast smith and mc cullers reported lack of establishment of staphylococcal infection even when ferrets were pre-infected with iav smith and mccullers 2014 the biggest advantages of using ferrets as a model include i their susceptibility to non-adapted human pathogens ii efficiency in transmitting iav and bacteria from one individual to another and iii presentation of the clinical signs of disease manifestation akin to human influenza infection unfortunately their limited availability complex husbandry and limited accessibility to ferret-specific reagents makes this research difficult to perform bouvier and lowen 2010 in recent years the guinea pig cavia porcellus was also used in pneumonia research the physiology and anatomy of the guinea pig lung resembles to a certain extent the human lung and this model organism is often used in non-infectious lung diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease canning and chou 2008 in addition its commercial availability ease of husbandry the ability to work with non-adapted pathogens and the efficiency of transmission are reasons for using this in vivo model bouvier and lowen 2010 guinea pigs are susceptible to human avian and swine influenza viruses although viral replication can be readily detected upon intranasal inoculation in the upper respiratory tract and the lungs guinea pigs exhibit only minor clinical symptoms lowen et al 2006 gabbard et al 2014 however the lung pathology of human iav infected guinea pigs correlates with the clinical severity of human infection gabbard et al 2014 transmission of pneumococci in guinea pigs is promoted by co-infection with sendai virus saito et al 1988 guinea pigs infected with pneumococci alone and cage-mated with non-treated contact animals transmitted the bacteria only in 7 of cases while sendai-virus infected co-housed guinea pigs acquired pneumococcal infection in 83 of contacts saito et al 1988 another study evaluated antibiotic efficacy in invasive pulmonary infection caused by penicillin resistant pneumococcus ponte et al 1996 intra-tracheal instillation of 3  109 cfu of s pneumoniae induced a fatal pneumonia and bacteremia in 85 of untreated animals within 46 h ponte et al 1996 as with ferrets there is a paucity of data describing immune responses to pulmonary infectious agents this is in parts due to the lack of species specific reagents which is a disadvantage in using this model organism recently the cotton rat sigmodon hispidus was reported to be susceptible to iav nasal and pulmonary infection in adult inbred cotton rats did not require viral adaptation ottolini et al 2005 the infection led to increased breathing rates accompanied by weight loss and decreased body temperature replication of iav was more extensive in nasal tissues than the lung and persisted for six consecutive days tissue pathology included damage of bronchiolar epithelium and the animals developed pneumonia which persisted for nearly 3 weeks ottolini et al 2005 in bacteriological studies rats are more frequently used there are numerous rat models investigating the impact of diabetes oliveira et al 2016 metabolic syndromes feng et al 2015 cirrhosis preheim et al 1991 pharmaco-kinetics and dynamics antonopoulou et al 2015 hoover et al 2015 intoxication davis et al 1991 immunization iinuma and okinaga 1989 and general bacterial virulence factors shanley et al 1996 on development of pneumococcal streptococcal and staphylococcal pneumonia and lung pathology unfortunately there are only few studies on bacterial and viral co-infections in rats the first was performed by harford et al 1946 harford et al 1946 the authors concluded that the secondary bacterial pneumonia does not convert the sub-lethal viral infection to a lethal outcome harford et al 1946 another study on human respiratory syncytial virus and s pneumoniae revealed that rats were easily colonized with pneumococci but viral replication after subsequent infection was strain dependent in addition neither pneumococci nor the virus spread from the upper to the lower respiratory tract and neither pathogen was transmitted to naive cage mates nguyen et al 2015 although rats share a lot of immune features with humans including nitric oxide production by macrophages carsillo et al 2009 the biggest disadvantages are low animal availability aggressiveness of the species and the lack of specific reagents rabbits oryctolagus cuniculus are well known for their use in studying cardiovascular diseases antibody production and eye research rabbits were also employed to study pneumonia although only a few models are available typical read-out parameters include survival leukocyte infiltration of the lungs lung pathology and assessment of drug concentration in serum one of the first studies on pneumococcal pneumonia in rabbits was performed in kline and winternitz 1913 this study revealed that rabbits possess an active immunity if they have recovered from one attack of experimental pneumonia and they may subsequently resist repeated intra-tracheal dosages of pneumococci kline and winternitz 1913 in 1926 an infection by inhalation of type i pneumococci was established in rabbits stillman and branch 1926 the bacteria infiltrated easily the lower respiratory tract and pneumococci which reached the lungs usually disappeared within hours and fatal septicemia appeared in some of the animals stillman and branch 1926 most recent rabbit models of pneumococcal and staphylococcal pneumonia are based on intra-bronchial or intra-pulmonary infections which make them useful for pathogenesis diep et al 2010 2017 as well as drug efficiency and efficacy studies cabellos et al 1992 croisier-bertin et al 2011 however this infection route requires surgery and species-specific reagents are scarce in iav research rabbits are frequently used for antibody production and for studies on antibody kinetics following single or multiple iav administrations loza-tulimowska et al 1977 also rabbits are used for safety investigations of vaccines eg covaccine ht or aflunov heldens et al 2010 gasparini et al 2012 in recent years the shedding of avian iav by cottontails sylvilagus spp was investigated revealing that nasally and orally inoculated cottontails shed relatively large quantities of viral rna root et al 2014 notably low viral titers were found to be sufficient to initiate viral replication in cottontails root et al 2017 however despite their susceptibility to iav infection rabbits are only rarely used as model for iav pathogenesis since they offer no improvement over other established infection models macaques represent the major non-human primate for studying infectious diseases they are omnivorous and adaptable the species most commonly used are rhesus macaques macaca mulatta and cynomolgus macaques macaca fasciluraris although it was shown early that macaques were susceptible to iav saslaw et al 1946 the animal models of choice remained ferrets and mice recently macaques have been used to compare the pathogenesis of highly virulent 1918 pandemic iav and the pathogenic bird flu strain h5n1 with a conventional h1n1 strain rimmelzwaan et al 2001 cynomolgus macaques infected with highly pathogenic h5n1 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome fever and necrotizing pneumonia rimmelzwaan et al 2001 the 1918 iav strain induced dysregulation of the antiviral response leading to insufficient protection of the host which in turn resulted in acute respiratory distress and a fatal outcome kobasa et al 2007 the 2009 pandemic h1n1 us isolate caused severe pathological lesions in the lungs of the macaques itoh et al 2009 the three studies mentioned above used combined intra-tracheal delivery of high doses of virus a recent study by marriott et al analyzed the outcome of challenge routes including inhaled aerosol and intra-nasal instillation with low to moderate doses of h1n1 in cynomolgus macaques marriott et al 2016 virus replication was detected in all challenge groups although the disease remained sub-clinical in bacteriological studies non-human primates are rarely used for group a streptococcal infection longitudinal transcriptome analyses were performed in experimental pharyngitis virtaneva et al 2005 and lower respiratory tract infection in cynomolgus macaques olsen et al 2010a the lower respiratory tract disease observed in macaques after gas infection mimicked the clinical and pathological features of severe bronchopneumonia in humans olsen et al 2010a another study by olsen and colleagues analyzed the contribution of pvl of a highly virulent usa300 s aureus strain in respiratory infection olsen et al 2010b although the lower respiratory tract disease observed in monkey mimicked the clinical and pathological features of early mild to moderate pneumonia in humans no involvement of pvl in lung pathology or immune cell influx of the lungs could be detected olsen et al 2010b the same research group has developed a non-lethal iav h3n2-s aureus co-infection model in cynomolgus macaques kobayashi et al 2013 pneumonia progression was monitored by clinical parameters assessment blood chemistry nasal swabs and pathology of the lungs seasonal iav infection in healthy cynomolgus macaques caused mild pneumonia but did not predispose the animals to subsequent severe infection with the usa300 clone kobayashi et al 2013 although macaques are frequently used for evaluation of pneumococcal vaccine efficacy including testing the impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine on antigen-specific memory b cell repertoires jia et al 2017 only two studies on pneumococcal carriage and pneumonia were conducted in the last decade in 2013 philipp and colleagues analyzed the carriage rate of pneumococcus in 158 colony animals none of the surveyed rhesus macaques carried s pneumoniae in the nasopharynx philipp et al 2012 the authors concluded that rhesus macaque is probably not a natural host of pneumococci but when infants were colonized with 19f strain via nasopharyngeal instillation the colonization was induced in eight of eight infants lasted for 2 weeks in all animals and for 7 weeks in more than 60 philipp et al 2012 the same group tested detoxified pneumolysin dply and pneumococcal histidine triad protein d phtd as potential vaccine candidates to prevent pneumonia denoel et al 2011 after immunization the rhesus macaques were challenged with a 19f pneumococcal strain as02-adjuvanted phtd-dply vaccine protected the animals against s pneumoniae-induced pneumonia which was linked to the capacity i to greatly reduce bacterial load within the first week post-challenge and ii the levels of phtd- and ply-specific antibodies denoel et al 2011 although only a few macaque studies on pneumonia exist due to the close proximity to humans in terms of physiology and immunity these animals can be a good model in the context of translational studies evaluating therapeutics and prophylaxis despite the wide use of different animal models the optimal in vivo model for human pneumonia remains to be identified small mammals including rodents are well known from a biological genetic and immunological point of view and are easy to maintain the choice of these particular animals for infectious disease studies is often a result of a compromise between technical and financial options however they are also far from humans anatomy physiology immunology and susceptibility to exclusively human pathogens the experimental animal model should be chosen based on responses comparable to humans primates are usually legally reserved to specific topics in this case pigs could be an appropriate model system for studying infectious diseases including pneumonia figure 1 the composition and size of the porcine genome is comparable to that of humans hart et al 2007 in addition human and porcine organs have many common features and functions swindle et al 2012 the upper respiratory tract of humans and pigs including the lymphoid tissue in the nasopharynx is anatomically similar furthermore like humans pigs possess tonsils which are absent in mice horter et al 2003 a major advantage of studying infectious diseases by utilizing pigs as a host organism is that pigs have a full set of innate and adaptive immune effectors according to whole genome sequencing results the porcine immune system resembles over 80 of the human immune system whereas mice share less than 10 with humans dawson et al 2016 most of the immune cell compartments identified in humans are also present in pigs piriou-guzylack and salmon 2008 fairbairn et al 2011 in contrast to mice and similar to humans pigs have 5070 of circulating polymorph nuclear cells fairbairn et al 2011 in addition all functional cytokines or orthologs involved in th1 th2 th17 and treg paradigm and corresponding immune cells have been described in pigs murtaugh et al 2009 kaser et al 2011 kiros et al 2011 especially the very prominent human pro-inflammatory chemo-attractant cxcl8 is present as an ortholog in pigs whereas there is no homologue in mice fairbairn et al 2011 in contrast to human monocytes which can be divided in three subclasses classical cd14cd16- non-classical cd14cd16 and intermediate cd14cd16 porcine monocytes consist of four subclasses chamorro et al 2005 fairbairn et al 2013 like human monocytes they express adhesion molecules such as vla-4 and lfa-1 and co-stimulatory molecules including cd80 and cd86 chamorro et al 2005 the pig has previously been used to mimic a number of human infectious diseases examples for s aureus infections with this model organism are wound infections sanden et al 1989 svedman et al 1989 osteomyelitis jensen et al 2010 and sepsis nielsen et al 2009 intravenous inoculation of piglets with pneumococci led to bacteremia during a 5 days period and was associated with fever and septic arthritis intranasal inoculation of piglets led to colonization for at least six consecutive days without causing clinical signs de greeff et al 2016 in addition research on respiratory infections of pigs by human pathogens including s aureus luna et al 2009 mycobacterium tuberculosis gil et al 2010 bordetella pertussis elahi et al 2007 pseudomonas aeruginosa luna et al 2009 and iav khatri et al 2010 was performed in recent years the fact that pigs and humans are infected with identical subtypes of iav h1n1 h3n2 and show similar clinical presentation and pathogenesis makes pigs an ideal model organism for studies on respiratory co-infections van reeth et al 1998 especially iav infections are already well established in swine van reeth et al 1998 2002ab jung et al 2007 khatri et al 2010 barbe et al 2011 in addition to the limited number of publications on pigs and human pathogens a lot can be translated and learned from studies on the porcine zoonotic pathogen streptococcus suis s suis usually inhabits mucosal surfaces of tonsils nares genital and alimentary tract of piglets once the microbial balance is disturbed the bacteria can cause meningitis septicemia arthritis and pneumonia in pigs staats et al 1997 some s suis strains are considered to be hyper-virulent and others hypo- or avirulent in general serotype 2 is most frequently isolated from diseased pigs staats et al 1997 s suis can also cause severe diseases in humans including septicemia meningitis arthritis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome tang et al 2006 yu et al 2006 gottschalk et al 2007 although many in vivo studies on s suis have been performed by utilizing mice as a model organism seitz et al 2012 auger et al 2016 several other studies have shown the advantage of using swine as a natural host for s suis bi et al 2014 ferrando et al 2015 a recent publication by lin and colleagues on h1n1 and s suis co-infected piglets demonstrated the synergistic effects of both pathogens lin et al 2015 co-infected piglets had more severe clinical presentation and pathological changes in the lung as compared to animals infected with single pathogens lin et al 2015 in addition genes associated with immune responses inflammatory cytokine production and apoptotic pathways were highly overexpressed in the co-infected group lin et al 2015 although the porcine model seems to be ideal to mimic human infectious diseases there are also disadvantages including eg requirement for specialized experimental animal facilities time consuming management high maintenance costs and limited availability of transgenic animals although the use of animals contributes greatly to our understanding of infectious diseases human 3d-organotypic tissue models and ex vivo organ tissues should be considered as they are most valuable tools to study hostpathogen interactions in a more complex setting figure 1 tissue engineering approaches were originally focused on regenerative medicine langer and vacanti 1993 in contrast to standard monolayer cell cultures tissue models much more closely resemble the 3d architecture cellular composition and matrix complexity of the respective organ in recent years tissue engineering was also successfully employed in a number of studies in infectious diseases including zika virus infections of cerebral organoids lancaster et al 2013 dang et al 2016 helicobacter pylori infections of gastric epithelial organoids mccracken et al 2014 schlaermann et al 2016 escherichia coli and rotavirus infections of gastrointestinal and small intestinal enteroids saxena et al 2015 vandussen et al 2015 entamoeba histolytica or hepatitis b virus infections of hepatic sinusoid tissue petropolis et al 2014 2016 group a and g streptococcal or staphylococcal infections of skin tissue models siemens et al 2015 2016 mairpady shambat et al 2016 and staphylococcal and andes hantavirus infections of human lung tissue mairpady shambat et al 2015 sundstrom et al 2016 the adaptability of these tissue-engineered models to multiple pathogens suggests a great potential for studies of infectious diseases for instance the lung tissue model relevant for pneumonia consists of lung fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix with a stratified epithelial layer on top nguyen hoang et al 2012 the engineered tissue is suitable for implanting and studying immune cells including dendritic cells monocytes macrophages and even peripheral blood mononuclear cells nguyen hoang et al 2012 mairpady shambat et al 2015 a recent publication demonstrated a two-hit-event of lung pathology in staphylococcal necrotizing pneumonia mairpady shambat et al 2015 while the -toxin had direct damaging effect on the lung epithelium pvl induced lung pathology indirectly through the lysis of neutrophils mairpady shambat et al 2015 all the studies mentioned above highlight a significant progress in the field of infectious diseases not only from a scientific point of view but also by contributing to the three r principle of animal experimentation russell 1995 on these terms the use of cultured ex vivo human organ biopsies which are rare due to ethical considerations is an additional option to study hostpathogen interactions this ex vivo system may overcome even the limitations of the engineered tissue in recent years human ex vivo lung tissue infections with various microorganisms including pneumococci szymanski et al 2012 fatykhova et al 2015 bacillus anthracis chakrabarty et al 2007 haemophilus influenzae zhang et al 2016 and iav nicholls et al 2007 chan et al 2009 were performed in the human setting most of the work focused on tropism severity of infections release of inflammatory mediators and replication rates of the microorganisms in addition recently also experiments on swine influenza virus siv and s suis co-infections of the porcine ex vivo lung slices were reported meng and colleagues showed that siv promotes subsequent bacterial infections in a two-step process of which the first initial step was dependent on capsule expression whereas the second step of bacterial invasion into deeper layers was capsule-independent and required virus-mediated damage meng et al 2015 however this is just a beginning and more investigations are needed to unravel the complexity underlying these highly invasive infections in summary bacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract are highly lethal and present a dramatic burden for the global health system the synergy between bacterial and viral infectious agents is related to a variety of factors including epithelial barrier damage exaggerated innate immune response and cytokine storm despite many advances in recent years more knowledge on mechanisms and immunology of disease progression is needed the synergistic mechanisms between viruses and bacteria leading to enhanced morbidity and mortality are poorly understood in vivo characterizations of these severe infections are mainly performed in mice which poorly resemble the human physiology and immune system several efforts have been made to establish other models including ferrets guinea pigs rabbits rats and non-human primates however all have limitations here we suggest using the porcine model which provides obvious advantages in studies of human infectious diseases and should be considered much more frequent for future studies on severe infectious diseases including pneumonia ns conceived the concept for this review

financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest  ecology of neglected rodent-borne american orthohantaviruses nathaniel mull reilly jackson tarja sironen kristian forbes m   due to their direct noticeable impacts on humans certain viruses tend to receive relatively large amounts of research attention members of the coronaviridae sars-cov mers-cov and now sars-cov-2 filoviridae ebola and marburg virus flaviviridae west nile and zika virus lyssaviridae rabies and paramyxoviridae hendra and nipah virus families contain several dangerous human pathogens that have emerged in recent decades and have resulted in extensive research attention while studying such viruses is important there are an untold number of other pathogens that persist among humans and wildlife that receive little to no attention 1 even in high-profile viral groups a disproportionate amount of attention is given to the viruses that are known to cause disease in humans highlighted by the current global response to sars-cov-2 due to unforeseeable circumstances such as host-switching events eg influenza virus human immunodeficiency virus 2 exposure to new viruses via landscape encroachment eg hendra virus 3 nipah virus 4 and changes in host or virus geographic range due to climate change species introduction or migration events eg zika virus 5 west nile virus 6 less-significant viruses can quickly become significant human health concerns therefore viruses that are disproportionately under-studied require research focus and they may ultimately aid understanding of related viruses and increase awareness of current and future threats a key example of research bias within a virus group is the hantavirus family bunyavirales hantaviridae recent taxonomic restructuring of hantaviruses was necessitated by the discovery of non-rodent- and non-mammal-borne viruses 78 however mammals particularly rodents are still the most common natural hosts of hantaviruses encompassing viruses in the largest subfamily mammantavirinae and genus orthohantavirus 9 and only rodent-borne orthohantaviruses have been linked to human disease 10 human infections caused by spillover of old world and new world orthohantaviruses can result in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hcps or hps respectively 11  the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv lists 58 unique orthohantaviruses distributed throughout the world with 20 distinct viruses within 12 virus species endemic to north and south america 789 although the first known american orthohantavirus prospect hill virus phv was described in 1985 12 most viruses were found shortly after the 1993 outbreak of sin nombre virus snv 13 in north america and the 1995 cases of andes virus andv 14 in south america table 1 new orthohantaviruses and genotypes continue to be identified via broad surveillance some discovered genotypes are suggested to be distinct viruses but a lack of sequence data and virus isolation prevents formal taxonomic placement for example phylogenetic analyses show up to 10 distinct branches within the andes orthohantavirus clade 1516 but only four strains meet all ictv criteria as distinct viruses table 1 and table a1 789 despite an increasing number of described hantaviruses andv and snv are disproportionately studied when compared to other orthohantaviruses in the americas table 1 such bias may be the reason for inadequate information to discriminate between potentially different viruses and the lack of distinction may discourage the collection of additional data creating a negative feedback loop muleshoe virus mulv for instance is a genotype of black creek canal virus bccv and evidence supports mulv being a separate virus based on genetic differences 17 however the necessary ictv criterion of mulv isolation has not been accomplished which keeps mulv from being distinguished as a distinct virus strain and may limit the amount of research conducted on this genotype until more virus-specific information is known we must infer characteristics of under-studied orthohantaviruses using other available information in this review we summarize current knowledge on neglected orthohantaviruses and highlight areas where future research is necessary to determine the potential range of these viruses we report evidence regarding the rodent hosts of each american orthohantavirus and the potential for various hostvirus relationships and communities based on existing evidence information regarding transmission for well-studied orthohantavirus systems is used to postulate the transmission characteristics of neglected american orthohantaviruses including direct transmission routes environmental persistence and spillover risk to humans as the number of described orthohantaviruses increases so does the number of suggested reservoir hosts table a1 reservoir hosts typically have asymptomatic and persistent infections 1119 although there is evidence of negative effects associated with orthohantavirus infection on the survival of young animals 20 and possibly decreased weight gain in newly-infected individuals 21 most studies that identify orthohantavirus infections in rodents have not evaluated the pathological or demographic consequences of infections the ability of rodents to be infected with an orthohantavirus without noticeable effects does not alone implicate them as a reservoir virus isolation is generally deemed the gold-standard evidence to support a reservoir role followed by positive polymerase chain reaction pcr results while orthohantavirus isolation from rodent hosts is rareeven for well-established virus-host relationships eg snv and peromyscus maniculatus 22recent advances in establishing rodent cell cultures such as those of the bccv host sigmodon hispidus may aid future isolations 23 in contrast positive rt-pcr results for a particular virus in multiple rodent species are common table a1 orthohantavirus infections are generally considered single-host-single-virus systems 242526 and viruses tend to co-diverge with their hosts 27 the term primary host is sometimes used for the most common reservoir host 2528 but this wording retracts from the idea that orthohantaviruses could persist in multiple hosts with the same propensity evidence increasingly suggests that some american orthohantaviruses do not follow the single-host-single-virus paradigm as strictly as their old world counterparts table a1 for example the reservoir for lechiguanas virus lechv is considered to be oligoryzomys flavescens but results from a recent study found lechv-positive reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr samples from oligoryzomys nigripes in argentina while all o flavescens samples were seronegative 29 similarly a study in texas found snv-positive rt-pcr samples from five seropositive peromyscus attwateri four p leucopus one p laceiarus and one reithrodontomys fulvescens but all of the sampled p maniculatus the reservoir of snv were seronegative except a single rt-pcr negative individual 17 it is unknown whether such instances are caused by frequent spillover events or the persistence of the virus within or among multiple species multiple-host systems are also more common than generally acknowledged when considering virus genotypes that are not classified as separate viruses by the ictv in such cases the reservoirs for a virus strain would be the combination of reservoirs for all genotypes for example limestone canyon virus lscv is a genotype of snv that is associated with peromyscus boylii and other peromyscus species 3031 instead of p maniculatus the reservoir of snv isla vista virus islav is a genotype of phv that is associated with microtus californicus 32 instead of m pennsylvanicus the reservoir of phv and rio mearim virus rimev and anajatuba virus anajv are genotypes of rio mamor virus riomv that are associated with holochilus sciureus and oligoryzomys fornesi respectively 33 instead of o microtis the reservoir of riomv table a1 in some circumstances distinct orthohantavirus genotypes are also host subspecies-dependent for instance oryzomys couesi is suggested to be the reservoir for catacamas virus catv and playa de oro virus orov a genotype associated with a clade composed of catv bccv and bayou virus bayv but orov and catv are associated with different subspecies of o couesi 3435 choclo virus chov and maporal virus mapv are both associated with oligoryzomys fulvescens although a distinction in the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene suggests that these viruses are host subspecies-specific infecting o f costaricensis and o f delicatus respectively 36 another technical issue to consider is the concept of host-switching events among orthohantaviruses evidence of historical host switching has resulted in hantavirus lineages among disparate mammal taxa 373839 more recent host-switching is supported by several mismatches in the cophylogeny of orthohantaviruses and rodent hosts for example monongahela virus mglv is an orthohantavirus genotype primarily carried by p maniculatus nubiterrae a subspecies of the mouse associated with snv despite mglv often showing a closer phylogenetic relationship to new york virus nyv which is associated with p leucopus 404142 although the true relationship is still unknown figure 1 and mglv has also been reported in p leucopus 43 additionally orov and catv are often found in the same species o couesi despite orov being more closely-related to bccv which is associated with s hispidus minimal range overlap between o couesi and s hispidus and minimal genome sequencing prevent conclusion of a host-switch event among these viruses  additional host-switching events have been proposed as the reason for the multitude of reported hosts in american orthohantaviruses table a1 such as from oligoryzomys flavescens to o nigripes for lechv 29 however while reports of orthohantaviruses infecting multiple species supports multiple hosts for many orthohantaviruses and therefore a plethora of host switching events there is a shortage of research examining the competence of many putative hosts and therefore the classification of true reservoirs information regarding the relative transmissibility of virus from each host to humans and other wildlife is also lacking with the exception of several case studies involving focused trapping around areas of assumed exposure eg 4244 additionally no orthohantavirus has been isolated from more than one rodent species table a1 although few studies have reported such attempts further research is therefore necessary to determine if frequent documentation of american orthohantaviruses in multiple species represents host switches or spillover in addition to the potential for multiple hosts the number of sympatric viruses must also be considered propensity for coexistence of different orthohantaviruses within a rodent community appears to vary spatially and temporally in one texas study viruses and even virus genomes appear to segregate at the county level 17 similar results were found in mexico with most states containing only one orthohantavirus 30 although another study examining a smaller portion of the same mexican region found viruses to commonly coexist 45 sympatric riomv genotypes anajv and rimev were also found in the same area but in distinct host species 33 in california and nevada elmcv phv and snv were also found in the same area indicating that viruses hosted by diverse rodents can exist in sympatry 46 thus multiple orthohantaviruses may exist together in rodent communities but separation based on habitat type and species distributions likely play a role in structuring their presence  in the absence of data on orthohantavirus presence in a particular area host distributions may be useful as proxies as rodent ranges and habitat types are often well-documented 254748 several orthohantaviruses have been found throughout large extents of their host range including bccv 1749 bayv 5051 and others indicating that orthohantaviruses have the potential to be present throughout the entire range of host species however the use of virus genotypes causes confusion when determining the range of orthohantaviruses for example bccv is used in florida united states 49 while mulv is used in texas 17 similarly chov is used in panama 52 while its genotype jabora virus jabv is used in brazil 53 until such genotypes are considered distinct viruses by taxonomists ie ictv acknowledgement of these relationships may be helpful in minimizing confusion and aiding understanding of orthohantavirus distributions without analyzing positive samples throughout species ranges for new viruses incorrect assumptions may also be made regarding orthohantavirus distributions for example riomv infects oligoryzomys microtis throughout most of its range in south america 47 so hcps cases in french guiana were thought to be riomv 35 however virus sequencing from an hcps case in french guiana found that maripa virus marv a then-new virus closely-related to riomv found in o fulvescens and zygodontomys brevicauda was the responsible agent 545556 difficulty in estimating virus range via host range also increases when one species can host several viruses both necocli virus necv 57 and marv 55 have been found in z brevicauda via positive rt-pcr but the range of each particular virus is unknown a similar situation was found for o longicaudatus the most common host of andv and also the host of oran virus ornv although the increased attention given to andv revealed which populations of o longicaudatus host which virus 48 therefore host distribution can be useful in estimating virus distribution but caution should be applied  hantaviruses are likely to spread to new areas and vanish from existing areas due to changes in rodent host distribution and abundance changes in grassland habitats caused by land-use changes and climate change 585960 have been strongly associated with rodent distributional changes for example range expansion of a north american grassland rodent species baiomys taylori was recently found in new mexico united states likely due to an increase in grassland areas particularly along roadsides due to climate change and habitat disturbance 61 thus the grassland rodents that host orthohantaviruses may show similar patterns in the future several orthohantavirus hosts occupy this habitat type in the united states alone including m pennsylvanicus phv m ochrogaster bloodland lake virus bllv genotype of phv microtus californicus islav reithrodontomys megalotis el moro canyon virus elmcv and sigmodon hispidus mulv and bccv and to a lesser extent oryzomys palustris bayv and peromyscus spp nyv snv figure 2 many rodents known to host orthohantaviruses also inhabit other grasslands throughout the americas figure 3 similar patterns of habitat changes from land use change and climate change can be expected for habitats of other orthohantaviruses and their hosts much of what we know about the transmission of american orthohantaviruses among conspecific rodent hosts is derived from studies of andv and snv 19 both viruses are primarily shed in saliva occasionally in urine and apparently not in feces suggesting that behaviors such as grooming and biting are the primary routes of transmission 226263 such transmission contrasts with old world orthohantaviruses such as puumala virus puuv which are commonly shed in feces as well 1964 older males are more commonly infected with orthohantaviruses than other demographic groups 65 including snv 2066 laguna negra virus lanv 67 lechv 68 and bccv 69 compounding more exposure opportunities for older individuals higher prevalence in older males is assumed to result from increased aggression and competition primarily for access to mates 7071 associations of bayv-infected male o palustris with receptive females and non-infected males with non-receptive females 51 further supports the concept of reproductive behaviors as a primary driver of orthohantavirus transmission among wild rodents thus some females likely become infected via allogrooming during copulative behaviors common in rodents eg 7273 the occasional shedding of the virus in urine may be important for transmission among conspecifics and perhaps heterospecifics as well urine is used by rodents for various reproductive and territorial behaviors 74 creating ample opportunities for exposure of virus in aerosolized urine via oropharyngeal routes however information pertaining to virus persistence outside the host in american orthohantaviruses is limited to circumstantial evidence regarding spillover infections and such transmission may be mitigated by uncommon virus shedding in urine relatively frequent rodent spillover events ie transmission from one species to another 75 suggests that other variables including overlap in habitat use such as shared runways burrows and nests is necessary for transmission among species during the breeding season many rodents compete for mates food space and protection of offspring so there is little overlap in space use by conspecifics and often congeners 7677 however in the non-breeding season these territories break down and space overlap increases 7879 during this time many rodents also share burrows within 8081 and occasionally among 82 species during warmer months some species may also use the burrows of other species who have since vacated 8384 burrow-sharing behavior in rodents has been associated with the spread of several other diseases including plague yersinia pestis 85 tick-borne relapsing fever borellia spp 86 and possibly valley fever coccidioides spp 87 and the stable cool humid microclimates of burrows 8889 may allow orthohantaviruses to persist in the environment this phenomenon would also help explain why multiple species can be infected by the same orthohantavirus potential opportunities of spillover to non-muroid rodents 20 and original host-switching events to other rodents shrews and moles figure 1 further research is necessary to determine the role of habitat overlap on conspecific orthohantavirus infection via competition excrement exposure and other potential sources of virus shedding and routes of transmission regardless of the routes of transmission population density appears to play a role in orthohantavirus maintenance experimental modeling of snv prevalence in peromyscus maniculatus populations and hcps cases indicates that climate-mediated fluctuations in host abundance are linked to orthohantavirus outbreaks 6690 high seroprevalence in p maniculatus is found after a time lag following high rainfall events particularly those associated with the el nio-southern oscillation enso 9091 although this phenomenon has been relatively well-studied in snv data demonstrating similar patterns among other american orthohantaviruses is lacking however such lag times in other systems may explain why less-abundant species in a rodent community may occasionally be the primary carriers of orthohantavirus 5292 as population sizes could have been larger in a recent season theoretical models indicate that orthohantavirus transmission among rodents also has aspects of frequency-dependent transmission infection prevalence is greatly influenced by contact rates 93 which increase as population density increases however increases in prevalence are greater in males than in females 94 likely due to increased competitive encounters among males but not females at higher densities high seroprevalence among overwintering animals 2166 are assumed to be caused by persistently infected animals infecting susceptible individuals population sizes generally crash during this time period 20 although p maniculatus populations remained stable prior to the hcps outbreak of 19982000 91 likely due to a strong enso event suggesting that winter infections may be caused by frequent interactions despite low host density it is unclear how the stable winters of tropical regions impact orthohantavirus transmission systems in northern south america and central america further attempts to imitate such systems in a controlled environment are necessary to better understand how orthohantaviruses persist and proliferate through rodent populations most american orthohantaviruses have been associated with at least one human case of hcps 1220 and approximately half 920 were discovered following an hcps case table 1 practically all hcps cases are thought to be caused by spillover events from rodents to humans 1924 the exception comes from andv in argentina and chile where some evidence supports transmission from infected patients to family members and medical workers 959697 however these instances are limited to outbreaks in small rural communities and regional medical staff that cared for hcps patients had similar seroprevalence to the general population 9899 several orthohantaviruses were originally discovered through broad surveillance of rodent tissues but were later implicated with human disease for example riomv was originally discovered while studying the host associations of andes orthohantavirus strains in 1997 100 and was connected to hcps eight years later 33 other hcps cases were attributed to the incorrect orthohantavirus until the actual virus was described such as marv cases originally diagnosed as riomv as mentioned previously 54 similarly due to regional variation in virus prevalence elmcv was suggested to be the etiological agent of several hcps cases ascribed to snv but the virus in these cases was never tested 30 without verification via sequencing of hcps cases elmcv is considered to not cause disease in humans thus certain orthohantaviruses may be infectious to humans but incorrectly dismissed due to a lack of sequencing conversely additional orthohantaviruses or viral genotypes that are pathogenic to humans may exist that have not yet been linked to any hosts such as tunari virus tunv which was discovered following an hcps case but the reservoir is still unknown 15 while understanding host ecology may help explain the maintenance of orthohantaviruses in wild rodent populations it can also inform spillover threats to humans snv and andv are both found most commonly in generalist rodent species that can be locally abundant these host characteristics allow viruses to be present in most habitats throughout a large geographical range increasing the likelihood of encounters between infected rodents and susceptible humans however due to the large number of described orthohantaviruses and their hosts most regions and habitats have the capacity to contain multiple viruses of human health concern on the other hand some species and their viruses are common in a variety of habitat types for example in west virginia united states where peromyscus are the dominant muroid rodents hcps cases were attributed to exposure of airborne particulates of p maniculatus secretions within cabins 4042 such cases indicate an infection risk in seasonally-used buildings in rural areas in the northeast similar to initial assessments in the southwestern united states 101 therefore these generalist species appear to be capable of transmitting virus to humans regardless of habitat urban areas may pose a risk for human exposure to orthohantaviruses and their hosts as well for example in addition to their abundance in forested habitats peromyscus mice are common in green urban spaces such as the park system in new york city 102103 and nyv was discovered on shelter island near new york city 18 notably homeless residents may be at increased risk as sleeping near rodent activity was associated with european orthohantavirus infections 104 although empirical evidence is lacking for american viruses due to limited migration of wild rodents throughout urban areas 102103105 green spaces may also be protected from orthohantavirus invasion orthohantaviruses carried by invasive rodents such as seoul virus seov in rattus norvegicus may pose a risk as well seov has been documented in the united states and canada due to the pet trade 106 while wild rats can also carry this virus one study found a seroprevalence for orthohantavirus in r norvegicus of 482 overall and 20297 in green spaces in baltimore maryland 107 although broader documentation of orthohantaviruses in urban areas is lacking these findings as well as observations of a range of other disease-causing pathogens in urban rodents eg 108109 suggest that this may be an area of major human health concern while current threats would likely be documented already misdiagnoses failure to seek medical attention and the potential for future outbreaks warrant attention it appears that hcps risk is greatest in areas where humans infiltrate rodent habitats rather than vice versa such as areas of landscape fragmentation and encroachment caused by urbanization and development in uruguay oligoryzomys flavescens infected with lechv were more common in disturbed habitats than in undisturbed habitats 110 relationships between habitat encroachment and infection risk occur for other zoonotic diseases such as nipah virus 4 and ebola virus 111112 suggesting a possible pattern in orthohantaviruses other than lechv as well many forms of habitat encroachment can increase risk of exposure to orthohantaviruses ranching and farming activity in the midwest united states prairies such as construction of new barns and field plowing could expose individuals to sigmodon hispidus bccv construction of rice fields and other encroachments into marsh habitat in the southern united states could expose individuals to oryzomyz palustris bayv the creation of edge habitat via development in the amazon basin provides additional habitat for oligoryzomys microtis riomv and increases contact with humans all of these rodent species carry orthohantaviruses that cause disease in humans table 1 100113114  estimating the risk of exposure to most orthohantaviruses with various human activities in south america is more difficult due to minimal information about the ecology of the rodent hosts although some evidence indicates that habitat disturbance particularly construction of domiciles in rural areas appears to increase the risk of human exposure to hantaviruses there as well 115116 interestingly ornv-positive oligoryzomys longicaudatus were found in orn argentina outside of the reported distribution range of o longicaudatus figure 3 117 showing the ability for agricultural development to expand orthohantavirus presence despite the discovery of at least 20 different new world orthohantaviruses carried by rodents most orthohantavirus studies in the americas focus on andv and snv while the majority of hcps cases are attributed to these viruses 118119 recent evidence suggests that such statistics may be skewed due to misdiagnosis of either the causative orthohantavirus or of the disease itself 2630 we show that despite having many similar characteristics american orthohantaviruses differ from their old world counterparts and from each other in several ways in the absence of empirical data we shed light on the diversity transmission and risk of spillover for neglected american orthohantaviruses and viral genotypes using the ecology of their hosts and information on andv and snv additionally comparisons were occasionally made to old world orthohantaviruses the ecological approach from this review may also be useful in implicating transmission and spillover risk of old world orthohantaviruses not yet examined a key constraint to inferring information about each orthohantavirus system is the complexity between the taxonomy of orthohantaviruses and their hosts related viruses appear to interact with hosts similarly as shown by the comparable phylogenies of orthohantaviruses and their natural rodent hosts 24 their affinity to cause disease in humans table 1 and frequent spillover or multiple related hosts table a1 however confusion in orthohantavirus taxonomy and the number of distinct virus strains limits further conclusions in particular surveillance of related rodent species may produce additional genetic samples that allow clearer orthohantavirus phylogenies to be constructed additional information regarding mole-borne orthohantaviruses such as oxbow virus oxbv and rockport virus rkpv 120121 and shrew-borne genotypes such as ash river virus arrv camp ripley virus rplv and jemez springs virus jmsv 38122 which have similar taxonomical issues due to minimal research and have some overlap in rodent phylogeny figure 1 may aid in understanding rodent-borne orthohantaviruses ultimately broader surveillance will aid in understanding which genotypes constitute distinct viruses and which represent genetic diversity of single orthohantaviruses in addition to the controversy over viral taxonomy the ability for multiple orthohantaviruses and their hosts to persist in the same environment and region 2547 figure 2 further limits conclusions on orthohantavirus samples that are not sequenced whether rodent or human since multiple rodent species are commonly found rt-pcr positive for particular american orthohantavirus strains table a1 virushost relationships are unclear although orthohantaviruses are difficult to isolate attempts to isolate these viruses from rodent samples is necessary to determine which rodents are reservoirs and which species experience frequent spillover events these results will aid in determining whether american orthohantaviruses follow a single-host system like their old world counterparts  empirical data on the ecology of neglected american orthohantaviruses are crucial to understanding transmission and persistence of such viruses and threats to human health few studies have examined the impacts of new world orthohantaviruses on rodent populations with the exceptions of variation in prevalence between sexes and age classes 676869 survivorship of age classes 20 and reproduction-dependent spatial variation 50 additional information regarding transmission routes and environmental persistence is also necessary as the minimal data currently available using snv and andv show mixed results 226263  although hcps cases are often associated with snv and andv changes in the landscape climate and host switching may cause particular orthohantaviruses to increase in severity each orthohantavirus may have the capability to become more significant to human health in the future and insight into each virus is necessary for adequate preparation various viral families have existed amongst humans with little to no impact until recent decades therefore research regarding neglected american orthohantaviruses is crucial for a holistic understanding of orthohantavirus epidemiology and to enable preparation for future risks  analysis of the mitigation strategies for covid-19 from mathematical modelling perspective semu kassa m john njagarah bh yibeltal terefe a   a novel coronavirus named a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 previously known as 2019-ncov was identified as the infectious agent causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia in wuhan china in december 2019 1 the world health organization who medical team codenamed the new outbreak caused by sars-cov-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the infection is in the same category as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which emerged in southern china in 2002 spreading to up to 30 countries with a total of 8098 cases and claiming 774 lives 2 covid-19 is also in the same category as the middle east respiratory syndrome mers which was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 and ended up spreading to 27 countries around the world reaching a total of 2519 cases confirmed and claiming up to 866 lives 3 since january 2020 an increasing number of cases confirmed to be infected with covid-19 have been detected outside wuhan and currently the infection has spread all over the world as of may 28 2020 0909 gmt covid-19 had affected all continents including island nations 213 countries and territories as well as 2 international conveyances with the total number of cumulative infections globally standing at 5807012 cases and 357800 deaths 4 and the numbers still increasing the major portal of entry of the virus into the body is the tissue lining the t-zones of the face including the nose eyes and mouth the infection is characterised by loss of the sense of smell a condition referred to as hyposmiaanosmia taste and poor appetite although such conditions have been observed in covid-19 patients many carriers of the infection may not show any severe symptoms like fever and cough but have hyposmia loss of taste and loss of appetite whereas knowledge of the virus dynamics and host response are essential for formulating strategies for antiviral treatment vaccination and epidemiological control of covid-19 estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation and help to identify whether public health control measures are having a measurable effect 5 6 the analysis from mathematical models may assist decision makers to estimate the risk and forecast the potential spread of the disease in the population understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection is crucial in designing alternative intervention strategies 7 in general by approaching infectious diseases from a mathematical perspective we can identify patterns and common systems in disease function which would enable us to find some of the underlying structures that govern outbreaks and epidemics mathematical models that analyse the spread of covid-19 have began to appear in few published papers and online resources 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 however there are several challenges to the use of mathematical models in providing nearly accurate predictions at an early stage of the outbreak particularly in real time as it is difficult to determine many of the pathogen-based parameters through mathematical models the estimation of such parameters will require clinical observations and shoe-leather epidemiology 14 it is also possible for some of the parameters to be verified through observation only at a later stage in the course of the epidemic to get better predictions and to design and analyse various alternative intervention strategies in the absence of such parameter values one needs to estimate them from existing epidemiological data like many respiratory viruses the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 can be spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected individual as soon as the virus enters the body either through the mouth nose or membrane of the eyes it finds its way to the windpipe and then the lungs this viral attack is characterised by flu like symptoms fever body temperatures more than 383c and dry cough at the initial stage of the infection once the virus gets into the lungs it causes fibrosis of the lungs leading to shortness of breath or difficulty to breathe and severe pneumonia followed by impaired functioning of the liver and acute kidney injury 15 the virus is then released from the infected individual when they cough sneeze and when they touch their own nose or mouth some particles that are released through coughing or sneezing may land on clothing of other people in close proximity and surfaces around them while some of the smaller particles can remain in the air for some time in addition some scientific evidence shows that the virus can also be shed for a longer time in faecal matter 16 the virus survives on surfaces fabrics metals plastics for variable times recent reports indicate that the virus can survive from a shorter time in the air up to 2-3 days long on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces 17 this implies that an uninfected individual can also acquire the virus through contact with infected surfaces that means there is a possibility for covid-19 infection to spread from such contaminated surfaces and objects to uninfected humans hence including the proportion of indirect transmission from the environment in the mathematical model structure is important to address this situation we note that the impact of environmental contamination and its role in the transmission of the disease is not well studied in mathematical models developed so far reinfection by the family of coronavirus is possible as it is indicated in 18 19 even if it is not yet well known how long it takes for a person who recovered from covid-19 to lose immunity we can not overlook its impact at this stage therefore when formulating a mathematical model for covid-19 dynamics it is reasonable to consider a kind of susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible sirs type of epidemiological model formulation so far there is no known curing medicine nor vaccine to combat the covid-19 pandemic the available prevention mechanisms that are recommended by the who so far are also limited and their effectiveness is not yet fully tested the level of the populations understanding and application of these preventive mechanisms varies from region to region and from country to country in some places the protective measures are employed voluntarily by individuals and in some other places governments impose some kind of rules on the population to use strict social distancing and wearing face masks in public places however the adherence to these rules is not uniform in the past it has been witnessed that during the outbreak of infectious diseases the human population has been taking precautionary actions such that wearing masks abstinence from risky contacts avoiding public transport means and increasing the uptake of vaccination when available 20 21 22 behaviour change towards using preventive mechanisms by the population to protect themselves from an infectious disease is assumed to be dependent on the way the disease is transmitted and its fatality rate individuals who have awareness about the disease and who decided to use preventive mechanisms have less susceptibility than those without awareness and demonstrating the usual risky behaviour a number of mathematical models have been proposed to analyse the effects of human behaviour in the dynamics of infectious diseases see 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 and the references therein in this paper we follow the diffusion of innovation approach which was proposed by kassa and ouiniho 21 in models of this approach it is assumed that the perceived threat for the population is the level of prevalence of the disease however for diseases with short time cycles the prevalence dependent awareness function may be unrealistic therefore in this work we assume that awareness is driven by the magnitude of the incidence rate reported each day that means based on the diffusion of innovation method one may consider the perceived threat for the population to be the incidence of the disease at the beginning of the covid-19 outbreak a huge disparity has been observed in the use of self-protective mechanisms and adherence to the advice given by public health agencies in particular the people in some parts of asia have fully embraced the measures while many in other parts of the world were very much hesitant to use them for example wearing a face mask everyday in public appearances is like a ritual in most of the countries in southeast asia while the same is considered as a bad gesture in many of the other parts of the world 31 even if it is now becoming a new normal also everywhere in the globe one key difference between these societies and the people in the west is that the communities in the southeast asia have experienced similar disease outbreaks before and the memories are still fresh and painful 31 that means recent history of a similar event plays a role in behavioural change of the population especially at the beginning of the outbreak in addition to the perceived threat from the disease therefore in this paper we consider a mathematical model that takes into account1the transmission dynamics of covid-19 similar to the sirs model2the contribution of the asymptomatic infectious individuals in the transmission dynamics of the disease in the population3the effect of indirect transmission of the disease through the environment4behavioural change of individuals in the society to apply self-protective measures and5the intensity of historical events from recent similar outbreaks
 by analysing the proposed basic mathematical model the effect of each of these factors is investigated in terms of their contribution to the control strategies of the disease moreover the use of isolation or quarantining and strict social distancing measures are also considered as mitigation strategies and a comparative study is made for different scenarios the layout of this paper is as follows the model is described and formulated in the next section its qualitative analysis is presented in section 3 estimation of the parameters and the sensitivity analysis of the reproduction number of the model with respect to involved parameters are discussed in section 4 numerical simulations of the model with some assumed intervention scenarios are also presented and analysed in this same section concluding remarks of the study are given in sections 5 in this section we present a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of covid-19 which spreads in a population the susceptible individuals can be infected through either direct contact with infectious individuals or indirect contact with the novel coronavirus infected environment the population under consideration is grouped into disjoint compartments individuals who are susceptible to the disease and without formal awareness about the prevention mechanisms or who did not decide to use any protective mechanisms are grouped in the s class individuals who are susceptible but are aware of and decide to apply any of the existing protective mechanisms after receiving public health information on how to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus infection are placed in the se class covid-19 infected individuals who are asymptomatic and symptomatic are grouped in classes c and i respectively some studies consider the asymptomatic class as the exposed class see for instance 9 but since the individuals in this group are known to be infectious and some of them also recover from the disease without going through the i group 32 we used a name carrier to avoid confusion the r class contains the recovered individuals from covid-19 finally e denotes the amount of the novel coronavirus pathogen that contaminates the environment due to shedding by covid-19 infectious individuals in the analysis of the model we intentionally excluded the actual exposed class for mathematical simplicity however a 5 days incubation period is taken into consideration in the numerical simulation part of this paper by combining the direct and indirect ways of transmission the force of infection will have the form11icn2eekwhere nssecir and k is the concentration of the novel coronavirus in the environment which increases 50 chance of triggering the disease transmission the proposed flow diagram for the transmission dynamics of covid-19 is depicted in figure 1

 then the disease-free equilibrium dfe is found to be6e01hh00000the basic reproduction number which is very important for the qualitative analysis of the model is determined here below by using the method of the next generation matrix used in 33 34 for the model under consideration using the notation xcie we have the vector functions

 the epidemiological implication of theorem 32 is that the transmission of covid-19 can be controlled by forcing the dynamics through its parameter values so that r01 if the initial total numbers in each of the subpopulation involved in eq 2 are in the basin of attraction of e0 to ensure that elimination of the disease is independent of the initial size of the subpopulation the disease-free equilibrium must be globally asymptotically stable when r01 this is what we present here belowtheorem 33

 hence by the kamgang-sallet stability theorem 36 the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for r01  the reality behind theorem 34 is that if immunity is permanent 0 coronavirus will be effectively controlled in the community by reducing r0 effectively to a value less than unity the novel coronavirus being a new strain of coronaviruses information about the dynamics of the infection is still evolving biological studies of parameter values describing the vital dynamics of the infection are still ongoing as more laboratory tests become available although some studies have been done on the early dynamics of the disease most especially on data from wuhan extensive reading reveals that some of the disease dynamics parameters are highly variable and some processes are not fully explored in this work we use new cases data from hubei province of china extracted from who situation reports 1-57 1 ie for the period january 21 2020 to march 17 2020 we ought to fit the proposed model to the extracted data and estimate the unknown parameters the total population of hubei province was estimated as 592 million the life expectancy of hubei province varies depending on the area of dwelling ie urban or rural as well as gender 37 for urban dwellers the average life expectancy is estimated to be 7568 years with an average being 7372 years for men and 7779 years for women the life expectancy of china of the year 2019 was estimated to be 7679 years whereas that for the year 2020 is estimated as 7696 years 38 owing to the negligible difference in the provincial and countrywide value we use the country life expectancy for the year 2019 which gives an average mortality rate of 357105 per day the recruitment rate is thus given as n0 where n
0 is taken to be the total population size 592 million the average time period taken for symptoms to appear after exposure is observed to vary considerably with ranges between 2-14 days 39 2-24 days 40 and some outliers going to up to 27 days the observed median incubation period was nearly 5 days 41 the time to recovery from the onset of symptoms varies depending on the seriousness of the infection individuals presenting mild illness were observed to recover in an average period of 2 weeks while those presenting seriouscritical illness recovering in about 3 to 6 weeks for our parameter estimation and simulations we consider a nominal value of 00476day1 corresponding to 3 weeks estimated from an interval 00238 00714 we note that a patient is considered recovered 1 if two swab tests taken in a time interval of at least 24 hours both test negative 2 if the time taken after the end of respiratory symptoms and fever is at least 72 hours the waning of the immunity after recovery is estimated to range between 4 months to 1 year which gives an interval for  as 000274000824day1 for our simulation we consider a nominal value of 000274day1 approximately one year we propose that at the end of the epidemic at least 2065 of the recovering population will learn from the experiences during the infection and even when the acquired immunity wanes such individuals will become susceptible individuals with past historyknowledge of the disease the rate of recovery for the symptomatic individuals  in wuhan varied considerably but majority of individuals who recovered from the virus were discharged from hospital after 212 weeks 42 however the patients in wenzhou-china stayed in hospital for 27 days 0037 per day on average in the model fitted on the early trends data from wuhan-china 43 the recovery rate obtained for symptomatic cases was 00897 per day accounting for 10 days to recovery the rate of recovery  for carrier individuals is expected to be higher 9 according to the who situation report 44 it is estimated that up to 80 of covid-19 cases are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms 15 show severe symptoms and up-to 5 end up with critical infection and require oxygen or a ventilator the proportion of individuals who do not show symptoms or have mild symptoms can be as high as 94 45 for our model fitting we use a range of 065086 for both  and  with selected initial values within the prescribed interval although hubei province was put on a lockdown on january 23 2020 the first major decline in the number of new confirmed cases was only observed on february 20 2020 situation report 31 1 approximately 1 month after the lockdown was imposed from february 14 2020 the method of identification of new cases was revised to include both cases confirmed through laboratory tests and clinical observations as such there was an observed spike in the number of new cases on february 14 2020 to 4823 compared to 1508 cases reported on february 13 2020 and 2420 cases reported february 15 2020 applying the above described set of assumptions in the bounds for some of the parameters we optimized the model output to fit the daily new cases data reported from the hubei province china the parameter values for which the model best fits to the incidence data are given in table 3 figure 2
shows the plot of the reported new-cases data together with the incidence of the disease obtained from the model as we can observe from the graph the model slightly overestimates the reported data except for the two highest points in addition since our model does not assume any control measure at this stage while the reported data after the 31st day may represent the effect of the strict lockdown measure taken by the authorities the parameters estimated give a good result we note however that in some recent work 46 47 the use of fractional-order calculus is recommended to get better data fit when we calculate the value of r0 from eq 8 using the estimated parameters given in table 3 we obtain r0291 which is within the range of values reported in 48 49 we examine the sensitivity of r0 to variations in parameter values and establish the significance of the sensitivity indices we used the latin hypercube sampling lhs scheme which is an efficient stratified monte carlo sampling that allows for simultaneous sampling of the multi-dimensional parameter space 50 for each run 1000 simulations were done and partial rank correlation coefficients prccs 51 calculated between each of the selected input parameters and the disease threshold the prccs indicate the degree of effect each parameter has on the outcome which in this case is the disease threshold the sign of the prcc identifies the specific qualitative relationship between the input parameter and the output variable the positive value of the prcc of the variables implies that when the value of the input parameter increases the future number of cases will also increase on the other hand processes underlying the parameters with negative prccs have a potential to contain of the number of cases when enhanced the results of sensitivity analysis are indicated in figure 3
a and the box plot figure 3b gives the five-number summary for the computed disease threshold value from the sampled parameter space the processes described by parameters 
1 
2  and  with the greatest positive prccs have the greatest potential of worsening pandemic when increased on the other hand parameters h and  with negative prccs have the greatest potential in helping contain the infection when maximised in this respect we note that increasing socialphysical distancing directly reduces 
1 as this lowers the likelihood of a susceptible individual getting in contact with a potentially infected individual in addition practising good hygiene such as regularly washing hands using sanitisers to disinfect the infected environment and avoiding touching the t-zones of the face is associated with lowering the likelihood of contracting the virus from infected surfaces anything contrary to the above increases the likelihood of getting the infection through the two aforementioned routes we further note that practising good hygiene also involves the infected individuals reducing the shedding of the virus into the environment it is evident from the results in figure 3 and table 4
that reducing the rate at which the virus is shed into the environment is significant in reducing the severity of the problem from the five number summary of the results in figure 3b the lower quartile of the computed values of r0 is about 2 the median around 29 and the upper quartile of about 4 the obtained value of r0 is within the range of 31195ci239413 obtained in the early studies in 52 we note that for a selected combination of underlying processes much higher values of r0 can be obtained which is an indication of possible worsening of the situation in a similar way we observe that for particular underlying processes a selected combination of parameters the value of r0 can be reduced to values below one as indicated in 51 we note that although some parameters in the model may have very small magnitudes of prccs non-monotonically related to the disease threshold output they may still produce sizeable changes in the disease burden to identify the most important parameters in containing or aggravating the epidemic we computed p-values for the simulated parameters using fishers transformation 51 we note that the computed prccs are bounded between the interval 11 for this matter some sampling distribution of variables that are highly correlated is skewed the fishers transformation r05log1r1r is used to transform the skew distribution to a normal distribution and then compute p-values for each of the parameters based on the prccs 51 the prccs for the parameters together with their corresponding p-values are indicated in table 4 we carry out pairwise comparison of the significant parameters whose p-values are less than 005 see table 4 to ascertain whether the processes described by the compared parameters are different we computed the p-values for the different pairs of significant parameters while accounting for the false discovery rate fdr adjustment and the results are given in table 5
 the major question posed at this point is are the different pairs of significant parameters different after fdr adjustment based on the fdr adjusted p-values in table 5 the compared pair of parameters are rendered to be different if their p-value is less than 005 and not different otherwise we summarise our results in table 6
 where true indicates that the compared parameters are significantly different and false indicating otherwise we observe that the more sensitive parameters are also significantly different see table 6 except for the 1 pair which may not necessarily be related we examine effect of variation of the sensitive parameters on the reproduction number r0 the results of the variation of parameters with more negative prccs are indicated in the bar graphs in figure 4 from figure 4 it is evident that the decay of the virus from the environment figure 4 which can be accelerated by disinfecting surfaces reduces the value of r0 and consequently the disease burden in addition we observe that an increased proportion of individuals with knowledge of similar infections from the past that are practising self-protection and preventive measures see figure 4a is important in slowing down the infection at the initial stage such proportions of individuals would normally have knowledge about prevention and control mechanisms of the infection just at the onset of the disease we observe in figure 5 that the increase in person-to-person contact 
1 figure 5a poor personal hygiene 
2 figure 5b and the rate of shedding of the virus into the environment by both carriers figure 5c and symptomatic individuals figure 5d increase the value of r0 and therefore the disease burden it is evident that the most effective way of containing the infection is by minimizing contact which is why in most cases imposing a lockdown becomes an effective way of slowing the spread of the infection in addition good hygiene practices by all individuals are two-fold 1 avoiding touching surfaces always washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol based hand sanitizer which reduced the likelihood of contracting the pathogen from the environment 2 those who are sick with symptoms like cough and flu ought to use masks when they cough or sneeze must do so in a sanitary tissue which must then be properly disposed off we also note that hygienic practices without socialphysical distancing may not significantly slow down the infection in summary we observe that it is possible to reduce the value of r0 to a value less than unity by reducing only the value of 
1 below 01 see figure 5a this observation is in direct agreement with mitigation approaches that are aimed at minimising human-to-human contact such as social distancing and imposing a lockdown therefore the paremeter 
1 is more influential in the model and can also play a significant role in eradication of the disease the other parameters see fig 4 fig 5 b 5 c and 5 d may reduce the value of r0 significantly when applied in combination but not as independent mitigation processes there are various intervention mechanisms for covid-19 that are being implemented in different parts of the world the strategies differ from country to country depending on the scientific information available to decision makers to investigate the outcomes of the mitigation strategies we include the isolated andor quarantined classes to the model system 2 we assume that the individuals in the asymptomatic class c are detected at a rate of  and placed in isolation q
1 class while the individuals in the symptomatic class i are identified at a rate of  and quarantined in q
2 class moreover the system is formulated as a mixed-delay system of differential equations where the time delay d is assumed to account for the incubation period of the disease then the system becomes12s1htdetdstds1rsehetds1tdsetdserctdstd1tdsetdcq1cn1q1i1tdstd11tdsetdciq2in2q2rcin1q1n2q2recivewhere the force of infection  is now modified to1u1icn1v2eekwith u representing the average percentage of contacts reduced due to the social distancing measures and v representing the total average rate or percentage of disinfecting the environment in the modified model system 12 the parameters n

1 and q
2 classes respectively here we assumed that n1n2121 note that the value v in the last equation of 12 represents the effective decay rate of the pathogen from the environment and should not be greater than 1 for the simulation purpose of this study we considered five different cases or scenarios of how to apply the interventions the strategies described in each of the cases below are in addition to the awareness creation for voluntary self-protective mechanisms which are widely communicated through various media outlets here we assume that the average effectiveness of the self-protective measures is 15 as estimated from the data and reported in table 3 and the individuals who decided to use any one of them are strict in following the appropriate rules here below we consider each of the scenarios for mitigation strategies case by casecase 1in this case we assume that about 40 of the symptomatic infectious individuals and only 1 of the asymptomatic infectious individuals are detected and quarantined this scenario is based on the assumption that among the people in the i class only about 40 show above mild symptoms and hence visit health care facilities while the remaining individuals in this class nearly 60 of them remain at home or at large in the society then through contact tracing mechanisms corresponding the hospitalized individuals some people will be traced and tested thereby about 1 of the total asymptomatic individuals can be detecteda similar scenario is being applied currently in some sub-saharan african countriesthe time profile in figure 6
shows the situation described in case 1 from this graph we can observe that the infection stabilizes around its endemic equilibrium which is nearly at 5000 cases this number depends on the initial conditions and the demographic variables of the population under study this shows that the disease persists in the populationcase 2in this case we assume that strict and longer time 6 weeks of social distancing rules are enforced by the government nearly 4 weeks after the first positive case of covid-19 is reported in the communitywe assume for simulation purpose that the implementation of the intervention strategy is divided into the following 4 time phasesphase 1the first phase in this case is 24 days long measured starting from the time the first positive case of covid-19 is reported during this phase because of lack of information and the nature of the infection we assume as in case 1 that only 40 of symptomatic infectious individuals and 1 of the asymptomatic infectious individuals are detected and quarantinedphase 2the second phase is assumed to last for 6 weeks 42 days during this period it is also presumed that80 of the symptomatic class and 30 of the asymptomatic class are detected and quarantineda mandatory strict social distancing rule is imposed which is assumed to have a 70 reduction of effective contacts of individuals in the societyenvironmental disinfection is widely carried out which is assumed to result in a 50 reduction in the rate of infection from the environment and to contribute about the same percent impact in increasing the rate of decay of the pathogen from the environment
phase 3the third phase is assumed to be 4 weeks 28 days long and is characterised by the partial lifting of the lockdown imposed in phase 2 during this period it is assumed further that70 of the symptomatic class and 25 of the asymptomatic class are detected and quarantineda relaxed social distancing rule is exercised which is assumed to have a 25 reduction of effective contacts of individuals in the societyenvironmental disinfection is partially carried out which is assumed to have an impact of reducing the rate of infection from the environment by 30 and increasing the rate of decay of the pathogen from the environment by the same 30
phase 4the last and fourth phase is the time when the social distancing rule is fully lifted due to the lesson learnt from the previous phases we assume that the following interventions will continue during this period as well70 of the i class and 10 of the c class are detected and quarantinedenvironmental disinfection is partially carried out which is assumed to have an impact of reducing the rate of infection from the environment by 20 and increasing the rate of decay of the pathogen from the environment by the same 20

the time profile of the disease dynamics after implementing the above described interventions strategy is plotted in figure 11
 the figure shows that the count of the infected individuals decreases down to nearly zero in phases 2 and 3 but the disease resurges back into the society soon after however the peak of the second wave looks to be much smaller than the first one that means the intervention mechanisms described in the above 4 phases of this case are not enough to contain the disease and unless some additional intervention mechanisms are developed the disease persists in the societycase 3in this case we assume that early action with shorter time social distancing rule is applied in this scenario it is assumed that the interventions described in case 2 started half way through the time that phase 2 was implemented in case 2 that means the implementation of the interventions described in the four phases of case 2 is assumed to be followed but the length of the time in phases 1 and 2 is reduced as described belowaphase 1 lasts only 12 daysbphase 2 lasts only 3 weeks andcphase 3 lasts 4 weeks the same as in case 2
otherwise all the details of the interventions in case 2 are kept the same the time profile for this set of interventions is given in figure 7
the general behaviour of the graph in figure 7 is the same as that of figure 11 however this strategy has an advantage in significantly reducing the height of the first peak the height of the subsequent peaks are found to be the same unless some additional measures are taken after phase 3unfortunately the strategies in both of the above two scenarios case 2 and case 3 do not help to fully contain the disease once it spreads in the population as it can be seen from figures 11 and 7 another wave of outbreaks of the disease emerge at a later stage here we can see that the asymptomatic infectious individuals play the greater role in becoming the major source for the second wave therefore if there is a possibility to track and detect people with asymptomatic infection and if they can be effectively quarantined for the required period of time then there is a possibility for the disease to be contained as it can be observed from figure 8
 if we can increase the rate of detecting and quarantining the asymptomatic individuals to a proportion of about 30 it is possible to significantly reduce the infection to a level where it cannot be a public threat otherwise any lower proportion of this effort will imply the resurgence of a second wave of the infection in the communitytherefore to contain covid-19 in every given community public health authorities need to work more on the detection and quarantining of the asymptomatic infectious individualscase 4in this case we assume that there is no lockdown imposed but only a large number of testing is applied to detect and quarantine a larger proportion of infected casesif it is possible to intensify the effort of tracing the asymptomatic infectious individuals and be able to quarantine at least 35 of them continuously and effectively our simulation shows that there is a possibility for the disease to be contained without imposing the strict lockdown rule on the total population the plot in figure 9
shows the time profile of the count of the infected groups while about 50 of the individuals from i class are effectively quarantined for example inside appropriate health facilitieswe can observe that this intervention strategy can also produce the required result in containing the outbreak as some countries like south korea are currently following this patterncase 5in this case we assume that the length of the lockdown period is nearly twice to the scenario in case 2 however the effort in detecting the asymptomatic infectious individuals is kept at the minimum level this scenario is more applicable in highly resource constrained countries as the current cost of testing is high in this case it is assumed that the length of the duration of each phase except for phase 2 is the same as that given in case 2 more still it is supposed thatathe conditions in phase 1 remain the samebphase 2 lasts 11 weeks with 50 of the symptomatic individuals and 5 of the asymptomatic individuals detected and quarantined moreover strict social distancing rules are still in place with an effect of reducing 70 of human contacts and 50 of environmental variablescphase 3 lasts 4 weeks the same as in case 2 but with 50 of individuals in the i class and 10 of individuals in the c class detected and quarantined while partial social distancing rules are in place with an effect of reducing 25 of human contacts and 25 of environmental variablesdphase 4 continues with detecting and quarantining 50 of members in the i class and 10 of members in the c class while the other mandatory intervention are lifted
the time profile of the infection following the scenario in case 5 is plotted in figure 10
the simulation for this scenario shows that even if we increase the length of lockdown period to 11 weeks like it was practised in the hubei province china the disease may re-emerge after some period of time however the heights of the peaks in the subsequent waves of the disease are much lower than the first peaks therefore once again unless the authorities apply some kind of strict contact tracing mechanism and conduct enough testing to detect and isolate up to 30 of the asymptomatic infectious individuals the disease persists in the community with multiple subsequent wavesin general from the simulations we can observe that in all of the above scenarios a transition from one phase to the other intervention phase is characterised by a surge in new cases however the number will eventually go down if the intervention in the immediate next phase is effective or else the disease re-emerges in the population we presented a mathematical model for the dynamics of covid-19 whose first cases were reported in december 2019 in wuhan-china the model incorporates a behaviour change function to account for the proportion of individuals who decided to use any of the self-protective measures and adhered to them in addition it also considers a proportion of individuals with a historyknowledge of similar infections from the past and practice necessary protective measures right from the onset of the epidemic the model also accounts for asymptomatic carriers of the infection as well as the concentration of the pathogen within the environment the basic properties of the model including well-posedness the disease free equilibrium and its stability model basic reproduction number as well as the existence of backward bifurcation were examined to estimate the parameter values the model was fitted to the data on daily new cases reported in who situation reports 1-57 1 which accounts for the period from january 21 2020 to march 17 2020 from the nominal values from the data fitting we obtained a reproduction number r029 214 which compares well with the values of r0 obtained in other researches for instance 224358
53 and 31195ci239413
52 from our sensitivity analysis simulations we observed that for some given parameter combinations the value of r0 can be reduced to below 1 and similarly for values much higher than 4 we observed that if the recovering individuals do so with permanent immunity 0 then reducing the reproduction number to a value below unity is enough to contain the infection on the other hand if recovering individuals do so with temporary immunity   0 the proposed model exhibits backward bifurcation which implies that reducing the value of r0 below 1 is not enough to contain the infection by applying the latin hypercube sampling scheme we observed that if the disease is to be easily contained measures such as physicalsocial distancing which reduces the rate of disease transmission directly from human to human improved personal hygiene which reduces the rate of disease transmission from the environment to humans and minimal shedding of the pathogen into the environment by both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals have the greatest potential of slowing the epidemic when enhanced we further observed that increased decay of the pathogen from the environment achieved by disinfecting surfaces alone is less significant in reducingcurbing the number of cases we further observed that having high numbers of people with knowledge from previous similar infections that are practising the prescribed self-protective measures can delayslow down the otherwise potentially explosive outbreak consequently the daily number of cases is kept at low manageable levels in addition increasing the average effectiveness of the self-protective measures and adherence to such measures is vital in realising low peaks of the number of cases furthermore due to the absence of vaccination or any approved medication developing capacity to detect carrier groups is very important from our results it is recommended that countries should develop capacities to identify and quarantine at least 30 of carriers as well as at least 50 of symptomatic cases if the infection is to be controlled our model predicts a possible resurgence of the number of cases if the asymptomatic cases are still many by the time disease spread curbslockdown measures are lifted in addition we observe from simulations that although disease spread curbs such as a lockdown measure may be imposed their real impact on the number of new cases may only be realised after approximately 21 days and the reduction when it appears could be sharp in the case of a strict lockdown measure with high impact in reducing effective contact between individuals in the population when providing the mitigation strategies we did not account for the delay between the actual incidence and the point when cases have been confirmed since the actual parameters describing such a delay are not known in health systems where testing of suspected cases is done after individuals show symptoms or on demand it is likely to have a big gap between the actual incidence and confirmation of new cases the impact of the delay between actual incidence and confirmation of case can be explored in future work in addition we assumed that all individuals who recover do so with the same level of immunity however this may not necessarily be the case since immunity of individuals is affected by a number of factors including age cortisol levels and nutrition among others the impact of differentiated levels of immunity on the disease dynamics and potential resurgence of the epidemic can be explored in the future when relevant data becomes available our model did not include the possibility of vaccination or treatment we however acknowledge their importance in controlling the infection therefore optimal control of the infection in the presence of these mitigation strategies can be explored in future works when relevant data becomes available since the disease has been observed to affect age groups differently it is plausible to consider age-structured models to better understand the effect of the disease in the respective age groups the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

medline a longitudinal query analysis 2 short title methodological issues with search in medline c burns sean tyler nix robert shapiro ii m jeffrey huber t  6 abstract this study compares the results of data collected from a longitudinal query analysis of 7 the medline database hosted on multiple platforms that include pubmed ebscohost ovid 8 proquest and web of science in order to identify variations among the search results on the 9 platforms after controlling for search query syntax we devised twenty-nine sets of search 10 queries comprised of five queries per set to search against the five medline database 11 platforms we ran our queries monthly for a year and collected search result count data to 12 observe changes we found that search results vary considerably depending on medline 13 platform both within sets and across time the variation is due to trends in scholarly publication 14 that include publishing online first versus publishing in journal issues which leads to metadata 15 differences in the bibliographic record to differences in the level of specificity among search 16 fields provided by the platforms to database integrity issues that lead to large fluctuations in 17 monthly search results based on the same query and to database currency issues that arise due to 18 when each platform updates its medline file specific bibliographic databases like pubmed 19 and medline are used to inform clinical decision-making create systematic reviews and 20 construct knowledge bases for clinical decision support systems since they serve as essential 21 information retrieval and discovery tools that help identify and collect research data and are used 22 in a broad range of fields and as the basis of multiple research designs this study should help 23 clinicians researcher librarians informationalists and others understand how these platforms 24 differ and inform future work in their standardization 25 methodological issues with search in medline a 26 longitudinal query analysis 27 introduction 28 bibliographic databases are used to identify and collect research data and therefore function as 29 scientific instruments 12 studies that rely on these instruments include research on 30 information literacy bibliometricsscientometrics information seeking systematic reviews 31 literature reviews and meta-analyses 3 these systems in particular pubmed and medline 32 are also used to inform clinical decision-making in the health professions 4 and construct 33 knowledge bases for clinical decision support systems 5 34 research on search queries that inform the development of bibliographic databases or on how 35 queries influence information retrieval sets were once common lines of inquiry 6 but these have 36 subsided in recent decades 7 search query research has largely shifted away from a boolean 37 model of information retrieval and has focused on ranked-based keyword systems 8 or on 38 database coverage 9-12 39 researchers librarians information scientists and others rely on bibliographic databases to 40 conduct research to instruct future information and other professionals how to conduct literature 41 searches and to assist those with information needs to locate and access literature 13 14 15 16  42 furthermore an entire bibliographic universe exists based on bibliographic control that includes 43 standardized rules for description authority files controlled vocabularies and taxonomies to 44 help make searching for information more precise or comprehensive 17 18  45 fine control over bibliographic search and the documentation of search strategies which are 46 often reported in systematic review research should allow for the replication and reproduction of 47 searches in the broader scientific community the replication and reproduction of research or 48 lack thereof has garnered increased attention recently 19 20  additional scrutiny has been 49 given to the replication of prior studies 21  this is true for systematic reviews and other 50 research that relies on citation or bibliographic records but in this domain the evaluation of 51 scientific rigor is centered around the reproducibility of search strategies the preferred 52 reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines 22and the 53 cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions provide examples of how scholars 54 have recognized the need for the systematic reporting of methods and the organization of review 55 research 23 56 unlike general search engines bibliographic databases such as those available on ebscohost 57 proquest web of science scopus ovid and others rely on structured bibliographic records 58 instead of full text sources to create search indexes these bibliographic records contain fields 59 we take as meaningful for providing discovery and access such as author name fields document 60 title fields publication title fields and date of publication fields 17 in some specialized 61 databases these records may be supported by controlled terminologies that are database specific 62 or are based on standard knowledge classification efforts such as the medical subject headings 63 mesh or the library of congress subject headings lcsh 64 controlled vocabularies thesauri and taxonomies are meant to provide users with a high level of 65 control over the search and retrieval process 2425 some thesauri systems are available across 66 multiple platforms or interfaces 26 for example the eric thesaurus is freely available at the 67 us department of educations doe eric digital library ericedgov but also through 68 subscription-based platforms provided by ebscohost and proquest similarly the mesh 69 thesaurus is freely available on the us national library of medicines nlm digital library 70 pubmed but can be used to search on platforms provided by ebscohost ovid proquest web 71 of science and others 72 commercial information service companies presumably provide their own access points to 73 bibliographic data from eric and pubmed and the corresponding thesauri on their own 74 platforms in order to add value above and beyond what the original database providers like 75 nlm or doe have created and provided access to the added value may be based upon the 76 providers unique user interface its search technologies its ability to link to library collections 77 via proxy software its additional database content or its ability to search against multiple 78 databases on a specific platform in single search sessions 79 however adding value entails some differentiation from the original system 2627 that may 80 introduce variation in search results for example the medline database accessed through 81 pubmed is defined by the list of publication titles it indexes the data structure of its 82 bibliographic records the application of mesh to the bibliographic records in those records and 83 the search technologies it implements when a commercial information service provider also 84 provides access to medline it uses that base system but also differentiates itself from 85 pubmed by providing a different interface search fields search operators and other 86 technologies 87 this differentiation among database platforms has long been recognized as important in the 88 systematic review literature in the biomedical sciences and because of this the forthcoming 89 prisma-s search reporting extension recommends that systematic reviewers report which 90 platform interface or vendor is used for each database searched 28 however the implications 91 of this differentiation across platforms with respect to how bibliographic records are queried are 92 not well understood 2930 for example even though pubmedmedline 93 proquestmedline ebscohostmedline ovidmedline and web of 94 sciencemedline are presumably built on the same medline data file it is not fully known 95 how the alterations that are made by these vendors impact search and retrieval on their respective 96 platforms even when there is some transparency such as with pubmed 31 these systems are 97 complicated and differences with other systems are not well understood 98 although the choice of database systems impacts potential source coverage and search methods 99 it is not known how searching the dame database eg medline on different platforms might 100 affect source coverage if searchers used too few databases to conduct literature searches 32-101 34 then they may miss relevant studies 1035 this is especially important in cases where data 102 from past research is collected analyzed and synthesized based on published andor gray 103 literature such as in systematic reviews or meta-analyses 1136 studies have also highlighted 104 problems in the reporting of search strategies highlighting incomplete details necessary for 105 others to investigate the quality of a search strategy 37 but this assumes consistency between 106 platforms that provide access to the same database for example that using medline on 107 pubmed is equivalent to using medline on ovid ebscohost proquest or web of science 108 this may have ramifications for those researchers leading clinical trials or conducting bench-side 109 research and who have to rely on published literature and conduct intensive literature searches 110 when systematic reviews on their topic are not available 111 even if search sessions are methodical and well documented database systems often operate as 112 black boxes ie the technology is not well documented and it becomes only possible to infer 113 how different systems operate by comparing multiple implementations 38 little is thus known 114 about what actual principles are applied by database vendors in indexing bibliographic records or 115 what specific sets of algorithms are used to rank results when sorted by system-defined 116 relevance this is commonly known problem among commercial search engines but it is also 117 problematic in bibliographic databases purchased by libraries 39 40  118 interface indexing and retrieval differences also impact reproducibility and replication which 119 are important aspects of the scientific process evidence-based medicine and the creation of 120 systematic reviews 33 41 42 43 44  although the nlm maintains the medline records and 121 provides free federally subsidized access to them through the pubmed website they also 122 license these records to database vendors to host on their own platforms furthermore although 123 these systems operate from the same medline data file database vendors apply their own 124 indexing technologies and their own search interfaces and it is possible that these alterations 125 influence different search behaviors and retrieval sets 45 46  this may be problematic if 126 platform differences are not commonly understood communicated in vendor reports or among 127 research team members using them and if the separate platforms are unable to replicate results 128 based on the same data files that are used across them 129 while some studies have included queries that were designed to be reproducible across systems 130 35 most studies compare queries across systems by evaluating recall and precision on the 131 retrieval sets in these systems 47 48 49  however the focus is not often on the query syntax used 132 even though this has been highlighted as an important problem one study investigated variations 133 among different interfaces to the cumulative index for nursing and allied health literature 134 cinahl database and reported reproducible search strategies except for queries that 135 contained subject-keyword terms 29  in our prior paper xxxx we found that queries 136 searched in medline across different platforms resulted in search result discrepancies after 137 controlling for the search query this paper extends upon that work with longitudinal data here 138 we ask the following research questions  143 to answer these questions our analytical framework is based on the concepts of methods and 144 results reproducibility 50  methods reproducibility is the ability to implement as exactly as 145 possible the experimental and computational procedures with the same data and tools to obtain 146 the same results and results reproducibility is the production of corroborating results in a new 147 study having followed the same experimental methods a new lexicon for research 148 reproducibility section para 2 we do not apply the concept of inferential reproducibility in 149 this paper since this pertains to the conclusions that a study makes based on the reproduced 150 methods and this would largely be applicable if we investigated the relevance of the results 151 based on an information need rather than as we do focus solely on the reproducible sets of 152 search queries and the records produced by executing those queries 162 the search queries tested in the pilot studies were designed to be semantically and logically 163 equivalent to each other on a per set basis differences between queries within sets were made 164 only to adhere to the query syntax required for each platform 188 note column meanings the keyword column indicates how many keywords were used in the query not counting 189 field specific keywords such as document title journal title or author name the latter are counted in the 190 fieldspecific column which indicates the number of field specific terms used in the query the mesh column 191 indicates how many mesh terms were used in the query the branches column indicates how many trees a mesh 192 term belongs to the pubdate column is a binary column to indicate whether a query does not include a publication 193 date 0 or includes a publication date 1 the explode column indicates whether a mesh term was not exploded 194 0 exploded 1 or in queries with multipe mesh terms at least one term was exploded and one was not 2  the 195 and or and not columns indicate a count of how many of these boolean operators were used in the query in 196 legacy pubmed queries require an and medline sb  tag in order to limit results to medline only and to exclude 197 pubmed more broadly these ands were not counted in this column we did count ands when used to join 198 terms or when including publication date ranges in our searches even for ovidmedline even though 199 ovidmedline uses the limit operator and not technically the and operator   the chain of communication in health science from researcher to health worker through open access leslie chan subbiah arunachalam barbara kirsop   the chain of knowledge transfer in health care begins with the research laboratories in university departments research institutes and health care companies where new research knowledge is generated from there it moves through peer-reviewed publications to the global community the chain can be broken at any link because of technical social or fiscal problems but if the primary link between original researchers and users is broken nothing new can emerge to support the health services around the world the global investment made in research is wasted9 traditionally researchers have published their findings in journals where the peer review process ensures authenticity and accuracy today however journals have become less effective vehicles for knowledge dissemination because their subscription prices have risen far above the cost of inflation disenfranchising readers in poorer nations as a study by who showed medical institutes in the lowest-income countries are often unable to purchase any journals at all10 and so their researchers work in a vacuum isolated from developments taking place in the rest of the world  concerns about the lack of access to research information have stimulated many initiatives if these efforts are to succeed they must build electronic publishing capacity and lead to research independence in 1982 a unesco report stated that assimilation of scientific and technological information is an essential precondition for progress in developing countries11 and this has been widely accepted by many international bodies the uns who and food and agriculture organization established the donation programs access to research initiative hinari and access to global online research in agriculture agora by which partner commercial journals provide free access to registered university and institute libraries in countries with a gross national product per capita below us1000 although these programs have filled gaps their reach is limited and they can never strengthen the national knowledge base in all disciplines of research research communities everywhere need freedom to access the global knowledge pool as their research needs dictate and to make known their own research findings to the international research community only when the current north-south south-north and south-south knowledge gaps are closed can research accelerate to meet growing demands outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases the threat of avian influenza the scourge of hivaids the ongoing infant mortality from malaria and other diseases can only be addressed through the cooperative efforts of researchers the urgency of climate change and environmental concerns along with agricultural research needs supports the importance of sharing research findings with those unable to afford ever growing subscription costs and permission barriers many instances of the consequences of information deprivation are emerging some  examples highlight these dangers gavin yamey provides a number of instances in his article excluding the poor from accessing biomedical literature a rights violation that impedes global health12 in one instance a physician in southern africa whose primary access to information was to abstracts posted on the internet altered a perinatal hiv prevention program based on his reading of a single abstract as yamey reports had the physician had access to the full-text article he would undoubtedly have realized that the study results were based on short-term follow-up a small pivotal group and incomplete data and were unlikely to be applicable to the physicians situation the decision to alter treatment based solely on the abstracts conclusions may have resulted in increased perinatal hiv transmission  but there were no funds to purchase the full-text document similar financial limitations on accessing relevant research resulted in a professor at makerere university uganda being unable to respond to a request to investigate research on the nodding disease a mysterious illness affecting children in southern sudan another reference to the broken link in the information chain came from olayinka ayankogbe a senior lecturer in family medicine at the department of community health and primary care college of medicine university of lagos nigeria who stated in a message to the hifa2015 forum advances in treatment of major endemic diseases made in the north are alien to most doctors in practice even here in lagos take the example of hivaids information on the most recent and advanced therapies are at best confined to the few professors specialized in hivaids treatment in the universities most gps do not know the information gap is horrendous if that word is strong enough to say the least13 an instance of the importance of open access to both publications and data came to light at the conference berlin 5 open access from practice to impact consequences of knowledge dissemination held in padua italy in september 2007 ilaria capua reported on her work with avian influenza and her laboratorys development of valuable sequence data to aid its containment but she disturbed the audience by reporting that she was initially discouraged from putting the data into the free open access database genbank14 capuas belief in the importance of data sharing resulted in a global project to share information on bird flu gisaid the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data15 at no time was the need to share scientific information openly more apparent than during the 2003 sars outbreak at the height of the epidemic there was unprecedented openness and willingness to share critical scientific information immediately as a result of collaboration of 13 major laboratories in 10 countries the coronavirus responsible for the outbreak was quickly identified and its genome mapped within weeks16 in a who news release dr klaus sthr who coordinated the collaborative research network remarked in this globalized world such collaboration is the only way forward in tackling emerging diseases17 since 2001 the global scholarly community has begun to take corrective measures and is widely adopting recommendations outlined in the budapest open access initiative the internet has made possible two recommendations that have the potential to release information locked away in expensive publications these are 1 to deposit copies of an authors final refereed accepted article in his or her interoperable ir also known as author self-archiving or 2 to publish in an open access journal the ir option or self-archiving is increasingly being adopted by funding bodies and universities around the world as figure 1 shows self-archiving requires the installation of free software that conforms to the internationally accepted oai-mph metadata harvest protocol which allows all irs to be searched by google yahoo and specialist search programs such as oaister as though all were a single resource it is important to note that self-archiving is accepted by some 63 of journals registered on the sherpa database of publishers copyright policies this low-cost option is eminently appropriate for low-income countries18 the open access journal option requires the development of alternative funding models that allow free access to all readers and the recovery of publishing costs by alternative economic mechanisms such as author fees  whereby authors or their organizations pay the document management costs  or other chargeable services advertising or institutional support none of the open access journals published in developing countries charges either authors or readers they recover costs through alternative means it has been rightly argued that even though a number of journals waive payment on request switching to an author-fee model does not help researchers in low-income countries but merely shifts the burden of cost from reader to author the directory of open access journals now lists some 4228 open access journals of which about 19 are published in developing countries the bioline international and scientific electronic library online or scielo platforms are examples of services providing open access distribution of research material from developing countries thereby greatly heightening the visibility of essential regional research scielo began in brazil and has been extended to other countries bioline international is a canadabrazil partnership providing a distribution mechanism for publishers from 17 developing and transitional countries the medknow publishing house in mumbai india similarly provides free access to about 80 journals that are published primarily in india and that focus on biomedical research these services together with a number of society journals from the developing countries constitute some 20 of all open access journals unlike a majority of commercial publishers in the industrial parts of the world these publishers have no concerns that open access will damage their journals  quite the contrary as evidence is now accumulating that visibility leads to quality improvements increased submissions increased citations and even subscription growth for the printed versions of their publications it is significant that in 2008 the bmj group which experimented with full open access and then reverted to toll access for non-research articles for bmj extended its open access experiment by introducing bmj unlocked httpadcbmjcominfounlockeddtl which allows authors submitting research to any of the groups 19 specialist research journals to pay an author fee in order to make their work open access19 the registry of open access repositories or roar lists 1396 open access repositories as of june 17 2009 the number increases by an average of 1 each day of these about 16 have been established in institutes and universities in developing countries the directory of open access repositories maintains a similar list the relatively low cost of establishing and maintaining irs makes them a highly appropriate means of distributing local research findings and helping close the knowledge gaps as outlined above deposit of already published articles in interoperable irs that comply with internationally developed and accepted metadata protocols eg oai-mph protocol allows free and immediate access for researchers who are unable to afford the fee-based versions since research scholars do not take the time and effort to download articles unless they need that information for their own research purposes the proof of the value of open access comes in part from usage statistics although it has always been difficult to measure the real impact of specific research findings on the progress of science it is now being shown that the number of articles downloaded from an information resource is a measure of future citation and by extension of impact2021 usage of open access journals published by developing countries was shown to be significant from the start22 and is growing steadily as more material becomes available statistics from bioline international show an increasing volume of usage including full-text downloads from 2002 to 2008 table 1 in 2008 the total number of full-text requests surpassed 42 million indicating the very significant need for previously unavailable research information  figure 2 an overlay map from the bioline website of the distribution of users indicates that usage was largely  though by no means exclusively  from developing regions which suggests that broken links between neighbouring developing countries often facing similar health and environmental problems are being repaired scielo journals have also seen increasing high-volume usage figure 3 shows the number of hits over a 4-year period from the scielo chile site  in india the medknow journals show consistent increases in the use of open access online versions and steadily improving impact factors figure 4 shows the increase in impact factor for medknows journal of postgraduate medicine between 2000 and 2005 before an online version of the journal was made available on an open access basis in 2002 the increase in impact factor was small after 2002 the increase was more rapid and between 2003 and 2004 the impact factor more than doubled  although some publishers have expressed concern that an open access publishing strategy could lead to a loss of subscription income vital for the survival of their journals evidence is now available that shows this not to be the case the main journals publishing high-energy physics research have seen no adverse effect from the widespread use by the physics community of the open access arxiv repository23 similarly in india the medknow publisher of biomedical journals reports an increase in subscriptions since the online versions of the journals were made available on an open access basis figure 5 moreover the quality of local journals has improved as a result of increased visibility with increases in submissions impact factor and international contributors being recorded24 irs are incorporating software to record usage and the resulting statistics show that usage of irs  as with open access journals  is growing dramatically and is worldwide an example can be found at the ir of the universidad de los andes in venezuela which saw a jump from 770273 downloads in all of 2008 to 1122562 in the first six months of 2009 alone and although 556 of the downloads from the total 18-month period originated from within venezuela or the university itself 304 were from neighbouring latin and south american countries and 73 or over 138000 were from countries from around the world including both remote developing countries and countries in europe and north america the origin of 67 of the downloads could not be identified these figures mirror those recorded by other irs and even taking into account the limitations of interpreting web statistics show a significant and increasing sharing of information these statistics are a strong indication that the old communication mechanisms barred many researchers and health workers from the information they needed the serendipitous benefits of re-established links between researcher and user are largely immeasurable since it is impossible to evaluate the consequences arising from chance meetings and partnerships or from the encouragement that grows from a feeling of inclusion in the meantime a number of large-scale open access infrastructure projects are underway in europe the digital repository infrastructure vision for europe has been established to support and develop irs there and a similar program online research collections australia has been set up in australia many groups are working on new software tools to advance the functionality of the ir network for example the sword protocol has recently been made available to allow easy transfer of files between irs other software for metrics of value to institutes authors and publishers are under development and the uks joint information system committee funds a raft of projects relating to irs and metrics it follows from the usage data and personal stories now available that highly improved access to the worlds published biomedical research literature can be achieved through the rapid new developments in open access nevertheless there is limited awareness in poorer countries of the opportunities made possible through open access and more effort needs to be made to increase this awareness among policy-makers research administrators and health care practitioners  the events link on the open access directory website records much global activity but those activities are limited in the main to the industrialized world dedicated groups such as the electronic information for libraries network the electronic publishing trust for development the recently launched open access scholarly information sourcebook together with the development agencies publishers and repository managers in developing countries are all making sterling efforts to inform and train to support open access capacity but these efforts would be much strengthened by support from the major international agencies in the area of health who has a leading role to play in supporting the establishment of open access repositories and journals and it is encouraging to note that in its global strategy and plan of action on public health innovation and intellectual property the world health assembly lists the following as one of its objectives promote public access to the results of government funded research by strongly encouraging that all investigators funded by governments submit to an open access database an electronic version of their final peer-reviewed manuscripts25 although other problems remain connectivity strengthening the links further down the communication chain education training and translation of both language and content there has been a surge of activity in efforts to resolve communication difficulties as discussions on the hifa2015 forum show mobile communications and other technologies are starting to have an impact on the transmission of information to remote areas and the communications infrastructure is an ongoing priority in the developing world see reports from balancing acts newsletter news update krishnan ganapathy a chennai-based neurosurgeon and the former president of the neurological society of india and current president of the apollo telemedicine networking foundation said in an interview with the great efforts underway by dedicated policy-makers researchers computer experts and development professionals it is clear that a way has at last been found to provide a level playing field for all those who need to access health information restoring the link between primary research and those who use it is fundamental to keeping the knowledge chain intact  roles for the recycling endosome rab8 and rab11 in hantavirus release from epithelial cells regina rowe k jason suszko w andrew pekosz   viruses must target structural proteins and genetic material to a specific location in infected cells for efficient assembly of new particles after assembly the virus particles must exit the cell in order to gain access to other susceptible cells or to spread from the infected host viruses that assemble at the plasma membrane exit the cell by budding directly into the extracellular milieu alternatively some viruses assemble by budding through intracellular membranes and must then be transported to the plasma membrane  a process called virus egress ochsenbauer-jambor et al 2001 the assembly of several important human pathogens  hepatitis c virus lindenbach and rice 2002 rotavirus

little is known about the trafficking pathways used to deliver the newly formed viral particles to the plasma membrane ksiazek et al 2003 lai 2001 lindenbach and rice 2002 moss 2001 hantaviruses are

three single-stranded negative-sense rna segments hooper et al 2001 and the entire replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm hooper et al 2001 with little cytopathic effects on the infected cell hardestam et al 2005 meyer and schmaljohn 2000 rowe and pekosz 2006 only four proteins are known to be expressed from the genome  the rna-dependent rna polymerase l two glycoproteins gn and gc produced by proteolytic cleavage of a precursor protein and the nucleocapsid protein n hooper et al 2001 the viral proteins and rna localize to intracellular membranes believed to be part of the golgi apparatus particles then bud into the luminal space and are transported to the plasma membrane via a vesicular trafficking pathway that has not been characterized to date goldsmith et al 1995 hooper et al 2001 ravkov and compans 2001 salanueva et al 2003 shi and elliott 2002 rabgtpases rabs are a large family of small molecular weight proteins stenmark and olkkonen 2001 that are critical mediators of vesicle formation trafficking and fusion slimane et al 2003 zerial and mcbride 2001 rabs gain their specificity for various membranes through interactions with effector molecules grosshans et al 2006 pfeffer and aivazian 2004 and play key roles in many important vesicular transport pathways including golgi to plasma membrane transport slimane et al 2003 zerial and mcbride 2001 rab8 and rab11 have been shown to be critical in trafficking proteins from the golgi to plasma membrane ang et al 2003 chen et al 1998 li et al 1993 zhang et al 2005 rab8 and rab11 are found at the trans-golgi and the recycling endosome a post-golgi compartment that serves as a transport intermediate for some cargo en route from the tgn to the plasma membrane ang et al 2004 chen et al 1998 li et al 1993 disruption of either rab8- or rab11-specific pathways leads to inhibition of recycling endosome-dependent tgn to plasma membrane transport as well as plasma membrane recycling ang et al 2003 ang et al 2004 brock et al 2003 chen et al 1998 li et al 1993 neznanov et al 2003 schlierf et al 2000 zhang et al 2005 however the recycling endosome rab8 and rab11 are not required for trafficking of all proteins from the tgn to plasma membrane as plasma membrane delivery of the influenza a virus hemagglutinin protein is unaffected by inhibition of rab8 or rab11 trafficking pathways chen et al 1998 li et al 1993 yoshimori et al 1996 this indicates that specific sorting events occur to direct cargo into multiple transport pathways ie recycling endosome-dependent and independent to facilitate delivery from the tgn to the plasma membrane viruses often hijack existing cellular pathways in order to complete various stages of their life cycle we investigated the vesicular trafficking pathways important for andv release from infected cells and describe a role for the recycling endosome and specifically rab8 and rab11 during andv exit from non-polarized epithelial cells viruses in the family bunyaviridae are thought to primarily assemble at membranes of the golgi and trans-golgi network tgn and these cellular compartments likely play a critical role in andv replication and assembly we focused our studies on the nucleocapsid protein because it is the most abundant protein in the virion kaukinen et al 2005 and localizes to the site of viral rna replication and particle assembly goldsmith et al 1995 hooper et al 2001 ravkov and compans 2001 while the andv glycoproteins have been shown to localize to the golgi and tgn during infection and from cdna expression deyde et al 2005 little is known about the localization of andv n with this compartment to determine the intracellular localization of andv n during infection immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed on andv-infected vero cells immunostained for andv n and various markers of the golgi and tgn fig 1
 andv n showed partial overlap with gm130 golgin-97 and tgn46 however the extent of colocalization differed slightly the greatest degree of colocalization was observed with gm130 fig 1a a protein associated with the cis-golgi pfeffer 2001 less colocalization was observed with golgin97 fig 1b a membrane-associated protein of the tgn gu et al 2001 yoshino et al 2003 andv n consistently showed more colocalization with membranes positive for tgn46 fig 1c than membranes positive for golgin97 tgn46 is an integral membrane protein that recycles between the plasma membrane and tgn but the recycling kinetics result in tgn enrichment greaves and chamberlain 2007 roquemore and banting 1998 while there was only partial overlap of andv n with the golgi markers the remaining andv n was consistently in close proximity to all of the golgi markers suggesting a close spatial relationship between nucleocapsid and the golgi this data indicates that while a portion of andv n does localize with golgi and tgn membranes the majority of the protein appears to be proximal but not associated with these membrane compartments to gain additional insights on the location of andv n during infection immuno-electron microscopy was performed on andv-infected cells fig 2
 andv n was localized throughout the cytoplasm but concentrated in the perinuclear region fig 2 andv n was primarily localized to large granulofilamentous structures surrounded by large numbers of mitochondria figs 2a and b these structures were not membrane-bound but were proximal to intracellular membranes resembling golgi cisternae fig 2c smaller accumulations of andv n not in filamentous structures also localized to the membranes of small vesicles in close proximity to the golgi figs 2c and d additionally the structure of the golgi was altered with extensive small vesicles surrounding the cisternae figs 2c and d there was no andv n found present at the plasma membrane or enclosed within membrane structures  75 cells observed data not shown and even with large amounts of andv n present in the infected cells no obvious structures resembling viral particles were detected this data suggests that there are two cellular pools of andv n one that is present in large granulofilamentous structures not significantly associated with membranes and one that is membrane-associated in order to determine the role of various cellular trafficking pathways in andv replication we focused our remaining studies on the portion of andv n localized to intracellular vesicular membranes andv n is predicted to be a peripheral membrane protein that exists in a dynamic equilibrium between membrane bound and cytosolic pools hooper et al 2001 kaukinen et al 2005 ravkov and compans 2001 to identify specific vesicular populations during infection andv-infected cells were transfected with cdnas encoding egfp-fusion proteins associated with various host cell trafficking pathways and analyzed by confocal microscopy for colocalization of egfp with andv n protein using 3-d reconstructions of serial z-stack images acquired by confocal microscopy data not shown we were able to focus on the portion of membrane-associated andv n in infected cells expressing cdnas of proteins associated with various vesicular transport pathways andv-infected cells expressing egfp-rab 8 fig 3a or egfp-rab11 fig 3b show a high degree of colocalization between andv n and either rab protein we measured the degree of colocalization using parameters within the volocity software that allowed us to focus on the viral antigen that was associated with the vesicular trafficking proteins described in the materials and methods the percent of egfp colocalizing with andv n was determined by dividing the total colocalization volume by the volume of egfp and expressed as percent colocalization fig 3c using this calculation rab8 and rab11 had the highest level of colocalization with andv n with 301 and 292 of the egfp-rab proteins colocalizing with andv n respectively rabs associated with early endosomes egfp-rab5a late endosomes egfp-rab7 and late endosomeslysosomes rab9 showed colocalization that was clearly less than that observed with egfp-rab8 and egfp-rab11 proteins associated with the multivesicular bodies cd63-egfp and egfp-vps4a showed limited colocalization fig 3c taken together these results suggest that the recycling endosome-associated rabs 8 and 11 colocalize with andv n and therefore may play a role in andv replication many viral proteins show similar subcellular localization during infection and when expressed independently from cdna in order to determine if viral proteins colocalized with rab8 and rab11 when expressed from cdna vero cells were transfected with cdnas expressing either andv n supplemental figs 1a and d or the andv glycoprotein orf m which expresses both gn and gc supplemental figs 1b and e with either egfp-rab8 supplemental figs 1a and b or egfp-rab11 supplemental figs 1d and e cells were then immunostained for either andv n or andv glycoproteins and analyzed by confocal microscopy andv n and the andv glycoproteins colocalized with egfp-rab8 and egfp-rab11 suggesting that both proteins can localize to cellular membranes enriched in rab8 and rab11 independently of virus infection the vesicular stomatitis virus g vsv g protein has been shown to traffic from the golgi to the plasma membrane via rab8- ang et al 2003 ang et al 2004 li et al 1993 and rab11-dependent pathways chen et al 1998 as expected vsv g colocalized extensively with both egfp-rab8 and egfp-rab11 supplemental figs 1c and f the data in fig 3 indicated that andv n could localize to cellular membranes containing cdna expressed egfp-rab8 or egfp-rab11 to determine if the andv n colocalized with the endogenous forms of rab8 and rab11 mock- or andv-infected vero cells were immunostained at 3 dpi for andv n and either endogenous rab8 fig 4a or rab11 fig 4b the signal intensity for immunostaining of endogenous rabs was lower when compared to the cdna-expressed egfp proteins  most likely a combination of higher expression levels of the plasmid expressed fusion proteins and the intense fluorescence signal of egfp while endogenous rab8 was readily detectable endogenous rab11 consistently showed low fluorescent intensity compare green fluorescence images in fig 4 despite the low level of signal intensity there were notable regions of colocalization between andv n and both rab8 fig 4a and rab11 fig 4b suggesting that a portion of andv n expressed during infection was present at membranes containing rab8 and rab11 and providing further support for a role for rab8 and rab11 during andv infection andv n protein also colocalized with fluorescently labeled transferrin data not shown further supporting a role for the recycling endosome in andv infection amino acid substitutions at highly conserved residues within rabgtpases create proteins that are no longer capable of gdpgtp cycling a serine to asparagine mutation at position 25 s25n in rab11 results in constitutive binding of gdp and locks the protein in a dominant negative form in contrast a glutamine to lysine mutation at position 70 q70l prevents gtp hydrolysis resulting in a constitutively active protein the analogous mutations in rab8 are t22n and q70l these mutant proteins often display altered subcellular localization due to augmented proteinprotein interactions chen et al 1998 hattula et al 2006 ren et al 1998 scheiffele et al 1995 to determine if expression of mutated egfp-rab8 and -rab11 proteins during andv infection altered the colocalization of these proteins with andv n infected vero cells were transfected with cdnas expressing egfp-fusions of either wild-type dominant negative gdp-bound or constitutively active gtp-bound mutants of egfp-rab8 and 11 fig 5
 there were notable differences in the subcellular distribution of the egfp-rab8 proteins the gdp-bound form rab8t22n had a tighter perinuclear localization and fewer effects on cell morphology fig 5b while the gtp-bound protein rab8q67l fig 5c had an expression pattern similar to wild-type egfp-rab8 fig 5a hattula et al 2006 scheiffele et al 1995 interestingly both forms of egfp-rab8 displayed similar levels of colocalization with andv n compared to wild-type rab8 figs 5ac quantitated data in fig 5d in contrast egfp-rab11s25n showed increased levels of colocalization with andv n while the constitutively active egfp-rab11q70l showed an approximately 50 decrease in colocalization when compared to egfp-rab11 figs 5eg quantitated data in fig 5h rab11 has been reported to function in trafficking between the trans-golgi and recycling endosome therefore we determined the localization of the egfp-rab11 proteins with respect to the trans-golgi marker tgn46 fig 6
 wild-type egfp-rab11 showed partial localization with tgn46 fig 6a while the q70l mutant showed limited overlap fig 6c in contrast the membrane-associated portion of rab11s25n showed almost complete localization with tgn46 fig 6b these data are consistent with previous reports that the dominant negative rab11 localizes to the tgn while the constitutive active form localizes at the recycling endosome chen et al 1998 neznanov et al 2003 to determine if rabs 8 and 11 played a functional role in andv release from infected cells rna interference rnai elbashir et al 2001 was utilized to downregulate rab8 and rab11 protein expression during infection many cell surface receptors including the hantavirus receptor 3 integrin are recycled through the recycling endosome jones et al 2006 therefore downregulation of molecules within this pathway could alter surface expression of the viral receptor thus affecting virus entry to avoid altering early events in the virus life cycle we took advantage of the fact that andv infection of vero cells leads to prolonged low level virus secretion with little obvious cytopathic effects hardestam et al 2005 meyer and schmaljohn 2000 rowe and pekosz 2006 seventy-two hours following andv infection vero cells were transfected with sirnas specific for the a or b isoforms of rabs 8 and 11 along with sirna controls at this time over 90 of the cells are expressing viral antigen data not shown since most cells express two isoforms a and b of rab8 and rab11 lai et al 1994 lau and mruk 2003 we utilized pooled sirnas specific for either the a isoform or both the a and b isoforms four sirnas per target transcript were used at 48 hpt there was a significant decrease in the rab8 protein expression levels fig 7a after transfection with sirnas targeting rab8a 527 decrease or both rab8a and 8b isoforms 516 decrease transfection of sirnas specific for rab11a or rab11a and 11b isoforms as well as transfection reagent alone siqst resulted in no changes in rab8 expression levels fig 7a there was also a significant decrease in the rab11 protein expression levels fig 7a after transfection with sirnas targeting rab11a 781 decrease or both rab11a and 11b isoforms 619 decrease again with no off-target effects from sirnas targeting rab8 isoforms unfortunately the antibodies used cannot distinguish between the two isoforms so we could not determine the specific downregulation of the b isoforms downregulation of all four targets rab8a and 8b rab11a and 11b resulted in significant decreases in both rab8 488 decrease and rab11 613 decrease proteins fig 7a the level of -actin expression was not altered after any sirna transfection fig 7a the treatment of cells with structured double stranded rnas can lead to host cell antiviral responses that can inhibit viral replication stetson and medzhitov 2006 intracellular andv n levels remained constant after sirna transfection fig 7b indicating there were no adverse effects of sirna transfection on viral protein production in order to assess if sirna treatments altered the secretion of infectious virus particles infected-cell supernatants were harvested immediately before and 48 h after sirna transfection infectious virus production was quantified by an immune tcid50 assay and expressed as a fold decrease in virus production fig 7c downregulation of rab11a or rab11a and 11b resulted in a nearly 10 fold decrease in virus secretion indicating rab11 isoforms were functionally important for andv release from infected cells transfection with control sirnas siqst transfection reagent alone siglo risc-binding deficient sirna and murine pkr sirna a protein not associated with vesicular transport did not alter the amount of infectious virus production when compared to mock-transfected cells indicating there were no non-specific effects of sirna transfection on andv virus production interestingly sirnas specific for rab8a did not alter andv virus secretion fig 7c even though rab8 levels were decreased significantly fig 7a however downregulation of both rab8a and 8b led to a 10-fold decrease in virus secretion decreasing all four rab isoforms did not enhance the decrease virus secretion compared to downregulating rab8ab rab11a or rab11ab the data in fig 7 demonstrates that rabs associated with the recycling endosome play a functional role in andv secretion from epithelial cells and specifically indicates rab11a as a major host cell factor involved in this process many viruses in the family bunyaviridae assemble at golgi membranes and new particles are transported to the plasma membrane via vesicular transport nichol 2001 salanueva et al 2003 the vesicular trafficking mechanism utilized during hantavirus egress is poorly understood but the data presented in this study suggests trafficking through the recycling endosome may be a key step in this process for andv the nucleocapsid proteins of viruses within bunyaviridae have been localized to multiple intracellular compartments the nucleocapsids of uukuniemi virus genus phlebovirus and black creek canal virus bccv genus hantavirus have both been shown to localize to golgi membranes jantti et al 1997 kuismanen et al 1982 ravkov and compans 2001 in contrast hantaan virus genus hantavirus and lacrosse virus genus orthobunyavirus nucleocapsids have been shown to localize to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum er and er-golgi intermediate compartment ergic ramanathan et al 2007 stertz et al 2006 even though andv n had partial colocalization with golgi and trans-golgi markers by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy a significant portion did not overlap with these markers electron microscopy studies further indicated two populations of nucleocapsid the majority of andv n was localized to large cytoplasmic structures not obviously associated with membranes which have been previously described as inclusion bodies in studies of other hantaviruses goldsmith et al 1995 hung et al 1985 ravkov et al 1997 these structures may be caused by accumulation of large amounts of n protein in infected cells or may be the site of rna replication as described for the orthobunyavirus bunyamwera yan et al 2002 further studies will be required to determine the composition of these structures a smaller portion of andv n was membrane-associated at vesicles proximal to the golgi which has been described for uukuniemi virus n jantti et al 1997 these vesicles could be part of the golgi trans-golgi network or post-golgi secretory pathway in order to identify these vesicles we focused on proteins involved in host cell vesicular trafficking pathways from these studies the data suggests an involvement of the recycling endosome pathway and rabgtpases rab8 and rab11 in andv release from infected cells plasma membrane assembly has been noted for sin nombre virus snv and bccv two new world hantaviruses goldsmith et al 1995 ravkov et al 1997 however the lack of plasma membrane localization of andv n in the electron microscopy studies strongly suggests limited plasma membrane assembly however we could not confirm the site of andv assembly because no obvious structures resembling viral particles were observed by electron microscopy at high frequency this is perhaps not surprising given the low numbers of andv particles released per cell it may also be possible that the anti-nucleocapsid sera may not recognize ribonucleocapsids rnps present in budding particles and fully assembled virions however based on the localization of andv proteins it is likely that andv assembles at membranes of the golgi or trans-golgi similar to that observed for hantaan virus and other viruses in bunyaviridae chen et al 1991 hung et al 1985 kuismanen et al 1982 salanueva et al 2003 tao et al 1987 our proposed model of andv assembly and egress starts with andv protein concentrated at the site of assembly to form new particles by budding into the host cell membrane which is enriched in rab8 and rab11 thereby facilitating the access of newly formed particles to the correct egress trafficking pathway egress could then occur via a rab8- andor rab11-mediated mechanism which traffics virus-containing vesicles to the recycling endosome the virus particles could then be sorted into vesicles destined for the apical or basolateral plasma membrane it is important to note that our studies utilized non-polarized vero cells intracellular trafficking in polarized versus non-polarized cells may utilize slightly different pathways so an analysis of andv trafficking in other relevant cell types eg polarized epithelial cells macrophages endothelial cells is warranted the recycling endosome regulates plasma membrane recycling of many cell surface receptors such as transferrin ang et al 2004 ren et al 1998 schlierf et al 2000 sheff et al 2002 low-density lipoprotein ldlr ang et al 2004 and polyimmunoglobulin pig receptors apodaca et al 1994 rojas and apodaca 2002 sheff et al 2002 in addition to receptor recycling the transport of select cargo from the golgi to the plasma membrane is also regulated by this compartment ang et al 2003 ang et al 2004 chen et al 1998 hattula et al 2006 ren et al 1998 our model proposes a similar role for the recycling endosome in the transport of andv particles to the plasma membrane both the viral nucleocapsid and glycoproteins colocalized with egfp-rab8 and egfp-rab11 when expressed from cdna however the localization of the nucleocapsid protein varied from cell to cell with some cells showing high levels of colocalization and others showing minimal colocalization this variation seemed to be related to high nucleocapsid expression levels in some cdna transfected cells therefore we focused our intracellular localization studies on cells that had levels of viral protein similar to that observed in andv-infected cells the expression of constitutively active and dominant negative rab11 proteins resulted in altered colocalization of the egfp-fusion proteins with andv n during infection the dominant negative rab11s25n protein showed an enhanced colocalization with andv n localizing closely at a perinuclear location and is similar to observations in which rab11s25n retained vsv g intracellularly at a perinuclear site resulting in decreased g surface expression chen et al 1998 in stark contrast to rab11s25n the constitutively active rab11q70l showed a dramatic decrease in colocalization with andv n it was further determined that the two mutant rab11 proteins localize to distinct membrane compartments rab11s25n localized to the trans-golgi while rab11q70l showed limited localization with the trans-golgi marker consistent with rab11 function and our model of andv assembly and egress the gdp-bound mutant localizes at the donor membrane the trans-golgi chen et al 1998 neznanov et al 2003 and may retain or enhance andv n localization to that membrane compartment in contrast the gtp-bound mutant localizes to the acceptor membrane the recycling endosome and by sequestering transport machinery at the recycling endosome may reduce trafficking of important host cell proteins involved in andv replication or trafficking of the viral proteins or particles themselves by utilizing rnai we determined that both rab8 and rab11 play a functional role in andv release from infected cells downregulation of rab8a showed minimal effects on virus secretion and was similar to control transfections however in cells transfected with sirnas targeting rab11a a 1015 fold decrease in virus secretion was observed downregulation both rab11 isoforms did not enhance the effect on andv release seen with rab11a downregulation alone suggesting that rab11a plays the predominant role in andv infection in contrast downregulating rab8a had little effect on andv secretion but reducing the expression of both isoforms led to a 10-fold decrease in virus release this result indicates that there is either redundancy in the rab8 pathway or rab8b is playing a more important role in andv replication it is unlikely that the effects of sirna downregulation of rab8 and rab11 on virus secretion are caused by a nonspecific block in all post-golgi secretion since numerous studies indicate that rab8- and rab11-independent pathways of golgi to plasma membrane transport exist chen et al 1998 crespo et al 2004 li et al 1993 yoshimori et al 1996 consistent with our model the sirna studies indicate an important role for rab8 and rab11 in andv replication given the low level of andv particle formation fig 2 we were unable to identify the precise step at which andv particle egress was blocked after treatment of infected cells with rab8 and rab11 specific sirnas the sirna sequences used were designed to recognize human forms of rab 8 and 11 and may not be optimal for recognizing the corresponding proteins from african green monkeys however we utilized four sirnas per construct and did in fact see downregulation of some rab isoforms indicating that sirna downregulation of rab transcripts was in fact occurring a more extensive downregulation of rab 8 and 11 protein levels may be needed to find the relatively low numbers of virus particles that are in the intracellular trafficking pathway during any particular time after andv infection rab11a has been shown to play a role in the replication of respiratory syncytial virus rsv brock et al 2003 hiv-1 murray et al 2005 varthakavi et al 2006 and another retrovirus masonpfizer monkey virus m-pmv sfakianos and hunter 2003 in these examples trafficking of viral proteins through the recycling endosome is required for the proteins to reach the site of particle formation at the plasma membrane thus the recycling endosome is functioning prior to virus assembly although the experiments we performed have not formally ruled out a role for rab8 and rab11 in andv assembly or budding rab8- and rab11-coated vesicles bud away from the membrane compartment into the cytoplasm and therefore have a different topology from that required to promote virus assembly into the golgi lumen alternatively disruption of rab8 and rab11 pathways could disrupt the localization of a host protein critical for virus assembly and further studies will need to be performed to determine this possibility since andv assembly is hypothesized to occur at the golgi rab8 and rab11 are presumably altering trafficking steps that occur after virus assembly this leads us to propose a model in which rab8 and rab11 are playing roles in steps of egress downstream of virus assembly to our knowledge a role for the recycling endosome in post-assembly trafficking of viruses to the plasma membrane has not been described to date hantaviruses may be utilizing the recycling endosome and its function in polarized trafficking to direct particles from the host cell in a directional fashion infection of polarized epithelial cells with viruses in the family bunyaviridae including andv leads to the polarized release of virus particles this release can be strictly apical strictly basolateral or a combination of both chen et al 1991 connolly-andersen et al 2007 gerrard et al 2002 ravkov et al 1997 rowe and pekosz 2006 since rab8 and rab11 play roles in polarized trafficking ang et al 2003 ang et al 2004 brock et al 2003 it is possible that andv utilizes these pathways to egress in a polarized fashion from cells by utilizing the recycling endosome during egress hantaviruses could be sorted in both the apical and basolateral direction and ensure appropriate viral spread and tissue tropism within the host anti-andv human convalescent sera 1150 immunofluorescence was kindly provided by stephen st jeor

viral infections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in humans in 1918 the influenza a pandemic was responsible for over 40 million deaths worldwide as of december 2002 60 million people had been infected with hiv and one-third of those infected were dead further emerging infectious diseases often have a viral etiology as evidenced by the recent outbreaks of a newly discovered coronavirus that produced severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemics in asia and north america and of monkeypox in the us chronic infections with hepatitis b and c viruses and herpes viruses are also significant public health threats and will remain so for the forseeable future clearly viral infections remain a significant threat to human health thus considerable efforts are expended to develop vaccines and therapeutics to control both acute and persistent viral infections the outcome of human viral infections depends on a complex interaction between the virus and the host genetic polymorphisms in the human population and the dose strain and route of virus inoculation all contribute to the wide range of clinical outcomes in viral infections the study of viral pathogenesis and the preclinical development of viral vaccines and therapeutics requires the use of animal models the exquisite specificity of viruses for their cellular receptors and the absolute requirement of viruses for appropriate intracellular machinery defines the host cell tropism of viruses and explains why viruses tend be adapted for infection of particular host species the relative genetic homology of humans and nonhuman primates nhps means that there is considerable conservation of the critical molecules used by viruses in their life cycle thus nhps often are the only species that can be infected with human pathogens alternatively a number of viruses endemic to nhps are distinct but closely related to human pathogens and are good models for the related human infection further the development genetics function and anatomy of the immune system of nonhuman primates and humans are very similar which makes nonhuman primates very useful for understanding human immunity excellent reviews document the historical role of nhps in viral research renegar 1992 soike et al 1984 including the critical role that monkeys played in elucidating the pathogenesis of poliovirus and in the development of the poliovirus vaccine sabin 1965 this review will focus on contemporary studies employing nhps to model viral diseases currently of greatest public health concern hantavirus genus hantavirus family bunyaviridae infection in humans is associated with two severe and potentially fatal diseases hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs is associated primarily with hantaviruses found in europe and asia and is characterized by fever thrombocytopenia renal failure and in severe cases hemorrhage due to increased capillary permeability lee et al 1982 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps is associated with infection by hantaviruses indigenous to the americas eg andes muerto canyon and sin nombre viruses and is characterized by fever myalgia and rapid onset of severe respiratory distress nichol et al 1993 the mortality associated with hps is 4050 lednicky 2003 the reservoirs of hantaviruses are specific rodent hosts in which persistent nonpathogenic infections are common lednicky 2003 schmaljohn and hjelle 1997 transmission to humans is by inhalation of aerosolized rodent urine or feces mcelroy et al 2002 human to human transmission of hantavirus has been documented only in cases of hps caused by andes virus padula et al 1998 no effective hantavirus vaccines have been developed and while the viruses causing hfrs respond to antiviral therapy with ribivarin there is currently no effective antiviral drug therapy for hps chapman et al 1999 several species of nhps are susceptible to experimental infection with hantaviruses groen et al 1995 yanagihara et al 1988 and nhp models are emerging as valuable tools for investigating hantavirus pathogenesis and for evaluating antiviral therapies and candidate vaccines experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with puumala virus produced typical signs of hfrs including lethargy anorexia proteinuria andor hematuria along with cytokine creatinine nitric oxide and c-reactive protein responses similar to those of human hfrs klingstrom et al 2002 nhp models have also been used to evaluate candidate hantavirus vaccines prototype dna vaccines against hantaviruses causing hfrs have elicited high titer neutralizing antibody in rhesus macaques hooper et al 2001 in a first attempt to develop a model of hps cynomolgus macaques were experimentally infected with andes virus by the intravenous or aerosol route viremia was detected by rt-pcr in 4 of 6 exposed animals but none developed clinical signs of hps one animal developed a 3-fold decrease in baseline platelet count coincident with high viremia and consistent with thrombocytopenia seen in human hfrs all animals however showed significantly reduced lymphocyte counts and all developed igm and igg antibodies against viral nucleocapsid protein and neutralizing antibody titers mcelroy et al 2002 future refinements of primate models should greatly facilitate progress in the treatment and prevention of hantavirus-related diseases ebola virus family filoviridae has been responsible for outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with high mortality in both humans and nhps evans et al 2003 walsh et al 2003 many species of nhps are susceptible to experimental infection with ebola virus the outcome of which is almost uniformly fatal the lethality of ebola virus infection in primates has been used as support for the conclusion that nhps are not the natural reservoir host of ebola in nature the course of ebola virus infection in nhps closely follows that observed in infected humans baskerville et al 1978 johnson et al 1995 jaax et al 1996 as a result nonhuman primates have been used extensively in studies of ebola virus pathogenesis baskerville 1978 johnson et al 1995 jaax et al 1996 riyabchikova et al 1999 ignatiev et al 2000 studies in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques have demonstrated that lethal ebola virus infections can occur by oral conjunctival or aerosol routes of exposure jaax et al 1996 jahrling et al 1996 johnson e et al 1995 experimental infections in african green monkeys and baboons have confirmed that macrophages and monocytes are the first cells to be infected and play a major role in subsequent systemic distribution of virus riyabchikova et al 1999 experimental studies have also documented the absence of an inflammatory response in ebola virus-infected nhps baskerville et al 1978 jaax et al 1996 suggesting virus-induced impairment of immune function studies in baboons have shown that the severity of ebola virus-induced coagulopathies is correlated with increases in serum levels of interferon and tumor necrosis factor- ignatiev et al 2000 interestingly differences have been observed in ebola virus pathogenesis in different species of nonhuman primates following infection with ebola-zaire baboons developed signs of hemorrhagic disease while african green monkeys given the same dose developed generalized fibrin thrombosis in the absence of overt hemorrhage riyabchikova et al 1999 these findings indicate that species-specific differences need to be considered when selecting a nhp model of ebola virus infection and that use of different model systems may be necessary to address the entire spectrum of human disease associated with ebola virus infection nhp models have also figured prominently in efforts to develop an ebola virus vaccine sullivan et al 2000 sullivan et al 2003 passive immunization of cynomolgus macaques with hyperimmune globulin alone or in combination with recombinant interferon- was not protective geisbert et al 2002 jaax et al 1996 jahrling et al 1996 jahrling et al 1999 similarly cynomolgus macaques immunized with liposome-encapsulated irradiated ebola virus produced virus-neutralizing antibodies but were not protected against lethal challenge suggesting that both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are required for protection rao et al 2002 newer approaches to vaccine development have focused on the induction of both cellular and humoral immune responses incorporating the use of dna vaccines a prime-boost protocol combining dna immunization followed by a boost with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing ebola viral proteins induced both cellular and humoral immune responses in cynomolgus macaques immunized animals were completely protected from lethal challenge with ebola-zaire indicating that a preventive vaccine against ebola virus is feasible sullivan et al 2000 this prime-boost protocol while effective as a preventive vaccine regimen required more than 6 months to complete precluding its use in controlling an acute epidemic sullivan et al 2003 recent studies have demonstrated that immunization of cynomolgus macaques with recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding ebola virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein in the absence of dna priming resulted in earlier antibody production and induction of ebola virus-specific cd8 t-cell responses monkeys immunized with only a single dose of this construct and challenged 28 days later were completely protected against both high and low-dose viral challenge sullivan et al 2003 the disease potential and pathology of respiratory pathogens differs in primates and rodent animal models for two major reasons first the anatomy and development of the respiratory system in rodents is significantly different from that in the human or nonhuman primate plopper et al 1992 second many viruses that are pathogenic in humans are also pathogenic in another primate species but not in rodents mainly due to the need for specific host cell factors for viral replication respiratory virus infections of humans have been modeled in a wide range of primates including chimpanzees belshe et al 1977 hancock et al 2000 teng et al 2000 macaques blake and trask 1921 bukreyev et al 2002 fouchier et al 2003 ponnuraj et al 2001 rimmelzwaan et al 2001 van den hoogen et al 2001 zaucha et al 2001 and african green monkeys durbin et al 2000 kakuk et al 1993 recently two new viral pathogens a pneumovirus and a coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome were successfully transmitted to cynomolgus monkeys and this helped to establish the etiology of these newly discovered respiratory tract infections fouchier et al 2003 van den hoogen et al 2001 primate models have been used for many years to study respiratory tract infection and immunity to measles virus figure 341
 blake and trask 1921b putz et al 2003 influenza renegar 1992 rimmelzwaan et al 2001 soike et al 1984 parainfluenza durbin et al 2000 hall et al 1993 schmidt et al 2002 respiratory syncytial virus belshe et al 1977 cheng et al 2001 hancock et al 2000 kakuk et al 1993 leaman et al 2002 teng et al 2000 and more recently monkeypox zaucha et al 2001 the majority of published work is focused on vaccine development possibly the best studied example of differing host species pathogenicity and hence the use of an animal model is the case of measles virus both rodent and primate animal models have been used for measles vaccine research but wildtype strains of measles virus do not replicate in rodent species with the exception of cotton rats so that vaccine-induced protective immunity can be tested only in humans or susceptible nonhuman primates putz et al 2003 similar restrictions are a concern for animal models of influenza virus renegar 1992 soike et al 1984 primate models have played a critical role in understanding the problem of enhanced or atypical lung disease that occurred in children vaccinated with whole-inactivated viral vaccines against measles or respiratory syncytial virus when these children were exposed to wildtype virus this vaccine-induced immunopathology has been extensively modeled in mice and a type 2 cd4 t cell has been found to play a pivotal role graham et al 2002 however the laboratory mouse is not permissive for measles or respiratory syncytial virus replication and the question of protective versus immunopathologic vaccine immunity can only be addressed in a primate model using nonhuman primate models it has now been shown that hypersensitivity reactions are largely responsible for the enhanced pathology associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection after immunization with formalin-inactivated rsv vaccines de swart et al 2002 kakuk et al 1993 ponnuraj et al 2001 studies in macaques have demonstrated a role for immune complexes and eosinophils in the pathogenesis of atypical measles polack et al 1999 for two decades nhp models for aids especially simian immunodeficiency virus siv infection of macaques have provided important insights into the transmission and pathogenesis of aids as well as virus-specific immune responses to anti-siv vaccine regimens although an effective vaccine against human aids is not yet available significant progress is being made towards this goal reviewed in robinson 2002 studies of primate lentivirus transmission in nhp models has permitted dissection of the earliest events that occur in an infected host after exposure to virus under defined conditions these include the effects of a viral inoculum dose viral virulence and the route of exposure reviewed in pope and haase 2003 experiments in nhp have also determined the temporal relationship between lentiviral replication after known virus exposureinfection systemic infection the development of antiviral immune responses and disease progression perhaps most important for vaccine development nhp studies have compared lentivirus-specific immune responses early after virus exposure in both vaccinated and unvaccinated animals to assess potential correlates of vaccine-mediated protection reviewed in mcmichael and hanke 2003 the results of these experiments have begun to identify key strategies that could be used for reducing or eliminating hiv transmission from one infected person to another understanding each of these areas is essential to developing a vaccine to prevent human hiv infection or aids and these studies are neither feasible nor ethical in humans 
table 341
compares the key similarities and differences between the major nhp models of hivaids and human hiv-infection the chimpanzeehiv-1 model uses hiv-1 but hiv infection in chimps is generally non-pathogenic and thus does not model aids in humans this limitation coupled with the very small number of chimps and their endangered species status make the chimphiv model for aids largely impractical for hiv vaccine research a variety of nhp species can be infected with isolates of hiv-2 which is genetically similar to siv many african nhp species are naturally infected with species-specific siv variants but these endemic siv infections apparently do not result in aids asian macaques are not naturally infected with siv but experimental inoculation of macaques with siv variants isolated from african monkeys results in aids reviewed in gardner 2003 a number of macaque and baboon species have been used for transmission pathogenesis and vaccine studies with hiv-2 locher et al 2001 infection of macaques with siv or hybrid sivhiv viruses containing the hiv-1 envelope shiv are generally accepted as the most practical nhp models for human hiv-infection and aids and they are widely used to evaluate vaccine strategies against aids reviewed in letvin et al 2002 mcchesney et al 1999 mcmichael and hanke 2003 robinson 2002 it is well-established that the capacity of a primate lentivirus to cause immunodeficiency disease in asian macaque species is associated with its ability to replicate to high levels after establishing systemic infection mcchesney et al 1999 although several biological properties including co-receptor use and growth in transformed t cell lines and primary macaque blood cells were proposed to account for virulence of siv and shiv isolates it has been demonstrated that none of these reliably predict the ability to induce aids in infected macaques table 342
 persistently high viral replication as measured by high levels of viral rna or core antigen in plasma is also the best predictor of the reliability of transmission by mucosal exposure for siv or shiv isolates table 342 in developed countries where infant formula is readily available and breastfeeding is not essential to infant survival vertical hiv transmission can be prevented effectively by antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy and delivery combined with a short course of antiretroviral drugs given to the newborn however in most developing nations even with some prenatal care or limited access to antiretroviral drugs there are few alternatives to breast feeding because formula and clean water are rarely available or affordable mbori-ngacha et al 2001 in these settings exposure to breast milk remains a major risk for hiv infection and a neonatal vaccine that can protect against hiv breast milk transmission is urgently needed to evaluate strategies that may prevent hiv infection by breast feeding hiv breast milk transmission has been modeled in infant rhesus macaques the most direct model is siv-infection of pregnant macaques who are allowed to suckle their infants early studies using this model found low or unreliable siv transmission to infants mcclure et al 1991 recently amedee and colleagues amedee et al 2003 reported efficient breast milk transmission of siv to infants of siv-infected dams a limitation of this model is that the duration of breast feeding until siv infection of infants varied from a few weeks to months and was not associated with levels of viral rna in milk amedee et al 2003 to conserve adult female macaques needed for breeding and to better control viral and host variables an alternative macaque model of hiv breast milk transmission is oral siv or shiv inoculation of newborn and infant macaques that may be nursery-reared advantages of experimental oral virus inoculation include the ability to use a specific dose of a well-characterized virus inoculum to vary the total number of virus exposures and the intervals between virus exposures and to assess how infant development may modulate outcome of virus exposure disadvantages are the need for labor-intensive nursery rearing of siv-exposed infant macaques in specialized bsl-2
containment facilities increased clinical care by veterinary staff of siv-infected infants and the absence of anti-microbial factors normally present in macaque breast milk which may more closely mimic conditions found in breast milk of hiv-infected women farquhar et al 2002 studies using oral inoculation of infant macaques with siv or shiv have demonstrated that antiretroviral drugs van rompay et al 2001 hiv neutralizing monoclonal antibodies baba et al 2000 hofmann-lehmann et al 2001 and passively acquired siv-specific non-neutralizing antibodies van rompay et al 1998 can prevent infection if given before or in some cases soon after virus exposure recently van rompay and colleagues van rompay et al 2003 have shown that active immunization of infant rhesus macaques with live-attenuated siv and recombinant poxvirus vectors expressing siv structural proteins can protect against high viremia and delay onset of aids after oral inoculation with virulent siv collectively the results of these studies using the sivinfant macaque model suggest that both passive and active immunization strategies may be successful in reducing breast milk transmission of hiv the major histocompatibility complex mhc plays an essential role in immune responses to viral infections and the enormous variation observed for human mhc genes is thought to reflect selective pressure by microbial especially viral pathogens there is consensus that some mhc alleles carrington and bontrop 2002 and haplotypes can significantly modulate the rate of progress to aids in hiv-infected people carrington 2003 carrington and obrien 2003 cullen et al 2002 cullen et al 2003 trachtenberg et al 2003 in addition concordance between mhc class i alleles of hiv-infected women and their infants is associated with increased risk of vertical hiv transmission polycarpou et al 2002 further there is evidence that specific human mhc alleles influence both the response to hiv-infection and immunization with hiv vaccines kaslow et al 2001 it has even been proposed that the relatively low genetic variation at mhc class i in chimpanzees is a direct result of long-term selection by an ancient siv during a devastating pandemic in wild chimpanzees de groot et al 2002 in contrast to the chimpanzee recent studies of the mhc of asian macaques indicate that the allelic and haplotype variation among individual animals is similar to or greater than mhc variation observed for humans doxiadis et al 2000 also as shown for hiv-infected humans some rhesus mhc alleles and haplotypes have been reported to influence the rate of disease progression in siv-infected animals carrington and bontrop 2002 oconnor et al 2003 pal et al 2002 sauermann et al 2000 and may modulate vaccine protection against siv challenge oconnor et al 2003 pal et al 2002 these observations underscore the need to identify more mhc alleles and to define complete mhc halplotypes in nhp species used for aids vaccine development friedrich and watkins 2003 sauermann 2001 
the ultimate test of the relevance and utility of nhp models of aids for hiv vaccine development is their accuracy in predicting efficacy of specific vaccine strategies in human clinical trials to date only results of a single clinical trial of hiv vaccine efficacy are available for comparison with efficacy observed in nhp models this double-blind placebo controlled human trial jointly sponsored by the nih and vaxgen found no overall efficacy of a clade b hiv recombinant gp120 protein vaccine in groups at high-risk for hiv exposure in the usa ie there were no statistically significant differences between individuals receiving placebo or vaccine in either the proportion of individuals who become hiv-infected or in viral load after infection cohen 2003a cohen 2003b this outcome was mirrored in prior nhp efficacy trials of recombinant hiv envelope gp120 or 160 for chimpanzees challenged with non-homologous laboratory isolates of hiv-1 girard et al 1996 and for macaques immunized with recombinant hiv envelope gp120 or gp160 both examples showed little or no protection against infection by parenteral or mucosal challenge with pathogenic siv or shiv isolates reviewed in robinson 2002 results are expected to be available by the end of 2003 of a second large human clinical trial to assess the efficacy of recombinant canarypox vector expressing hiv envelope and other structural and regulatory proteins given as primary immunization followed by recombinant hiv envelope protein as a booster immunization preclinical studies in macaques immunized with recombinant canarypox expressing siv andor hiv antigens found that despite only modest levels of virus-specific immune responses vaccinated animals had reduced viral load and slower disease progression compared to unvaccinated controls after challenge reviewed in robinson 2002 if the results of nhp efficacy studies consistently reflect those for human trials of similar hiv vaccine strategies this will reinforce the value and relevance of nhp models of aids for hiv vaccine development especially to identify immune correlates and perhaps to understand mechanisms of hiv vaccine efficacy use of nhps as models for human cytomegalovirus hcmv has expanded dramatically in the last few years because of the increasing appreciation of the impact of hcmv infection on human health hcmv is a member of the herpesviridae family of viruses mocarski 1993 it has been recognized for over 30 years as a serious threat to the developing fetus where it can cause a wide spectrum of pathological outcomes weller 1971 hcmv is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality in those with either aids or an immunosuppressed immune system alford and britt 1993 there is no licensed vaccine for hcmv although there has been a long-standing recognition of the medical need for one committee to study priorities for vaccine development and medicine 1999 hcmv is species-specific and will not grow in the nhps available for study this limits experimental investigations to tissue culture settings and natural history studies in humans leaving many experimental questions unanswered however the nhp models are ideally suited to fill the experimental void concerning many critical aspects of hcmv natural history and to develop novel immunological and chemotherapeutic strategies that can either prevent infection or limit disease the vast majority of studies have involved infection of rhesus macaques with rhesus cmv rhcmv however important observations have also been made with cmv of other macaque species the african green monkey baboon and chimpanzee all of these simian systems are also relevant surrogates for hcmv for this review a prototypical simian cmv phenotype is presented based on studies with the different nhp cmv comparative studies between different nhp cmv are extremely limited it should be stressed that each cmv representative has co-evolved with its host species accordingly the evolution of virus-host relationships may have led to important and as yet undiscovered distinctions between the different cmv isolates cmv has been isolated from multiple genera and species of old and new world nhp hosts asher et al 1974 black et al 1963 eizuru et al 1989 it is probable that every nhp species has an associated species-specific cmv analyses of the genomes protein expression and serological cross-relatedness demonstrate that cmv isolates from different nhp species are unique to each host davison aj et al 2003 eizuru et al 1989 gibson 1983 hansen et al 2003 kilpatrick et al 1976 minamishima et al 1971 tinghitella et al 1982 there is no evidence to date that the cmv of one host species can grow in another host species following natural exposure however simian cmv replication in vitro is not restricted to cells of the host species the cmv of african green monkeys black et al 1963 and rh cmv alcendor et al 1993 can productively infect human and nhp cells in culture further agmcmv can productively infect rhesus macaques and replicate for years swack et al 1971 with the expansion of nhp cmv sequences on genbank it is now possible to confirm the species identity of a primary isolate by limited sequence analysis like hcmv simian cmv is a common infectious agent in nhp populations andrade et al 2003 black et al 1963 eizuru et al 1989 kessler et al 1989 minamishima et al 1971 swack and hsiung 1982 swack et al 1971 vogel et al 1994 virtually 100 of monkeys in breeding facilities are seropositive by one year of age and 50 of infants are seropositive by 6 months of age vogel et al 1994 it is likely that multiple strains of cmv are present within each breeding facility alcendor et al 1993 comparable rates of seroprevalence have been reported in monkeys trapped in the wild eizuru et al 1989 minamishima et al 1971 ohtaki et al 1986 swack et al 1971 the routes of transmission are not known but it is likely that virus is horizontally transmitted from mother to infant via breast milk and saliva similar to identified modes in humans virus is also normally excreted in urine adding another route of virus spread there is no evidence consistent with transmission in utero although low rates cannot be excluded vogel et al 1994 maternal-fetal transmission is a critical component of hcmv congenital transmission and this is one aspect of hcmv natural history that cannot be modeled in nhp at this time it is most likely that absence of congenital infection in nhp has to do with the high seroprevalence of hcmv in breeding age females cmv seroprevalence changes dramatically if animals are reared in smaller cohorts from birth when infants are separated from the dam at or soon after birth and hand reared in a nursery the animals remain essentially cmv-free well past the age of sexual maturity barry unpublished minamishima et al 1971 simian cmv infection in immunocompetent hosts either experimental or following natural exposure does not result in any clinical signs of disease this is similar to the vast majority of hcmv infections mononucleosis a relatively rare outcome of primary hcmv infection has never been associated with cmv infection in the nhp in addition there have been no published reports or anecdotal observations of cmv disease in monkeys that were culled or died of reasons other than acquired immunodeficiency or immunosuppression it can be concluded from the absence of disease that host immune responses to primary cmv infection are highly protective the general course of primary infection in a seronegative host involves rapid dissemination from the site of infection to distal sites throughout the body lockridge et al 1999 in monkeys naturally exposed to cmv virus is probably transmitted across the oral or genital mucosa experimental inoculations have been done by the oral intravenous and subcutaneous sc routes viral dna can generally be detected in the blood within 7 days of infection and in multiple tissues within two weeks lockridge et al 1999 antiviral immune responses are rapid and increase in intensity as viral plasma dna loads decrease cellular antiviral responses follow the same course of development as the humoral responses a variety of hematological changes follow experimental iv inoculation although no consistent pattern is observed lockridge et al 1999 there are two prominent hallmarks of the persistent phase of rcmv infection chronic viral shedding and stability of the antiviral immune responses these characteristics are identical to hcmv infected monkeys can remain viuric for years following primary infection probably for the life of the host asher et al 1974 swack and hsiung 1982 the frequency of cmv shedding is variable between animals although some monkeys appear to be constantly shedding infectious virus at the oral and genital mucosa historically shedding has been assayed by culturing virus more recently sensitive molecular techniques such as real-time pcr have been used to detect and quantify cmv dna purified from mucosal swabs huff et al 2003 approximately 50 of seropositive monkeys are dna-positive in mucosal fluids at any one time thus there is active and ongoing virus replication at mucosal surfaces within a persistently infected host occasionally antigen-positive cells can be detected by immunohistochemistry in other tissues although the tissues are usually histologically normal without an accompanying inflammatory response the relative constant exposure to cmv antigens probably explains the pattern of antiviral immune responses observed in long-term infected monkeys both antibody titers and cellular responses stay relatively stable over time end-point antibody titers to total viral antigen preparations hover around the plateau level achieved at the end of the primary infection cellular responses to rhcmv antigens also exhibit little fluctuation kaur et al 2002 
the maintenance of a stable virus-host relationship ie no disease requires a considerable expenditure of the immunological repertoire of the infected host up to 58 and 53 of memory cd4 and cd8 t-lymphocytes respectively have been shown to be cmv-specific in healthy cmv-positive rhesus macaques kaur et al 2002 pitcher et al 2002 comparably high frequencies of cmv-specific memory t cells have been observed in persistently infected humans waldrop et al 1998 waldrop et al 1997 the three conditions in which hcmv is a serious pathogen immunodeficiency immunosuppression and intrauterine infection have strong parallels in nhp these conditions are summarized below the first published descriptions of cmv disease in nhp occurred in the context of rhesus macaques coinfected with the type d simian retrovirus srv and a lentivirus the simian immunodeficiency virus siv henrickson et al 1983 king et al 1983 lerche et al 1984 letvin et al 1983a letvin et al 1983b osborn et al 1984 the acquired immunodeficiency disease caused by both srv and siv was characterized by persistent lymphadenopathy severe wasting chronic diarrhea high morbidity and mortality and multiple opportunistic infections including activated cmv activated cmv disease is generally characterized by an abundance of cytomegalic cells containing cytoplasmic andor intranuclear inclusions and often associated with tissue necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration in tissues this pattern of cmv infection in immunodeficient monkeys is distinct from the paucity of viral inclusions in healthy macaques and is strikingly similar to cmv disease in human aids patients the incidence of cmv disease in monkeys with saids caused by siv or srv is variable some studies have reported that up to one-third to one-half of cmv seropositive animals have evidence of cmv disease at necropsy baskin et al 1988 kaur et al 2003 king et al 1983 kuhn et al 1999 osborn et al 1984 similar to hcmv activated simian cmv can be observed in multiple tissues baskin 1987 however cmv disease is not always systemic and can occur in only a single tissue sequar et al 2002 cmv retinitis an important clinical problem in some human aids patients has not been described in a saids monkey there are multiple distinctions between the course of rhcmv infection in an immunodeficient and an immunocompetent host notable changes include an increased frequency of detectable rhcmv dna in blood elevated genome copy numbers in tissues and declining measures of anti-cmv immune functions such as ctl activity cytokine secretion and neutralizing antibody titers kaur et al 2003 sequar et al 2002 the kinetics of these changes are variable if siv infection occurs during the primary phase of rhcmv infection the onset of rhcmv disease and saids can be rapid 1027 weeks post siv if the monkeys are inoculated with siv during the persistent phase of rhcmv infection the time of death can be greatly extended 10 weeks  1 year one study observed a statistically significant decrease in the time of death in animals with rhcmv end-organ disease compared to animals without histological evidence of activated rhcmv kaur et al 2003 cmv sequelae have also been observed in immunosuppressed nhp receiving either allografts or xenografts although there are not many references in the literature the occurrence of activated cmv in transplant-recipients appears to be related to the use of intense immunosuppression regimes such as cyclophos-phamide corticosteroids andor anti-thymocytic globulin designed to prevent graft rejection a transplant recipient can develop cmv histopathology similar to cmv disease in human allograft recipients including pneumonitis and vasculopathies ghanekar et al 2002 mueller et al 2002 ohtaki et al 1986 ohtaki et al 1988 teranishi et al 2003 further studies are required to determine the utility of nhp as an experimental model to study transplantation-associated cmv disease primarily because the frequency of cmv reactivation in this setting is not known rhcmv can cause a range of developmental defects in experimentally inoculated rhesus macaque fetuses that are almost identical to those observed in human infants congenitally infected with hcmv it should be stressed that fetal infection in this nhp is a model of intrauterine pathogenesis and not transplacental transmission no studies have been reported documenting either natural or experimental maternal-fetal cmv transmission in nhp the published studies of cmv-induced fetal disease required direct in utero inoculation of fetuses with virus chang et al 2002 london et al 1986 tarantal et al 1998 using ultrasound guidance needles can be directed through the abdominal wall of the dam to deliver virus to precise locations within the developing fetus at defined stages of gestation growth and developmental outcomes can be prospectively monitored by ultrasound and fetal samples blood amniotic fluid and tissue can be obtained by needle biopsy rhesus macaque fetuses have been inoculated with rhcmv by the intramniotic ia intracranial ic and intraperitoneal ip routes from late in the first trimester gestation day 50 through mid-gestation day 80 chang et al 2002 london et al 1986 tarantal et al 1998 mild to severe fetal outcomes have been observed in approximately 50 of inoculated fetuses no rhcmv sequelae have ever been observed in the dams although there has been suggestive evidence of retrograde transmission of the virus across the placenta london et al 1986 the developing brain is highly sensitive to cmv disease with a spectrum of developmental abnormalities these include microcephaly lissencephaly ventricular dilatation leptomeningitis encephalitis and periventricular calcifications all of these are hallmarks of congenital hcmv infection alford and britt 1993 rhcmv histopathology is not limited to the brain and systemic effects such as intrauterine growth restriction disseminated rhcmv disease and isolation of virus in blood and tissues have been seen chang et al 2002 tarantal et al 1998 placental abnormalities deciduitis infarction calcification and lymphocytic infiltration have been seen in some of the inoculated fetuses london et al 1986 
cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 generally referred to as herpes b virus bv is an alphaherpesvirus of the rhesus macaque with strong genetic virological and immunological relatedness to herpes simplex virus hsv of humans bv infection of the rhesus monkey seems to accurately model hsv infection of humans but the deadly zoonotic potential of bv has prevented its use in an animal model however it was recently listed as a categorical pathogen by the us public health service and could be an agent of bioterror thus a brief discussion of bv is included here bv is endemic in asian macaque populations weigler 1992 and closely related alphaherpesviral variants are present in african nhp eberle and hilliard 1995 bv deservedly bears the most attention of the nhp alphaherpesviruses because of its pathogenic potential in humans zoonotic infection of humans with b virus is almost invariably fatal 70 in the absence of antiviral chemotherapies and severe non-fatal infections can result in encephalomyelitis or severe neurological impairment huff and barry 2003 bv is the only simian herpesvirus that is known to cause disease in humans the most salient feature of bv natural history in terms of its occupational risk is that an overwhelming majority of macaques shed b virus without overt signs of disease huff je et al 2003 weigler et al 1993 zwartouw and boulter 1984 thus every bv-seropositive macaque must be considered as a potential source of infectious bv whether through its bodily fluids or its tissues despite the preceding risk assessment there have only been approximately 40 documented cases of human infection since the first reported transmission to humans in 1932 huff and barry 2003 the disproportionality between the number of zoonotic infections and the high seroprevalence of bv in breeding age animals is a function of the bv life cycle the biology of bv infection in macaques is characterized by a lifelong persistence with infrequent and usually subclinical shedding at mucosal surfaces although the natural history of bv has not been described in detail the replication cycle of hsv serves as a precedent roizman and sears 1993 virus is transmitted across a mucosal surface such as the oral or genital mucosa following localized replication in mucosal epithelial cells the virus is transmitted directly to sensory nerve endings the prevailing thought is that there is no associated bloodborne stage of infection except in rare systemic infections simon et al 1993 the virus particle is carried by axonal transport to the dorsal root ganglia where the virus establishes a true latent infection in neurons latency is noted for a lack of viral replication and an extremely limited pattern of viral transcription periodic reactivation from latency results in the production of progeny virions which transport back down the axon to mucosal epithelial cells where they replicate and the infectious virus is released from the mucosal epithelium for bv most episodes of recurrent viral shedding are asymptomatic huff et al 2003 weigler et al 1993 zwartouw and boulter 1984 and represent a constant risk of zoonoses clinical signs of either primary or recurrent infection oral herpetic lesions such as gingivostomatitis oral and lingual ulcers and conjunctivitis are the exception carlson et al 1997 keeble et al 1958 weigler 1992 and usually require immediate euthanasia of the animal virus isolation and molecular detection of bv dna indicate that the frequency of shedding in a population is low 15 although more studies are needed to establish a true rate there is evidence to suggest that shedding frequency may go up during breeding season huff et al 2003 weigler et al 1993 there is a strong correlation between the seroconversion to bv and the age of the animal seroconversion rates increase sharply when monkeys reach the age of sexual maturity with prevalence rates of 80100 in adult populations weigler 1992 weigler et al 1993 there is no evidence for vertical transmission of bv human b virus infections have generally involved direct contact with macaques or their tissues or fluids huff and barry 2003 methods of contact have included a bite scratch contact of a mucosal surface with a macaque body fluid or tissue or a contaminated needle puncture or cage scratch huff and barry 2003 there has only been one documented case of human-to-human transmission although the potential for secondary transmission is probably low holmes et al 1990 bv disease can begin within a few days to a month although disease progression is variable in terms of the kinetics and clinical signs guidelines for reducing potential exposure and treatment of suspected bv infections in humans have recently been published holmes et al 1995 hepatitis b virus hbv a small double-shelled hepadenavirus virus that contains a partially double-stranded dna genome of approximately 3200 bases is found in several species including woodchuck ground squirrel a range of bird species such as duck goose and grey heron marion et al 1980 mason et al 1980 summers et al 1978 and the nhps chimpanzee pan troglodytes woolly monkey lagothrix lagothrica orangutan pongo pygmaeus gibbon hylobates sp and gorilla gorilla gorilla grethe et al 2000 lanford et al 1998 mimms et al 1993 vaudin et al 1988 warren et al 1999 hbv isolated from gibbons and chimpanzees share an early phylogenetic lineage indicating that these viruses were indigenous to their respective hosts norder et al 1996 despite the species specificity of natural hbv isolates experimental infection of chimpanzees with human and gibbon hbv can be accomplished gallagher 1991 gibbons can be infected through experimental exposure to human saliva containing hbv bancroft et al 1977 scott et al 1980 replication of human hbv in a number of primate species suggests that natural hbv cross-transmission can occur hbv can be present in the blood and other body fluids including salivanasopharyngeal fluids semen cervical secretions and leukocytes alter et al 1977 davison f et al 1987 however hbv transmission from gibbon or chimpanzee to human has never been documented cd8 t cells mediate viral clearance during acute hbv infection in chimpanzees thimme et al 2003 hepatitis c virus hcv is a member of the flaviviridae family and has a single-stranded positive sense rna genome the chimpanzee is the only experimental animal susceptible to infection with hepatitis c virus hcv the chimpanzee model of hcv infection was instrumental in the initial studies on non-a non-b hepatitis including observations on the clinical course of infection determination of the physical properties of the virus and eventual cloning of the hcv nucleic acid reviewed in lanford and bigger 2002 other nhp models of hcv have been developed using surrogate viruses such as gb virus-b reviewed in beames et al 2001 gb virus-b virus is closely related to hcv and it is hepatotropic in addition the level of gbv-b viremia observed in infected tamarins the animal model for gbv-b is greater than 1000-fold higher than for hcv tamarins are much easier to house than chimpanzees and a tissue culture system for gbv-b using primary tamarin hepatocytes is available beames et al 2000 thus primates are likely to play an important role in developing effective hcv vaccines

  communicable respiratory threats in the ed tuberculosis influenza sars and other aerosolized infections richard rothman e yu-hsiang hsieh samuel yang   tuberculosis tb is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis which is a slow-growing acid-fast bacillus it is the second most common cause of infectious diseaserelated deaths worldwide after hivaids 6 with 88 million incident cases per year and 17 million deaths per year 7 in the united states the disease burden is lower but still significant with approximately 15 million people infected overall 8 although public health preventive measures over the past decade have resulted in a favorable trend in the incidence of tb in the united states with a peak of 105 cases per 100000 in 1992 to 51 cases per 100000 in 2003 rates of decline have recently slowed 8 this slowing in the rate of decline along with the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis mdrtb 9 makes this disease one of the leading public health threats to our nation tb is spread by tiny 1- to 5-m airborne droplet nuclei which can remain airborne for hours after expectoration caused by coughing sneezing or talking the infectious nuclei are inhaled and lodge in the distal alveoli where host defenses are activated a variety of potential subsequent events follow based on pathogen load and host responsiveness in most cases cell-mediated immunity results in immediate destruction of the organism in some cases however initial infection is established when the organism is transported to regional lymph nodes here further cell-mediated immune response results in containment of infection or in those with less-effective immune systems development of immediate disease ie primary active tb for the majority of infected individuals who successfully contain the infection bacteria remain contained in granulomas or tubercles where replication of the organism is limited this latent infectious state generally lasts for the life of the infected patient in others reactivation of infection occurs when the hosts immune response is no longer capable of containment those at highest risk for reactivation include the very young the elderly and patients with chronic immunocompromising diseases particularly hiv 10 for immunocompetent individuals the overall lifetime risk of reactivation of tb is 10 for those with hiv the risk of reactivation is significantly higher estimated to be about 7 per year ed diagnosis and public health control measures are challenging because clinical presentation of tb can be highly variable and culturing the organism takes days to weeks primary tb is most frequently asymptomatic and identifiable only by a positive skin test ppd purified protein derivative in rare cases active disease may develop which is clinically similar to reactivation tb signs and symptoms of reactivation tb can be either pulmonary only 80 of cases or systemic early recognition of tb in the clinical area requires maintaining a high level of clinical vigilance populations recognized to be at increased risk of infection include foreign-born persons from areas where tb is common eg asia africa latin america and countries that were part of the former soviet union medically underserved patients low-income populations racial and ethnic minority groups eg african americans hispanics asians and pacific islanders and native americans the residents of long-term care facilities eg correctional facilities and nursing homes injection drug users idus migrant farm workers homeless persons and persons who may have had a personal or occupational exposure to tb 11 the most common symptoms of tb are fever productive cough and dyspnea other symptoms include night sweats malaise fatigue and weight loss hemopytysis and pleuritic chest pain in one ed-based study of a series of patients who later were identified as having contagious tb cough was present in only 64 of cases and was the chief complaint in less than 20 of cases furthermore only 36 of patients reported any pulmonary complaints at triage 12 tb can involve nearly every organ system but the most common extrapulmonary sites infected are the lymph nodes central nervous system cns bones and joints cns presentations are usually subacute with findings including indolent headache fever and occasionally altered mental status although tb can affect nearly every joint the spine is the most commonly affected site potts disease disseminated tb can involve multiple organ systems including the lungs diagnosis should be suspected in those with a miliary pattern on chest radiographs patients with suspected tb should be isolated in negative pressure isolation rooms as early as possible until tb has been ruled out with certainty definitive diagnosis is not possible in the ed since culture is the gold standard and requires several weeks for growth a presumptive diagnosis of tb can be made by ziehl-neelson staining which identifies acid-fast bacilli sensitivity of this method is only 50 to 80 however and requires obtaining multiple positive sputum samples for confirmation new laboratory-based molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction hold promise for rapid definitive diagnosis but are not yet accepted as routine for clinical decision making 13 chest radiographs should be obtained on patients with suspected tb classic radiographic findings are upper-lobe infiltrates cavitary infiltrates and hilar or paratracheal adenopathy it is critical to keep in mind however that radiographic findings with tb are highly variable with atypical findings more common in those with immunosuppressive states such as advanced hiv 14 disposition and treatment decisions for ed patients with suspected or confirmed tb should be made in consultation with infectious disease specialists hospital epidemiologist and public health services should be notified for all new cases suspected or confirmed and respiratory isolation patients should be maintained outpatient treatment is considered acceptable in those instances in which compliance and home isolation can be assured admission with inpatient respiratory isolation should be arranged for any patient with uncertain diagnosis question regarding outpatient medication compliance concern for mdrtb or other obvious clinical parameters requiring hospitalization ie hypoxemia beginning treatment which is beyond the scope of this review consists of three- or four-drug therapy until drug susceptibility can be confirmed emergency departments are particularly vulnerable to the threat of tb and represent high-risk sites for potential propagation of disease contributing factors include characteristics of the patient populations served ed infrastructure and the inherent nonspecific clinical features and highly contagious nature of the disease 15 16 17 as described above those groups at highest risk for tb eg the homeless the uninsured immigrants idus and hivaids patients often use the ed as their principal or sole site of care 18 19 20 busy inner-city waiting rooms and overcrowded conditions with long wait times and lack of adequate isolation rooms and personal protective equipment further contribute to the potential spread of tb 21 one recent retrospective study from an urban teaching hospital found that 44 active tb patients made 66 contagious ed visits over a 30-month period that went unrecognized before diagnosis 12 a similar retrospective study found that nearly 50 of newly diagnosed tb cases had an antecedent visit within 6 months of diagnosis 22 several studies from high-risk urban eds have demonstrated delayed disease recognition with reports of lengthy ed stays median 13 hours 23 and significant delays in time to isolation median time of 8 hours from triage to isolation 24 increased risk of tb infection among health care workers hcws versus the general population is evident the results are principally derived from the evaluation of ppd conversion studies with one recent review reporting an overall incidence of ppd positivity 100 times higher in hcws versus that found in the general population 25 risk of tb infection significantly increases when clinical procedures that produce large amounts of aerosol are performed such as induced sputum or intubation 26 ed staff reportedly have ppd conversion rates up to six times higher than other hospital workers with rates of conversion ranging from 1 to 12 27 principal explanations for the high rates of ed hcw ppd conversion include the high frequency of atypical presentations for patients with tb at initial presentation the lack of consistent implementation of triage screening for tb and the lack of availability of adequate infection control facilities in eds 21 interventional approaches to tb control can be primary secondary or tertiary consistent application of simple public health measures can convert the ed from a site that represents a high-risk venue for further disease transmission to one that can improve disease prevention recognition and control the principles of tb control described in the 1994 centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidelines for hospitals and other health care facilities encompass three areas of intervention administrative engineering and use of personal protective equipment ppe 28 although there are no specific guidelines for tb control provided by the american college of emergency physicians acep most texts use the cdc guidelines as a standard 28 administrative interventions include development of methods to ensure early isolation of persons with suspected disease development of hospital-wide tb control plans and maintenance of an active ppd skin-testing program among hcws engineering controls focus on handing of air negative-pressure respiratory isolation rooms uv light fixtures and hepa high-efficiency particulate air filters 29 ppe involves routine use of the n-95 particulate respirator for hcws who are in close contact with suspected cases several studies conducted since 1994 have demonstrated that adherence to these guidelines significantly increases identification of cases and reduces disease transmission in hcws 16 23 for example the introduction of tb control measures including engineering upgrades and improved access to ppe in one inner-city ed resulted in a nearly sixfold diminution in ppd conversion among hcws 16 similar administrative and facilities improvement in another high-risk ed resulted in decreased wait times and increased rates of appropriate isolation for ed patients with suspected tb 23 development of methods for rapid identification of cases of tb at ed triage has met with mixed results one study that evaluated the use of a simple triage guideline found that the sensitivity and specificity of their screening tool was only 63 and 78 respectively 30 explanations for the relatively low sensitivity of the tool included lack of consistent compliance with guideline implementation and failure of a subset of patients to report key risk factors and symptoms at ed triage which were elicited later during the ed evaluation an alternate tb screening tool that was retrospectively derived from a population of culture-positive cases had a much higher sensitivity 96 31 the final decision instrument involved assigning a 1-point score to each of several variables abnormal chest x-ray temperature greater than 101f homelessshelter dwelling and tb history with a positive screen assigned to any patient with more than 2 points the principal limitation of this method which restricts applicability for triage decision making is the need for chest radiographic findings to assign a score however the tool may be appropriate for determining need for isolation a tertiary public health intervention for tb control involves routine ppd testing in ed patients the one study conducted to date to evaluate the feasibility of this approach reports promising findings sixty percent of eligible patients consented to testing and more than half returned for follow-up which is comparable to that seen in other public health venues 32 optimal strategies for targeted screening found that it is possible to identify a high-risk group which would identify nearly 90 of cases while testing only about 50 of the ed population although promising further research is required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this strategy general principles for management of patients with suspected tb for emergency physicians include maintaining a high index of suspicion and immediately providing a mask to decrease rates of transmission to any patients with tb risk factors or suspected symptoms early chest radiography should then be performed and implementation of full airborne precautions should be established for any patients with suggestive findings on radiographs or high clinical suspicion of disease high-risk clinical procedures that will aerosolize m tuberculosis should be minimized as much as possible in the ed unless isolation facilities with proper ventilation are available 33 influenza is a seasonal disease that occurs in the winter months with the vast majority of cases reported from november through march annual outbreaks and sporadic pandemics result in significant morbidity and mortality globally epidemics of influenza result in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 250000 to 500000 deaths each year in the united states influenza accounts for more than 100000 hospitalizations and nearly 40000 deaths each year the majority occurring in susceptible populations the elderly or the very young 34 during the past century three pandemics global epidemics of influenza have occurred the spanish flu in 1918 to 1919 was responsible for 40 million deaths worldwide and 650000 in the united states more recent pandemics which have had less impact in the united states include the asian flu 1957 to 1958 34000 deaths in the united states and the hong kong flu 1968 to 1969 70000 us deaths 35 in contrast to the annual epidemics of influenza deaths during influenza pandemics frequently occur in young otherwise healthy individuals 36 influenza is a single-stranded rna virus which belongs to the family orthomyxoviridae there are three major types of influenza viruses a b and c which are structurally similar but vary antigenically only types a and b cause infections in humans influenza a is more common and virulent than b and is divided into subtypes based on viral surface antigens hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigenic drift is produced by point mutations in the viral antigen that occur during viral replication and result in slightly different new strains of influenza for which there is diminished immunologic recognition antigenic shift is a sudden major change in the surface peptides that occurs when two different strains of influenza infect the same individual simultaneously this results in mixing of the surface antigens and a new subtype of influenza for which humans have little or no protective immunity all of the recent influenza pandemics were caused by antigenic shift 37 in 1997 the avian strain a h5n1 the first avian virus known to have been transmitted directly from birds to humans 38 began to appear in several asian nations 39 40 this strain has proven to be highly virulent with nearly 200 deaths reported to date worldwide although several family clusters of avian influenza suggest that human-to-human transmission may have occurred there is no evidence that efficient transmission can occur via this route 41 42 43 significant public health concern exists regarding reassortment of avian influenza with the human virus which could then produce a strain of flu that would be both extremely virulent and contagious potentially triggering the next pandemic 44 influenza a and b can be transmitted from person to person via a number of routes including 1 direct or indirect contact with contaminated articles 2 droplet 10 m transmission produced by release of contagious droplets produced by coughing or sneezing by an infected host resulting in contact with the nasal mucosa conjunctiva or mouth of another person or 3 airborne transmission leading to inhalation of small 5 m nuclei that remain suspended in the air and can be disseminated by air currents 4 evidence exists that transmission may begin 1 to 6 days before the onset of symptoms and that viral shedding and human infectivity may persist for several weeks particularly among those who are immunocompromised in adults the classic presentation of influenza is abrupt onset of high fever myalgia headache and malaise with accompanying respiratory symptoms cough sore throat and rhinitis in children otitis media nausea and vomiting are also common 45 unfortunately these signs and symptoms are highly nonspecific making ed diagnosis challenging one recent systematic review reported that no individual or combination of clinical signs and symptoms can reliably confirm or exclude the diagnosis of influenza 46 data from a recent ed-based study supporting this conclusion noted that more than 50 of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza had atypical or nonclassic symptoms on presentation particularly among those with comorbid conditions 47 therefore it is recommended that physicians be aware of both local and national epidemiologic data to determine if influenza is in a particular community and then have a low index of suspicion for consideration of this disease 46 with increasing concern about other acute communicable respiratory illnesses emergency physicians should also be aware of new and evolving algorithms that may help clinicians differentiate common influenza from avian influenza sars anthrax or other emergent biothreats 48 suspected cases of influenza can either be managed empirically or have rapid testing performed to assist with treatment decision making the value of diagnostic testing has been well described and includes limiting use of unnecessary antibiotics more specific use of antivirals identification of atypical cases of disease decreased length of ed stay and improved surveillance by local and state health departments regarding presence subtype and strain of influenza 47 49 clinical data supporting routine testing is more compelling in children than adults 50 51 although testing is advised by the cdc during suspected influenza outbreaks as part of the broader surveillance and public health strategy aimed at controlling the spread of disease in a health care facility laboratory tests currently available include rapid antigen testing polymerase chain reaction pcr immunofluorescence serology and viral culture from various types of respiratory specimens nasopharyngeal swab throat swab nasal wash nasal aspirate sputum and bronchial wash or serum commercially available rapid tests can provide results in the ed within 30 minutes performance characteristics of the tests are variable but generally sensitivity is greater than 70 and specificity is greater than 90 the cdc recognizes the limited sensitivity of the rapid test and recommends that samples should always be sent for viral culture which is considered gold standard confirmation with viral culture 45 definitive laboratory diagnosis of influenza is not absolutely required for management 46 and many ed texts recommended using laboratory testing only in those instances where testing would influence treatment decisions 52 thus in the midst of a known influenza outbreak a patient with typical signs and symptoms who can be managed with empiric therapy need not be subjected to testing instances in which laboratory testing may be indicated include cases in which the diagnosis is in doubt because of early or late seasonal presentation or atypical clinical presentation or in those cases where treatment decisions may be aided by a definitive test eg those patients in whom complications of untreated influenza are more likely 53 the most common complications associated with influenza are primary influenza viral pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia other less frequent complications include encephalopathy transverse myelitis reyes syndrome myositis myocarditis and pericarditis general guidelines regarding treatment issued by the cdc in 2004 to 2005 are as follows cdc encourages the use oseltamivir or zanamivir for treatment as supplies allow in part to minimize the development of adamantane resistance used for prophylaxis among circulating influenza viruses treatment with antiviral medication is advised for 1 any person experiencing a potentially life-threatening influenza-related illness and 2 any person at high risk for serious complications of influenza and who is within the first 2 days of illness prompt diagnosis and treatment also has the beneficial effect of reducing the duration of host infectivity pregnant women should consult with their primary providers regarding use of influenza antiviral medications further details and the most up-to-date treatment and prophylaxis recommendations can be found on the cdc web site during flu season influenza is one of the leading causes of ed visits especially among children and among adults aged 65 and older 54 several us- and canadian-based studies that evaluated emergency medical system ems diversion as a proxy for ed overcrowding have reported high correlations between influenza season and ems diversion 55 56 another study conducted in europe during peak flu season found that approximately one third of all ed visits for children younger than 1 year of age were attributable to influenza 57 although several nosocomial outbreaks of influenza in health care workers have been documented there has been relatively little research describing transmission in the ed one study conducted in an acute-care hospital during the 1986 to 1987 flu season found that one third of influenza a cases identified could be traced to the ed and that the estimated nosocomial influenza attack rate was 03 per 100 hospital admissions 58 the ed thus represents a high-risk location for nosocomial transmission several interventions help to decrease the likelihood of individuals contracting influenza and lessen the likelihood and burden of a public health crisis associated with an influenza outbreak the principal known preventive measure is routine and widespread use of vaccination 59 current cdc recommendations for populations to vaccinate include adults aged 65 years and older persons aged 2 to 64 years with underlying chronic medical conditions all women who will be pregnant during the influenza season residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities children aged 2 to 18 years on chronic aspirin therapy health care workers involved in direct patient care and out-of-home caregivers and household contacts of children aged younger than 6 months 60 several studies lend support for using the ed settings for routine influenza immunization 61 data demonstrate high rates of ed visits for unimmunized individuals who are at high risk for influenza eg nursing home patients and the elderly as well as moderate to high rates of physician and patient acceptability for ed-based immunization 62 63 64 65 66 one recent randomized clinical trial comparing on-site ed-based vaccination to education and referral demonstrated that ed-based vaccination was significantly more efficacious both for pediatric patients as well as their accompanying family members 67 other potential vaccination strategies that remain relatively unexplored include use of ems 68 either as a routine preventive measure or in the event of an epidemic outbreak in the wake of the flu vaccine shortage and in preparation for future inevitable influenza outbreaks the acep issued a policy statement in 2004 highlighting ed priorities during suspected or known influenza outbreaks

from american college of emergency physicians emergency department utilization during outbreaks of influenza policy 400558 approved november 2004 with permission the first documented cases of sars occurred in november of 2002 in the guangdong province of china initially presenting as an atypical pneumonia 70 71 over the next several months a surge in cases of pneumonia were reported in the surrounding regions with a disproportionate number of hospital workers affected and several unexpected deaths 72 months after the initial case of this atypical pneumonia a physician from guangdong traveled to hong kong infecting up to 16 others during a brief hotel stay this triggered a global pandemic with outbreaks in hong kong singapore vietnam and canada 73 74 in spite of early evidence that these illnesses represented an emerging infectious disease based on number of cases lack of responsiveness to standard therapy and high transmissibility hospitals were generally slow to implement respiratory isolation procedures it was not until several hundred more cases were reported that the world health organization who issued a global health alert resulting in establishment of an international laboratory reporting network and standardized protocols for infection containment 75 these measures contributed to the definitive identification of sars a novel previously uncharacterized coronavirus as the causative pathogen 73 76 the peak period of the sars pandemic occurred in late 2002 and early 2003 during which time cases were reported in more than 25 countries spanning five continents although the exact number of cases is unknown it is estimated that there have been more than 8000 probable cases and 774 deaths as of july 2003 at which time human-to-human transmission was essentially contained 77 78 the largest number of sars cases have occurred in mainland china hong kong taiwan and canada where a significant outbreak occurred in the city of toronto in the united states there have been 29 cases of probable sars all of which have been linked with preceding international travel to an endemic area 79 80 there have been no us sars-attributable deaths to date sporadic cases of sars continue to be reported four cases were reported in guangdong in late 2003 three separate laboratory-related incidents were reported in singapore taiwan and china one of which resulted in a small contained community outbreak 81 clinical symptoms associated with sars typically emerge 2 to 10 days after an exposure with a mean incubation period of 5 days in most infected individuals initial clinical presentation and the clinical course of patients with sars is variable and generally nonspecific making diagnosis challenging 82 since definitive diagnosis relies on advanced laboratory testing ed consideration of sars must rely on having a high clinical suspicion which should be guided by history focusing on potential exposure characteristic clinical features and laboratory and radiographic findings as described in the following paragraphs during the first stage of infection patients infected with sars typically present with flu-like symptoms the most common finding on initial presentation is fever greater than 38c although exceptions occur in the elderly and in those with chronic underlying illness other clinical features occurring in more than 50 of cases include chills rigors cough and myalgias less frequent but also commonly appearing are rhinorrhea dyspnea watery nonbloody diarrhea and headache 74 83 84 85 common laboratory findings associated with sars including lymphopenia thrombocytopenia derangements in clotting profiles and various electrolyte abnormalities the majority of patients with sars have abnormal radiographs the most common chest x-ray finding in a patient with sars is a unilateral infiltrate early on followed by bilateral interstitial or confluent infiltrates these findings are usually indistinguishable from viral or atypical pneumonias one study suggests that the presence of an air-space opacity on chest radiographs may be a helpful early diagnostic clue to sars 86 for public health surveillance purposes who defines a clinical case of sars as an individual with 1 a history of fever or documented fever 38c 1004f 2 one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness cough difficulty breathing shortness of breath 3 radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome ards or autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or ards without an identifiable cause and 4 no alternative diagnosis that can fully explain the illness 87 laboratory testing for sars should include both respiratory and blood samples laboratory diagnosis can be made by any one of three assays according to who standards 1 any of one nucleic acid test for the sars-cov in two specimens or two nucleic acid tests in one specimen 2 seroconversion by elisa or ifa immunofluoresence assay or 3 isolation of the sars-cov using validated testing methods and appropriate quality assurance mechanisms 87 approximate 20 to 30 of sars cases require treatment in the intensive care unit the case fatality rate of sars is estimated at approximately 10 to 15 globally with increased rates seen in older patients with comorbid disease 83 the clinical course of disease can be mild to fulminant respiratory decompensation typically occurs in a week to 10 days although some patients may have a more rapid progression requiring intubation at the time of initial presentation in one of the largest sars cohorts from hong kong a triphasic progression of disease was described phase 1 is a brief period of malaise fever and flu-like symptoms which resolves with antibiotics phase 2 occurs several days later and is characterized by recurrent fevers diarrhea oxygen desaturation and progression of x-ray findings only a small subset of patients approximately 20 progress to phase 3 which is marked by severe sepsis and multiorgan system failure most notably ards 85 transmission of sars from infected patients to health care workers visitors and other patients was well documented during the sars pandemic 88 early on it was recognized that overcrowded understaffed emergency departments with limited resources represent extremely high-risk sites for disease transmission 89 90 91 92 93 94 one study that tracked 322 sars patients in beijing china found that of all heath care workers ed staff had the highest attack rate 119 95 another detailed epidemiologic investigation from toronto found that transmission of sars to ed staff who had contact with sars patients ranged from 0 to 22 with a calculated attack rate of 136 per 1000 nursing hours exceeding that found in the icu 94 factors believed to contribute to the high rates of contagion in the ed included difficulty with early identification and isolation of patients particularly those with atypical symptoms use of aerosol treatments for patients with respiratory symptoms in the ed and poor compliance with basic ie hand washing and other recognized public health control measures for reducing transmission of respiratory infections 96 implementation and adherence with systematic preventive measures resulted in significant reduction of disease transmission throughout the world and are discussed further below 92 97 the 2003 sars pandemic forced a widespread shift in thinking regarding the role of the ed from that of emergent treatment and stabilization of patients with acute illnesses to central coordination of a public health response plan in the face of an emerging pandemic 92 98 recognition that eds serve as the primary portal of entry for patients with a highly contagious and potentially lethal disease was paramount to the development of rationale and well-organized infection control programs 99 one recent comprehensive literature review describes the cumulative experiences of hospitals and health care organizations 100 sars was found to be spread principally by the respiratory droplet route making ppe use the mainstay of infection control while use of n95 masks offers theoretical advantages over surgical masks no studies have documented significant additional benefits in patient care settings importantly consistent compliance with ppe has been proven to decrease risk of disease transmission indirect evidence from super-spreading events in hospitals has suggested that sars may be aerosolized 101 102 infectious disease experts advise that special care should be taken to decrease aerosol-generating procedures as much as possible and to observe additional precautions when these procedures are necessary recommended environmental interventions include placing surgical masks on patients with suspected sars at triage and during transport limiting the movement of patients with suspected sars and making use of physical isolation measures including warding and use of negative-pressure isolation rooms when available 103 successful policies for containment of sars in eds demand strict attention and enforcement of ed operational protocols including procedures for recycling of supplies and equipment and guidelines for optimization of patient and staff traffic 97 the sars outbreak exemplified the need for modified ed staffing owing to the increased demands of patient care that occurred during the period of the greatest disease threat and burden 98 secondary prevention measures for sars have involved methods for early disease detection early detection requires a reliable definition of cases the who definition of sars cases although useful for epidemiologic purposes was found to be insufficiently sensitive for assessing patients in ed triage areas consequently physicians had to develop clinical prediction rules that could more accurately identify patients with sars during an acute outbreak 104 105 106 107 one group from taiwan derived a simple sars decision rule that relied on combinations of symptoms and laboratory findings the scores were reported to have greater than 90 sensitivity and were found to be highly reliable when validated in a separate cohort 105 107 a more recent study from hong kong which included nearly one third of the sars cases from 2003 reported similar results with key variables including exposure history symptoms and laboratory values 104 although determination of which prediction rule will be most effective is not known these studies provide compelling support for integration of ed-based decision guidelines in future respiratory outbreaks potential gains include early identification and isolation of high-risk patients reduction of disease transmission in the ed and optimization of use of limited resources principal limitations of these decision tools include lack of proven reliability in nonendemic areas and the need for validation with each new outbreak based on potential strain and geographic variation that may alter clinical presentation dr anthony fauci director of the national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases suggests that sars teaches a valuable lesson it demonstrates the ever-present threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases 108 dr fauci and dr julie gerberding director of the cdc emphasize the importance of a strong public health preparedness and response system which in addition to use of personal and environmental infection control parameters includes a system capable of early detection 109 as the frontline of the health care system the nations eds are receiving renewed recognition as pivotal sites for early detection surveillance systems a number of national surveillance systems were put in place largely in response to the 2003 sars outbreak effective disease control will require a reliable national surveillance program as well as consistency in local hospital-based education and practice of proven risk-reduction measures a civilian target in a bioterrorism act has the potential to create a large number of casualties civil panic and disruption early detection and preattack preparedness is central to any response timely coordinated intervention triggered by early recognition will result in improved patient outcome disease containment preservation of the medical infrastructure and effective law enforcement responses this is evidenced by the lowest fatality rate ever recorded for inhalational anthrax following the 2001 bioterrorist attacks in the united states serving in the frontline emergency physicians play a critical role in responding to such an attack early recognition requires prior knowledge of typical clinical syndromes of the various bioterrorism agents however diagnosis of index cases may be difficult as clinical presentations of the bt agents are generally nonspecific and laboratory confirmations are often delayed for these otherwise rare disease entities ed-based syndromic surveillance systems with autonomous sensing and reporting capabilities can provide early warning and earlier recognition of suspicious patterns epidemiologic patterns peculiar to a biological attack which can help differentiate it from a natural outbreak of disease include 1 an extraordinary number of patients arriving from a similar geographical area with similar symptoms and acuity 2 rapid rise and fall of epidemic curves over a short period of time hours to days 3 steady rise in cases instead of peaks and troughs seen in natural outbreaks 4 rapidly fatal cases 5 a lower attack rate in people who were indoors than in those who were outdoors and 6 increased infected and dying animals 110 once a bioterrorist attack is suspected the first order of business is to initiate early protective infection control measures eg contact droplet or airborne precautions and identify the causal agent local- and state-level health care authorities should be notified immediately as soon as the attack has been confirmed prompt therapy postexposure prophylaxis and vaccination should be initiated advance preparation for eds will be essential in mitigating the effects of a bioterrorist attack key components of a bioterrorism response plan should include 1 specific guidelines for plan activation and notification of proper authorities 2 facility protection from contamination and secondary transmission 3 methods of decontamination 4 expansion of service capacity 5 ensuring an adequate cache of medical supplies 6 staff education and training 7 incident command system for controlled management and 8 coordination and communication with the surrounding community 111 the cdc has divided biological agents that are critical biothreat agents into categories based on their risks for causing mass casualties 112 category a agents the highest priority represent organisms that pose a risk to national security because they can be easily disseminated or transmitted person-to-person have a high risk of mortality and have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption these agents include bacillus anthracis anthrax variola major smallpox yersinia pestis plague francisella tularensis tularemia viral hemorrhagic agents and clostridium botulinum toxin other potential agents of concern but posing a less imminent threat were assigned to categories b or c a comprehensive review of the individual bt is beyond the scope of this discussion the principal route of delivery of most bt agents is by the inhalation of aerosols which in some cases may result in pulmonary manifestations such as cough and sputum production and can be easily mistaken for common respiratory illnesses the spectrum of potential pulmonary consequences that result from these biothreat agents is broad and reflects the variety of agents that could be involved category a agents which can be easily aerosolized for weaponization include inhalational anthrax pneumonic plague inhalational tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fever only a subset of these agents specifically y pestis and the viral hemorrhagic fever viruses have the potential for secondary human-to-human spread through respiratory droplets or airborne transmission of note despite its general lack of prominent respiratory symptoms smallpox can also be highly contagious via droplet or airborne transmission of the virus other significant aerosolizable category b agents with pulmonary manifestations include coxiella burnetti q fever brucella species brucellosis and burkholderia mallei glanders however only b mallei has the potential for human-to-human transmission from the ed perspective it is critical that patients who are suspected to be infected with such communicable agents be cared for in respiratory isolation for disease containment need for isolation should be determined by suspicion before definitive diagnosis with these exigencies in mind we will focus our discussion on pneumonic plague as an example of a communicable respiratory biothreat agent plague is a zoonosis with a rodent host and a flea vector which is caused by the gram-negative bacillus yersinia pestis transmission to humans is from the bite of an infected rodent flea the bacilli multiply intracellularly resulting in painful swollen regional lymph nodes called buboes septicemic plague and pneumonic plague can occur secondarily as a complication of hematogenous dissemination of bubonic plague the vector is not essential for infection however inhalation of aerosolized bacillus from cough or deliberate dissemination can result in primary pneumonic plague historically plague was responsible for three pandemics killing millions of people throughout the centuries the most recent pandemic originated in china and spread worldwide at the turn of the twentieth century 113 from 1987 to 2001 36876 plague cases were reported in 24 countries 114 in the western hemisphere the incidence of plague is highest in the andes and the southwestern united states 115 from 1916 to 1947 390 cases of plague were reported in the united states 84 of which were bubonic 13 septicemic and 2 pneumonic concomitant case fatality rates were 14 22 57 respectively although pneumonic plague has rarely been the dominant manifestation of the disease large outbreaks of pneumonic plague have occurred 116 advances in living conditions public health and antibiotic therapy make future pandemics improbable however outbreaks following use of plague as a biological weapon represent plausible threats in world war ii plague-infected fleas bred by the billions were released over chinese cities and resulted in multiple epidemics 117 of greater concern is that the biological weapons program by the former soviet union has reportedly developed techniques to aerosolize plague directly eliminating the dependence on fleas as vectors 118 in 1997 the who reported that in the worse case scenario if 50 kg of y pestis were released as an aerosol over a city of 5 million people 150000 cases of pneumonic plague would result with 36000 expected deaths 119 inhalation of aerosolized y pestis following a biothreat attack would result in primary pneumonic plague which can be distinguished from secondary pneumonic plague by the absence of buboes infected patients may experience chest pain progressive tachypnea and dyspnea productive cough sputum may be watery frothy blood-tinged hemorrhagic or purulent and hypoxia prominent gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea may be present pneumonic plague is a fulminant process with rapid progression to exudative pulmonary consolidation and respiratory failure 120 many patients with pneumonia develop profound septic shock with multiorgan system failure inhalation of infectious aerosol may also produce plague pharyngitis with focal suppuration and prominent cervical buboes plague pneumonia is almost always fatal if treatment is not initiated within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms early diagnosis of individual cases requires a high index of suspicion especially in areas without endemic zoonotic plague clinical suspicion of pneumonic plague in the context of a bioterrorist attack may be based on presentation of many patients with rapidly progressive pneumonia with hemoptysis there are no pathognomonic radiographic characteristics of primary pneumonic plague in primary infections radiographic signs usually begin as localized unilateral alveolar infiltrates that quickly advance to patchy diffuse and bilateral pneumonitis in secondary pneumonic cases infiltrates are mostly bilateral involving lower lung fields 121 early presumptive diagnosis can be made by gram wright-giemsa or direct fluorescent antibody dfa staining of peripheral blood sputum or lymph node aspirates that will reveal a bipolar safety pin morphology that distinguishes plague bacilli from other gram-negative organisms the first clinical or laboratory suspicion of plague should lead to immediate notification of the hospital epidemiologist or infection control specialist hospital and reference laboratories local and state health departments and the cdc confirmation of y pestis is made by culture serology or pcr parenteral aminoglycosides eg streptomycin or gentamicin are considered first-line plague therapy 120 doxycycline or ciprofloxacin are recommended for postexposure prophylaxis or in mass casualty settings all persons developing a fever 385c or new cough should be promptly treated with parenteral antibiotics close contacts with untreated pneumonic plague should receive postexposure antibiotics for 7 days a vaccine is available but it is not protective against pneumonic plague 122 the available evidence indicates that person-to-person transmission of pneumonic plague is through respiratory droplet not droplet nuclei accordingly routine protection from respiratory droplets including mask eye protection gowns and gloves should be used by medical personnel attending infected patients who have not been on antibiotics for at least 48 hours exposed persons who refuse to take antibiotic prophylaxis but who are not symptomatic do not require isolation but need to be watched and treated when the first sign of cough or fever occurs microbiology laboratory personnel should practice biosafety level 3 precautions when handling potentially infectious samples during high-risk laboratory procedures in 2001 the who estimated a global incidence of 399 million measles cases 777000 deaths and 28 million disability-adjusted life years 124 about half of these deaths occurred in africa in which fewer than 50 of children aged 1 year have received at least one dose of measles vaccine factors that contribute to the high case-fatality rates in developing countries include crowding poor nutritional state occurrence of infection at young age underlying immune deficiency disorders and limited access to health care in 2001 the who and united nations childrens fund unicef established the goal of reducing measles deaths by 50 by 2005 compared with 1999 estimates through mass vaccination campaigns worldwide 124 as a result global measles mortality decreased by 39 between 1999 and 2003 with the largest gains 46 occurring in the african regions 125 in the united states routine measles vaccination has been part of a childhood immunization program since 1963 resulting in a downward trend in the incidence of disease however resurgence occurred between 1989 and 1991 because of low vaccination coverage since 1997 the incidence of measles in the united states has been sustained at record low levels of approximately 100 cases per year 126 unfortunately efforts toward measles eradication in the us have been challenged by the continued high prevalence of measles outside our borders as evidenced by identification of imported viral genotypes among the majority of incident us cases 127 efforts to ensure high immunization rates among people in both developed and developing countries must be sustained to control measles worldwide infection is acquired via the respiratory tract primary viremia occurs 2 to 3 days after exposure subsequent infection of the reticuloendothelial system results in secondary viremia with skin and respiratory tract manifestations after an incubation period of 10 to 12 days the clinical prodrome is characterized by fever and is followed by the onset of cough coryza and conjunctivitis kopliks spots lesions on the buccal mucosa occur 1 to 2 days before the onset of rash the measles rash occurs 2 to 4 days after the prodrome and is usually first noted on the face and neck before gradually spreading downward and outward to the trunk and extremities maculopapular lesions are generally discrete but may become confluent fine desquamation may occur and the rash fades in the same order that it appears from head to extremities the diagnosis of measles can usually be made on clinical grounds isolation of the measles virus is not recommended as a routine however as with influenza virus isolates are important for molecular epidemiologic surveillance to help determine the geographic origin of the virus a serologic test most commonly by enzyme-linked immunoassay can be used to establish the diagnosis a fourfold rise in titer of igg antibody to measles virus or a positive result of serological testing for measles igm antibody is considered diagnostic complications from measles can involve every organ system and the rates of complication vary by age and underlying conditions complications are more common among children under age 5 and adults over 20 years of age pneumonia is the most common fatal complication associated with measles occurring in 56 to 86 of measles-related deaths 128 pneumonia may be caused by the measles virus alone or secondary viral or bacterial infection 129 the prevalence of measles virus pneumonia is higher in pregnant women and patients who are immunocompromised as a result of hematologic malignancy aids or immunosuppressive therapy 130 chest radiographic findings may include infiltrates consolidations hilar lymph node enlargement and pleural effusions treatment of the primary disease is mainly supportive bacterial superinfection should be promptly treated with appropriate antimicrobials but prophylactic antibiotics to prevent superinfection are of no known value and are therefore not recommended vitamin a administration has been shown to reduce mortality severity and duration of complications in children with measles 131 immunocompromised children and infants younger than 1 year of age who are susceptible and have been exposed to measles may be given passive immunization within 6 days of exposure transmission of measles is primarily person-to-person via large respiratory droplets however airborne transmission via aerosolized droplet nuclei has been documented maximum communicability occurs from onset of prodrome through the initial 3 to 4 days of rash 132 although suspected patients should be placed in respiratory isolation to preclude airborne transmission isolation and quarantine procedures may be of limited value given that exposure usually occurs before diagnosis is made and the availability of passive immunization or vaccination of susceptible contacts has obviated quarantine the measles virus is an rna virus belonging to the genus morbillivirus in the family paramyxoviridae it has only one serotype and can therefore be prevented with a single monovalent vaccine measles vaccine is one of the safest and most effective of all vaccines 133 it is a live attenuated vaccine which is frequently given in a combined product with rubella vaccine as mr vaccine or with rubella and mumps vaccine as mmr vaccine immunization produces a nontransmissible asymptomatic infection approximately 5 of children who receive only one dose of mmr vaccine will remain susceptible owing to primary vaccine failure but after a second immunization more than 99 of vaccinees develop serologic evidence of measles immunity which can be lifelong 134 recent experience has demonstrated that prevention of endemic outbreaks with single-dose vaccination is not possible even with high vaccination coverage a two-dose vaccine schedule is thus recommended 135 the first dose of mmr should be given on or after a childs first birthday and the second dose may be given as soon as 1 month after the first but should routinely be given at age 4 to 6 years postexposure prophylaxis with vaccination within 72 hours or passive immunization within 6 days of exposure should be given to susceptible contacts ie persons exposed and not fully vaccinated all health care workers are at high risk for exposure and should be adequately vaccinated prevention and control of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks require that disease transmission be interrupted by sustained high levels of immunization greater than 95 for measles as part of the effort to ensure high immunization rates eds may be well suited to capture nonimmunized children because they are often the primary sources of medical care for many of the urban poor who are considered the highest risk for underimmunization several studies have evaluated eds as potential sites for routine vaccination and for accelerated vaccine delivery during outbreaks with limited success 136 137 major barriers with measles vaccination have included high costs lack of continuity and difficulty in determining the true immunization status of patients 138 139 until these barriers are effectively addressed ed providers can contribute to measles control by screening and referring underimmunized children to private or public health clinics in the community for vaccination as with all emerging or reemerging infectious diseases ed-based surveillance which relies on early recognition and reporting of suspected cases plays a key role in outbreak control primary and secondary prevention are recognized as the most effective measures for containing infectious disease outbreaks the role of eds in instituting these preventive measures is rapidly evolving in response to increasing awareness of the critical role eds serve as the initial encounter site for most patients with acute communicable infectious illnesses evidence and support for ed-based primary prevention strategies such as influenza vaccination or prophylaxis exists 67 although practical challenges regarding such issues as education counseling and sustainable funding present ongoing challenges secondary preventive measures using clinical decision rules to rapidly identify and sequester patients with diseases have also been demonstrated to be effective in ed settings 31 104 but are by no means fail-safe recognized limitations of decision guidelines include difficulties with ensuring routine and consistent application and need to establish generalizability disease surveillance is another method of secondary prevention that is recognized as a critical tool in prevention and control of communicable disease outbreaks both natural and bioterrorist 140 the methodology involves continuous systematic collection analysis and interpretation of health-related data for timely dissemination to essential parties who can then use this information for evaluating planning and implementing the most effective public health preventive measures 141 syndromic surveillance has been recognized to be especially applicable to airborne respiratory infections that can be insidious and highly contagious the ed serves as a rich yet relatively untapped surveillance site that could contribute to control of respiratory infectious disease outbreaks there are a large number of ed variables to track and evaluate including ed ambulance diversion rates numbers of ed patient visits by chief complaint and ed discharge diagnosis and hospitalicu admission rates 56 142 the best-known ed-based surveillance network for infectious diseases emergency id net was established in the mid-1990s as a cooperative research and operational program involving the cdc the national center for infectious diseases and about 12 university-based eds throughout the united states 143 the surveillance network monitoring activities are varied but have shown the capacity to effectively monitor various infectious disease outbreaks including methicillin-resistant skin infections and respiratory m tuberculosis public health surveillance based on ed data is further discussed in the chapter by varney and hirshon elsewhere in this issue development and testing of novel molecular techniques for rapid real-time detection of infectious diseases is another evolving public heath approach for ed evaluation of aerosolized infectious diseases 144 rapid laboratory-based disease surveillance systems have the potential to detect infected individuals even before the onset of symptoms this could represent one step ahead of traditional clinical syndromic surveillance although promising further technical advancement in automation optimization of detection sensitivity and specificity is required before their true impact can be determined  effect of puumala hantavirus infection on human

vaheri 2008 although puuv infections have a low case fatality rate 1 and in literature the virus is often described as the least virulent of the pathogenic viruses within the hantavirus genus puuv infections can cause severe disease in healthy adults which may require a long recovery period lasting up to 1 year schmaljohn and hjelle 1997 furthermore several reports described cases with severe

from sweden reported increased risk for acute myocardial infarction shortly after puuv infection connolly-andersen et al 2014 given the high incidence in northern europe acute myocardial infarction as a complication of puuv infection could have a major impact in endemic areas in light of both bleeding and thrombotic events that might complicate puuv infections we hypothesized that endothelial cells also the target cells for hantaviruses and the major regulators of coagulation and inflammation play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease zhou et al 2003 during hantavirus infection drastic alterations in the coagulation system have been observed laine et al 2014 clinical studies focusing on primary and secondary hemostasis during hantavirus disease showed thrombocytopenia in

both mois the number of viral rna increased significantly 2-log after 48 h kruskal-wallis p  00028 in the supernatant as well as in the cell lysate confirming active viral replication viral replication reached a plateau at 72 h post infection furthermore western-blot analysis of the cell lysate for puuv nucleoprotein confirmed infection of huvec figure 1 the viral copy numbers in the supernatant or cell lysate of huvec incubated with bpl inactivated virus served as a control for non-replicating virus consistently the rna copy numbers did not increase over time indicating the efficient inactivation of the virus by bpl treatment efficient inactivation was confirmed by negative ipox staining of the huvec incubated with bpl inactivated puuv data not shown gavrilovskaya et al 2010 reported the potential of hantaan and andes virus to bind quiescent platelets via 3 integrin since this observation is of much importance in further understanding the alterations in primary hemostasis and its role in disease mechanisms in hfrs we decided to confirm this mechanism for puuv using a different approach first we assessed the ability of quiescent platelets to bind to puuv infected huvec figure 2 binding of platelets was determined by measuring the intensity of cd41a platelet glycoprotein iib a heterodimeric integral membrane protein present only on platelets and megakaryocytes cd41a expression was significantly higher on the huvec monolayer after infection with a moi of 05 or 3 compared to the control detection of cd41a expression did not differ when platelets were not added to the huvec monolayers suggesting that there was no non-specific anti-cd41a binding to infected cells furthermore there was no difference in od values when an isotype control anti-cd3 was used to detect platelets based on cd41a expression statistically significant differences were measured between infected wells and wells incubated with virus free veroe6 medium negative control at 24 h post infection one way anova moi 3 vs neg p  001 moi 05 vs neg p  005 after 48 h of infection this difference in cd41a expression was also significant between moi 3 infected wells and the bpl inactivated virus control one way anova moi 3 vs neg p  0001 and moi 3 vs bpl p  0001 moi 05 vs neg p  005 taken together the data indicate that platelets bind to cultures incubated with puuv huvec incubated with bpl did show a trend to increased platelet cd41a expression figure 2 but this was not statistically significant we measured vwf antigen in cell free supernatant and vwf expression on the surface of infected huvec increased vwf production may be a general inflammatory response of endothelial cells that could be evoked as a result of puuv infection however at the time points where platelet binding increased huvecs infected with puuv showed no alteration in vwf activity as determined by elisa in neither the supernatant nor the cell lysate data not shown compared to bpl or negative control next we looked whether the platelets could bind directly to puuv particles for this purpose we performed an in-house developed platelet pull down-assay using quiescent platelets to this end several experiments were conducted to demonstrate specificity of this binding figure 3 shows results of binding of platelets to virus-coated elisa plates figure 3a more platelets mannwhitney u p  00022 adhered to plates directly coated with puuv compared to plates coated with a virus control vsv which was cultured under the same conditions as puuv subsequently to control if the binding of platelets was directly to the puuv particles and not due to another factor present in the veroe6 supernatant we made use of a sandwich elisa principle puuv was incubated on elisa plates with wells coated with a monoclonal igg2 specific for the glycoprotein of puuv or with a igg2 control antibody by this approach significantly more platelets bound to the wells where puuv was captured compared to wells with no puuv capture mannwhitney u p  00022 figure 3b to confirm direct binding between platelets and puuv platelets were captured to anti-cd41 coated elisa plates and incubated with virus followed by detection with a puuv specific antibody to control for binding between puuv detection antibody and captured platelets control wells were incubated with vsv puuv detection was significantly higher in the wells incubated with puuv compared to vsv mannwhitney u p  00043 figure 3c these experiments collectively suggest that platelets can specifically bind to puuv finally we show in figure 3d that the binding of platelets to puuv particles could be blocked by addition of a blocking step with human serum from a recovered puuv case when wells coated with puuv were incubated with human serum with proven puuv neutralizing igg antibodies significantly less platelets adhered to the wells compared to wells incubated with a puuv negative human control serum figure 3d p  0001 the anti-cd41 expression in the wells with a blocking step was comparable to that of the negative control which consisted out of plates coated with 5 days old vero e6 virus free medium binding of the neutralizing igg antibodies was confirmed by incubation with a goat-anti human hrp labeled conjugate and subsequent tmb reaction to test the hypothesis whether increased thrombin generation observed in acute puuv patients is the result of increased tf expression on endothelial cells we incubated huvec infected with puuv at a moi of 3 or with a virus free 5 days old vero e6 medium control with a polyclonal anti-tf antibody by this approach we showed that tf expression was significantly increased with an almost twofold increase in od value 48 h post infection figure 4a mannwhitney u p  00047 cells infected with puuv also showed an increased tf concentration when the cell lysates of puuv infected wells were compared to the lysates of control wells figure 4b both mock and bpl subsequently we wanted to prove that the increase in tf expression on the endothelial cell surface was of biological significance and would led to increased thrombin generation thrombin generation was quantified directly on infected endothelial cells by incubating normal plasma on cells and initiating coagulation by the addition of calcium ions infected cells induced plasma clotting faster due to increased thrombin generation figures 4cd using a calibration curve with purified tf in the absence of endothelial cells we quantified huvec tf production after virus infection and after incubation with a virus free medium control tf concentration showed a statistically significant increase for moi 3 at 24 h compared to the negative control and the huvec infected with moi 05 one way anova p  001 and at 48 h post infection compared to the negative control one way anova p  0001 the moi 05 infection led to higher levels of tf on the huvec surface only after 48 h post infection one way anova p  005 when compared to mock important proteins in the regulation of fibrinolysis show close interactions with the pathogenic hantavirus receptor 3 integrin for instance vitronectin a stabilizer of pai-1 activity in plasma is largely regulated by this receptor mackow and gavrilovskaya 2009 florova et al 2013 to study potential changes in regulators of fibrinolysis we first measured pai-1 levels in the cell-free supernatant and supernatant of cell lysate from 24-well plates infected with puuv or control infections the total pai-1 antigen the combination of levels in the supernatant and cell lysate was significantly increased 48 h post infection kruskalwallis p  005 with moi 3 figure 5a subsequently we tested if in our model pai-1 would bind to vitronectin since this binding is associated with increasedprolonged pai-1 activity seiffert and loskutoff 1991 and if this interaction is altered during infection elisa plates coated with a monoclonal antibody against vitronectin incubated with supernatant from our experiments pooled control or from moi 3 infected wells followed by incubation with pai-1 antibody suggested formation of pai-1 vitronectin complexes due to an increase in od compared to incubation with pbs mean expression in medium 490 mod 100 vs 370 mod 70 p  002 if supernatants were tested separately puuv vs mock levels of pai-1 vitronectin complexes were increased after puuv infection mannwhitney u p  003 figure 5b the present study addresses platelet binding to puuv infected cells and activation of secondary hemostasis after endothelial cell puuv infection with the lack of a valid and accessible animal model for old-world hantavirus infection we remain dependent on ex vivo cell culture models to address questions regarding virulence and pathogenesis vaheri et al 2013b taking into account the recently found association of puuv infection with cardiovascular disease connolly-andersen et al 2014 and hemorrhagic complications that may occur during infection the interaction between puuv and the coagulation system especially warrants further attention since puuv tends to rapidly lose virulence upon in vitro cell passages the use of low passaged isolates is of vital importance nemirov et al 2003 therefore we have put a lot of emphasis on obtaining low passage puuv isolates and optimisation of the hemostatic assays under the right biosafety regulations using primary cell cultures based on hemostatic changes seen in several clinical studies most from northern europe we decided to study specific parts of the coagulation system in vitro we started by studying the effects of puuv infection on formation of a platelet plug the major event in primary hemostasis binding of platelets by puuv infected cells could explain thrombocytopenia in acute puuv patients since it would result in wasting or loss of platelets adhered to these cells gavrilovskaya et al 2010 laine et al 2011 especially if we make notice of the ability of hantaviruses to infect megakaryocytes and thereby lead to a decreased production of platelets in addition to the loss of platelets adhered to infected cells liang et al 2004 lutteke et al 2010 in our model it seems that puuv infection increases binding of platelets to the surface of huvec compared to control cells figure 2 here we assumed increased cd41a expression observed in the first experiments was the result of an increased number of platelets on the huvec theoretically increased cd41a detection could also be due to an increased expression of cd41a on platelets after 30 min incubation with infected huvec rather than an actual increase in platelet numbers while we cannot rule this out based on our experiments we blocked extrinsic platelet activation by prostaglandin treatment making platelet activation less likely furthermore in line with studies performed with more pathogenic hantaviruses gavrilovskaya et al 2010 we tested specific binding of platelets to puuv particles judged from results from the platelet pull down experiments figure 3 this seemed to be a specific binding between virus and platelets which could be reversed by the addition of puuv neutralizing antibodies in these experiments we controlled for aspecific binding of antibodies isotype control experiments factors present in the virus culture medium 5 days old veroe6 medium as a control and binding of platelet detection antibody directly to puuv we expected the increased platelet binding to co-occur with increased vwf production as a general inflammatory response during infection however the observation that vwf concentration does not change during puuv infection further suggested a vwf-independent mechanism for platelet binding in hfrs results from earlier studies showed an increased vwf concentration in hospitalized puuv patients laine et al 2011 one should keep in mind that overall plasma vwf level in any patient represents the state of the total endothelial cell layer and not only that of infected cells as is the case in our model furthermore we are studying the acute response of endothelial cells in the first 48 h after infection a time point at which puuv patients are generally not considered to be hospitalized and tested the increase of vwf in all three conditions control bpl and puuv over time in our huvec model could be the result of an increased number of cells or a sign of in vitro stress and activation of the endothelial cells since it seems highly unlikely the cells still multiply after the formation of a full monolayer which is present at the time of infection we believe that also non-infected cells show a certain level of activation when in culture gavrilovskaya et al 2010 were the first to study the interaction of hantaviruses andes and hantaan with platelets and concluded that there was a specific binding of hantaan and andes virus particle particles to 3 integrins present on both endothelial cells and platelets interestingly our experiment showed a trend to increased number of platelets bound to the bpl-inactivated virus treated cultures suggesting active replication was unnecessary and inactivated virus bound to the cell surface might also bind to integrins present on platelets however this hypothesis is merely based on a statistical trend observed in wells with the cells incubated with bpl inactivated virus for the interpretation of our data one should take in mind that we made use of a moi 3 bpl at t  0 h and that the bpl inactivated virus will not replicate therefore at timepoint t  24 and t  48 the bpl control will most likely be comparable to the moi 05 infection it could very well be the case that when increasing the moi for the bpl infection a more comparable result to the moi 3 infection would be observed puumala virus infections of huvec directly increased the expression of tf on the cell surface and in the cell lysate compared to controls this resulted in drastic activation of secondary hemostasis in our cell model during puuv infection data from a direct clotting assay on the cell monolayer gives interesting insights in the potential mechanism behind increased thrombin generation seen in acute puuv patients laine et al 2010 2014 a clear pro-coagulant state the result of an increased expression of tf on the surface of puuv infected cells resulted in enhanced thrombin generation increased thrombin generation decreased thrombin time overall increase in prothrombin fragments 1  2 antithrombin and protein c that laine et al 2010 2014 observed in acute puuv patients could very well be the result of direct infection of endothelial cells and concomitant increased production of tf whether increase in tf is a general defense response or if the virus actually benefits from tf as is seen in certain herpesvirus infections pryzdial et al 2014 remains unknown however excess of tf production during infection could lead to increased clotting and eventually consumptive coagulopathy or even dic a severe condition that is only seen in a small percentage of puuv patients laine et al 2010 but which could be one of the factors contributing to the hemorrhagic complications seen in hfrs especially since increased tf expression has been proven to play an important role in the pathogenesis of other viral hemorrhagic fevers like marburg and ebola geisbert et al 2003ab since alterations in pai-1 levels are related to renal disturbances comparable to that seen in hantavirus disease gong et al 2007 malgorzewicz et al 2013 and functional polymorphisms in pai-1 were related to more severe disease in acute puuv patients laine et al 2012 we also studied pai-1 and regulators of pai-1 activity infection with puuv increases pai-1 production which would in vivo lead to decreased fibrinolysis the 3 integrin receptor plays an important role in pai-1vitronectin complex formation zhou et al 2003 increased 3 expression during puuv infection combined with competitive binding of hantavirus with vitronectin for 3 could hypothetically lead to further alterations in pai-1 half-life and stability the increased level of vitronectin-pai-1 complexes in the supernatant of puuv infected cells further strengthens this hypothesis considering that an increase in pai-1 and vitronectin could result in renal impairment and even cause a nephritis-like response pledges for further evaluation of

potential conflict of interest  bioengineering tools to speed up the discovery and preclinical testing of vaccines for sars-cov-2 and therapeutic agents for covid-19 manuela raimondi teresa francesca donnaloja bianca barzaghini alberto bocconi claudio conci valentina parodi emanuela jacchetti stephana carelli   as of may 8 2020 the 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was responsible in 215 countries for 3767744 infections and 259593 deaths from the related disease defined as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1 the human population has no immunity to sars-cov-2 because this virus had never previously infected humans before its initial outbreak in december 2019 until now no drugs or biologics have been proven to be effective for the prevention or treatment of covid-19 to deal with this pandemic apart from non-pharmaceutical containment measures including quarantine and maintenance of social distance possible interventions consist of the repurposing of existing pharmaceutical products along with the development of new products and vaccines 2-4 the development of a radically new pharmaceutical product either traditional or biological such as an antibody targeting a sars-cov-2 receptor is subject to regulatory approval for use in humans based on three steps 1 lab discovery in vitro on cell cultures 2 preclinical testing in vivo in animals to confirm the mechanism of action and to measure the range of effective dosages and tolerability and 3 clinical testing in patients to define the safe dosage and to confirm the efficacy and possible interactions this process involves serious challenges both related to the efficiency for example the development of a human vaccine from concept to licensing takes at least 15 years 5 and also to the effectiveness drug development currently involves a 999 overall failure rate of which 964 is due to failure in the preclinical testing phase meaning that the drug efficacy measured in vitro is almost never confirmed in animals 6 the main issue is that the most widespread technology currently used to test therapeutic agents in vitro is obsolete often it consists of a two-dimensional 2d polystyrene culture dish in which a single cell population is cultured on the bottom the drug to be tested is added to the culture medium and the expected modulation in specific processes or targets is measured however in these simplified in vitro culture conditions the drug elicits a cell response that is not representative of the in vivo response which is based on the cell interactions that occur a in three-dimensional 3d non-flat environments and b within an heterogeneous cell population which is never limited to the cell population primarily addressed by the drug another very serious issue is the unethical slaughter of lab animals which more effective in vitro methods would replace at least in part moreover the methods adopted for monitoring the drug effects in animals are also obsolete whereas new miniaturized intravital imaging techniques are now available that could greatly refine in vivo observations even in terms of the temporal evolution in the same animal thus reducing the number of animals sacrificed by 80-90 there are many on-going clinical trials evaluating potential vaccines and treatments for covid-19 which cannot be accelerated without putting the safety of patients at risk instead both the in vitro and in vivo preclinical phases of drug development could be accelerated by replacing some of the current unrepresentative and obsolete study models with new ones based on improved modeling tools for example many groups have developed 3d static microfluidic and intravital imaging models of viral infection and relevant therapeutics using new high-performance experimental devices that are user-friendly for operators and enable live organoids to be cultured and examined in 3d with high-resolution imaging here we review the published work based on these modeling tools in the specific fields of virology and pharmacology sars-cov-2 infection can lead to covid-19 infection which causes massive damage to the pulmonary cells 7-11 due to a cytokine storm ie an acute secretion of inflammatory signals by innate monocytes in response to the infection which causes hyper inflammation the who 12 and clinicaltrialsgov database currently report many active trials on covid-19 patients of drugs that have already been licensed for other infectious and inflammatory diseases these include anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine large spectrum antivirals inhibitors of endonucleases nucleosides protease inhibitors and other antiretrovirals interferons corticosteroids immune suppressants and anticoagulants in parallel many groups are repurposing known compounds and are developing new vaccines 3 and therapeutic solutions 4 to specifically target the sars-cov-2 virus the drug targets are primarily viral proteins most of which have been resolved and are available on the protein data bank pdb much progress has been made in the structural biology of sars-cov-2 many structural and non-structural proteins have been determined experimentally by cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em and x-ray crystallography the proteins specific to sars-cov-2 that have already been determined experimentally are shown in figure 1 drug therapies may act either a on the host cells affecting the specific receptor or restoring the innate immunity of the cells or b on the virus by blocking the virus functions i target or acting on the virus structural proteins ii target the primary i drug target is represented by several non-structural viral proteins nsps whose inhibition blocks the viral rna synthesis and replication 13 these include the papain-like protease plpro in the nsp3 region the main protease mpro also known as c-like protease 3clpro the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and the helicase the structural spike protein on the viral envelope is the most studied protein of the secondary ii drug targets 13 the virus cannot bind to the host cell receptors fuse with cell membranes and enter cells if the spike protein is inhibited and thus it has also already been solved by electron microscopy 14 this comprises a receptor binding domain rbd mainly involved in the host-cell interaction incorporating a sub-domain called a receptor binding motif rbm believed to bind similarly to sars-cov mainly with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 cell receptor to gain entry inside cells 15 the ace2 receptor was discovered in 2000 and is expressed above all in the lungs heart kidneys gastrointestinal tract testis and other tissues or organs 16 most drugs against sars-cov-2 investigated today therefore target the complex rbdace2 17-19 solved sars-cov-2 molecular structures have been used to set-up docking analyses and molecular dynamics simulations that predict the affinity of chemical binding of these structures with known compounds this in silico modeling technique has been used intensely for drug screening in virtual libraries table 1 shows the latest published results in terms of drugs predicted to bind with sars-cov-2 targets it is worth noting that most of the in silico drug docking analyses listed in table 1 use the homology modelling strategy to predict the structures of the target proteins that have not yet been experimentally resolved 20-25 the homology modelling approach predicts the atomic-resolution model of a target protein based on the structure of the protein chosen as a template according to the genome sequence identity 26 the genome of sars-cov-2 showed a high homology with the sars virus which makes it a reliable template 13 the sequence alignment with the previous sars-like viruses have also been applied to perform the virus evolutionary analysis 27 or to highlight particular features of the sars-cov-2 virus table 2 several studies have compared sars-cov-2 with sars in terms of interaction of the spike protein with the host cell receptor structural- and free-binding energy-based analyses have revealed accurate details of sars-cov-2 these observations may explain the aggressiveness of sars-cov-2 at least in part 17-1928 a similar approach has also been taken to explore the efficiency of the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ace2 allelic variants with the sarscov2 spike protein from the binding analysis two variants showed variations in the orientation of the amino acid side chain altering the intramolecular interactions and the complex formation this aspect may represent partial intrinsic susceptibility or resistance to the sarscov2 infection 29 these parameters can be imaged and are replicated similarly to in-vivo in 3d cell and organoid models unlike in cell monolayers for example cells in 3d engineered airway epithelium infected with sars-cov-2 showed apical-apical polarity which is known to restrict the infection to the airway lumen in vivo
30 and reproduced infection peaks and significant morphological alterations earlier in nasal cells compared to bronchial cells 32 cells in liver organoids infected by sars-cov-2 33 and cells in intestinal organoids infected by mers-cov 46 had syncytia and membrane fusions as observed in mice in vivo models when infected by the respiratory syncytial virus rsv lung organoids had a morphological structure and infection features matching human fetal lung tissue 35 and airway epithelium organoids had massive epithelial modifications as in mature tissue infection in vivo
36 in a 3d engineered airway epithelium cell morphology was close to in-vivo characteristics with a reorganization of cytoskeletal components an abundance of ciliated cells 38 and a mucociliary layer 41 with surfactant and mucus often produced 37 here the h7n9 influenza virus infected both ciliated and non-ciliated cells causing cilia and tight junction damage seen in vivo
42 a 3d engineered liver model reproduced and demonstrated greater physiological hepatocyte morphology polarity and apicalbasal adhesion to ecm compared to a classical cell monolayer 47 3d cell and organoid models are significantly more permissive to viral infection compared to cell monolayers for example when infected by sars-cov-2 the peak infection in 3d-engineered human airway epithelium was reached 30 faster 31 also when infected by avian influenza virus h7n9 viral proliferation was faster 42 in addition propagation of human rhinovirus c and bocavirus was two and three orders of magnitude greater respectively 41 in airway epithelium organoids infected with avian influenza virus such as h1n1 the viral proliferation was faster and with a time-order equivalent to the in vivo proliferation time 38 mers-cov was shown to infect intestinal organoids more than epithelial monolayers 46 in a model of hiv-1 infection of primary human cd4 t-lymphocytes 3d collagen culture unlike suspension conditions promoted cell-associated hiv-1 transmission consistent with spread mechanisms described in vivo
48 human intestinal organoids infected with rotavirus displayed a 10000-fold increase in genomic viral rna than cells infected in monolayer 49 hepatitis b replicated one order of magnitude faster in a 3d-engineered liver model compared to a cell monolayer 47 the expression of all these markers is more similar in time and space to in-vivo values in 3d cell and organoid models compared to cell monolayers for example a 3d-engineered airway epithelium infected by sars-cov-2 showed different expression levels of immune-response genes type i and type iii interferons and a subset of genes associated with the nf-kb and tnf pathways between nasal cells with strong upregulation at 24 hours post infection and bronchial cells with low expression 31 cells in liver organoids expressed the ace2 receptor thus enabling sars-cov-2 infection unlike in the mouse model 33 when infected by the respiratory syncytial virus rsv lung organoids had gene and marker expression primarily the mesenchymal markers pdgfr- pdgfr- -sma vimentin and cd90 that matched infected human fetal lung tissue 35 while airway epithelium organoids expressed levels of genes involved in migration krt16 krt6b interferon signaling il1rn ifi44l and viral response mx2 oas1 comparable to in vivo values 36 in 3d-engineered airway epithelium expression of inflammatory cytokines aquaporin-5 and cytokeratin-14 was two-fold higher than monolayers when infected with avian influenza viruses h1n1 and h3n2 37 and two orders of magnitude higher for il-6 and il-8 when infected with human rhinovirus c and human bocavirus 41 closely recapitulating the immune response seen in vivo in a model of stratified airway epithelium infected by the andes-hantavirus long-term culture at seven days showed a switch in immune response from anti-viral transient interferon to antinflammatory cytokines and vegf-a as occurs in-vivo
40 hepatitis b induced a two-fold higher expression of specific antigens hbsag in a 3d-engineered liver model compared to cell monolayers 47 in 3d models the sensitivity to antiviral drugs is significantly lower and more similar to in vivo than cell monolayer observations for example the efficacy of clinical-grade soluble human ace2 in reducing sars-cov-2 infection in both human capillary organoids and kidney organoids was one order of magnitude lower than in monolayers 34 in a 3d-engineered airway epithelium infected with the h7n9 influenza virus and treated with recombinant human interferons 2b and 1 the expression of interferon-stimulated antiviral genes was significantly reduced and the level of gene expression induced by the two agents was reversed consistently with data in vivo compared to monolayers 42 human intestinal organoids infected by human rotavirus compared to the simple cell line model in monolayers were twice less sensitive to interferon  and ribavirin with a range of effective doses comparable to that administered in in vivo models 49 the response to the antiviral drug entecavir in a 3d human engineered liver model infected by hepatitis b was more similar to in vivo compared to the cell line model 47 in conventional cell monolayers the response of herpes simplex infection to antivirals is unrealistically fast with 100 reactivation for herpes simplex 1 virus reactivation after exposure to interferon  was reduced five-fold in infected 3d brain organoids compared to cell monolayers as reported in animal models 50 in addition in hydrogels made of acrylated hyaluronic acid and loaded with fibroblasts the time for cell recovery and reaggregation after infection and exposure to the antiviral drug acyclovir was three-fold greater than in cell monolayers similarly to in vivo
51 the evidence outlined above shows that 3d cells and organoid models consistently develop properties that are able to determine the in vivo-like dynamics of infection by pathogenic viruses they thus may represent a valuable tool towards a more rapid assessment of infectivity to humans of emerging respiratory viruses such as the sars-cov-2 and of relevant drug responses from a technological point of view there are two principal limitations of the previously analyzed 3d models compared to conventional monolayer models which are essentially related to the 3d scaffolds the current scaffolds are mainly represented by either hydrogels 52-53 or solid ecm analogues 54 which are placed on the bottom of culture plates or in trans-well inserts resulting in constructs which are a few millimeters thick and cannot be examined under optical microscopy the second problem in current 3d scaffolds is the very limited control over the culture time of some physical and chemical properties known to profoundly affect cell behavior such as biodegradation with the release of various solutes and mechanical properties such as stiffness which influence cell adhesion and migration 54 to overcome all these limitations many groups of researchers are developing miniaturized 3d scaffolds by a cutting-edge fabrication technique called two-photon laser polymerization 55 for example our group has developed an innovative 3d micro-scaffold called the nichoid figure 2 which is optically and physically accessible to the cells cultured inside over time and to all the existing biological assays the nichoid is a miniaturized rigid transparent ultra-precise 3d grid fabricated in a biocompatible resin 56-58 this scaffold is up to 100 microns thick thus truly 3d for cells but 100 optically accessible to high-resolution fluorescence diagnostics by mimicking the 3d stiffness of a physiological cell niche 59 the nichoid can guide the self-organization of several types of stem and progenitor cells 60-61 including embryonic stem cells 62 and mesenchymal stem cells msc 63 it also maintains their phenotype in expansion culture by regulating hundreds of genes involved in mechanotransduction processes such as cell migration cytoskeletal organization and membrane plasticity 64 the nichoid could thus provide an effective culture environment to test mechanobiological effects such as the overexpression of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins that can rigidify the cell membrane thus markedly inhibiting viral membrane fusion and entry it could thus be used for screening candidate antiviral drugs and vaccines based on the targeting coronavirus spike protein we also observed that the nichoid potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of stem cells expanded inside 65 this substrate is a powerful candidate to maintain the safety and function of expanded msc 63 which is a new therapy already being tested in clinical trials to treat post-covid-19 pulmonary fibrosis 66 for example a 3d bioreactor-engineered respiratory epithelium infected with sars-cov was found to more closely resemble normal human tissue in terms of cell apical polarity essential to viral cell-cell transport compared to non-perfused culture 67-68 a bioreactor-engineered liver model of hepatitis b infection recapitulated the functional hepatic microarchitecture and complete cell polarization which is critical for the cells susceptibility to infection compared to non-perfused organoids which show de-differentiation over 10-13 days 70 a bioreactor-engineered model of neuronal tissue based on neural progenitors showed some features of the human trigeminal ganglia the site of latency of the varicella-zoster virus not seen in non-perfused cultures 68-69 a 3d bioreactor-engineered respiratory epithelium infected with sars-cov remained viable three-times longer than non-perfused controls 67-68 a bioreactor-engineered liver model of hepatitis b infection was metabolically and functionally stable for at least 40 days ie four times longer than conventional non-perfused cultures 70 a bioreactor-engineered model of neuronal tissue infected by the varicella-zoster virus was successfully maintained in culture for 180 days compared to the limit of a few days for primary human ganglia in non-perfused culture 68-69 in a microfluidic model of fibroblast infection by the adenovirus a 50 higher infection efficiency was maintained at a lower multiplicity of infection the minimum viruscell ratio able to cause infection for longer incubation times with respect to non-perfused controls 71 a bioreactor-engineered liver model of hepatitis b infection led to a 10000-fold lower multiplicity of infection compared to non-perfused culture 70 a bioreactor-engineered model of neuronal tissue infected by the varicella-zoster virus maintained persistent viral infection for 90 days which is not possible with non-perfused culture 68-69 in a 3d bioreactor-engineered respiratory epithelium infected with sars-cov the antibody response to sars-cov-specific spike and nucleocapsid glycoproteins was two-fold compared to non-perfused culture 67-68 a bioreactor-engineered liver model of hepatitis b infection maintained stable expression levels of receptors of innate immune cells and downstream effectors compared to non-perfused cultures 70 the evidence above therefore shows that perfused models enable infection studies to be extended even up to several months on stable cell cultures of highly differentiated cells with a higher infection efficiency and lower multiplicity of infection compared to non-perfused models this makes it potentially feasible to extend the study of the life cycle and genetic stability of new viruses such as sars-cov-2 to in vitro systems despite being derived from minimal doses from patients and to test sequential antiviral drug treatments 70 most importantly perfused cell models make it feasible to reproduce dynamic interactions between tissue-resident cells and circulating cells including the response to a pathogen of innate and adaptive immune cells and thus to extend the testing of vaccines to in vitro models a first step forward in this regard is a recent microfluidic-based model of a lymph node 72 here the stroma was modeled with adherent murine tumor dendritic cells and cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes were put in suspension in the culture medium and recirculated interstitially within the engineered organ this system selectively promoted the adhesion of antigen-specific t cells through affinity isolation by serial cell contacts with fluid-induced shear stresses maintained in the range 01-1 dyncm2 in contrast to non-perfused cultures this model was able to compare in parallel and in real time the effect on t cell adhesion to dendritic cells of different treatments inhibitors activators and immunogens with regard to vaccine testing bioreactors that host cm-sized 3d scaffolds such as the rotating wall vessel are able to provide tens of millions cells for confirmation assays such as pcr or facs as required by regulatory agencies their technological limitation however is that they are too thick to be accessed thoroughly for real time optical inspection of cell interactions 5473 microfluidic bioreactors instead are 2d and have micron-sized channels that are also fully inspectable in real time 74-75 however they can host only a few thousand cells which are difficult to harvest and in any case would not be sufficient for robust confirmation assays 76 to overcome these limitations our group developed a millifluidic optically-accessible bioreactor moab which is a compromise between the two categories mentioned above the moab figure 3 is a chambered microscope slide allowing the culture of fully 3d cell models with dimensions of up to a few millimeters containing several million cells under interstitial perfusion of the culture medium with the infusion of cells in suspension and the therapeutic agents to be tested the culture chambers are only 400 microns thick and enable full-thickness high-resolution fluorescence diagnostics both in real time and post-cultivation 77-81 in in vitro tests the moab led to a comparable cell response to biodrugs to the one seen in experimental animals in specific fields characterized by slowly-developing diseases and slowly-developing healing induced by the therapeutic agent stem cell therapy for neurodegeneration 82 gene therapy for muscular dystrophy 83 and chemotherapy for bone metastases 84 by adding lymphocytes in suspension in the perfused medium figure 3 the moab easily extended to 3d a microfluidic model of lymphocytes instruction within a lymph node 72 millifluidic bioreactors in fact have a high potential to speed up the discovery and testing of drugs and new vaccines for sars-cov-2 and are not limited to the interactions with the immune system for example they can successfully maintain human primary neurons infected by a virus in long-term culture for up to 180 days compared to the limit of a few days in non-perfused culture 68-69 millifluidic bioreactors can even be hydraulically connected in multiple units to reproduce transport of neurotoxic agents through multiple body barriers pertaining to distant body compartments for example from the gut endothelial barrier to the blood-brain-barrier 85 this method can be exploited to assess neurotoxicity which is a primary concern for new antiviral drugs and vaccines for sars-cov-2 in addition the sars-cov-2 virus itself could hold a neurotropic potential new observations on the loss of smell and taste by patients later manifesting symptoms of covid-19 together with evidence showing that coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov could target the central nervous system open up a new window in this regard 86 in fact a long-term bioreactor co-culture of olfactory neurons and ensheathing glial cells in 3d could not only confirm the expression of ace2 in human olfactory neurons thus their role as a potential entry site for the sars-cov-2 virus but also could help to clarify the potential mechanism of virus propagation to the brain through neural cell populations ie from the olfactory neurons to their ensheathing glial cells such a model could verify whether in sars-cov-2 infection the defense mechanism provided by olfactory ensheathing cells is present and whether it is maintained during aging such an experiment could add crucial insights into unveiling the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by covid-19 11 also suggesting new prevention measures such as the vaporization of nasal disinfectants in the elderly population these can be quantified in real time with a resolution at the cellular scale for example intravital imaging studies in lungs quantified in time the recruitment of cd4 t cells from blood vessels in response to the influenza a virus 89-90 and most recently the recruitment of neutrophils in response to the pr8-h1n1 and h5n5 influenza viruses 91 multiphoton intravital microscopy in abdominal lymph nodes was used to quantify a partial reduction in the motility of hiv-infected t cells as well as their tethering to and fusion with cd4 immune cells 92-93 intravital imaging within vessels of colon adenocarcinoma tumors was used to quantify the timely evolution of several oncolytic viruses binding to intravascular leukocytes and endothelial cells 94-95 these parameters are greater than in in vitro assays for example in an immunization study using a glycoprotein of the respiratory syncytial virus associated with an antiviral treatment with the specific monoclonal antibody live imaging was used to visualize and capture virus-infected cells in the nasal cavity and in the lungs of experimental mice with a higher sensitivity compared to the in vitro plaque assay 87 intravital imaging of live mice was sufficiently sensitive to quantify vaccinia viruses in ear blood vessels and labial mucosa 96 and single oncolytic virus particles interacting with individual leukocytes and endothelial cells within blood tumors and visceral organs 94-95 intravital imaging is thus emerging as a key tool to observe the spatial-temporal dynamics of very complex phenomena even as complex as embryonic development at a cellular resolution 97 in the field of immunology however intravital imaging models have significant limitations temporary suction window chambers are highly invasive and always require animal euthanization at the end of each observation preventing repeated observations at subsequent time points in contrast implantable windows allow for long-term repeated observations in the same animal however they are currently too invasive and affected by chronic inflammation at the surgical site thus interfering with the desired measurements 88 in addition implanted imaging windows in general do not retain lymphatic circulation thus preventing the recruitment of cells from the bone marrow or lymphatic system 89-90 to overcome these limitations we developed an implantable miniaturized intravital imaging device called microatlas figure 4 this minimally invasive device which is 5 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness is implantable in chicken embryos or subcutaneously in mice to quantify in vivo aspects of the immune response to biomaterials and drugs 98 microatlas integrates a micro-fabricated fluorescent 3d scaffold that guides and hosts the intravital regeneration of vascularized tissue in addition this scaffold enables the repositioning of the observation field of view of a two-photon microscope which is necessary for repeated and quantitative intravital measurements of immune cell recruitment neo-angiogenesis and fibrotic reaction on the same animal at different time-points the fluorescent grid is currently designed to provide beacons to correct aberrations derived from deep optical sectioning of the 3d micro-scaffold repopulated by cells during ex ovo experiments expression of the human ace2 receptor can be engineered in transgenic mice in contrast with histopathology techniques imaging through a miniaturized intravital window can be used at incremental time points within the same mouse in vital conditions to study the localization and distribution pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of antiviral therapies and vaccines while seeking solutions for covid-19 it could significantly speed-up the preclinical testing of experimental antiviral drugs and vaccines while eliminating the need for animal sacrifice at the various time points thus reducing by up to 90 the number of animals required by the regulation for ex vivo assessments intravital imaging could be very effective in this model also to test therapeutic agents based on an engineered messenger rna mrna that directs cells to make a protein which could work as a drug or vaccine for sars-cov-2 human safety trials have already begun for mrna-based vaccines against two flu strains and the zika virus in each case the mrna encodes for viral proteins that infected cells would physiologically present to activate the immune system against infections to succeed the engineered mrna must hide from dendritic cells enter the cells avoid degradation and be translated efficiently the efficiency off all these stages could be monitored and measured by the intravital imaging of fluorescently-labeled mrna in this review we have discussed various cutting-edge bioengineering tools already available in the fields of virology and pharmacology which are based on i 3d co-cultures that are highly predictive of in vivo mechanisms and ii high-resolution intravital microscopy we have also discussed the potential strategies aimed at repurposing these tools in order to significantly accelerate the development of therapeutics and vaccines against covid-19 although several academic institutions have already adopted these improved tools for research into basic immune biology and drug discovery pharmaceutical companies still use conventional cell lines and standardized animal models for confirmatory studies as requested by the standards for the passage of new drugs through the preclinical steps of regulatory approval but despite the limited predictive capability of these models the particular urgency to find clinical solutions for the sars-cov-2 pandemic makes it even more evident that an adequate validation of these new tools could lead to an update of the current preclinical testing standards with the new ones based on the concepts of 3d culture perfused culture and intravital imaging presented here in virology and vaccinology as well as in many other pharmaceutical sectors the new standards suggested in our review would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the whole drug development process with the added benefit of drastically reducing refining and widely replacing animal testing  emerging viral infections in india reeta mani s v ravi anita desai sn madhusudana   it is time to close the book on infectious diseases and pay more attention to chronic ailments such as cancer and heart disease the war against infectious disease has been won this was the remark made in 1967 by the then us surgeon general william h stewart buoyed up by the accelerating pace of scientific and technological progress and the conquest of infectious diseases accomplished by use of miracle drugs-antibiotics and vaccines to write about infectious diseases in 1962 said macfarlane burnet australian virologist and nobel laureate is almost to write of something that has passed into history this over-optimism was soon shattered by the recognition of a new disease of infectious origin in 1981-aids which remains the global killer today threatening to outdo the black death of the fourteenth century and the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 which killed at least 50 million people each indeed despite an elaborate armamentarium to tackle infectious bugs the continual evolution of emerging and re-emerging diseases due to the astonishingly diverse microbial world and its adaptive capacity will remain a crucial global challenge in the twenty-first century emerging infections can be defined as infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range1 emerging infections can be further classified as newly emerging re-emergingresurging or deliberately emerging since the underlying causes of emergence and preventive strategies differ between these groups newly emerging infections are those that have not previously been recognized in man re-emerging and resurging infections are those that existed in the past but are now rapidly increasing in incidence or in geographical or human host range deliberately emerging infections are infections due to microbes naturally occurring or bio-engineered deliberately introduced by man usually for nefarious use 2 microbes know no geographical boundaries and their dissemination is accelerated by human mobility circumnavigation of the globe took more than a year a century ago today it can be completed in a record 67 h 3 at any given time over a million people each one a potential carrier of pathogens are airborne around the planet transit times of people and other commercial goods which can be a potential source of pathogens and vectors are very short now compared to the incubation times of diseases carriers of disease can reach their destination before the threat they harbour is detectable reducing health quarantine to a near absurdity 4 rapid global spread of the recent 2009 h1n1 pandemic influenza introduction of aedes albopictus asian tiger mosquito into the united states brazil and parts of africa in shipments of used tyres from asia 5 and the world-wide spread of hantaviruses by rats 6 can be attributed to international travel and commerce mass migration of people due to war natural calamities or economic hardships play a key role in disease emergence other aspects of modern human behaviour contribute to the emergence of novel infectious diseases eg water shortage leading to increased usage of open containers for water storage creates a breeding ground for mosquito vectors dengue social practices like tattooing in tribal areas in india hbv hcv and other blood borne viruses rural urbanization sexual behaviour hiv needle sharing among iv drug abusers hiv hcv use of contaminated bloodtissue products hiv hbv hcv vcjd contaminated vaccines polio vaccines contaminated with sv40-linked to increased risk of non-hodgkins lymphoma immune deficiency associated with aids and advanced medical care including cancer chemotherapy and organ transplantation has contributed to an enormous increase in an immunocompromised population world-wide opportunistic re-emerging infections are frequently seen in such individuals due to reactivation of latent viruses or unrestrained replication of endogenous viruses leading to enhanced virulence or changes in host or tissue tropism cmv ebv hhv-6 parvovirus b-19 jc bk etc 2 7 subsequent to the anthrax attacks through the us mail system in 2001 the possible use of viruses as weapons of bioterrorism has been considered potential viruses that can be deliberately introduced into susceptible human population as weapons of bio-terrorism include smallpox ebola marburg venezuelan equine encephalitis virus eastern equine encephalitis virus western equine encephalitis virus lassa fever virus etc the potential use of genetically engineered viruses with enhanced virulence is also a possibility microbes are constantly evolving to adapt to their environment many viruses like influenza show a high mutation rate and rapidly evolve into new variants against which the immune system fails to mount a response and vaccines against existing strains are ineffective in certain viruses evolution of a new variant may result in new manifestation of disease change in host or tissue tropism or altered virulence emergence of drug-resistant microbes by natural selection confers an added advantage to them the molecular evolution of chikungunya virus chikv a226v mutation in glycoprotein envelope gene leading to a higher efficiency of replication and dissemination in the vector species aedes albopictus is reported to have contributed to resurgence of chikungunya fever chik in kerala state in 2007 8 
when humans get infected its not because the virus is wily or devious adjectives applied to this complicated pathogen humans get infected quite often simply because they have put themselves in some viruss way 9
 deforestation expansion of human habitat and mining activities have been suggested as risk factors associated with re-emergence of vampire bat rabies in the amazon basin 10 the dramatic increase of human cases of kyasanur forest disease kfd a tick-borne flavivirus in south west india in 1983 can be attributed to deforestation and agricultural development which increased exposure of humans to the virus and the vector ticks usage of cleared areas in the forest for cattle grazing favoured the proliferation of the ticks haemaphysalis spinigera which prefer to feed on bigger animals including humans 11 the emergence of argentine haemorrhagic fever and its expansion to more areas in argentina has been linked to agricultural activities like cultivation of corn that sustain the corn mouse the main reservoir of the junin virus causing the disease 12 in india japanese encephalitis was introduced where dams and canals were built to bring in water for rice cultivation a large pig population is conducive for outbreaks of je while a large cattle population may support mosquito feeding but act as dampeners for spread of je since viraemia is not present 7 the worst affected districts in kerala during the 2007 chikungunya outbreak kottayam and pathanamthitta are hilly and heavily forested with vast rubber plantations the rainwater that collects in the hemispherical containers fitted to the trunks of rubber trees for latex collection in the region supported prolific breeding of aedes albopictus mosquitoes contributing to resurgence of the disease 8 wild-life constitutes a large and often unknown reservoir of diseases an estimated 75 of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic mainly of viral origin and likely to be vector-borne 13 several factors related to wild-life like wild-life trade and translocation live animal and bush-meat markets consumption of exotic foods ecotourism access to petting zoos and ownership of exotic pets contribute to emergence of infectious diseases 11 outbreaks of marburg and ebola have been associated with transport of animals the rapid economic growth in southern china leading to an increasing demand for animal proteins including those from exotic game food animals such as civets and many varieties of these wild game mammals in overcrowded cages in wet markets allowed the jumping of the novel sars coronavirus from animals to human 14 currently very few countries have active wild-life disease surveillance and it is the need of the hour to monitor the emergence of novel microbes nipah virus a zoonotic paramyxovirus is an emerging virus endemic in southeast asia beginning in september 1998 a major outbreak of disease in pigs and human beings appeared in the northern part of peninsular malaysia resulting in 265 infected individuals and 105 deaths most of whom were farmers or abattoir workers who had come in close contact with infected pigs 15 surprisingly while respiratory symptoms predominated in pigs infected humans presented mostly with encephalitic symptoms in march 1999 a novel paramyxovirus was isolated from the csf of an encephalitic patient from sungai nipah village this virus which was later named as the nipah virus was found to be closely related to hendra virus another paramyxovirus identified in 1994 which caused severe respiratory illness in horses and humans in australia 1517 these two geographically remote yet phylogenetically close viruses were classified into a new genus-henipavirus 18 19 fruit bats belonging to the genus pteropus were identified as the natural hosts for nipah virus while pigs were considered the intermediary hosts the most likely explanation for introduction of the virus into pigs appears to be related to the practice of growing fruit orchards near piggeries to allow efficient use of pig waste as fertilizer for the trees with some trees overhanging the pig-pens it is likely that pigs were exposed to virus laden excreta and masticated fruit pellets dropped from feeding fruit bats also called as flying foxes who are symptomless carriers of the virus 15 pigs infected with the virus showed less mortality however due to their predominant respiratory involvement they spread the infection to humans in close contact mass culling of more than a million pigs contained the outbreak in malaysia however subsequently several nipah virus associated encephalitic outbreaks with a high mortality occurred in bangladesh between 2001 and 2007 20 a similar outbreak which was retrospectively identified to be due to nipah virus was reported in 2001 from siliguri west bengal not far from bangladesh all of the patients were residents of siliguri and the outbreak occurred among hospitalized patients family contacts of the patients and medical staff of 4 hospitals sixty-six cases of encephalitis were identified and the case-fatality ratio was 74 analysis of the limited sequence data suggested that the nipah virus strains associated with the outbreak were more closely related to the virus isolated in bangladesh than to the virus isolated in malaysia suggesting that viruses circulating in different areas have unique genetic signatures and may have co-evolved within local natural reservoirs 21 many of the epidemiologic features of the outbreak in siliguri were comparable to those of the recent nipah virus outbreaks in bangladesh in bangladesh no intermediate animal host was identified and many infected individuals were thought to have had direct contact with fruits eaten by bats or consumed contaminated date palm sap 22 in the siliguri outbreak studies to detect an intermediate host were not conducted however serological evidence suggested pteropus giganteus fruit bats as reservoirs of infections in bangladesh 23 as well as in india 24 in both outbreaks human-to-human transmission occurred in healthcare settings through contact with infected persons supporting nosocomial mode of transmission initiating adequate barrier nursing techniques helped to curtail further spread of infection 21 in april 2007 30 cases of fever with acute respiratory distress andor neurological symptoms with 5 deaths were reported from nadia district of west bengal the cases presented mainly with fever headache and body ache with a few cases having episodes of vomiting disorientation and respiratory distress samples including urine csf brain and lung tissue from the five fatal cases were found to be positive for nipah virus by rt-pcr 25 in northern india as in bangladesh p giganteus bats live in close association with the human population the multiple outbreaks of nipah encephalitis in bangladesh and the 20012007 outbreaks in west bengal show a perpetual risk for spillover infection between bats and humans in this region suggesting that more such outbreaks may continue to occur in future establishing appropriate surveillance systems in these areas will be necessary to initiate prompt infection control measures 21 24 procedures for the laboratory diagnosis of nipah virus include serology histopathology pcr and virus isolation all work involving the propagation of nipah virus must be done in containment level 4 facilities bsl-4 considering the high virulence of virus wide range of susceptible hosts and absence of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions there is no effective treatment for nipah virus disease but ribavarin may alleviate the symptoms of nausea vomiting and convulsions 26 currently no vaccine is available for use however a few candidate vaccines include a recombinant sub-unit vaccine formulation which protects against lethal nipah virus challenge in cats 27 and alvac canarypox vectored nipah f and g vaccine which appears to be a promising vaccine for swine and has potential as a vaccine for humans 28 the occurrence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in 1993 in the southwestern united states due to the emergence of a disease caused by viruses known for decades was attributed to the relatively abrupt and short-lived weather changes due to the el nino effect the el nino effect provoked heavy rainfall across the southern states in us leading to proliferation of vegetation and consequently the rodent population the natural hantavirus hosts which are asymptomatic carriers of the virus as the population of rodents especially deer mice peromyscus maniculatus exploded and they sought food and shelter in human dwellings people were exposed to the aerosolized animal droppings urine and saliva which lead to the infection 29 the outbreak has continued since and by december 1 2009 a total of 534 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with 36 mortality have been reported in the united states 30 hantaviruses are the most widely distributed zoonotic rodent borne viruses known to cause two significant clinical syndromes-haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps also referred to as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hcps hantaviruses belonging to family bunyaviridae genus hantavirus are enveloped rna viruses and currently up to 22 species and more than 30 genotypes have been described important species of hantaviruses include hantaan virus seoul virus puumala virus sin nombre virus and dobrava-belgrade virus hfrs and hps are being increasingly reported from various geographical locations worldwide and are a cause of global concern apart from inhalation of aerosols from virus containing rodent faeces urine or saliva transmission is reported to occur even through rodent bites 31 though considered unlikely human-to-human transmission has been reported in an outbreak due to andes virus in argentina 32 thottapalayam virus the first hantavirus to be isolated is the only indigenous isolate from india isolated from an insectivorous shrew suncus murinus captured in vellore south india during field studies of japanese encephalitis in 1964 33 however there is limited data to suggest that the thottapalayam virus is pathogenic to humans 34 future studies on the epizootiology of the virus and exploration of new shrewborne hantaviruses will provide more insights into the evolutionary origin of hantaviruses in their rodent and insectivore reservoir hosts clement et al documented the first evidence of seoul virus like andor puumala virus like antibodies in a serosurvey of leptospirosis-suspected cases from india in 1998-1999 subsequently they also reported nephropathy due to hantaviruses mimicking leptospirosis in a prospective study in the chennai and cochin area in southern india providing clinical evidence of disease due to hantaviruses in india seven 12 and three 5 of the 60 patients with suspected leptospirosis screened for igg antibodies were positive for seoul virus and puumala virus respectively nine of these cases were also positive for specific igm antibodies confirming for the first time recent hantavirus infections in these indian cases two deaths due to acute renal failure were reported wild rats which have a documented presence world-wide including india are the reservoir of seoul virus they can cause thrombocytopenia with concomitant renal and hepatic involvement thus mimicking leptospirosis interestingly the bank vole which spreads the puumala virus is not present in india therefore the positive serological results for puumala virus in indian patients may represent cross-reactions with the thottapalayam virus or yet another unknown hantavirus in india 3537 chandy et al found 147 of 152 serum samples from patients with febrile illness positive for anti-hantavirus igm and in 57 of healthy blood donors in south india indicating the presence of symptomatic and asymptomatic hantavirus infections in the indian population 38 few cases of ocular involvement due to hantavirus were reported in patients admitted with pyrexia of unknown origin or hemorrhagic fever following exposure to flood waters in mumbai in 2005 39 there are no specific anti-viral drugs for treatment of all hantavirus infections ribavirin used in clinical trials in china for hfrs has been reported to cause significant reduction in fatality 40 prevention of exposure to rodent excreta is the best preventive strategy there is no who-approved hantavirus vaccine available however at least three different inactivated vaccines developed in korea and china are being used only locally many other vaccine approaches have been investigated using both inactivated virus and recombinant dna technology 41 chikungunya fever chik caused by an arbovirus chikv a rna virus belonging to family togaviridae genus alphavirus is a re-emerging viral disease to date a vertebrate reservoir or sylvan transmission cycle for chikv has only been identified in africa in asia the virus is presumed to exist in a human-mosquito-human cycle 42 re-emergence of chikv was recorded in india during 20052006 after a hiatus of 32 years causing more than 138 million cases of chik in 14 states and union territories in india 43 several islands of the indian ocean reported similar outbreaks in the same period the illness is characterized by abrupt onset of fever with severe arthralgia followed by constitutional symptoms and rash lasting for 17 days most often the disease is a self-limiting febrile illness however atypical manifestations like cardiovascular renal and neurological complications 44 45 as well as mother to child transmission 46 47 has been reported chikv is known to cause epidemics after a period of quiescence the first recorded epidemic occurred in tanzania in 19521953 in asia chikv activity was documented since its isolation in bangkok thailand in 1958 in india well-documented outbreaks occurred in 1963 and 1964 in kolkata and southern india respectively and in sholapur district in maharashtra in 1973 chikv emerged in the islands of south west indian ocean viz french island of la reunion mayotee mauritius and seychelles in early 2005 after a hiatus of about three decades chikv has re-emerged in india in the states of andhra pradesh karnataka maharashtra madhya pradesh and tamil nadu since december 2005 cases have also been reported from various other states including rajasthan orissa gujarat and kerala the outbreak is still continuing chikv is transmitted by aedes species mosquitoes primarily aedes aegypti however unusually the vector responsible for transmission between humans in the 20052006 chik epidemic on reunion island was apparently the asian tiger mosquito aedes albopictus interestingly the same epidemic was associated with a strain of chikv with a mutation in the envelope protein gene e1-a226v which was reported to play a role in the adaptation of chikv to aedes albopictus mosquitoes providing an insight into how a genetic change in the pathogen can increase the host range and geographical distribution 48 the precise reasons for the re-emergence of chikv in the indian subcontinent remain an enigma lack of immunity may have possibly facilitated rapid spread of the infection 49 other factors include lack of efficient vector control activities globalization mutation of the virus and emergence of aedes albopictus in addition to aedes aegypti as an efficient vector for chikv 8 molecular characterization has demonstrated two distinct lineages of strains which cause epidemics in africa and asia the recent outbreaks were attributed to the african genotype of chikv laboratory diagnosis can be achieved by detection of igm antibodies in serum and csf in neurological involvement virus isolation and direct detection of nucleic acids in the samples using pcr based techniques to tackle this re-emerging virus laboratory research aimed at the development of vaccine candidates antiviral strategies and commercially available diagnostic kits is needed 42 even as we grapple with the challenge of eradicating poliomyelitis another enterovirus ev-71 responsible for neurological disease has emerged 50 hand-foot-and-mouth disease hfmd is a mild exanthematous illness seen worldwide with characteristic lesions on the palms soles and oral mucosa affecting mainly children under 10 years of age the causative agents were initially coxsackie virus type a 16 ca 16 and related serotypes however in recent years a new aetiological agent of hfmd ev-71 has emerged causing large outbreaks with severe complications and many deaths especially in the asia pacific region 51 this geographical predilection is unexplained but could be related to the frequency of intra- and inter-typic genetic recombinations of the virus the genetic predisposition of host population environmental hygiene and standard of healthcare 52 ev-71 is a member of the family picornaviridae and belongs to the genus enterovirus human enterovirus a faeco-oral route is the principal mode of transmission and humans are the only known natural host a major epidemic of hfmd induced by ev-71 was reported in sarawak malaysia in 1997 followed by smaller outbreaks in peninsular malaysia more than 2600 children mostly under 6 years of age were affected most of them presented with characteristic febrile illness and skin lesions but severe neurological complications like aseptic meningitis acute flaccid paralysis fatal encephalomyelitis and cardiopulmonary complications were also reported in a small proportion of patients unlike the benign type of hfmd caused by ca 16 and other aetiologic agents subsequently ev-71 associated hfmd has been reported from taiwan in 1998 perth in 1999 and singapore korea malaysia japan and taiwan in 2000 vietnam in 2005 and china in 2008 brainstem encephalitis especially affecting the medulla associated with cardiopulmonary dysfunction has become a notable feature in ev-71 epidemics in asia and is the primary cause of death in india outbreaks of hfmd have been reported from calicut kerala in 2003 and three districts of west bengal in 2007 however these outbreaks were not associated with neurological complications 53 54 various case reports and hospital based or clinico-epidemiological studies from india have reported neurological complications caused by ev-71 5557 like all other enteroviruses children are the most significant target as well as reservoir of ev-71 in a study of aetiology of viral encephalitis in children in uttar pradesh the most common causative agent was ev-71 identified in 42 of the 87 patients enrolled in the study generalized convulsions with altered sensorium were a significant finding in these patients the infection was associated with a significantly high morbidity and mortality 50 of the children with ev-71 encephalitis died 57 nucleotide sequence analysis of an ev-71 isolate from a patient with acute flaccid paralysis guillainbarr syndrome from haryana revealed that the indian isolate is genetically distinct from the ev-71 strains isolated from other outbreaks in the asia pacific region 56 diagnosis of hfmd can be made clinically with certainty if a strong index of clinical suspicion exists laboratory confirmation is dependent upon direct isolation of the virus from skin vesicle fluid throat and rectal swabsstool specimens in cell cultures using neutralization with a type-specific antiserum indirect fluorescent assay ifa and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr amplification of the viral rna prophylaxis and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin ivig has been used with some success in patients with complicated ev-71 infection and agammaglobulinaemic individuals prone to the development of chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis vaccines being developed include inactivated whole-virus live attenuated subviral particle and dna vaccines since the densely populated asia pacific region is the epicentre of emergence of this virus in the past decade continuous monitoring of this disease and its epidemiology in india is warranted since the first outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel triple re-assortant swine origin influenza a 2009 h1n1 was identified in mexico in march 2009 influenza a 2009 h1n1 cases have been documented throughout the world causing a tremendous impact on health and economy the pandemic strain hit indian shores on may 13 when a 23 year old passenger who traveled from usa to hyderabad andhra pradesh tested positive for influenza a 2009 h1n1 the first death due to 2009 h1n1 influenza in india of a 14 year old female student was reported on august 3 2009 from pune maharashtra as of november 30 2009 samples from 87417 persons were tested for influenza a 2009 h1n1 in various laboratories designated by the government across the country and 18198 208 of them were found positive and 575 315 deaths recorded 59 in india the state of maharashtra was the worst affected followed by karnataka 58 the mode of transmission is through droplets from coughing or sneezing and through direct or indirect contact with the respiratory secretions of an infected person the clinical spectrum of the illness varies from a mild respiratory tract illness to severe complications such as pneumonia resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards respiratory and multi-organ failure and death the risk of complications is higher among pregnant women and those with pre-existing diseases such as asthma heart disease obesity and kidney disease laboratory confirmation is achieved by detection of viral rna by rt-pcr on respiratory samples the drug of choice is oseltamivir zanamivir can be used as an alternative indigenously developed vaccines have been approved for use in india on 10 aug 2010 the who director-general declared that the pandemic was over by then 18449 deaths had been reported worldwide in the sea region 76302 cases and 2054 deaths had been reported however in the post-pandemic period it is likely that the pandemic h1n1 2009 virus can continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years several countries including sri lanka india and thailand continue to report cases each week although the trend is on a downswing 60 with the continual circulation and interspecies transmission of human swine and avian influenza viruses in countries around the world there is an increased need for influenza surveillance in pigs birds and other animals to aid in monitoring and assessing the risk of future pandemic virus emergence involving different species vaccination in humans and continued surveillance can curb the occurrence of recurrent waves of the pandemic highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza emerged in hong kong in 1997 infection was acquired by humans directly from chickens without the involvement of an intermediate host the outbreak was contained with effective culling of more than 15 million chickens 61 since december 2003 outbreaks have been reported in poultry from china vietnam and thailand and more than 70 countries across asia europe the middle east and africa have reported the disease in poultry and wild birds as of 11th april 2011 549 confirmed human cases of avian influenza ah5n1 have been reported to who with 320 deaths 62 epidemics of the highly pathogenic avian bird flu h5n1 among indian poultry birds were reported for the first time on a large scale during 2006 in the states of maharashtra gujarat and madhya pradesh subsequently several outbreaks in 20082009 were recorded in west bengal sikkim assam and tripura in 2010 recently an outbreak of avian influenza has been reported from tripura in february 2011 63 mass culling of birds in affected farms led to the control of the disease spread no suspected human cases of this deadly bird virus have appeared in india where the mechanisms for spreading the disease and its potentially serious public health dangers in india are understood however as long as the avian influenza outbreaks due to h5n1 continue to occur from infected poultry in various parts of the world the threat of an imminent pandemic looms large and hence a constant vigil is warranted chandipura virus is a member of the family rhabdoviridae and genus vesiculovirus that is associated with an encephalitic illness in humans it was first identified in 1965 after isolation from the blood of two adult patients with febrile illness from chandipura nagpur in maharashtra state india 64 and subsequently from a child with acute encephalopathy syndrome in raipur in central india 65 however the significance of chandipura virus as a human pathogen was unresolved until 2003 when an outbreak of acute encephalitis in children in various districts of andhra pradesh with a case fatality of 556 was attributed to chandipura virus 66 twenty-six suspected cases were investigated for the aetiological agent in another outbreak of encephalitis that affected children in tribal areas of gujarat state in western india in 2004 with a case fatality rate of 783 demonstration of chandipura viral rna in 9 45 of 20 cases igm antibodies in 3 15 and isolation of the virus from one patient provided strong evidence for chandipura virus as the aetiologic agent of the encephalitis outbreak the virus sequences from the outbreak were closely related to prototype strain 1965 and isolates from the andhra pradesh outbreak in 2003 67 outbreaks of encephalitis due to chandipura virus were reported in 2003 and 2005 from maharashtra 68 69 and in an hospital based surveillance of acute encephalitis among children from north telangana in andhra pradesh 70 chandipura virus was confirmed as an aetiological agent of an acute encephalitis syndrome aes outbreak among children from nagpur division in 2007 with a case fatality ratio of 436 71 fever and neurological manifestations are the predominant features bleeding tendencies have been reported in some cases of encephalitis due to chandipura virus the clinical course of chandipura encephalitis is short with rapid progression to death with 60 of the deaths occurring within 24 h 71 chandipura virus has been isolated from sandflies of phlebotomus species in andhra pradesh and maharashtra in india 7173 and west africa 74 and is probably spread through its bite the presence of the virus in africa indicates a wide distribution although no human cases have been observed outside of india laboratory studies indicated venereal transmission of this virus from infected male to female sand flies while mating 75 the virus has also been found to be transmissible through aedes aegypti mosquitoes in laboratory studies 76 these findings may have important epidemiologic implications in spread of the infection evaluation of a combination of recombinant glycoprotein rgp and a commercially available dpt vaccine chp-dpt has shown promising results in a murine model 77 chandipura virus has emerged as an important encephalitis-causing pathogen with high mortality among paediatric population in india the need for immediate comprehensive analysis of the transmission mechanisms of this virus including the role of vectors and other ecologic factors for the development of appropriate control strategies is warranted 67 in january 2011 the first ever report of an outbreak of crimean congo haemorrhagic fever cchf has been confirmed from the village of kolat in sanand taluka 30 kms south-west of ahmedabad in gujarat state in india a 30 year old woman and the doctor and nurse who treated her succumbed to the illness creating panic waves not only in the local population but the country as well 7880 the rna virus causing cchf is a member of the genus nairovirus of the family bunyaviridae ixodid ticks of the genus hyalomma specifically act as a vector and reservoir for the virus and numerous wild and domestic animals can serve as amplifying hosts cchf was first described as a clinical entity in 1944 when many soviet military personnel were infected in war affected crimea a similar illness was recognized in congo and uganda in 1967 resulting in the name crimean congo haemorrhagic fever the virus is also distributed throughout the mediterranean northwestern china central asia africa southern europe middle east and the indian subcontinent 79 80 outbreaks of cchf have recently been reported from iran in 2008 81 turkey in 20012003 82 and pakistan in 2010 83 transmission of virus occurs through bite of an infected tick contact with blood or tissues of infected animals or humans nosocomial transmission also has been reported 7981 the virus causes predominantly haemorrhagic manifestations in humans with high case fatality rates ranging from 15 to 70 after an incubation period of 36 days the onset is sudden with high fever chills headache joint pain myalgia vomiting and abdominal pain the spectrum of haemorrhagic manifestations includes red eyes flushing of face throat congestion petechiae over the palate epistaxis haematemesis haematuria and intracerebral bleeds the complications include jaundice disseminated intravascular coagulation hypovolumic shock and muti-organ failure laboratory diagnosis of cchf has to be performed in biological safety level-4 bsl-4 facility immunohistochemical staining to demonstrate viral antigen in formalin fixed tissues detection of viral antigen and antibodies by elisa virus isolation and detection of viral nucleic acids by pcr are used for laboratory diagnosis treatment of cchf is mostly supportive though ribavirin has shown benefits in in vitro studies and is also recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis 79 80 in the recent outbreak in gujarat 20 of the samples collected from cattle around the affected area have tested positive for antibodies to cchf earlier studies from india have also reported evidence of circulating antibodies both in humans and domestic animals suggesting the presence of the virus in india since many years 84 this necessitates constant surveillance for the virus and any new outbreaks to initiate immediate control measures animal handlers abattoir workers and veterinarians are at high risk and preventive strategies include use of effective personal protective measures against tick bites severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a form of atypical pneumonia that apparently originated in guangdong province of the peoples republic of china in late 2002 a novel coronavirus the sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov was identified as the agent responsible for this first pandemic of the new millennium after its recognition in early 2003 the infection was reported worldwide as of july 31 2003 8096 cases of probable sars have been reported in more than 30 countries world-wide with 774 96 deaths 85 human-to-human transmission of the virus the lack of awareness in hospital infection control and international air travel facilitated the rapid global dissemination of this agent the findings that horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for sars-cov-like virus and that civets are the amplification host emphasizes the importance of wildlife and biosecurity in farms and wet markets which can serve as the source and amplification centers for emerging infections 86 the typical clinical presentation of sars is that of viral pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration after 37 days of prodromal symptoms the illness is characterized by an onset of dry non-productive cough or dyspnoea which may be accompanied by or progress to hypoxaemia about 1020 of the patients may develop acute respiratory distress requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation laboratory testing requires a biosafety level 3 facility a positive viral culture from respiratory faecal and occasionally urine or tissue specimens or a fourfold rise in the neutralizing antibody titer in paired serum samples is the most definitive evidence of infection rapid detection by nucleic acid amplification such as rt-pcr or antigen detection by eia is the alternative 86 though a few suspected cases of sars were reported from india none of them were confirmed and in the official declaration by the government as reported on may 2 2003 in the media india was declared by who as a sars free country 87 absence of hla b46 in indian population has been postulated as one of reasons for protection from sars epidemic 88 coronaviruses are known to undergo genetic recombination which may lead to new genotypes and outbreaks the possibility of the re-emergence of sars and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored 86 buffalopox is an important contagious viral infection of buffaloes of all ages occurring in epidemic proportions in countries including india where buffaloes are reared causing considerable morbidity and reduction in milk yield buffalopox is an important emerging zoonosis affecting humans and in recent years several reports of infection in humans have been described from various states in india 89 90 buffalopox virus is a member of the orthopoxvirus and is closely related to vaccinia virus human beings including smallpox-vaccines contract infection upon close contact with infected animals but the extent of disease is greater in non-immunized individuals milking of affected animals is one of the major modes of spread human to human transmission has not been reported milkers develop pox-like lesions on the shin of their fingers arms fore-head and face associated with fever and axillary lymphadenitis regular monitoring of buffalopox outbreaks in india in animals and humans is essential to curb economic losses as well as to reduce public health impact of the disease 90 dengue is the most significant and widespread flavivirus disease to have emerged globally the global epidemiology of dengue feverdengue hemorrhagic fever dfdhf is changing rapidly 91 the dengue virus belonging to family flaviviridae genus flavivirus consists of four serotypes 14 despite extensive cross-reactivity among these viruses in serological tests there is no cross protective immunity in humans a person living in an endemic area can have as many as four infections one with each serotype during their life the disease spectrum caused by dengue virus varies from a subclinical infection to a mild self limiting disease-dengue fever df and a severe disease that may be fatal the dengue haemorrhagic feverdengue shock syndrome dhfdss the dengue viruses are the only known arboviruses that have fully adapted to humans having lost the need for an enzootic cycle for maintenance usually transmitted by aedes aegypti mosquitoes the virus has been reported to be transmitted in recent years by aedes albopictus which may have significance with respect to dengue re-emergence 91 dengue infection has been known to be endemic in india for over two centuries as a benign and self limited disease however in recent years dengue which has been an urban disease has spread to rural areas of india as well 92 93 dengue and the vector have been reported in the arid zones of rajasthan 94 95 the disease has changed its course manifesting in the severe form as dhf and with increasing frequency of outbreaks with all four dengue serotypes co-circulating and the predominant serotypes ever changing 9698 these severe complications are thought to occur as a result of evolution of the dengue virus to escape high population immunity manifesting as increased viral virulence and human immunopathogenesis due to antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection 99 the resurgence of dengue can be linked to urbanization and unprecedented population growth increased density of the mosquito vector reinfestation with aedes aegypti of a new geographical area warm and humid climate water storage pattern in houses storage of junk in open spaces including tyres coconut shells etc that trap rain water introduction of new serotype of the virus lack of effective mosquito control and to the enormous increase in the international transport of people and commodities 100 101 since vaccines or antiviral drugs are not available for dengue viruses the only effective way to prevent epidemic dfdhf is to control the mosquito vector aedes aegypti and prevent its bite 101 japanese encephalitis je is one of the most important endemic encephalitis in the world especially in eastern and southeastern asia je virus belonging to family flaviviridae is transmitted through a zoonotic cycle between culex mosquitoes pigs and water birds humans are accidentally infected and are a dead end host because of low level and transient viraemia japanese encephalitis kills more than 10000 children in asia and the pacific every year and it leaves one-third of its survivors with permanent neurological damage je virus activity in india was first established by a serological survey in 1952 and clinical recognition of this disease was first made in 1955 at vellore of north arcot district in tamilnadu state between 1955 and 2007 there had been an increase and spread of infection throughout the country except in arid and high land regions outbreaks of je occurred in west bengal during 19731976 and in andhra pradesh bihar tamil nadu and uttar pradesh during 19771979 subsequently outbreaks were reported in assam karnataka and pondicherry and uttar pradesh in the 1980s 102 in recent years jev has spread to new geographical locations within india-into haryana and kerala states in northwestern and southwestern india respectively 103 104 a new focus of infection in sangli district of maharashtra was reported in 1999 since 2000 je occurrence has been reported from 16 states and union territories and among them uttar pradesh assam and karnataka have accounted for more than 90 of the total incidence in india 102 in 2005 uttar pradesh faced a devastating epidemic outbreak of je which surpassed in intensity and magnitude all previous reported epidemic outbreaks in the country the outbreak was mostly confined to gorakhpur affecting 6061 cases with 1500 deaths followed by another outbreak in 2006 with 2320 cases and 528 deaths 105 immunization in india was inspired by a pilot program that the government of andhra pradesh started with path program for appropriate technology in health with funding from the bill and melinda gates foundation this partnership helped introduce the live attenuated sa 14-14-2 je vaccine that has been effectively and safely used in china for almost 20 years to high-risk districts in the state at affordable costs beginning in 2001 subsequently the government of india launched vaccination campaign in highly endemic states of assam karnataka west bengal and uttar pradesh in 2006 and in andhra pradesh bihar haryana maharashtra tamil nadu in 2007 and 2008 respectively which has resulted in reduced incidence of je in these states by the end of 2009 more than 60 million indian children have been immunized through these successful vaccination campaigns 106 107 effective prevention and control strategies need to be continually implemented since the number of je epidemics has increased in the recent past and the disease has spread to new geographical areas the occurrence of epidemic je is attributed mainly to vagaries of climatic conditions and thereby warrants preparedness to implement an effective preventive strategy like je immunization of target population in risk area resurgence of je in endemic areas is largely determined by agricultural activities irrigation and animal husbandry practices an integrated approach using vector control and selective immunization of children has been recommended to tackle this problem 102 rotaviruses cause acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide the diversity of rotavirus strains reported and the high prevalence of mixed infections are unique features of rotavirus epidemiology in india and emphasize the need for surveillance of cocirculating strains to follow the rapid changes in circulation and to detect novel strains group b rotaviruses have been reported from kolkata and pune and human infections with strains g6 g8 g10 and g9p 19 which may occur as a result of zoonotic transmission of bovine and porcine rotaviruses have been reported from western southern and eastern india the occurrence of these unusual rotavirus strains which are natural reassortants of human and bovine rotaviruses suggests that reassortment may be an important mechanism for generation of rotavirus strains of newborns this is catalyzed by the age old traditions of calves and humans living in the same household and socio-economic conditions in india 108 109 the emergence of new variantsstrains of noroviruses causative agents of acute gastroenteritis has been described in various studies from india 110 111 human bocavirus a new human parvovirus identified in children with respiratory tract disease in 2005 has been reported from india as well 112 red baby syndrome a new disease characterised by abrupt onset of high fever and generalized erythema involving the entire skin seen in infants and young children associated with human parvovirus b-19 infection was recently reported from india 113 with the adoption of the international health regulations ihr2005 by the who india has made considerable progress and continues to demonstrate a strong commitment for establishing and operating a disease surveillance programme the union ministry of health and family welfare launched an integrated disease surveillance project idsp in 2004 to connect all district hospitals and state-run medical colleges to facilitate tele-education training of health professionals and monitoring of disease trends the project is implemented through the central surveillance unit within the national centre for disease control ncdc at new delhi and aims to detect early warning signals of impending disease outbreaks and initiate effective and rapid health actions with the help of information and communication technology at the district state and national levels in addition to monitoring diseases like vector borne infections diarrhoeal diseases respiratory diseases and vaccine preventable diseases the idsp also has a category called unusual clinical syndromes which would alert public health professionals to an intentional release of any biological-agent 114 laboratories in india played a major role in the management of the outbreak investigations during the recent 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic some laboratories geared their capacity by training manpower to carry out confirmation of index cases and test large number of samples this activity may have helped build capacity of several state level laboratories to tackle similar emergencies though lessons learnt from managing one outbreak may not always suffice for another as the agent mode of transmission and susceptible population may differ two main factors for containment of an outbreak are isolation and contact tracing 115 there is a need to move from conventional time consuming laboratory techniques to molecular technologies with rapid and sensitive detection capabilities and increased throughput for responding to the threats posed by emerging and re-emerging viruses in the recent past 115 116 there is also a need to create awareness among clinical microbiologistsvirologists about existing outbreak reporting systems laboratories designated for handling and processing samples for outbreak management and for training and development of skills for testing and identifying new and emerging pathogens 115  evolutionary ecology of virus emergence john dennehy j   despite their limited genetic repertoires and typically specific host tropisms viruses have a remarkable ability to infect new often highly unrelated host types the incidence and spread of novel viruses in host populations is termed virus emergence in recent years the incidence of newly identified viruses in human populations appears to be increasing but whether this is a consequence of improved detection or more emergence events is a topic of considerable debate1 2 3 nevertheless there are some general patterns for virus emergence emergence events typically occur when novel host and reservoir populations experience significant changes in range demographics aggregation and dispersal behavior contact rates environmental and climatic conditions or vector distributions in humans there appear to be several hotspots for emergence typically regions of high human population activity and density these emergence hotspots include the eastern united states western europe japan and southeastern australia3 sources of emerging viruses tend to be phylogenetically closely related organisms for example zoonotic viruses of wildlife are overrepresented among the emerging human viruses3 in addition there is a tendency for emerging viruses to have rna genomes4 this pattern may be a consequence of the high evolvability of rna viruses5 despite these generalities efforts to predict potential emerging viruses have not progressed as fast as hoped mechanistically virus emergence is a threestep process in the first step a virus acquires the ability to infect new host cells the second step consists of virus adaption to the novel host such that transmission between hosts is facilitated finally to achieve full emergence the virus gains the ability to spread epidemically through the host population while the first two steps entail genetic changes in the virus the third step may require changes on the part of the vector or host populations such as through increased contact rates range changes or other ecological or environmental shifts6 virus emergence is therefore by definition an ecoevolutionary process7 in this review i address our current understanding of the evolutionary ecology of virus emergence highlight new approaches to its study and assess the future prospects for the management of risks associated with pandemic infectious viruses examples selected to illustrate basic concepts tend to come from medically and agriculturally important viruses primarily because these viruses are the best studied table 1 however it should be noted that virus emergence is a biologically universal phenomenon and occurs across all phyla a major future challenge is to broaden our perspective of emerging viruses to include bacterial archaeal fungal and invertebrate viruses the study of virus emergence necessarily touches on a broad range of interdependent ecological and evolutionary phenomena conceptually i begin by addressing changes concomitant with emergence in viruses themselves then expand to consider broader population ecosystem and global changes associated with virus emergence since gaining the ability to infect a novel host and the initial adaptation to that host is an inherently evolutionary process i begin this discussion by focusing on virus genetics and evolution i then link evolutionary changes to ecological processes in the context of host and virus population dynamics viruses are among the smallest nucleic acidbased replicating entities and possess characteristics associated with exceptionally fast evolutionary change small genomes short generation times high mutation rates large population sizes high levels of genetic diversity and strong selection pressures8 9 because viruses often lack nucleic acidproofreading mechanisms virus mutation rates are commonly on the order of 103106 per nucleotide each time the genome is copied10 given the small sizes of viral genomes typically 1030 kb viruses with high mutation rates can generate genetically different progeny each time the genome is replicated this errorprone replication can produce viral quasispecies ie vast populations of closely related genotypes5 11 although sequence spaces are unfathomably large the sequence space of a 10kb virus genome is 410000 the immense virus populations can contain many alternative variants thus viruses can rapidly sample sequence space and locate high fitness combinations of mutations6
 the quasispecies nature of viruses may facilitate virus emergence the initial gainoffunction mutations permitting infection of novel hosts tend to be associated with host entry namely the binding of the virus to a specific molecule on the host cells surface in many cases changes in cell tropism can be accomplished through a few or even one nucleotide substitutions12 13 14 15 16 17 a typical example is provided by the alphaviruses a group of 29 nonsegmented positivesense singlestranded rna ssrna viruses mainly vectored by mosquitoes18 19 examples of alphaviruses include eastern equine encephalitis virus chikungunya virus chikv ross river virus and sindbis virus despite the striking architectural similarities among the different strains these viruses can infect an exceptionally broad range of hosts including mammals fish amphibians reptiles birds and insects18 19 emergence events can result in hundreds of thousands of human infections20 21 the molecular basis of this broad host range stems from the malleability of the alphavirus host attachment protein the e2 envelope glycoprotein and its ability to bind the highly conserved laminin receptor single amino acid substitutions in the e2 envelope glycoprotein projecting from the alphavirus capsid surface have been linked with host range expansion17 many of these substitutions were shown to occur in a specific domain of e2 approximately spanning amino acid residues 190260 part of domain b see fig 122 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 mutations in this region are also associated with escape from monoclonal antibodymediated neutralization32 33 34 smith et al used cryoelectron microscopy to show that fragment antigenbinding fab fragments bind the outermost tip of the e2 glycoprotein of sindbis and ross river viruses roughly corresponding to amino acids 190260 of the e2 protein35 a class iii pdz domain binding motif was identified at residues 21321636 pdz domains are proteininteraction modules that recognize short amino acid motifs at the ctermini of target proteins37 it is this region that presumably binds the laminin receptor and changes in the amino acid sequence constituting this region likely permit binding to different laminin receptor variants furthermore alphavirus host shifts may be facilitated by the indispensability and lack of structural flexibility of the highly conserved laminin receptor39 40 the e2 host receptor binding site has likely been shaped by natural selection for flexibility to bind different host laminin receptors providing alphaviruses with the ability to shift hosts easily another wellstudied example of changes in binding avidity concomitant to virus host shifts comes from influenza a viruses iav in birds iav host attachment hemagglutinins prefer to bind oligosaccharides that terminate with a sialic acid linked to galactose by 23linkages by contrast human iavs prefer sialic acids with 26linkages61 as few as one or two mutations in hemagglutinin can significantly alter binding avidity to favor either human or avian sialic acids62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 several studies have suggested that subtle changes in the electrostatic properties of the virus host receptor domain and increased opportunities for hydrogen bonding with complementary domains on host sialic acids permit host range expansion61 62 63 64 65 crucially mutations permitting binding to human receptors do not preclude binding to avian receptors and vice versa although binding affinities are typically reduced61 68 71 72 73 the ability to bind both human and avian receptors allows the possibility that a broad host range virus could be amplified in one host while periodically infecting the other in what is described in ecological theory as a sourcesink scenario74 75 sourcesink evolution and its relevance to viral ecology will be discussed later in this paper the small number of mutations required to shift hosts has significant implications for virus emergence given small viral genomes and large population sizes the number of potential host range mutants in a sample can be surprisingly large a 10kb genome has a maximum of 3  104 potential independent single mutants which is well below the average population size of viruses given that a considerable proportion of these mutants are not biologically feasible owing to lethal mutations76 two or three rounds of replication of a single virus can generate every possible viable mutation one step away from the parental genotype a simple thought experiment illustrates the ease of generating host range mutants in high mutation rate viruses a single sneeze can expel 20000 droplets with each droplet containing 1000 virus particles77 assuming that a single nucleotide substitution at in a 10kb genome provides the ability to infect a novel host there could be 10000 virus particles in that sneeze that possess mutations allowing them to infect a novel host moreover while most virus mutations are highly deleterious even lethal76 host rangeexpanding mutations often incur minimal impacts on viral fitness on native hosts although this is by no means universal78 79 80 81 since the effectiveness of purifying selection is proportional to the strength of selection one consequence is that slightly deleterious mutations may persist for long periods in quasispecies swarms in primary host populations82 83 due to genetic drift and other stochastic processes their frequencies in host populations could even increase in our example 10000 host range mutants per sneeze could be a significant underestimate of the number of particles able to infect a novel host it is clear that the first step of virus emergence is not the ratelimiting step virus host shifts can also occur via largescale genomic rearrangements among related viruses that is through the recombination of homologous genetic sequences the acquisition of nonhomologous sequences ie illegitimate recombination or the reassortment of virus genome segments fig 284 85 recombination is relatively common among the dna viruses86 87 88 while recombination frequencies vary considerably some dna viruses have extremely high rates of recombination in one study of cauliflower mosaic virus 538 of the genomes recovered after a single passage were recombinants89 in the brome mosaic virus practically every virus is a recombinant90 nonreplicative recombination uses enzymemediated breakagerepair mechanisms similar to dnabased genomes91 thus the functions of recombination in dna viruses may be similar to the hypothesized functions of recombination in other clonal organisms that is recombination in dna viruses may serve to repair dna remove mutations break down linkage disequilibrium and maintain genome integrity92 moreover recombination may allow viruses to capture and use hostencoded genes to manipulate hosts and increase infectivity fig 293 for example the epsteinbarr herpesvirus likely acquired via recombination a homolog of human interleukin10 called brcfi brcfi inhibits the synthesis of antiviral cytokines and stimulates the production of b cells in which the virus replicates94
 in contrast to dna virus recombination rna virus recombination mainly occurs through a different mechanism termed copychoice recombination although some rna virus recombination can occur through nonreplicative mechanisms95 96 97 in copychoice recombination an rnadependent rna polymerase molecule switches from one template rna molecule to another during the process of genome replication fig 2 if the two templates contain divergent genetic information these differences can be recombined into the same rna molecule recombination frequency varies widely among the rna viruses this variation in recombination frequency may reflect the diverse nature of rna genomes rna virus genomes may consist of ssrna negativesense singlestranded rna ssrna or doublestranded rna dsrna recombination is rare in ssrna viruses95 but frequent in retroviruses particularly in hiv where recombination rates can exceed mutation rates98 recombination frequencies in the ssrna viruses are mixed some groups show high recombination rates eg picornaviridae while in others recombination is rare or nonexistent eg some flaviviridae and leviviridae84
 some of these differences may derive from mechanistic constraints on recombination for example ssrna viruses are often bound in ribonucleoprotein complexes which limits opportunities for hybridization between complementary sequences encapsidation of dsrna viruses in nucleocapsids during genome replication prohibits recombination however in other cases the rarity of recombination may have more to do virus and host life history for example recombination has not been observed among the tickborne flaviviruses ticks usually feed once during each life history stage as larva nymph and adult therefore the likelihood of an infected tick feeding on a host infected by a different virus strain is low since recombination requires coinfection of the same host by multiple virus strains the rarity of tick coinfection may explain the failure to detect recombination among the tickborne flaviviruses99
 virus recombination has been shown to facilitate virus emergence88 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 a recombination event may provide a host receptor gene with a new genetic background providing the recombinant virus with the ability to gain access into a host cell without triggering host active immunity for example the spike glycoprotein host receptor gene of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus an upperrespiratory virus of chickens was replaced by a spike gene from an unknown source101 the chimeric virus gained the ability to infect and cause disease in turkeys but as an enteric not respiratory virus moreover this new virus now called turkey coronavirus no longer possessed the ability to infect chickens a good case study of recombinationfacilitated emergence is provided by the geminiviruses a large group of vectortransmitted viruses infecting plants geminiviruses are unique in the virus world by virtue of encapsidating their 3kb singlestranded dna genome in two incomplete icosahedra to form a twinned particle110 most geminiviruses with the exception of the bipartititegenomed begomoviruses are monopartite these viruses have been implicated in a number of devastating plant diseases including maize streak cassava mosaic cotton leaf curl and tomato yellow leaf curl diseases104 105 106 107 108 109 111 112
 interspecies recombination rates among the geminiviruses are among the highest of all viruses104 106 113 some of these recombination events have given rise to destructive new variants for example in 1988 an extremely virulent form of mosaic virus appeared in uganda destroying crops of the staple food cassava and causing food shortages and famine the new pathogen spread from its source at a rate of 2025 kmyear114 the uganda variant eacmvug2 as it was called was shown to be a recombinant of african cassava mosaic virus acmv and east african cassava mosaic virus eacmv which despite their similar names are not closely related105 114 specifically the eacmvug2 strain was generated when the eacmv strain acquired a fragment of the acmv coat protein given the role of geminivirus coat proteins in intraplant movement and betweenplant vector transmission it should not come as a surprise that the protein is linked to an emergence episode115 similar recombinationmediated emergence events may have occurred in other geminiviruses including eacmv emergence in cameroon116 tomato yellow leaf curl emergence in spain and the mediterranean basin108 117 118 cotton leaf curl virus in pakistan107 119 and sugarcane yellow leaf virus in hawaii120
 the frequency of recombination among the geminiviruses may be due to its significant role in virus biology geminivirus genomes are replicated using recombinationdependent mechanisms121 122 recombination may also be a mechanism for dna mutation repair123 despite this recombination may play a role in the generation of virus genetic diversity and the facilitation of host shifts104 106 112 117 124 125 126 127 in fact there is considerable evidence that recombination in the geminiviruses occurs at specific locations in the genome termed hotspots108 113 118 128 129 130 many of these hotspots tend to preserve gene integrity because the break points are found in intergenic regions131 by contrast gene regions such as that encoding the coat protein cp are recombination coldspots132 one common recombination hotspot in geminiviruses is located at the coat proteinsmall intergenic region cpsir interface129 130 133 134 it is plausible that the genome architecture of geminiviruses has been selected to expedite the swapping of the coat protein module among different virus strains thus facilitating host switching reassortment only occurs in segmented or multipartite viruses when two or more segmented viruses infect the same cell their replicated segments can be packaged into procapsids regardless of the parent of origin producing viruses with a mixture of segments acquired from both parents fig 2100 135 136 alternatively such as in the multipartite viruses each genome segment is independently packaged into a separate virus particle but all particles are required for successful host infection137 reassortment is common in some viruses including the reoviruses eg rotavirus138 orthomyxoviruses eg influenza virus139 140 141 bunyaviruses eg hantavirus142 143 144 and bromoviruses eg cucumber mosaic virus145 146 it may be that reassortment fulfills a similar role to recombination by generating genetic diversity and facilitating host shifts perhaps the most famous case of reassortment leading to the expansion of virus host range comes from the 2009 iav h1n1 pandemic this virus is believed to have originated from a triplereassortment event in 1998 where iav segments from birds swine and humans were combined into one h3n2 iav which circulated in swine147 148 149 this virus contained nucleoprotein np matrix protein m and nonstructural protein ns segments from a swine influenza strain hemagglutinin h3 neuramidase n2 and polymerase subunit pb1 segments from the seasonal human influenza strain and polymerase subunits pb2 pa from an avian influenza strain147 subsequently this virus reassorted with and acquired hemagglutinin h1 and neuramidase n1 segments from classical swine influenza147 150 151 in 2009 this h1n1 swine strain reassorted with an avianderived h1n1 swine strain from europe acquired the m and n1 segments and subsequently shifted hosts and emerged in human populations fig 3 by the time the pandemic subsided the world health organization reported 18631 laboratoryconfirmed deaths but studies suggest the total death toll was 10fold higher152
 a virus can be said to occupy a position on an adaptive landscape corresponding to its host an adaptive landscape is defined as a network of genotypes connected by mutational paths153 154 this network of genotypes is visualized as a threedimensional topology of peaks and valleys corresponding to the fitness values of the associated genotypes the relevance of adaptive landscapes for virus emergence stems from the fact that most emergence events require a virus to significantly increase its fitness on the novel host such that betweenhost transmission can be sustained when a virus emerges in a new host it transitions to a new adaptive landscape unlike the landscape corresponding to its previous host it is exceedingly unlikely that the emerging virus is preadapted to the new host thus the virus would need to ascend a new fitness peak in order to fully emerge in the novel host an example of the challenges a virus faces when emerging on a novel host comes from the bacteriophage 6 one or two mutations allow the bacteriophage 6 to infect a novel host pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes however the phages absolute fitness on the new host is approximately an order of magnitude lower than its fitness on the original host fig 474 78 moreover each mutation incurred up to a 10 reduction in absolute fitness in the original host pseudomonas phaseolicola fig 478 in order to increase their fitness on p pseudoalcaligenes to a level comparable to the original host these 6 mutants need to navigate a new adaptive landscape of unpredictable topology before going extinct when a virus mutates to a genotype that allows infection of a novel host the exact topology of the adaptive landscape on the new host will depend on the fitness values of genotypes adjacent to this new position in order to ascend a fitnesspeak host from its current position on the landscape the mutant virus needs to navigate an adaptive trajectory that passes through these intervening genotypes several adaptive landscape characteristics can affect a viruss ability to ascend a new fitness peak including the genetic distance from the present location to the genotype representing the new fitness peak any interactions between mutations along this adaptive trajectory and the ruggedness of the adaptive landscape genetic distance refers to the number of mutations separating any two genotypes on an adaptive landscape there are at least two factors limiting the likelihood of traversing greater distances in adaptive trajectories first since the probabilities of acquiring specific mutations are additive the greater the genetic distance between two genotypes the lower the probability that the virus can navigate from one to the other assuming no recombination and equal probabilities of mutations across all loci the probability p of acquiring multiple mutations in the same lineage is un where u is the per generation mutation rate and n is the number of mutations that need to be acquired therefore if a virus with a mutation rate of 106 needs to acquire five mutations in order to fully emerge on a novel host then the probability of acquiring all five mutations in the same lineage is 1030 by comparison the probability of a coin coming up heads in 99 consecutive coin flips is 3  1030 this example clearly illustrates that these five mutations would need to be acquired sequentially rather than simultaneously which brings about a second problem if mutations are acquired sequentially many mutational trajectories may not be accessible while the five mutations may have high fitness together other intermediate combinations would not necessarily have higher fitness than the starting genotype in fact they could have lower fitness than the starting genotype in this situation a virus would need to cross a fitness valley or find an alternative path to reach the fitness peak what this means is that mutations may have to be acquired in a specific order which further reduces the probability of traversing the intervening genetic distance experiments exploring mutational trajectories have seldom been performed but one example comes from the acquisition of lactamase resistance in escherichia coli five point mutations provide to e coli a high degree of lactamase resistance in principle there are five or 120 possible mutational trajectories weinreich et al showed that 102 of 120 trajectories were inaccessible to natural selection and many of the remaining were unlikely to occur155 thus it was demonstrated that the acquisition of lactamase resistance in e coli could only occur via a limited number of mutational paths the specific order in which mutations need to be acquired is a function of epistasis and pleiotropy pleiotropy refers to situations where mutations in a single gene affect multiple traits a mutation that increases fitness in one context may simultaneously reduce fitness in a different context a phenomenon termed antagonistic pleiotropy an example of antagonistic pleiotropy was introduced earlier in this paper when i described how bacteriophage 6 mutations permitting infection of a novel host decreased fitness in the original host see also fig 478 while the prevalence and magnitude of antagonistic pleiotropy in viruses have been largely unexplored antagonistic pleiotropy may make some mutational trajectories nonviable because mutations along that trajectory may severely reduce fitness in some contexts the compactness multifunctionality and lack of redundancy characteristic of virus genomes is expected to make antagonistic pleiotropy a frequent consequence of mutation156 high frequencies of antagonistic pleiotropic effects among viral mutations will limit adaptive evolution in viruses infecting novel hosts epistasis is the phenomenon where the fitness effects of a mutation depend on the genetic background in which it occurs sign epistasis refers to a specific class of epistatic interactions where the fitness effect of a mutation is beneficial in some backgrounds but deleterious in others157 reciprocal sign epistasis occurs when mutations are individually deleterious but beneficial when they appear together158 in the absence of sign epistasis the adaptive landscape is smooth fitness effects are additive and mutations can be incorporated in any order in the presence of sign epistasis adaptive trajectories are constrained and fewer paths to increased fitness are available157 as reciprocal sign epistasis increases the adaptive landscape becomes more rugged and it becomes increasingly difficult to ascend the highest fitness peak without being trapped on local maxima158 experimental studies have shown that epistasis is pervasive among viruses159 160 161 162 the prevalence of epistasis particularly reciprocal sign epistasis restricts virus adaptive evolution by limiting accessible evolutionary trajectories and by making it more difficult for viruses to ascend global fitness maxima an example of the limiting effects of epistasis comes from chikv which exploits the vector aedes aegypti to facilitate its own transmission a single nucleotide substitution e1a226v allows chikv to infect aedes albopictus but despite the high abundance of ae albopictus in southeast asia chikv has never become established in this vector in this region163 the failure of the asian chikv lineage to exploit ae albopictus as a vector can be attributed to a negative epistatic interaction between the e1a226v mutation and a threonine residue at position e198164 another chikv lineage the eastcentralsouth african genotype ecsa has alanine at position e198 which has no negative epistatic interaction with e1226v in fact the e1t98a substitution generated a nearly 100fold increase in infectivity of ae albopictus by e1226v thus this ecsa lineage was able to acquire the a226v mutation adapt to ae albopictus and invade the southeast asia niche164 since ae albopictus has a broader range than ae aegypti in temperate zones165 this lineage switch could lead to the expansion of chikv into new regions together epistasis pleiotropy and genetic distance may help explain why despite the ease of acquiring host rangeexpanding mutations pandemic emerging viruses are relatively rare these features of adaptive landscapes may explain why some viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus sars fail to emerge in novel host populations in 2002 an outbreak of sars in guangdong china eventually infected thousands of people in southeast asia and north america however relatively low fitness of sars basic reproductive number r
0  16 a high degree of host population heterogeneity in transmission potential k and the rapid mobilization of containment procedures led to the eradication of the outbreak by late 2003166 the implication here is that sars was unable to effectively navigate the adaptive trajectory required to increase its basic reproductive number and cause a wider outbreak rugged adaptive landscapes associated with host switches may make host adaptation too difficult to achieve in the light of the other ecological and environmental constraints on virus reproduction and transmission the ability of organisms to navigate adaptive trajectories is referred to as evolvability evolvability is defined as the capacity of a population to increase its fitness over time in response to changes in the environment5 167 components of evolvability include high mutation rates high levels of standing genetic variation large population sizes facility for genetic rearrangements modular genomes and short generation times all of which are characteristic of viruses5 167 since evolvability can be expressed as an organisms speed in responding to environmental change or more formally an organisms nonsynonymous substitution rate168 viruses are exceptionally evolvable virus nucleotide substitution rates estimated through phylogenetic analyses typically range between 102 and 105 substitutions per site per year169 170 although there is considerable variation in substitution rates171
 viruses and their genomes show many signs of having been selected for increased evolvability and this may be a consequence of the ecological demands placed on viruses to change rapidly high mutation rates and rapid adaptation were cited as the primary factors driving the emergence of parvovirus in canines172 in hiv the envelope env gene fixed adaptive mutations on average every 33 months or every 25 viral generations which was the fastest adaptive rate ever recorded173 this exceptionally fast rate of evolution is testament not only to hivs evolvability which facilitates evolutionary change but also to the strength of selection imposed by the human immune system which necessitates evolutionary change the capacity for rapid evolution makes viruses especially treacherous as they can quickly escape host immunity host resistance and antiviral treatment and can rapidly adapt to increase their fitness on novel hosts this feature of virus evolution is especially prominent in withinhost hiv evolution where virus phylogenies show a ladderlike structure over time here successive waves of virus genotypes expand and contract in response to hostimposed diversifying selection particularly in the envelope env gene174 these phylogenies dramatically contrast with betweenhost hiv evolution which show more branched distributions as different lineages survive and differentiate over time174
 high viral mutation rates however may be a doubleedged sword while facilitating the acquisition of beneficial mutations the high frequency of deleterious mutations may sandbag virus populations and slow adaptive evolution175 176 the effects of mutation load are more pronounced in small populations or when populations pass through bottlenecks177 178 by nature viruses experience severe bottlenecks during betweenhost transmission only a tiny fraction of a virus populations withinhost growth is expected to successfully encounter a new host these bottlenecks can result in a loss of genetic diversity mutation accumulation and fitness losses for example in an evolutionary study of the potyvirus tobacco etch virus strong bottlenecks imposed on serially passaged virus populations produced fitness losses of 5 per passage179
 since the number of viruses transmitted between hosts is proportional to its withinhost growth viruses that grow poorly within a host have a lower probability of being transmitted this point is especially pertinent for emerging viruses because they are expected to be poorly adapted to novel hosts16 because emerging viruses are often poorly adapted withinhost replication is reduced and correspondingly the number of viruses released from the host is also reduced this has two consequences first the number of viruses in transmission vehicles eg sneeze droplets fomites etc is decreased reducing the chance that they will be picked up by another host second if a new host is encountered the number of particles entering the host is also decreased reducing the probability that the virus can establish itself in that host without being eliminated by the immune system inactivated or washed out of the organism in fact these effects are likely compounded during each transmission event in a vicious cycle and likely give rise to stuttering transmission chains that eventually go extinct180 181 in this sense the population dynamics of preemerged viruses can be described by the sourcesink paradigm of ecology which will be discussed in greater detail later in this paper an enduring paradox in evolutionary biology is the harm done to hosts by the parasites that depend on them for survival the impairment andor death of a host would appear to be disadvantageous to the parasite that depends on it for growth and transmission early theory suggesting that viruses evolve to a benign coexistence with hosts has matured into theory emphasizing the benefits and costs of virulence tradeoffs for virus transmission in brief every virus has an optimal virulence that maximizes betweenhost transmission increases or decreases in virulence will evolve insofar as they also increase virus transmission182 with respect to virus emergence the relevance of virulence evolution largely stems from the supposed mismatch between virus virulence in a novel host and its optimal virulence in that host since an emerging virus has by definition not adapted to its host it is unlikely that its virulence in that host is optimal we can speculate that many virus spillover events do not progress to fullblown emergence because of lessthanoptimal virus virulence for example ebola virus ebov is remarkable for its extreme virulence in humans mortality rates due to ebov are approximately 50183 given that ebov is spread through direct contact with infected individuals ebovs excessive virulence curtails the duration of infectivity and persontoperson contact rates thus reducing the transmission potential of the virus this reduction in transmission may be the reason why ebov outbreaks are so far spatially limited to certain regions of africa however ebov outbreaks have been trending upward in both numbers of individuals infected and area affected the most recent outbreak in west africa resulted in 25000 cases of infection and 10000 deaths across three nations which exceeds the totals for all previous ebov outbreaks combined184 reports examining ebov evolution during the latest outbreak caution that the virus might eventually evolve greater transmission and fully emerge in human populations185 186
 excessive virulence is not the only reason why a virus may fail to emerge an insufficiently virulent virus may suffer the same fate because withinhost growth is not high enough to effect transmission to a new host in addition the weakly virulent virus may lose in direct competition for resources with a more virulent genotype an example of the competitive replacement of a weakly virulent virus by a more virulent genotype comes from the dengue virus serotype 3 denv3 before 1989 denv3 was endemic to the indian subcontinent but caused mild or no disease in humans187 after 1989 the virulence of denv3 changed and caused outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever a severe often fatal form of the disease messer et al showed that the sudden onset of dengue hemorrhagic fever was caused by the competitive displacement of group a denv3 strain by group b denv3 strain in the indian subcontinent187 subsequent work showed that the group b denv3 strain infects and disseminates in ae aegypti more efficiently than the group a denv3 strain suggesting that the invasive strain is transmitted more effectively188
 in a sourcesink scenario a primary host population the source contributes virus migrants to a secondary host population the sink where the virus is poorly adapted74 189 190 by definition populations existing in sinks have a negative population growth rate thus they are expected to go extinct in the absence of migration75 the influx of migrants can provide genetic diversity and contribute to densitydependent growth in the sink population allowing the acquisition and fixation of mutations increasing fitness in the secondary host75 eventually fitness gains are such that the virus is able to escape the sink by achieving positive population growth even in the absence of migration189 190
 the difficulties encountered in the evolutionary transition required to turn an ecological sink into a source are probably the strongest constraining factors in virus emergence in a sink a virus needs to increase in fitness fast enough to counteract the relentless downward pressure imposed by negative population growth the synergistic effects of genetic drift and erosion positive densitydependent growth and mutational and migrational meltdown all act to limit the fixation of beneficial alleles178 190 191 192 moreover sink populations are more susceptible to chance fluctuations and demographic stochasticity193 194 leading to broken transmission chains and virus extinction ultimately these factors may help explain the discrepancy between the relative ease with which host rangeexpanding mutations are acquired and the relative lack of pandemically spreading emerging infectious diseases infecting humans one means of evading these difficulties is the possibility that viruses can migrate from sink hosts to source hosts for further amplification and spread to use iavs as an example imagine a mutant iav in waterfowl containing the ability to bind both avian and human sialic acids despite being competitively inferior to other iav genotypes this mutant does not necessarily go extinct in waterfowl in fact it is common for multiple competing isogenic variants of similar relative fitnesses to circulate in an adapting asexual population195 196 this mutant iav may epidemically spread through a waterfowl population with occasional spillover into human populations the mutant virus may initially be a poor fit in humans but able to replicate in immunocompromised individuals for example while humantohuman transmission is not observed at this point the high affinity for avian receptors may lead to humantowaterfowl transmission of iav genotypes that have increased infectivereplicative ability in humans in this manner a broad host range iav is amplified by repeated transmission between humans and waterfowl until sustained transmission between humans is achieved though it is recognized that host populations must overlap in order for virus emergence to take place virus host alternation has seldom been explored outside of a few laboratory and theoretical studies however these studies show that contrary to the prevailing perception natural selection can simultaneously improve virus fitness on multiple different hosts197 198 199 200 in the vernacular of evolutionary ecology there seem to be few barriers to evolving to be a host generalist and viruses are not necessarily constrained to specialize on certain hosts the broader issue of parasite generalismspecialism has a long and complicated history201 202 commonly it was believed that adaptation to a specific host necessitated a reduction in fitness in other hosts due to betweenhost tradeoffs ie antagonistic pleiotropy such betweenhost tradeoffs can and do occur203 204 but the frequency of observing no tradeoffs has caused the question to be inverted to ask why broad host range viruses are not more common205 206 it may be that while adaptation to multiple hosts is possible ecological circumstances usually promote virus adaptation to a single host type in other words host specialization is caused by the absence of selection in favor of maintaining host generalism if there are no alternative hosts for a virus in a particular habitat then the virus will adapt to the currently available host ie specialize during the process of adaptation to a single host mutations are fixed that are either beneficial or neutral to the present host but are deleterious to the alternate host once host specialization has begun linkage between loci affecting host preference and performance on that host may make it increasingly difficult to reverse direction and reevolve broad host ranges by contrast if multiple hosts are available then a virus may adapt to both hosts simultaneously in the absence of fitnessreducing tradeoffs it is likely that in most emergence situations antagonistic pleiotropy is not a factor and alternating exposure to multiple hosts can lead to increased virus fitness on both hosts when host ecology changes it may result in increased contact between primary and secondary host species providing opportunities for multihost evolution in humans relevant ecological changes include altered local demographics changing travel or immigration patterns intensified agricultural practices changing landuse patterns and encroachment into wildlife habitat climate change in human occupied areas and range expansion of virus vectors or reservoirs208 the reciprocal transmission of viruses following increased interspecies contact rates may select for virus variants with increased fitness in one or both species an interesting and open question is how the relative sizes and dynamics of the two host populations affect emergence probabilities host utilization host range virus life history transmission routes and kindred subjects are all aspects of virus ecology that is interactions between viruses and the biotic and abiotic environment environmental heterogeneity across space and time affects the incidence of disease in vectors and reservoir hosts and can lead to emergence events an illustrative example comes from outbreaks of an arbovirusbluetongue virus btvamong ruminants in europe in its native range btv is vectored by culicoides imicola midges209 in recent years a subsaharan strain of the virus expanded northward from africa first to southern and eastern europe and then into northern and western europe leading to widespread mortality among livestock209 changes in climate have been implicated as a major driver in the expansion of btvs range210 the most compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis is the observation of btv and c imicola in regions that have warmed the most since the 1990s but not in regions that stayed cool during this period210
 the northward shift in btvs range likely stemmed from the expansion of the africanasian vector c imicola northward211 where it came into contact with indigenous european culicoides species209 212 213 btv then switched vectors from c imicola midges to c obsoletus and c pulicaris midges adapted to the cooler wetter climes of northern europe212 213 the overlapping culicoides populations may have allowed btv to increase its infection competence in the latter vectors213
 environmental variables of elevation temperature and rainfall had the biggest impact on btv spread because they affected vector abundance and host availability214 215 temperature in particular affected the magnitude of btvs basic reproductive number r
0 a measure of the transmission potential of a disease216
r
0 was maximal when temperatures ranged from 20 to 25c but declined outside that range214 the connection likely stems from the fact that culicoides midges show increased activity reproduction and feeding behavior at higher temperatures209 217 in addition milder winter temperatures promote midge overwinter survival and are crucial for the maintenance of btv presence in any particular region218
 in the spring of 1993 an unknown pathogen infecting humans appeared in the southwestern united states resulting in death in more than 40 of cases219 the causative agent was soon identified as a previously unknown hantavirus bunyaviridae subsequently named sin nombre virus snv220 snvs reservoir host was subsequently identified as the deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus a common inhabitant of the deserts and dwellings of the southwest221
peromyscus population densities were shown to have increased threefold to 20fold between 1992 and 1993 the peromyscus population surge was linked to the el niosouthern oscillation event of 1992 which resulted in increased temperatures and precipitation in the region during the fall winter and spring of 19921993219 the outcome was a trophic cascade the increased precipitation recharged the thirsty soil and increased primary production more plants led to increased rodent forage such as seeds berries nuts and insects improved forage augmented rodent survival and reproductive output greater rodent densities led to increased contact rates among rodents and pushed them to their range margins such as human dwellings the higher rodent densities likely facilitated increased snv infection rates triggering spillover infections in consanguineous human populations219
 rodent populations in the area subsequently crashed reaching a nadir during the la nia event a dry and cold period in the spring of 1996219 human snv infections diminished as well219 in 19971998 another el nio episode appeared and rodent populations resurged219 however fewer human snv infections were reported in 1998 than in 1993219 curiously human cases doubled the following year in 1999219 while rodent densities in 1999 were lower than in 1998 the density of snvinfected rodents in 1999 was an order of magnitude higher than at any other time during this study219 this pattern was repeated in subsequent el nio events222 the precise causes of this timelagged infection prevalence are unclear but it is hypothesized that prevalence of infection in peromyscus populations is proportional to the population densities reached during the previous reproductive season223
 the greatest snv risk to humans therefore occurs 23 years following the increased precipitation event219 however strictly speaking snv has not yet fully emerged according to the threestep process established earlier in this paper sustained humantohuman transmission has not yet been observed224 in fact persontoperson transmission of hantaviruses has been documented only for the andes virus225 given that snv is mainly transmitted to humans by exposure to rodent urine and feces human sanitary habits may reduce the opportunities for humantohuman transmission of snv while the specific mechanism of andes virus humantohuman transmission has not been established some evidence suggests that close exposure among sex partners and family members may be responsible226 it stands to reason that hantaviruses may be optimized for indirect transmission but can gain the ability to be spread by bodily contact as the andes virus may have done if a hantavirus such as snv gains the ability to spread via direct human contact the prospects for emergence are troublesome the specific obstacles to hantavirus humantohuman transmission urgently need to be determined in order to assess the likelihood that hantaviruses can eventually fully emerge in human populations the greater lesson from these studies is that climatic disruption alters species ranges and demographics and can have unforeseen consequences for virus dynamics it is plausible that other viruses that episodically appear in human populations eg ebov may be driven by asyet unknown environmental and ecological changes but many virus outbreaks are not well documented especially in underdeveloped countries particularly worrisome is the encroachment of tropical climates in typically temperate areas along with the spread of vectors and reservoirs that are climate limited in their distributions animal and human populations in temperate regions are fertile ground for virus emergence and spread virus emergence poses tremendous challenges to human society and ecological and environmental trends suggest that the problem will get worse urbanization globalization encroachment of wildlife habitat intensified agricultural practices and climatedriven range shifts will tend to increase the incidence and spread of infectious viruses exhortations in favor of more stringent epidemiological surveillance improved predictive modeling enhanced diagnostic tools increased vaccination and better public health infrastructure are common while these approaches are valuable their longterm economic and logistic feasibility as primary means to interdict emerging viruses is questionable there are simply too many potential emerging viruses and containment measures are too porous more than 219 human pathogenic viruses have been described227 if similar numbers exist for each mammalian species we can liberally estimate roughly 320000 viruses among the 5500 known mammals228 this figure suggests that enormous numbers of viruses are at least superficially similar enough to infect our phylogenetic relatives and thus are likely suspects for potential emergence events add the viruses of other animals and potential pathogens may number in the millions simply identifying these viruses would cost billions228 actively tracking their frequencies and evolutionary trajectories is a daunting perhaps impossible task if surveillance of the viruses of economically important animals and plants are included it is clear from these rough numbers that wholesale virus surveillance to prevent new viruses from entering new host populations will never be feasible while a more limited triage approach may be possible the ability of viruses to escape interdiction and spread globally eg 2009 iav h1n1 does not inspire much confidence that this approach will generally work moreover a surveillance approach does not account for laboratory biocontainment failures or even the possibility of deliberately engineered and released pathogenic viruses the ease of dna synthesis genome sequencing and editing and cell culture have frightening implications in the hands of statesponsored actors or terrorist organizations can we rule out that a dedicated research effort with sufficient funds and expertise could produce a highly virulent and transmissible synthetic virus one priority should be the development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs while the one bugone drug approach has many successes it is not well suited to countering new emerging viruses as it suffers from a closing the barn door after horse has bolted problem because of the time required to develop and implement a new treatment regime broadspectrum antivirals will allow rapid treatment of newly infected individuals before the pathogenic agent is identified and epidemiologically characterized the highly conserved nature of many virus structures and functions may aid the discovery of broadspectrum antiviral agents broadspectrum drugs targeting shared virus mechanisms such as membrane fusion229 capsid assembly230 receptor binding231 metal nanoparticles232 transcription and translation have already been developed233 from an evolutionary perspective antiviral drug resistance will always be an issue but they can be the knockout punch that interdicts an emerging virus before it goes pandemic another promising approach is to find improved means of training immune systems to broadly recognize and defend against pathogenic viruses leblanc et al developed the vaxcelerate platform to generate selfassembling vaccines against specific pathogen targets in less than 120 days234 other efforts rely on computational and bioinformatic tools to identify highly conserved segments of antigenic genes or proteins and their binding epitopes eg conservatrix epimatrix235 welldeveloped platforms can be modified for speedy use against novel viruses236
 since the majority of emerging viruses are arthropodborne special attention should be paid to developing genedriven mechanisms to eliminate the most common vectors of emerging pathogens the development of crisprcas genome editing techniques has permitted the introduction of genedrive mechanisms into insect vectors that disrupt reproduction237 for example hammond et al identified in the malaria vector anopheles gambiae three genes that when disrupted confer recessive female sterility238
crisprcas9 genedrive constructs designed to target and edit each gene were introduced into a gambiae the drive was transmitted to offspring at rates ranging from 914 to 996238 the drive successfully induced infertility in homozygous mutant females while males and heterozygous females showed normal fertility which is necessary for the drive system to spread within the population fig 5 while it is unlikely that gene drives can result in vector extinction because of the evolution of genedrive resistance such gene drives could suppress vector populations below levels required for sustained virus transmission breaking epidemics and preventing further virus dissemination finally education should factor into any plan to combat emerging infectious viruses dispensing knowledge on the importance of avoiding risky behaviors eg contact with animals eliminating vectors encouraging the use of antimicrobial surfaces eg copper preventing virus transmission eg limiting travel using face masks controlling the spread of invasive animals and plants sustaining wildlife habitat and ameliorating climate change may go a long way to prevent the introduction of dangerous viruses into human populations ultimately this knowledge must come from scientists themselves and is spread through their engagement with the public the author declares no conflicts of interest  interferon lambda modulating immunity in infectious diseases mohammedyaseen syedbasha adrian egli   patients with infectious diseases often show heterogeneous clinical courses with a range of associated morbidities and variable mortality this is dependent on a series of factors covering the complex aspects of hostpathogen interactions 15 ifns play a crucial role in these interactionsdefining the outcome of many viral bacterial fungal and parasitic infections 616 see figure 1 in addition ifns reduce tumor cell proliferation 17 18 and show important immune regulatory functions in autoimmunity 19 20 these broad effects are explained through the induction of hundreds of ifn-stimulated genes isgs 21 three types of ifns have been described which can induce isg expression and add further complexity type i with mainly ifn-s and -s 2226 type ii with only ifn- 27 and type iii with ifn-s 2831 although most cells can induce and release various types of ifns specialized immune cells are the main producers during an inflammatory process the effects induced by single or combined ifns in exposed cells are very heterogeneous and range from differential patterns of isg expression regulation of cell proliferation 18 changes in cell surface molecules such as hla dr 32 to the maturation of monocytes to dendritic cells 33 the effects depend on the plasticity of the various ifns involved including the peak concentrations concentration changes over time binding affinities of ifns to the specific receptors receptor expression potentially induced feedback mechanisms and the target cell type itself 34 four ifn- ligands have been described ifnl14 with each family member having antiviral effects on various viruses within different cell types 28 ifnl13 share high amino acid sequence homologies whereas ifnl4 is more divergent with only 408 amino acid similarity to ifnl3 35 the expression of ifn-s is induced in a broad range of cell types by pattern recognition receptors including toll-like mediated 3641 ku70 21398614 and rig-1-like 24952503 type 2 myeloid dendritic cells have been described as the main producers of ifn- 4248 in mice commonly used as a model organism for infectious disease and immune function only ifnl2 and ifnl3 are functional as ifnl1 and ifnl4 are present as inactive pseudogenes 49 after release ifn- binds to its heterodimeric ifn- receptor ifnlr the ifnlr consists of two subunits -subunit il28ra and -subunit il10rb 35 5053 despite high sequence homologies binding affinities of the different ifn-s to the ifnlr1 differ greatly ifnl1 shows the highest binding affinity to il28ra and ifnl3 the lowest 54 the dimerization of the receptor subunits leads to activation of janus kinase 1 and tyrosine kinase 2 and phosphorylation of stat-1 and -2 which induces the subsequent downstream signaling with the induction of hundreds of isgs 31 see figure 1 ifn- and ifn- both show a complex mechanism of positive and negative feedback loops mainly modulated via the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 31 55 the il10rb subunit is expressed in many cell types 57 whereas the il28ra subunit expression is much more restricted expression of il28ra mrna has been detected in the lung intestine liver tissues immune cells such as b cells neutrophils macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells 28 29 43 5862 human nk cells seem not to express ifnlr 63 whereas mouse nk cells show deficient function in il28r knockout animals 25901316 the effects of ifn- on cells and tissues are often measured in vitro via indirect markers such as downstream expression of isgs or changes in specific cellular phenotypes data on the induction of stat phosphorylation as the most direct measurement of signal induction are still missing for some cell types and tissues the ifnlr expression is regulated via transcription factors 31 and may show variability during an inflammatory process which adds an additional level of complexity primary hepatocytes show relatively low baseline responsiveness to ifn-s yet upon ifn- treatment a marked increase in il28ra mrna levels is observed 64 65 similarly during cytomegalovirus cmv infection of fibroblasts il28ra mrna levels increase by about twofold but protein expression levels remain stable 66 a recent paper by lazear et al suggested that endothelial cells in the bloodbrain barrier may be sensitive to ifn-s reducing permeability to west nile virus in a mouse model 67 understanding which immune cells and subsets are responsive to ifn-s in humans can be experimentally and technically challenging due to low target cell densities and less accessible cell types such as tissue resident cell types in contrast peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs are relatively easy to access in order to explore responses to ifn-s therefore most literature focuses on hepatocytes from liver biopsies and immune cells from the blood the direct impact of ifn-s on t-cells via surface expression of the specific ifnlr is subject to ongoing debate 58 6871 ifn-s may also induce foxp3-expressing regulatory t-cells 72 which may impact a series of immunoregulatory aspects during an infection as part of the inflammatory response several research groups confirm that ifn-s influence the t-helper cell balance which is shifted toward th1 70 71 7376 the th1th2 balance might be important for controlling specific infections such as helminths 6 77 78 in addition the b-cell-driven humoral immune responses are also modulated by the presence of th2 cytokines eg during vaccination we have recently shown that ifnl3 is a key regulator of the influenza virus-specific b-cell proliferation and antibody production 76 the exact mechanism of how th1th2 balancing and b-cell activation is modulated by ifn-s and how this impacts infectious disease outcome has to be explored in more detail in the future a series of snps in ifn- ligand and receptor genes have been described see figure 2 most importantly these snps have been associated with a series of important clinical phenotypes in the context of infectious diseases see table 1 for more details modulation of ifnlr expression may have a great impact on the effects of a particular ifn- ligand and thereby influence the subsequent signaling pathway and the outcome of infectious diseases multiple snps in the gene encoding il28ra have been described 9497 the rs10903035 snp is located within the 3utr of the il28ra mrna sequence suggesting a potential microrna binding site this particular snp was identified as an independent risk factor for ifn- treatment failure against hepatitis c virus hcv 44 98 in addition this snp has been associated with insulin resistance in hivhcv coinfected patients 94 another snp in this gene rs4649203 has been linked to the risk of psoriasis in four independent populations 96 and to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus 97 these observations suggest an important influence of il28ra on infectious and autoimmune diseases expression of ifn- ligands is modulated by snps in both transcription factor binding sites and methylation sites of the promoter region as well as frameshift mutations 99102 the ifn- gene layout is shown in figure 2 the clinical impact of snps in the ifnl34 locus was originally observed in the context of ifn- treatment outcomes in patients with chronic hcv 79 80 87 90 103 snps within this locus are in high linkage disequilibrium eg rs12979860 with ss469415590 103 104 which complicates the exploration of the effects of individual snps therefore the impact of some snps on ifn- expression is still debated most studies have concluded that the minor alleles of snps rs12979860 cttt and rs8099917 tggg are associated with reduced ifnl3 expression during chronic hcv infection observed in liver biopsies 80 105107 serum and pbmcs stimulated with polyic- cmv- and influenza virus 66 76 108 109 however it has also been shown that the tt allele of rs12979860 in hepatocytes expresses higher levels of ifnl1 and ifnl3 110 this minor allele genotype of rs12979860 tt has also been associated with a higher and prolonged isg expression in hcv infection 79 80 87 90 103 111 interestingly the same snp of the ifnl3 gene is associated with a higher isg expression in mothers after childbirth suggesting that postpartum the normalization of physiological control of ifn signaling depends on the ifnl3 genotype 112 although the rs12979860 snps have been specifically associated with ifnl3l4 expression these snps might also affect the expression of the other ifn- genes 80 87 113 the impact of the ss469415590 snp on the expression of ifnl4 is in contrast very well described in the context of a delta-g polymorphism a frameshift mutation generates a gene containing an alternative reading frame which causes ifnl4 to be functionally expressed in about 40 of caucasians 90 an amino acid substitution at residue 70 of ifnl4 p70s decreases the antiviral activity via a reduction in the isg expression levels 111 beside the impact of snps on innate immune signaling via differences in isg expression profiles an important impact on adaptive immune functions has been noted we have shown that ifn- decreases virus-induced b-cell proliferation and antibody secretion in a dose-dependent manner in addition ifn- increases influenza-induced th1 cytokines ifn- il6 whereas influenza-induced th2 cytokines decrease il4 il5 il9 il13 these effects can also be reproduced with specific allelic combinations in particular the tggg allele of rs8099917 shows significantly lower levels of ifn- il2 and il6 secretion in influenza-stimulated pbmcs in an influenza vaccine cohort vaccine recipients with the rs8099917 tggg minor allele showed significantly higher vaccine-induced humoral immune responses 76 similarly in a cohort of children vaccinated against measles the post-vaccine antibody titers were significantly higher in the group with the rs10853727 snp ag and gg minor allele 89 both snps rs8099917 and rs10853727 lie within the ifnl3 promoter region and have been associated with lower ifnl3 expression 76 89 ifns protect cells against viral infections in response every virus has evolved specific ways to counteract ifn signaling and its effects 139143 only a few studies have explored this in the context of ifn-s parainfluenza virus 3 blocks antiviral mediators downstream of the ifnlr signaling by modulation of the stat1 phosphorylation in beas 2b cells a bronchial epithelial cell line 144 dengue virus was recently shown to induce ifnl1 via its non-structural protein ns1 in order to facilitate dendritic cell migration 114 using cell culture-based in vitro models ifn-s have been shown to play a role in controlling viral replication in most studies cultured cells were treated with ifn-s and the impact of viral infection was assessed these studies investigated human 66 and murine cmv 59 dengue virus 114 145 encephalomyocarditis virus 28 29 146 herpes virus type 2 120 hepatitis b virus 115 hcv 37 60 113 115 116 147 hiv 40 117 118 human meta pneumovirus 121 influenza virus 122 148152 lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv 125 norovirus 124 respiratory syncytial virus 128 153 154 sendai virus 155157 and vesicular stomatitis virus 131 158 159 in vivo the complexity of the role of ifn- within tissues and between various immune cells has been explored using an il28ra mouse model leading to the discovery of multiple important aspects of ifn- signaling 122 130 150 a recent study by lin et al demonstrated that the effects of type iii ifns change with increasing age rotavirus was controlled by both type i and iii ifn in suckling mice whereas epithelial cells in particular were responsive in adult mice epithelial cells were responsive only to type iii and not type i ifns suggesting an orchestrated spatial and temporal organization of the ifn- and ifn- responses in the aging murine intestinal tract 160 however there is some controversy regarding the rotavirus data as other researchers have shown that rotavirus is specifically controlled by type iii and not type i ifn 21518880 mahlakoiv et al showed that leukocyte-derived ifn- and epithelial ifn- constitute a compartmentalized mucosal defense system to restrict enteric viral infection in mice the authors concluded that epithelial barriers to ifn- may have evolved to reduce frequent triggering of ifn- and thus reduce exacerbated inflammation 161 a study by baldridge et al showed that antibiotics could prevent the persistence of enteric murine norovirus infection but only in the presence of functional ifn- signaling the il28ra mice showed a high rate of infection despite the administration of antibiotics this may suggest cross talk between the gut microbiota and ifn- signaling in modulating chronic viral infections 162 important synergistic effects in the intestine have been described with il22-inducing ifn- expression in intestinal epithelial cells in a murine rotavirus infection model 163 the role of ifn- during respiratory tract infections has also been explored using the il28ra mouse model the studies so far have concentrated on the classical role of ifns as antiviral cytokines the il28ra mouse displayed a significantly higher burden of disease than wild-type mice during infections with influenza virus and sars coronavirus 122 130 150 one study showed the immunoregulatory function of ifn- in an lcmv model the authors noted that in an acute lcmv infection model the il28ra mouse showed a greater than normal cd4 and cd8 t-cell response compare to the wild type whereas in a chronic lcmv infection model the il28ra mice showed a greater disease burden and a significantly reduced lcmv-specific t-cell response the paper showed that germinal center b-cells were more frequent in peripheral blood in the il28ra mice than wild-type mice however the lcmv-induced memory b-cell response in terms of frequencies and lcmv-specific antibodies was comparable 164 the immunoregulatory actions of ifn-s have been explored in an ovalbumin ova-induced asthma model the il28ra mice showed a clear shift to increased th2 cytokines and a more severe asthma phenotype importantly ige antibodies were also significantly increased 73 in this model the ifnl2 il28a immunoregulatory activity was dependent on lung cd11c dendritic cells to decrease ox40l increase il-12p70 and thereby promote th1 differentiation 73 the potential role in infection-triggered asthma has also been explored in humans 72 126 although these conclusions from mice studies are very important a series of important differences to human effects have also been noted in a human chimeric mouse model using human hepatocytes the response rates of human and mice hepatocytes toward ifn-s were very different specifically in that mouse hepatocytes did not respond to ifn- 56 in addition the expression of ifnlr in immune cells seems to be strikingly different whereas b-cells in humans respond to ifn-s in b-cells from mice there seems to be no direct effect from ifn-s 69 164 studies on the impact of ifn-s in clinical scenarios have been dominated by the strong association of ifnl3l4 snps with spontaneous clearance of hcv and ifn- treatment response 79 80 87 90 103 111 details on this important association have been reviewed in detail elsewhere 165167 the association between ifn- snps and other infectious diseases is far less well explored not many studies have linked the genetic associations with mechanistic immunological assay several studies have explored the association between snps in the ifnl3l4 signaling and cmv replication transplant recipients with the rs8099917 gg allele demonstrate significantly less cmv primary replication this snp has been associated with reduced isg expression upon infection 66 we postulate that this phenomenon has two reasons i significant primary cmv replication is less likely due to a higher baseline isg expression and ii nave cmv-specific t cells from seronegative healthy blood donors show reduced proliferation capacity when pretreated with ifnl3 and stimulated with cmv lysate 66 in contrast the rs368234815 g snp shows a higher risk for cmv retinitis in hiv-infected patients 91 and has been associated in a transplant cohort with an increased risk of cmv replication and disease especially in patients receiving grafts from seropositive donors 92 non-immunosuppressed patients with chronic periodontitis due to herpes virus infection show significant lower ifnl1 levels in gingival fluid compared to a healthy control group without viral replication 168 suggesting a protective effect of ifnl1 on virus replication or cmv-induced antagonism of ifn- expression these results highlight the different roles of ifn-s in acute or chronic infection scenarios and viral reactivation the impact of ifn-s on human t-cell leukemia type-1 virus has also been explored in several independent cohorts the first evidence came from kamihira et al showing that the ifnl3 mrna expression level was significantly higher in htlv-1 mono-infection than htlv-1hcv coinfection in addition the high expression level was associated with the rs8099917 tt snp 169 the impact of the rs8099917 gg snp on the risk of htlv-1 associated myelopathytropical spastic paraparesis tsp has since been confirmed 88 the impact of the rs12979860 snp is more controversial one study on the rs12979860 snp showed that the cttt alleles were more frequent in patients with htlv-1-associated myelopathytsp 81 although this finding was not replicated in two additional studies 170 171 de sa et al reported that the major alleles of ifnl3 snps rs12979860 cc and rs8099917 tt are associated with a shift in the th1th2 immune response toward a th1 response 172 the andes virus causes a hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in a cohort of andes virus-infected patients the minor alleles of rs12979860 and rs8099917 tt and gg were linked to milder disease compared to ctcc and tgtt 86 the impact of the ifn- signaling on humoral immune function has been described in two vaccine cohorts immunosuppressed patients vaccinated against influenza 76 and healthy children vaccinated against measles 89 these important observations hold promise for personalized vaccine strategies and adjuvant development 4 the cytokine microenvironment of a tissue may have an impact on the rate at which a particular infectious bacterium can colonize and also influence the rate of infections planet et al showed that ifn-s might lead to important changes in the local microbiota during influenza infection in a mouse model of influenza infection the authors observed that mice with functional il28 signaling showed more profound changes in their respiratory microbiota and subsequent higher colonization rates with staphylococcus aureus compared to il28ra mice 173 these important findings should be confirmed in a human cohort as s aureus is an important source of bacterial superinfection after an influenza infection in addition microbiota changes upon common clinical scenarios such as antibiotic treatment may be modulated by ifn-s and their genotypes bacteria including m tuberculosis induce ifn- and ifn- however little is known about the effects of ifn-s in epithelial immunity gram-positive bacteria such as s aureus staphylococcus epidermidis enterococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes induce ifn-s whereas salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium shigella flexneri and chlamydia trachomatis do not substantially induce ifn-s in intestinal and placental cell lines 134 others have reported that s enterica serovar typhumurium can induce ifn-s in human dcs 137 ifn- gene expression can be increased within dcs upon stimulation with bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide in particular during m tuberculosis infection ifn- plays an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis 12 174 m tuberculosis in a549 lung epithelial cells stimulates expression of ifn-s in addition the ifnl2 concentration in sputum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis is significantly higher than that in the sputum of healthy controls 135 although the impact of ifn-s has not been explored in more detail the cross talk between ifn- and ifn-s may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of m tuberculosis the modulation of th1th2 toward th1 may be of additional importance neutrophil functions are crucial in clearing bacterial infections and wound repair 175 176 a major target of the effects of ifn-s may be neutrophils 62 177 a study by blazek et al showed that in a collagen-induced arthritis model ifnl1 showed anti-inflammatory function by reducing the numbers of il17-producing th17 cells and the recruitment of il-1b expressing neutrophils which is important to amplify the inflammatory process 62 similar effects on neutrophil recruitment to the lung have been observed in an ova-based asthma mouse model 73 although somewhat speculative this may suggest an important modulatory function of ifn-s via neutrophil recruitment toward sites of bacterial infection so far only one study has linked snps in genes involved in the ifn- signaling pathway with an increased risk of bacterial infections xiao et al showed that snp rs10903035 with g allele in the il28ra was associated with significantly less frequent urinary tract infection 178 the role of ifn-s in parasitic and fungal disease has not yet been explored although somewhat speculative helminth infections in particular might be regulated by snps in the ifn- system considering the profound evidence on the importance of th1th2 balance 6 77 78 furthermore for parasite infections of the liver such as plasmodium spp there is important evidence on the importance of the ifn- signaling 13 179182 due the regulatory interactions of ifn- and ifn- and the clinical importance of relevant snps 31 it is not unreasonable to postulate an impact ifn-s and their modulation via snps are increasingly recognized as important players in a broad range of infectious diseases although the literature is still dominated by reports on hcv work especially in mouse models has pointed out the important role in viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections bacterial colonization and bacterial infections may also be modulated by ifn-s the important diversity in ifns and the large number of snps adds a difficult-to-address layer of complexity therefore further research on ifn-s outside the hcv field is required to understand their roles and diagnostic and therapeutic potential most importantly predictions of risks associated with infectious diseases have to be confirmed in independent cohorts to allow personalized medicine strategies both the authors ae and ms have significantly contributed by writing the manuscript and designing the graphs the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest  molecular characterization of rotavirus isolated from alpaca vicugna pacos crias with diarrhea in the andean region of cusco peru antonio garmendia e wellington lopez nastassja ortega marycris chamorro j   alpacas vicugna pacos are economically important south american camelid sacs species raised for fiber and food by a significant proportion of dwellers of the peruvian andes numerous diseases have been recognized in these species and a variety of factors are involved in disease causation including nutrition genetics and climate infectious pathogens are a major cause of morbidity reproductive failure and mortality in sacs leading to production losses moro 1971 fernandez baca 1975 ramirez et al 1980 kapil et al 2009 sharpe et al 2009 among infectious agents viruses that are prevalent in other domestic species are transmitted to llamas and alpacas thedford and johnson 1989 mattson 1994 whitehead and bedenice 2009 however their impact in morbidity and mortality remain unclear therefore establishing causal relationships and measuring impact are of utmost importance to implement appropriate and effective control measures evidence of exposure and morbidity caused by pathogens originated in other domestic species has been documented in alpacas and llamas thus there is serologic and immunochemical evidence of exposure to bovine respiratory enteric and systemic viruses rivera et al 1987 rosadio et al 1993 puntel 1997 puntel et al 1999 leoni et al 2001 victorio et al 2004 cabello

al 2013 the negative effects of enteric disease in alpaca production are significant and indicate a need for further investigation to establish more precisely roles and impact of enteric pathogens in morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhea while there is evidence of specific antibodies to rotavirus chang-say et al 1985 rivera et al 1987 and rotaviral antigens in alpaca crias with diarrhea morales et al 2007 lopez et al 2011 there has not been reports of actual rotavirus isolation from the affected animals the isolation and molecular characterization reported here further confirm an association of rotavirus with acute diarrhea in alpaca crias the alpaca herd of la raya research center universidad nacional de san antonio abad del cusco usaac in the province of canchis department of cusco was used for investigation in this study la raya is located in an area of intensive alpaca production fecal samples collected from crias with acute diarrhea in the herd screened in an earlier study lopez et al 2011 for rotaviral antigen using an immunochromatrographic icg kit kindly provided by the manufacturers vetall laboratories koyang-ku gyeonggi-do south korea and stored at 80 c were used two fecal samples positive for rotaviral antigen by icg were further processed for virus isolation the isolates were identified by rt-pcr rna was extracted with trizol reagent from cell cultures showing cpe and from non-inoculated cell controls as recommended by the manufacturer invitrogen carlsbad ca the rna mixed with equal volumes of dmso was heated at 97 c for 5 min cooled down to 4 c and then kept in ice until the reverse transcription rt reaction was conducted the rt reaction was carried out using an iscript cdna kit as instructed biorad hercules ca briefly reaction mixtures

a control samples extracted and amplified under identical methods were negative furthermore the two alpaca isolates also tested positive in vp6-specific rt pcrs yielding amplicons of similar electrophoretic migration in agarose as those of the nvsl brv positive control fig 1b these molecular data identified the two virus isolates as group a rotaviruses molecular g typing yielded positive reactions and identified both isolates as type g3 and p typing identified alrvakayraper3368-10 as p11 while for yet unknown reasons p typing of alrvakayraper3386-10 was inconclusive despite of several attempts fig 1c molecular g and p typing of the isolates identified alrvakayraper3368-10 as g3p11 and isolate alrvakayraper3386-10 while was also g3 positive p typing remained elusive the reasons of the inconclusive p typing for the latter are not understood at this juncture as the tests were repeated several times with different samples with similar results nevertheless the isolation identification and partial molecular characterization of rotavirus in fecal samples of alpaca crias with diarrhea will be instrumental for understanding the epidemiology pathogenesis and will be of significant value to establish the role of rotavirus relative to other pathogens in the diarrhea complex in alpaca crias more precisely the finding that the rotavirus isolates appear to be type g3 is intriguing as this is a common type in humans and sequencing of the corresponding gene revealed a relatively high nucleotide homology 96 with human rotavirus in this segment sequencing of pcr-amplified fragments coding for vp4 and vp7 of the two alpaca isolates revealed homologies with swine and human rotaviruses interestingly the alpaca rotavirus isolates showed 75 homology with porcine rotavirus vp4 coding sequence and up to 96  homology with human rotavirus vp7 coding sequence genebank accession numbers kt250941 and kt250942 the sequence relatedness of the two alpaca isolates with swine and human rotaviruses suggest that these may represent novel viruses resulting from interspecies transmission that may also involve zoonotic transmission matthijnssens et al 2006 parra et al 2008 martella et al 2010 parreo et al 2004 oshea et al 2014 and swine may be an important reservoir in which new virus reassortants may originate parra et al 2008 however in order to draw phylogenetic or epidemiologic conclusions will require more extensive sequencing thus additional comparative genetic analysis of all segments would be indicated to establish linkages and evolutionary relationships with rotaviruses from other species dwelling in the same ecologic niche including humans as recently reported with group a giraffe and vicugna rotaviruses oshea et al 2014 badaracco et al 2013 the full or partial genome sequence analysis reported in rotaviruses recovered from these species suggests that interspecies circulation of viruses within a particular genotype constellation is a likely transmission event oshea et al 2014 badaracco et al 2013 further extensive sequencing and phylogenetic analysis would be required to verify whether rotaviruses recovered from other sacs or any other artiodactyls or humans within the same area of our study share such genotype constellations with the alpaca rotavirus isolates the relative importance of several pathogens in diarrhea of crias has been documented in north america cebra et al 2003 reviewed by whitehead and anderson 2006 it appears that coronavirus is one of the leading causes of diarrhea in crias followed by protozoal pathogens with a relatively lower incidence of rotavirus associated diarrhea cebra et al 2003 coronavirus-induced diarrhea has been identified in crias of llamas and alpacas and in adult animals in north america cebra et al 2003 genova et al 2008 the relatedness of the genome sequence to bovine coronavirus suggests that the virus in alpacas is from bovine origin jin et al 2007 in contrast an outbreak of acute diarrhea in guanacos lama guanicoe in patagonia argentina with high morbidity and mortality was shown to be associated virologically and serologically with rotavirus while coronavirus was not a significant factor parreo et al 2004 previous serologic surveys in argentinian llama farms found a 88 prevalence of antibody to rotavirus puntel et al 1999 there is also evidence of antibodies to rotavirus rivera et al 1987 or rotaviral antigen in crias with diarrhea in peru morales et al 2007 lopez et al 2011 in the andes of peru recent studies confirm rotaviral infection in guanaco crias by seroconversin and excretion of virus in feces marcoppido et al 2011 and in vicua by elisa and molecular methods badaracco et al 2013 these data indicate marked differences in frequency and distribution of enteric viruses in sacs in different geographical locations the present study reports the molecular characterization of rotaviruses isolated from feces of crias that had acute diarrhea and this strongly suggests a causal relationship however the prevalence and relative importance of rotavirus in the diarrhea complex in alpacas remains undetermined thus further investigation is required to establish the actual impact of rotaviruses in the overall morbidity and mortality of alpaca crias diarrhea is one of the leading causes of cria mortality the isolation and molecular characterization of rotavirus from alpaca crias with acute diarrhea enabled us to further understand this important pathogen which potentially will contribute to develop appropriate control andor treatment two rotavirus isolates were obtained from fecal samples by inoculation into cell monolayers the isolates were identified as rotavirus by means of a rt-pcr with specific primers for human rotavirus during identification bovine rotavirus a was used as a reference the alpaca isolates were identified as group a rotaviruses by vp6-specific pcr and were designated alrvakayraper3368-10 and alrvakayraper3386-10 molecular g and p typing placed the former as g3p11 and the latter as g3p sequencing of the isolates segments coding for vp4 and vp7a revealed partial homologies to swine and human rotaviruses respectively these findings are of significant interest and call for further investigation to establish epidemiologic and phylogenetic relationships with rotaviruses from other species dwelling in the same area including humans  special editorial wac in the time of coronavirus john carman jan turek   we do not usually write an editorial for a special issue this however is a special editorial written in an emergency situation as we are in global war with the invisible enemy of covid-19 coronavirus pandemic we face many restrictions and safety measures worldwide for wac the most painful consequence is the postponement of wac-9 see the announcement by the wac president that was supposed to be held in prague 510 july 2020 wac as a global organization is responsible for the safety of its membership during the main congresses and inter-congresses at the time of writing this editorial the situation is not getting any better just the opposite while in china and south korea we can see the first signs of successful quarantine the pandemic reached iran europe and north america in february and decisively affected the lives of millions of people the pandemic is still rising and one of the archaeologies co-editors is currently in quarantine concerning the prospect of wac-9 we decided to postpone it by a whole year so the current dates of the prague congress are 49 july 2021 this wasnt an easy solution but definitely the most safe and responsible one nobody knows how the pandemic is going to behave in the rest of this year however some epidemiologists are warning that there may be an autumn recurrence of the virus so we hope that july 2021 may be the time in which we either have the virus globally under control andor have the vaccine and medication available then we could organize the meeting without stress and fear and make our global meeting even more successful the reason why we are so surprised and unprepared for the global disease outbreak is that the immediate experience with such danger has disappeared from our living memory the 1918 influenza pandemic called the spanish flu occurred at the end of ww i more than hundred years ago the occurrence of global pandemics has a very long pedigree some of the copper age bateni in russiaafanasievo culture 29092679 bc scope in estoniacorded ware culture 25752349 bc bulanovo in russiasintasha culture 22802047 bc and early bronze age burials from central and eastern europe chociwel in silesiapolandntice culture 21351923 bc kytmanovo in russiaandronovo culture 17461626 bc contained dna from bacterium yersinia pestis that caused the black death callaway 2015 this spread is usually connected with the migration of the yamnaya culture population westwards these earliest cases of plague lacked a gene called ymt that helps the bacterium yersinia pestis to colonize guts of fleas often travelling on rodents transmitting bacteria to humans the later example comes from early iron age armenia 1048855 bc from the cemetery at kapan where the bacterium yersinia pestis already harbouring the ytm was identified together with another mutation linked to flea-aided transmission since then the plague became a fast spreading disease of civilization such as in the case of the medieval bubonic plague callaway 2015 the earliest historical evidence of plague comes from 5th century bc athens the city-state that was at the time engaged in the peloponnese war so the mobility of humans and rodents and social misbalance such as wartime were the worst accelerators of pandemics medieval globalization brings the first recorded truly global outbreak of plague that first occurred in china in the 1330s a time when china was engaged in substantial trade with western asia and europe the plague reached europe in october 1347 the diseases commonly travelled from east to west in 1529 a measles outbreak in cuba killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived european smallpox two years later measles was responsible for the deaths of half the indigenous population of honduras and ravaged mexico central america and the inca civilization in the modern world the flow of ideas information goods capital and people across political and geographic boundaries allow infectious diseases to rapidly spread around the whole planet the third plague pandemic emerged in yunnan province of china in the mid-19th century it spread east and south through china reaching guangzhou canton and the british colonial port of hong kong in 1894 where it entered the global maritime trade routes plague reached singapore and bombay in 1896 most similar to our current struggle is the outbreak of spanish flu 19181920 that infected 500 million people around the world or about 27 of the world population which was at that time between 18 and 19 billion the death toll was estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to 50 million or perhaps even more the disease originated probably in northern china and spread with the movement of soldiers and trade globally in europe and north america it badly affected countries involved in the world war unlike covid-19 it mainly killed young people in reproductive age it came in three waves see fig 1 the first wave started in late 1917 and early 1918 the second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much deadlier than the first the first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics those most at risk were the sick and elderly while younger healthier people recovered easily by august when the second wave began in france sierra leone and the usa the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form october 1918 was the deadliest month of the whole pandemic the third wave came in februarymarch 1919 fig 1 much has changed in medical science and technology since the time of spanish flu but with ever-growing population and the unprecedented mobility of present day humankind we face new and yet unknown challenges of the 21st century global pandemic we wish us all good health open mind and good luck in coming time see you in prague 2021 fig 1 source image courtesy of the national museum of health and medicinepandemic influenza the inside story

shieldnewcastle university united kingdom  progressive adaptation the key to sustaining a growing global population frederic siegel r   adaptation is an evolving long-term process during which a population of life forms adjusts to changes in its habitat and surrounding environments adaptation by the global community as a unit is vital to cope with the effects of increasing populations global warmingclimate change the chemical biological and physical impacts on life-sustaining ecosystems and competition for life sustaining and economically important natural resources the latter include water food energy metal ores industrial minerals and wood within this framework it is necessary to adapt as well to changes in local and regional physical conditions brought on by natural and anthropogenic hazards by health threats of epidemic or pandemic reach by social conditions such as conflicts driven by religious and ethnic fanaticism and by tribalism and clan ties although the rate of global population growth is declining and is expected to fall to the replacement level by mid-twenty-first century it is still increasing by about 7580 million people annually see chap 101007978-3-319-09686-51 a grand part of the growth is taking place in africa asia latin america and the middle east that together already accounts for a 2014 population of 59 billion of the 72 billion people worldwide conversely populations are contracting or stable in most of western and eastern europe and japan together with the united states that has a stable population this latter group today is home to the other 13 billion people thus although there are two population situations to adapt to both have common problems of sustainability to address the principal problems with growing populations do not involve space although population density is a problem unto itself for reasons discussed in previous chapters the main problems are how to nourish people with food and water the chronic malnutrition that about 1 billion people suffered from in 2013 is likely to grow in number in some regions due to global warmingclimate change because humans cannot adapt to less food if they are already at subsistence rations for example the 2012 population in sub-saharan africa is 902 million people the population is projected to increase to about 125 billion in 2030 an increase of about 38  within the same time frame the united nations estimates that acreage under maize cultivation in the region will decline by 40  because of heat and drought brought on by climate change the loss of arable land for food production can be countered in sub-saharan africa if marker assisted hybridization of maize or maize genetically modified to withstand heat and drought come onto the seed market together with modified seeds for other food staples and if african nations that do not now accept gmo seeds do so in the future if not nations favored for food production by climate change will have a moral obligation to provide food staples to people in nations with declining food production at accessible costs based on their economies it is clear that what happens in sub-saharan africa and other regions with declining cultivation acreage or that will bear other effects of climate change eg drought shifting rain patterns will affect the rest of the worldwide community politically economically and socially the earths problems that associate with global warming climate change will be further discussed in the last section of this chapter water is the staff of life it keeps the body hydrated and is necessary to grow food crops hydrate food animals and grow feed grains chemically or biologically polluted water does not serve these ends if ingested contaminated water can result in sickness as discussed in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-52 water stokes industry and manufacturing as well thus keeping economies in many countries contributing to a populations well-being by providing employment goods and services ideally these businesses contribute their fair share to a tax base that supports social needs eg education healthcare maintenance of infrastructure factory owners adapt and plan against water shortages by having a water recycling system in place but may also slow or stop production until operational water conditions return citizens with a reliable water supply can adapt to periods of water shortage by limiting use according to mandates by government officials but still have water for basic daily needs however persons in nations with a chronic per capita water shortage may not have this option to serve their daily needs unless water is imported or new water sources are found see chap 101007978-3-319-09686-52 if imported water is not an option to meet immediate essential needs an alternative adaptation for people and animals is to try to reach a location where water would be available to them with growing populations per capita water availability is greatly diminished table 101007978-3-319-09686-52 water shortages become endemic and people are at risk of existing at subsistence levels or dying most at risk from the lack of a basic water ration are pregnant women infants young children and old people water wars are a future possibility as nations battle for their peoples survival unless political differences are set aside and projects are supported to develop and share water sources in a welcome effort jordan israel and the palestinian authority signed a memorandum of understanding in the world bank december 2013 with specific aims 1 produce millions of cubic meters of drinking water for a water-deficient region 2 pipe 200 million cubic meters of water annually 180 km 110 mi from the red sea to the dead sea 3 build a desalination plant at aqaba that would supply water to aqaba and eilat 4 the israeli water utility would supply 2030 million cubic meters of drinking water to the palestinian authority for the west bank population at a reduced cost and 5 there would be an inflow of water to slow and in the future perhaps abate and reverse the shrinking of the dead sea funding for the estimated 400 million 5-year project will come from the world bank donor nations and philanthropic groups as the global population increases and more people in developing and less developed nations have more disposable income there will be a growing draw on natural resources other than water and food to service their industrial agricultural and manufacturing needs and wants competition can force economic wars among national and multinational corporations for the resources necessary to provide goods and services and thus drive up prices for resources industries and manufacturing units that cannot compete economically for natural resources will shut down thus contributing to unemployment and downturns in economies because of falling domestic demand to keep order in the increasingly interdependent world economy accommodation for shared natural resources or substitutes for them at affordable prices is the adaptationnecessary this can be mandated by the world trade organization backed by other practical-minded international groups another adverse effect of growing populations that is a national resource that can be lost at the expense of some countries to the benefit of others is brain power this brain power has been cultivated at excellent universities in developing countries often times at little or no cost to students eg in medicine science engineering economics the arts who attend and graduate in increasing numbers where there are too many well-educated professionals but lack of employment opportunities for them in their fields of expertise educated people have the option of relocating to another country that can nurture and use the expertise many adapt to the employment problem by taking up this option this may mean moving from a developing country to a developed country or from a less developed country to a developing or developed country ultimately this loss of citizens with special skills can hurt a country to counter this brain drain or reverse it a country can adapt by investing in its future to create programs and conditions that keep talented professionals home or if they have emigrated entice them to return china and india are examples of countries that have successfully taken this tact when there are increases in a population because of immigration problems can ensue between immigrants and a general population adaptation to diversity and the multicultural experiences it brings to a community is often not a comfortable change the antipathy of some in a host country is based on slowness of the immigrants to learn the language and inability of host country citizens to understand what immigrants are saying among themselves this makes citizens feel uneasy some view immigrants as a threat to their own or a family members employment or advancement race difference is a factor that some cannot readily adapt to as is ethnicity with its traditions and customs unfamiliar to the general public religion can be divisive if adherents to its beliefs engage in acts of hatred detrimental to the host country fueled by fundamentalists and zealots who interpret religious writings as giving them license to commit crimes or absolving them of the crimes sadly many citizens paint an entire religious community with the taint of the relatively few evildoers adaptation to diversity is essential for our earths citizenry with joint efforts by all to resolve worldwide issues eg global warmingclimate change so as to become the keys to providing a sound future for coming generations there has to be a shared attack on global threats no matter what the language race ethnicity or religious beliefs are no matter social or economic status no matter whether a threat affects less developed developing or developed countries in areas prone to earthquakes we know that earthquakes do not kill and injure people but that collapsing buildings and infrastructure do earthquakes are not predictable so that there is no adaptation by a timely evacuation to minimize deaths and injury however building structures to make them more earthquake resistant can save lives reduce injuries and protect property thus after a high-magnitude earthquake forensic engineering teams come to assess the damage and determine where and why damage and destruction took place within the context of the magnitude of an earthquake the type of motion it originated shaking jarring rolling its duration the area it affected and the geologic properties of rocks underlying structures foundations hazard assessment teams also evaluate other factors that contributed to additional damage such as ruptured gas lines that feed fires and ruptured water lines that inhibit fire control the engineers establish how construction can be improved in the future in terms of construction techniques and materials to prevent the types of collapses and utility failures they investigated municipalities revise building codes accordingly to direct reconstruction and future building projects where possible structures that withstood an earthquake with minor or no visible damage should be retrofitted to improve their resistance to the next big one with each event we gain more data on how to better construct earthquake-resistant structures and alter building codes to more stringent specifications in theory this adaptationto an irregularly recurring global event is good but in practice it is most applicable to nations with the economic resources for reconstruction according to revised building codes and where there is no corruption to allow a bypass of the code the same can be stated for retrofitting to give more resistance to earthquakes to existing structures many developed nations and nations rich in commodity exports eg oil have a moral obligation to donate funds material and expertise to help citizens in economically disadvantaged nations recover from a destructive earthquake some commodity-rich and economically sound nations do not do so directly whereas others big and small rally to help disaster victims for example immediately after megatyphoon haiyan devastated many regions in the central philippines in 2013 israel sent 250 medical doctors and nurses and field hospitals to help philippine citizens recover from the impacts of the typhoon as discussed in an earlier chapter volcanoes are predictable in terms of becoming active by emitting wisps of smoke bulging on a slope warming of the soil or nearby pond or lake waters emitting increasing concentrations of gases and showing increased low-frequency seismicity however this activity does not always result in an eruption a marked increase in measurements and observations especially the low-frequency seismic activity suggests that an eruption is imminent adaptation to living and working on or near a volcano means investing in equipment to monitor volcanic activity and listening to alerts from scientists monitoring its activity and being ready to evacuate by gathering important papers and precious mementos and prepared to load into transportation for evacuation to safe locations governments adapt by charging geologists to map out areas considered as high- moderate- and low-hazard zones in the volcano environs geologists do this by studying rocks deposited from past eruptions and assessments of the topography municipalities then pass zoning regulations applicable to the hazard level governments have adapted to repeated periodic flooding in areas by creating flood control systems described in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-54 dams hold water during times of heavy andor extended rainfall and release any overflow into channels that move water away from urban or rural population centers levees increase the volume of water that can move through a channel thereby keeping it from spreading into populated areas and cultivated farmland for smaller waterways that flow through cities municipalities may invest in deepening widening and straightening channels as well as erecting walls so that more water can flow through the area more rapidly without coming out of a channel governments define zones on flood plains according to a recurrence interval of damaging floods eg 100 years as being off limits for residential and factoryplant construction as much as we plan to adjust to living in an area prone to flooding there is always the possibility of a megaevent that can overcome in situ control systems therefore as described chap 101007978-3-319-09686-54 governments adapt to this possibility by installing flood prediction equipment in drainage basins to provide warning to those at risk from rising and sometimes raging waters the warning gives people time to gather important documents and personal treasures and evacuate to safe areas the apparent increase in the frequency and magnitude of storms and resulting flooding in recent years is thought by many weather scientists to be related to global warming and the increased amount of moisture in the atmosphere from warmer oceans that gathers in clouds and precipitates during storms this will be discussed further in this chapter 
adaptation to extreme weather events such as an extended period of drought heat waves and frigid weather means preparation to wait them out some municipalities adapt to repeated sometimes seasonal times of short-term drought by storing a 36 month water supply in surface or underground reservoirs during periods of normal precipitation that can be tapped conservatively as needed others may plan to move water via pipes or water tankers from where it is plentiful to where drought conditions exist otherwise to survive people move as best they can to where they have access to water in instances of years long drought crops and livestock and other life forms may be lost heat waves can kill adaptation to heat wave conditions means that water has to be available to people to avoid dehydration where possible homes should have air-conditioning or fans to keep people comfortable and municipalities should have cooling centers to which people can go personnel should check on senior citizens and escort them to cooling centers if necessary clearly economically advantaged nations have the resources to give support to citizens during natural hazards such as these these nations international organizations and ngos have a moral obligation to help economically disadvantaged nations as is possible when hazard conditions such as these threaten populations the most extreme of weather conditions that can injure and kill people and destroy housing and infrastructure are tropical storms that evolve into violent hurricanes typhoons monsoons by increasing wind speeds and sucking up moisture water as they track across oceans toward land when these storms make landfall they drive storm surges that can wreak havoc onshore communities and as they move inland precipitate heavy rains that cause life-threatening and destructive flooding these violent storms are destructive to coastal populations and island nations and have regional reach inland as they move along paths until they finally spend their energy or move out to sea on november 8 2013 the typhoon named haiyan the strongest recorded typhoon ever to make landfall smashed into the central philippines killing more than 2600 people injuring about 12500 and displacing almost 600000 people there was a 4-m 13 ft storm surge driven by winds measured at over 312 kmh 195 mih with gusts reaching 380 kmh 235 mih the typhoon flattened the city of tacloban that was home to 200000 residents and there was major flooding inland the weather alerts led to a government call for evacuation away from the predicted path of the storm and about 1 million people followed the evacuation warning surely saving many lives access to aid typhoon-ravaged areas was difficult and there were shortages of water food and medical care for many evacuees for several days the philippine central government and local officials were not prepared to deal with a storm of this magnitude but help started arriving from many nations worldwide there was a post-event concern of attending to sanitation needs of survivors to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as cholera typhoid fever hepatitis and dysentery if the philippine government had adapted by adopting better policies with respect to response to high-category typhoons in addition to the call for evacuation the impact of haiyan would have been ameliorated one would hope that this deficiency would be dealt with to limit the effects of future like disasters evacuation to prevent injury and death in coastal zones that could be struck by high winds heavy sustained rains and storm surges is dependent on weather bureau forecasts and warnings from police firefighters or other government-authorized personnel homeowners adapt to hurricanes by securing roofing with additional nails or special fasteners as a retrofit precaution and by boarding up windows on structures before an incoming storm hits governments have adapted to the onslaught of violent high-energy storms by constructing seawalls of varying designs and heights to protect population centers by damping the force of storm surges in china for example a seawall 672 m 22 ft in height and that has been heightened in the past protects shanghai from the full damaging effects of high-category typhoons as a result of rising sea level the shanghai seawall and other that protect coastal cities from being flooded by surges from high-energy tropical storms will have to be heightened to afford a greater degree of protection to people and property wildfires can be a natural hazard when ignited by a lightening strike however most wildfires are started by human carelessness such as tossing a lit cigarette on a forest floor or failing to completely extinguish a campfire or by arsonists one may adapt to living in an area with a history of wildfires in two ways neither of which is practical or promises 100  protection first would be to clear an area of vegetation in a 30-m 100 ft swath around a dwelling or site for building second would be to build with nonflammable materials so that embers propelled during a wildfire could not ignite a structure adaptation to the advance of a wildfire would be to heed warnings to evacuate carrying a prepared case with important documents and other items of personal value to delay evacuation by going back to retrieve something from then home can be fatal as it was for two people in a recent june 2013 wildfire that destroyed almost 500 homes in colorado springs colorado usa when there is a hazard event coming that calls for evacuation responsible and often economically advantaged governments have adapted to the threat by designating evacuation routes by providing transportation for people who need it by having evacuation centers stocked with water and food cots and blankets basic medical supplies and medical personnel and by having phone service available for people that need it in the case of a primary or triggered hazard that happens with little or no warning eg an earthquake a tsunami a volcanic mud flow search and rescue teams should be ready to move in soon after dangerous conditions ease and they can move with safety there should be medical attention to treat injured survivors and stations set up as soon as possible to provide water food and other essentials available to those that survived with little or no physical hurt these first steps at adaptation are the keys to survival recovery after a shock phase can be long and drawn out depending in grand part on a nations social and economic resources and physical and economic assistance from other nations international institutions and ngos global warming is a fact attested to by an overwhelming majority of the scientific community and unwaveringly supported by a february 2014 joint publication of the us national academy of sciences and the royal academy in the uk on the causes and evidence for global warming 1 as noted in earlier chapters during the past century measurements show that the earth has warmed by 08 c 144 f global warming is an ongoing process that is attributed in grand part to a slow but continuous and increasing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the greenhouse gas most associated with global warming is carbon dioxide co2 a plot of the increase of co2 content in the atmosphere with time against the increase in global temperature shows an excellent correlation of one with the other additional lesser contributors include methane ch4 nitrous oxide no2 and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs with the beginning of the industrial revolution and the increased use of coal as the principal energy source the content of co2 in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million 0028  the combustion of coal and later oil petroleum and natural gas emits co2 to the atmosphere initially and for many years thereafter the added greenhouse gases were taken up by vegetation for photosynthesis and was also absorbed by the oceans and other water bodies this kept the atmosphere co2 close to the 280 ppm pre-industrial level however with increased industrialization the need for electrical power and the use of internal combustion engines the amount of co2 generated was greater than what could be absorbed by nature and the content of co2 in the atmosphere increased during june 2013 its concentration reached more than 398 ppm an increase of over 40  over the pre-industrial concentration scripps institute of oceanography mauna loa measurement the increasing co2 content other greenhouse gases aerosols and particles acted as a media that admitted sunlight heat energy to the earths surface but did not let all of the heat escape back into the atmosphere this abets global warming in the past two to three decades the rush to industrialization in developing countries eg china india and brazil and their growing power needs and vehicular use has thwarted the implementation of international agreements to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants other industrial and manufacturing operations and the transportation sector a direct consequence of global warming is sea level rise slr caused by the progressive melting of icecaps and ice sheets in greenland the arctic and antarctica and of mountain glaciers in the himalayas the alps the rocky mountains and the andes the 20-cm 8 in sea level rise during the past century may see a rise of another 50 cm 20 in1 m 39 in during this twenty-first century one-third of the rise would be from the expansion of warmer sea water one-third from icecap and ice sheet melt and one-third from mountain glacier melt 2 in 2012 other researchers used computer models on existing data and proposed that 50  of sea level rise between 1903 and 2007 was from glacial melt 3 following the same line of investigation other scientists studied satellite data and ground measurements from alaska the canadian arctic greenland the southern andes the himalayas and other high mountains of asia and estimated that glacier contributions to sea level rise from 2003 to 2009 was 29  and together with ice sheet melt explained 60  of slr 4 a publication in 2012 estimated that ocean thermal expansion 0300 m deep and 300700 m deep contributed up to 35  to sea level rise 5 these latter two estimations are in line with the ipcc prediction for melting ice and ocean thermal expansion contribution to the estimated rise of sea level by the end of the century 2 with a rise in sea level marine waters encroach on land as the rise continues possibly at an increasing rate it threatens habitation in lowlying islands coastal villages and farmland in lowlying zones and heavily populated cities worldwide settled on inshore terrain close to sea level eg bangkok ho chi minh city jakarta manila miami new york boston buenos aires london rotterdam rising sea level and warming of ocean waters have other ramifications that affect coastal communities as well as inland areas as explained in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-57 the warmer surface water releases more water vapor with heat energy into the atmosphere when the water vapor molecules condense in clouds heat energy is released this energy gives more force to tropical storms as they form track to shore and move inland or storms that move close to and along a coast these storms may transition to hurricanes typhoons monsoons with the violent winds that cause destruction and heavy rainfall that triggers flooding if they move onto land we recognize that rising sea level means that tropical storms that impact a coast with storm surges have a farther reach inland with their destructive energy that is more pronounced when the surge occurs at high tide the surges also saturate farmland they reach with salt water that harms crops they also carry salt water into fresh water marshes and ponds thus disrupting ecosystems there the increase in the number of these extreme weather events and the increase in violence and destruction they wreak on land compared with like weather events in the recent past eg during the past 30 years strongly suggest that they are fueled to a significant degree by global warming there are two possibilities for adapting to the effects of rising sea level on coastal urban centers one impractical the other very costly but doable the impractical adaptation possibility is to move at-risk population centers inland out of the reach of the destructive tropical storms this does not lessen the threat of flooding the move is possible in some cases where land is available but such a move is not economically feasible one practical but costly adaptation to mitigate encroachment from sea level rise and the effects of tropical storm surges is to surround cities at risk within place seawalls 23 m higher than recorded high tides or higher depending on historical records and contemporary published data the walls can have a concave configuration so that surging waves lose energy when their lower parts hit and are curled back on themselves damping some wave energy or there can be a different configuration best for the sites to be protected similarly gates buried at strategic locations where there is ship access to consider can be built to be hydraulically driven so that they can rise from a near shore seabed site to mitigate the effects of storm surges both techniques have been used at different global locations we have read that climate change affects land-based agricultural production both for crops and animal husbandry the warming climate at higher mid-hemispheric latitudes and at higher altitudes does not favor the growth and normal yield andor quality of many crops depending upon the degree of climate change and the linked changes that may follow it farmers can adapt in several ways to maintain or increase crop yield and nutrition value for example when warming starts diminishing the productivity of a traditional crop farmers can sow crops that are known to grow well in warmer temperature and give a satisfactory economic benefit however new groups of weeds pests and diseases will migrate to the warmer growth environment and will have to be dealt with in order to protect the new crops where the effect of global warming reduces water supply for rain-fed agriculture for crops irrigated with surface waters and for groundwater-irrigated crops when aquifer recharge does not balances discharge agriculturalists can adapt in two ways first is the use of a more efficient irrigation method that delivers water directly to a growing plant eg drip or focused irrigation this minimizes runoff and loss to evaporation second and similar to what was mentioned earlier is to sow a crop that needs less water to thrive and that delivers a good yield good-quality product another result of global warming for some farmlands is a longer growing season in this situation growers can adapt by planting earlier and have the possibility of double cropping they can also grow a cultivar that is later maturing and that gives a product that brings a good market price however switching to new crops in a warmer growth environment means that there will be an invasion of a new set of weeds pests and diseases to ward off in any efficient operation and as emphasized in earlier chapters farmers adjust to a changing growth environment for a given cultivar by applying the optimum amounts of fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals as might be needed that nurture and protect it most effectively this reduces agricultural costs and lessens runoff of these chemicals to ecosystems where they can be harmful global warming can bring on abnormal weather extremes that affect agricultural productivity in these cases farmers have to plan ahead based on recent history of these conditions in their regions drought heat waves and long-term rain or heavy rain in a short time present problems for both cultivars and food animals periods of less than average precipitation may last months or years depending on the amount of the deficit precipitation adaptation can include storing water in reservoirs and cisterns during times of rainfall to be tapped during a drought to sustain food animals and crops during a short-term not too severe drought there is also the option of trucking in water to sustain livestock long-term droughts when precipitation deficits are high take their toll on plants and animals to the detriment of agriculture in a region especially when accompanied by heat waves they have caused recent disasters for crops and food animals on all continents less antarctica farmers either wait out the bad times change the type of cropping they do the livestock they tend to or change careers the adaptation from crops that have been grown successfully before the effects of global warming reduced yields and quality of a harvest to those same crops that can grow successfully under the advancing warming changes just described generally means that hybridized species have to be developed and used as warming increases at a location and slowly tracks to higher latitudes and higher altitudes thus growers turn to plants that are created by hybridization as described in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-53 traditional methods and marker-assisted selection methods within the same species and genetically engineered -modified -manipulated methods using different species hybridization is a slow process sped up markedly by genetic engineering a method that yields foodstuff not accepted by the european union and many nations outside the union especially in africa bred species are developed to carry one or more characteristics that favor crop resilience against the effects of climate change these include resistance to disease weeds and pests and tolerant of drought water stress heat short-term inundation and short-term saline exposure see chap 101007978-3-319-09686-53 hybrids have also been developed to give higher yields and more nutritious crops thus far research has been focused mainly on improving seed for world staples such as rice maize corn wheat sorghum and soybean there have been great successes where hybrid crops were agriculturalists adaptation so that the possibility exists that we can feed the earths growing populations and reduce chronic malnutrition when this is coupled with the opening of additional arable acreage and the use of improved farming methods for seeding watering and harvesting global food security can be strengthened for the existing world population and the future generations on earth however this will require economic and technical input by developed nations and international groups without basic sustenance people will have less resistance to diseases and there may be local or regional population crashes if diseases evolve into epidemics or pandemics that invade susceptible populations warming of the open ocean water enclosed aquaculture operations in ocean waters and on land water bodies has affected marine fisheries and marine and estuarine aquaculture that grow food fish and shellfish and lakes that sustain fisheries in marine fisheries worldwide eg in the north atlantic off the coast of peru off the coast of the philippines some food fish or fish captured for other purposes eg to use in pet food to use to make fertilizer have migrated to cooler water in ecosystems with conditions conducive to their spawning and growth in some cases predators follow fish they prey upon that have migrated to cooler waters but in other cases they find new prey to sustain them in other situations they may become prey for larger fish in an ecosystem fishing fleets adapt by following the fish they hunt into cooler waters where ideally they capture the hunted species in quantities allotted them by national and international fishery governing body regulations if the quota system is followed this will allow recovery of fish populations and sustainable harvesting aquaculture operations that provide important supplies of food fish worldwide can adapt to warming waters by raising food fish or shellfish that will grow and multiply under the changed range of daynight temperature conditions if the fish they are farming cannot survive in the warmer waters aquaculturalists also have the option to move their facilities to cooler-temperature waters but the economic feasibility of doing this has to be evaluated by a benefit to cost analysis this analysis has to be for the time frame during which the cooler-ecosystem waters are estimated to remain stable within the framework of a time range against global warmingclimate change another adaptation is that food fish currently being raised can be genetically engineered to be resistant to a warmer growth environment without changing their nutrition yield growth rate and ability to reproduce 
vaccines provide a main line of defense against many diseases smallpox has been eradicated on earth by vaccination polio has all but been eradicated globally except for a few pockets of the disease in pakistan afghanistan and nigeria where in some cases religious fundamentalists have beaten and killed health workers tasked with giving the vaccine to children and in other cases where parents have been warned by the zealots against allowing their children to be vaccinated recently 81 polio cases were diagnosed mainly in somalia but also in kenya this is attributed to the fact that by 2013 500000 children in somalia have not received the vaccine and are at risk from this highly contagious disease it is also attributed to cross-border migration of infected persons into kenya both governments are stepping up their vaccination programs there were 59 cases of polio diagnosed in the rest of the world in 2012 
measles is a global disease that can be prevented by a vaccine that is safe and cost-effective measles may soon reach the near-eradication stage in 1980 and subsequent years 26 million people mainly children under 5 years of age died from measles since 2000 1 billion children were vaccinated 225 million in 2011 by 2011 84  of the worlds children received the measles vaccine up from 72  in 2000 from 2000 to 2011 deaths from measles dropped to 71  from 548000 to 158000 when the vaccination rate reaches 95  mainly in low-income countries the world will have brought another disease close to elimination 6 
seasonal influenza is a global viral illness that afflicts 35 million people the sickness kills 250000500000 people with severe symptoms annually transmission of the virus takes place when an infected individual coughs or sneezes without covering hisher mouth and releases droplets that can be inhaled by someone up to a meter away transmission can also be from hands carrying the virus seasonal influenza affects all age groups but children less than 2 years old people over 65 and those with complicating medical problems are most at risk influenza is a disease to be controlled the principal control is by safe and effective vaccines that can prevent 7090  of influenza cases in healthy adults secondary controls are obvious for infected persons cover the mouth when sneezing or coughing and wash the hands frequently the influenza vaccine is taken once annually because strains of the influenza virus change from year to year adaptation is needed the adaptation is via a vaccine that is prepared with 3 or 4 strains that scientists determine will be most common during a coming season 7 other types of influenza and respiratory illnesses have the potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic they include avian flu and its strains and swine flu if the strains develop the ability for person-to-person transmission after infection and sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome  mers because there is human-to-human transmission of the sicknesses to the present the outbreaks of the animal influenza diseases have been contained by quarantining infected people during treatment and by culling flocks and herds or if available vaccination of healthy animals the latter two respiratory illnesses are caused by the coronavirus and infected people have been in isolation wards for sars an illness that broke out in 2003 and spread to 24 countries isolation of victims and treatment with antiviral drugs and steroids stopped the disease during 2004 mers is a recent 20122013 illness that has been confined to jordan saudi arabia qatar and the united arab emirates the mers virus has been found in camels infected persons are quarantined in hospitals but an effective drug treatment is still being sought to complement the normal hospital care-afforded patients hiv aids is a global epidemic that killed 25 million people in three decades since 1981 worldwide in 2011 there were 34 million people with hiv mainly 33 million or 97  in sub-saharan africa and southsoutheast asia the illness is caused by the exchange of body fluids semen vaginal excretions blood breast milk from an infected individual with an uninfected person more than 50  of the cases of hiv are from heterosexual activity there is no vaccine against hiv aids no cure for it but there is a cocktail of medicines antiretroviral treatment that control viral replication and allow an infected persons immune system to strengthen this keeps the illness at bay and afflicted people in general good health and productive in their communities in 2012 only 97 million less than 30  of those with hiv in low and middle economies received the antiretroviral treatment this is changing as more hiv carriers have access to antiretroviral therapy and there are more donations from economically advantaged countries to support hiv stabilization and reduction programs the number of new cases of hiv is not exploding because more than 50  of those infected are following protocols that reduce the transmission of the disease the prevention of transmission methods include access to male and female condoms blood screening before transfusions and needle and syringe exchange programs for sterile injections by drug users hiv testing and education programs and hiv treatment help prevent transmission because individuals in continuous treatment have a very low probability of passing on the disease male circumcision reduces the infection in men by about 60  there is still much progress to be made because there were 25 million new cases of hiv in 2011 with 18 million of that total in sub-saharan africa the hivaids is a global sickness that is slowly coming under control because of generous donations from governments and foundations in developed countries added to what low- and middle-income countries themselves provide to lower the prevalence and incidence of hiv in their populations 8 
tuberculosis tb infected 87 million people globally in 2011 killing 14 million persons it is a bacterial disease that spreads among people when infected individuals cough sneeze or spit releasing bacteria into the air where they can be inhaled by others a meter away although tb occurs worldwide developing countries carry the largest burden of cases and deaths 95  the bulk of new cases are regional in asia 60  with sub-saharan africa reporting a large share as well with 2600 new cases per million inhabitants there is no vaccination for tb but the disease can be treated and cured the treatment is a half-year course of four antimicrobial drugs that must be taken without fail and thus requires continual supervision by healthcare personnel more than 51 million people have been treated and cured of tb since 1995 and perhaps 20 million lives saved by following the who stop tb strategy protocols including securing adequate sustained financing ensuring early reliable detection and diagnosis and providing approved treatment with a secure effective drug supply the number of people infected with tb is declining and from 1990 to 2011 the tb death rate dropped more than 40  the success in dealing with tb is muted somewhat because a strain of the bacterium that causes tb has evolved to be multidrug resistant  mdr-tb in 2011 310000 cases of this variant were reported of the 87 million cases worldwide mainly from india china and the russian federation these are treated with but do not always respond to the most effective anti-tb drugs research into new drugs to deal with this problem is ongoing 9 there is the question of whether people visiting or immigrating from these countries should be screened before a host country issues them entry visas regional illnesses threaten the health of 100s of millions of people mainly in tropical and subtropical areas and often affecting children one of these the guinea worm disease is trending toward elimination if not eradication this is a parasitic disease caused when people swallow water contaminated with infected water fleas microscopic copepods carrying worm larva the worms release penetrate the intestines and move through the body migrating under the skin until they emerge causing swelling and blistering people infected with guinea worm disease cannot contribute to their communities for months during the mid-1980s there were 25 million cases mainly in 16 african nations but attention to where the sources were so that they could be avoided and treated and assistance in generating clean water were adaptations that brought the number of cases down to less than 10000 in 2007 the number of cases continued to decline and was reduced to 542 in 2012 in four african countries south sudan chad ethiopia and mali there is no vaccine against guinea worm disease health officials adapt to counter this sickness in several ways as noted above access to clean drinking water is the best way to prevent infection the prevention or transmission of the worms from infected individuals to healthy persons by proper treatment and hygiene and the use of the larvacide temephos to eliminate the parasite-infected water flea vector and other prevention protocols are important in the control and effort to eliminateeradicate the disease 10 the jimmy carter institute atlanta georgia usa has been a principle force since 1986 in the fight to rid the world of guinea worm disease in tropical and subtropical regions there are three mosquito-vectored diseases that put millions of people at risk yellow fever malaria and dengue fever yellow fever is an endemic viral disease in tropical regions of africa and latin america with 200000 cases reported annually that cause 30000 deaths there is no set treatment for afflicted people but there is an adaptive preventive measure a vaccine against yellow fever is available that is safe affordable and that gives lifelong immunity to the disease with one dose after 710 days for 95  of the people vaccinated when there is the onset of a yellow fever outbreak where the population lacks vaccination protection mosquito control is an essential first step in adaptation to prevent or slowdown transmission of the yellow fever virus spraying insecticides to eliminate breeding sites and kill adult mosquitos is the control used during epidemics to make time for vaccination campaigns in a population and for immunity to take hold there are limitations to the application of the yellow fever vaccine first is that babies less than 9 months of age should not be vaccinated or during an epidemic babies less than 69 months of age should not receive the vaccine second pregnant women should not be vaccinated except when there is an outbreak of the disease third people with a strong allergy to egg protein or those with a marked immunodeficiency or with a thymus problem should not receive the vaccine 11 
malaria is a parasitic disease caused by the bite of an infected mosquito there is no vaccine against malaria but one is undergoing a clinical trial in seven african nations with results expected in 2014 a use or no use decision as a control method for malaria will be made in 2015 promising results from an early-stage clinical trial of an unconventional vaccine prepared with live weakened sporozoites of the malaria parasite were published in 2013 plasmodium falciparum was given to healthy 1845 year-old volunteers intravenously the volunteers were grouped to receive 26 doses and subsequently exposed to bite by five mosquitoes carrying the parasite none of the six that received five doses were infected with malaria three of the 12 that received four doses became infected whereas 16 of the 17 that received lower doses became infected of 12 that received no vaccine 11 became infected those that became infected were treated with malarial drugs and cured clearly higher dosages give protection against infection by malaria 12 more research and extensive clinical trials are necessary to determine how children respond to the vaccine with adjusted dosages and whether the results from early-stage trial are reproducible in larger volunteer populations if the results of additional clinical trials go well the hurdle of producing enough vaccine and adapting it to injection has to be faced forty percent of the deaths from malaria are of african children in the democratic republic of congo and nigeria in addition to sub-saharan africa populations in asia especially india and the greater mekong region and latin america suffer from the disease the effort to deal with the disease that is preventable and curable now centers on control and treatment to reduce the number of cases in 2010 the who reported that there were 219 million cases and 660000 deaths with an uncertainty range of 490000836000 in a 2012 report researchers suggested that the number of deaths was understated and that their computer model gave a figure for 2010 almost double 1238000 deaths 95  uncertainty interval of 9290001685000 13 the who stood by its figure stating that much of the data in the cited study were based on verbal testimony of how people had died not on laboratory diagnosis of samples either figure represents too many deaths from the disease and have to be reduced mosquito control is the adaptation that can reduce the transmission of the disease greatly this includes personal protection by use of proper clothing andor the application of mosquito repellent the use of long-lasting insecticidal pyrethroids treated nets to kill mosquitos and prevent nighttime bites and indoor residual spraying remains effective for months those people infected can be treated with oral artemisinin monotherapy followed by a second drug failure to complete the treatment as prescribed leaves parasites in a persons blood no other antimalarial treatment is available so that parasite resistance could become a serious problem for visitors to a malaria region antimalarial drugs taken before during and after a trip can protect them from the disease many countries in tropical and subtropical areas have used the above-cited strategies and others to work toward the elimination of malaria malaria eradication is the goal of the who 14 
dengue fever is a female mosquito-borne virus that infects people with an influenza-like disease in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide the disease can kill if it evolves to severe dengue it is endemic in latin america and asia where most cases now occur since the 1970s the sickness has spread to more than 100 countries putting about 35  of the worlds 2013 population 25 billion people at risk dengue fever is especially endemic to urbansemi-urban environments humans are the main carrier of the virus after a mosquito bites an infected person each subsequent bite by the infected mosquito creates another carrier a mosquito can bite many people each time it feeds in the americas alone there were 16 billion cases of dengue fever reported in 2010 with 49000 being severe dengue there is no vaccination against dengue fever but research continues to develop one the main treatment for afflicted persons is to keep them hydrated adaptation to deal with slowing or stopping the spread of dengue fever involves three main tracks in addition to spraying insecticide to kill mosquitos the best control method to prevent the transmission of the virus is to deprive mosquitos of sites with shallow standing water where they can lay eggs and multiply control can be improved if communities cover and clean water storage containers regularly and use proven insecticides on them as necessary finally individual protection such as the use of mosquito repellants and insecticide-impregnated bed nets can help reduce the incidence of dengue fever as it has with malaria 15 although controls are known they are not always applied because of economics and other factors that prevent access to protection methods the result is that the number of cases of dengue fever reported continues to grow globally as populations increase in urban locations the incidence of dengue fever can be expected to increase as well unless strict controls are enforced until a safe and cost-effective vaccine is developed a positive aspect of the dengue fever problem is that recovery from one serotype of the virus gives immunity for life however there are four serotypes of the infectious virus so that recovery from one leaves a person susceptible to the others 15 chagas is another regional disease it infects 78 million people annually mostly in 21 latin american countries it is a parasitic illness that evolves after the bite of a blood-feeding triatomine bug often on the face where it defecates close by leaving parasite-bearing feces parasites access the body when the feces are inadvertently smeared into the bite the eyes the mouth or any skin lesion the parasites circulate in the blood expressing their presence as a purplish swelling of one eyelid or as a skin lesion there are several other symptoms as well in this acute stage of the illness but these may be absent or mild if diagnosed early during this stage chagas disease is treatable the parasite is killed with the medicines benznodazole and nifurtimox taken for 2 months there are limitations as to who can take these medicines eg not by pregnant women or people with kidney or liver problems the untreated sickness can cause cardiac alterations and digestive problems that show up 2040 years after an untreated infection chagas disease can be spread by blood transfusion and by organ transplant making blood screening for the parasite essential before a procedure it can also pass to a fetus from an infected woman there is no vaccination against the illness so that control of the vector triatomine sp is necessary the controls adapted by many municipalities include insecticide spraying inside a home the use of treated bed nets and hygiene practices that protect food its preparation and its storage before eating it 16 the sickness may recur if control practices become lax chagas disease is spreading as populations emigrate from latin america to northern countries blood screening of visitors or immigrants from the countries where chagas is endemic may be necessary and treatment followed by an infected individual before a host country issues an entrance visa this would prevent the ingress and possible spread of chagas outbreaks of diseases in town and cities is most often caused by bacterium-contaminated water or food and poor sanitation sicknesses such as cholera typhoid and various other diarrhea types are examples of such diseases they are all highly infectious if good hygiene practices are not followed these diseases are endemic in many countries where populations do not have access to safe water and adequate sanitation there are vaccinations for some of these sicknesses that may require more than one dose but they may not be completely effective or long lasting and require revaccination at times specified by medical personnel eg after 25 years otherwise infected persons can be treated with medicines such as oral rehydration pills or antibiotics adaptation for prevention is easier called for than realistically available washing hands with soap and clean water after visiting the toilet and as noted above access to safe water and good sanitation given the millions of people infected by these bacterial diseases and the hundreds of thousand that die from them annually generally in economically disadvantages countries there should be an expanding global priority to eliminate the disease-causing conditions and preparedness to combat an outbreak when it is reported there are important factors to consider when adopting plans to halt or meliorate the effects of health threats to people in the near and extended future one is the climate change-driven spread of tropical and subtropical diseases discussed earlier to newly warmer and moister higher-latitude and higher-altitude zones another is the growth of populations mainly in tropical and subtropical regions in africa asia and latin america together with this latter factor are the increasing populations and population densities in urban centers especially in the regions just cited an additional factor to consider is whether there is accessibility to populations by healthcare workers or by people to healthcare clinics or hospitals well-staffed and well-stocked with necessary pharmaceuticals certainly future planning has to include funding to support research to develop vaccines for diseases that do not have vaccination as an option against an illness eg malaria dengue fever  in addition improvement of vaccines that are available but that are not completely effective in terms of protection or the length of time they are effective should be a priority in pharmaceutical and biotechnology laboratories scientists presented a fine review of the status of vaccine research from the design and development of vaccines to discussion of vaccines and infectious diseases eg hiv malaria tuberculosis pneumococcal disease and influenza 17 they also discuss vaccines against enteric infections and viral diseases of livestock as well as vaccines against non-infectious diseases eg cancer and against chronic non-infectious diseases continued and repeated education classes on how to prevent the transmission of diseases and free supplies of materials that work to this end eg insecticide-treated bed netting male and female condoms are essential to reducing the prevalence and incidence of diseases as are safe water and uncontaminated food as new medicines or combinations of medicines are developed tested and found to be effective in controlling diseases they become part of the protocol for either curing disease or controlling disease to reduce transmission while allowing persons to carry on with their lives in these times of easy and rapid migration one wonders whether screening of visitors or immigrants for diseases known to be endemic or active in the countries or regions from which they come should be required so as to prevent a carrier from infecting others and spreading a disease eg chagas disease cholera tuberculosis this was done at airports during the sars scare for people leaving or entering a country eg china and likely limited the transmission of the sars virus and spread of the disease preparedness for a disease outbreak response to an outbreak and management of resources during and post-outbreak are the keys to adapting to health threats that could affect future generations this means developing the capability to extend the reach of health services to regions where climate change brings warmer moister conditions to higher-latitude and higher-altitude ecosystems that are now reached by disease vectors that have expanded into these formerly cooler and drier environments as a result of global warming adapting to this reality and planning ahead makes it possible to deal with and stem an incipient outbreak of disease before it is transmitted and spread to the general population this becomes essential when there is a future disease outbreak in large dense populations in tropical and subtropical urban centers as well as those in regions warmed and humidified by climate change to subtropical and tropical settings remember that urban populations worldwide especially in africa asia and latin america are where much of the global population growth will take place during the next few generations under these conditions diseases can spread rapidly in many ways these include from bites of vectors by respired droplets after an infected person coughs or sneezes and by touching surfaces bearing viruses bacteria or parasites diseases are also spread by ingestion of contaminated water andor tainted food and by other methods of infection transmission disease transmission can be checked by rapid response teams with appropriate and sufficient supplies to treat and perhaps places to quarantine those in the infected population lastly it must be noted that there are many other diseases in addition to those cited previously for which prevention treatment and cures are research priorities in laboratories worldwide in addition there are addiction diseases that can trigger health problems in important segments of society these include smoking eg emphysema lung cancer alcoholism eg cirrhosis of the liver drugs eg various psychological and physical ills and overeating obesity diabetes high blood pressure adaptation to these health threats involves public education forums through various media outlets counseling and sponsored groups with their individual group meeting and programs are assisting many in breaking from an addiction to the benefit of a healthier life adaptation to meet the health challenges in the past and in contemporary times has been a slow progressive adventure with many successes but with much yet to be done this is the planned path for the future meet the challenges of societal health threats resolve many and keep researching to resolve others a special ipcc report in 2012 examines in a general way adaptation to a changing climate as a risk management approach 18 it uses pre-planning to reduce exposure and vulnerability to extreme hazard events by preparing for them beforehand responding to their impacts on people structures and infrastructure and having in place recovery systems that can act when a danger condition eases in this way there will be an ability of populations to cope with future risks brought on by a changing force with which a hazard impacts a community changes in the frequency of an occurrence and extension of the spatial reach of its destructive power much of this has been discussed in the chapters of the book you are reading an understanding of what is being done now to adapt to the various problems society faces during the second decade of the twenty-first stimulates proposals of how to adapt to them as global conditions change in the future to this end the world bank commissioned a study on the effects global warming as it increased from 08 c that exists on our planet now to what can be expected if the warming reached 2 c a change that many scientists believe we can adapt to and then reached 4 c as warming continues 19 the study centered on regions with high population growth and great susceptibility to be negatively impacted by climate changes 1 sub-saharan africa where food production is at risk 2 southeast asia where coastal zones and productivity are at risk and 3 south asia where there could be extremes of water scarcity and excess the effects of higher temperatures from global warming and climate change included what has been discussed in previous chapters of this book heat drought sea level rise coastal zones typhoons flooding river runoff water availability ecosystem shifts crop yields fishing aquaculture livestock health and poverty and tourism projections such as those published in the world bank study give impetus to governments international institutions multinational companies private foundations and ngos to think now to invest now and to research now for adaptations that can be realized in good time and that will provide global citizenry with a good quality of life where needed in this book we have examined existing human populations and the problems they are experiencing in the second decade of the twenty-first century and have also considered growing populations globally and additional problems future generations will experience we have discussed strategies on how to cope with many-faceted threats to citizens these include how to nourish those who need food and water how to shelter people safely from natural and anthropogenic hazards how to provide them with healthcare education and employment and how to prepare them for the evolving global warming and the physical and biological dangers that ensue from climate change given the present global conditions with about 14  of our earths population suffering from malnutrition and more than 21  not having access to safe water our capability of nourishing a billion and a half more people by 2035 is in question also problematical is our capability to provide for an additional billion people 15 years later or a total of at least 103 billion people by the turn of the century that is if we reach those population figures or have population crashes such as from pandemics that can kill scores of millions if a disease is not immediately treatable or an unlikely but possible nuclear conflagration that could do the same less likely yet is an explosion of a small asteroid or comet in the atmosphere such as happened in a poorly inhabited area of siberia in 1908 here an exploding mass more than 60 m in size knocked down millions of trees in an area greater than 2000 km2 close to 800 mi2 with energy thought to be 1000 times greater than the hiroshima atomic bomb clearly such an event could kill the population of a megacity if it were to occur another question is whether national governments are economically strong enough and have the will to set priorities that adopt strategies to protect citizens from natural eg earthquakes and anthropogenic eg pollution hazards as well as from extreme weather conditions that are supported by global warming  pollution of the atmosphere but are naturally occurring countries can also improve social and economic conditions by investing in health care and education for their citizens in order to form a sound and knowledgeable cadre that would be attractive to investors interested in locating a development project that would provide employment again this is in question given limited national economic capabilities and the increasing numbers of people to be accommodated especially in several developing and less developed countries in africa asia latin america and the middle east at this point we must ask what is the carrying capacity of the earth have we reached it at 7 billion given the billions who are today under served in developing and less developed countries some scientists will answer yes whereas others believe that advances in agriculture and technology can allow population expansion although to what point is not defined can countries that are poisoning their environments do a turn around to save their citizens from grief can they exert controls on operations that create unhealthy conditions that sicken people lessen agricultural production and otherwise disrupt local regional and global ecosystems at the expense of maintaining their gdp and increasing it this is not the case for many nations today that do not want to acknowledge that changes tomorrow may be too late and that the future begins now without action now to activate programs to sustain and nurture our ecosystem earth the future is bleak for many and bright for a few with action now we can strive toward an equalization in benefits for all citizens the intergovernmental panel on climate change completed the fifth assessment report april 2014 after this book was written climate change 2014 impacts adaptations and vulnerability it is a comprehensive and important contribution to the challenges presented to society by climate change now and in the future and how to manage them for the good of society the full text is online at wwwipccchreportar5
  molecular and nanotechnologic approaches to etiologic diagnosis of infectious syndromes sathish sankar mageshbabu ramamurthy balaji nandagopal padma srikanth ganesh venkatraman gopalan sridharan   a number of diverse infectious agents cause diseases that present with similar signs and symptoms characteristic of an infectious syndrome this classically sets them apart from other clinical infectious conditions that are caused by an easily identifiable organism or a small number of related organisms eg typhoid fever some such syndromes may have a bacterial viral or other etiology diseases of infectious etiology including common infectious diseases such as dengue fever are increasingly presenting with protean manifestations or with atypical manifestations presently a paradigm shift is occurring in the clinicians approach to the patient as having an acute febrile illness the syndromic approach in which the clinician recognizes that there are multiple different infectious agents that could potentially cause the disease successful treatment of such patients requires identification of the specific causative agent and therefore relies on laboratory diagnostic packages provided for specific syndromes many of the descriptions of such syndromes have been based on isolation of the pathogen andor serologic diagnosis this information on the etiology has enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these syndromes but the methods that have been employed have been cumbersome and slow presently the approach is to develop a single technologic platform-based diagnosis for distinct infectious syndromes with a rapid turn-around time 8 hours developments in molecular detection have facilitated such an approach using pcr and its modifications dna microarrays and nanotechnology the use of multiplex pcr mpcr and dna microarrays has already begun to move from the research arena into clinical service laboratories however nanotechnology is still an emerging field with the exciting potential for diagnosis of infectious diseases nanomaterials are versatile and can be engineered into biofunctionalized particles the field of pathogen detection has begun to exploit the unique optical and magnetic properties of nanoscale materials such as fluorescent nanoparticles metallic nanostructures and super-paramagnetic nanoparticles for bioimaging and detection of infectious micro-organisms1 this article lists important and widely recognized entities of infectious syndromes and reviews the recent literature regarding molecular and nanotechnology-based methods used in their diagnosis a literature search on this topic reveals a paucity of specific information that would give insights into syndromes of infectious origin there are few research laboratories and biotechnology companies trying to develop useful devices for infectious syndromes the available literature has certain limitations from a geographic point of view because the researchers have developed platforms for comprehensive diagnosis of important syndromes in their regions the review shows the lacunae that researchers in tropical countries must address when developing appropriate platforms that are relevant to their regions for use in hospitals and public health laboratories to date research has focused on the generation of genomic information directly from samples such as tissue or blood in certain instances generation of information on the genotype of the infectious agent could help to formulate treatment an illustrative example is the treatment of hepatitis c virus hcv infection where the duration of pegylated interferon peg-interferon therapy is determined by the genotype of the viral strain infecting the patient certain post-amplification methods  which include sanger sequencing and pyro sequencing of target genes reverse hybridization and luminex analysis  are coming into use in western countries2 a survey of the published literature indexed in pubmed revealed the use of five different molecular assay technologies that have recently been developed for detection of various microbialviral infections the principles and intended uses of the assays are discussed in this review the term exanthem refers to a rash on the skin which occurs generally in children the rash can spread all over the body it may be caused by micro-organisms and viruses infectious causes however it should be noted that the development of this clinical condition may also be due to exposure to toxins or drugs or it can result from autoimmune disease noninfectious causes some of the infectious etiologies include measles virus rubella virus varicella zoster virus vzv parvovirus b19 human herpesvirus hhv-6 epstein-barr virus ebv enteroviruses and dengue virus bacterial infections such as scarlet fever staphylococcus aureus infections toxic shock syndrome meningococcemia typhoid fever and rickettsial infection may also present as fevers with exanthema research in veterinary diagnostics has made some progress such as establishing a definitive diagnosis of vesicular or vesicular-like lesions in livestock animals it is difficult to achieve a differential etiologic diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv vesicular stomatitis virus vsv and swine vesicular disease virus svdv a rapid method has been described using padlock probes and microarrays to detect and simultaneously differentiate the three viruses in a single reaction the padlock probemicroarray assay the assay had a lower limit of detection of 144 median tissue culture infective doses tcid50 per assay for fmdv 720 tcid50 per assay for vsv and 29 tcid50 per assay for svdv although this method was not evaluated on clinical samples the authors concluded that it is comparable to real-time pcr3 likewise a high-throughput multiplexed assay has been developed for laboratory use to detect and differentiate fmdv from other similar disease-causing viruses the assay simultaneously screens for five rna and two dna viruses by using multiplexed reverse-transcription pcr mrt-pcr amplification coupled with a microsphere hybridization array and flow-cytometric detection the sensitivity of mrt-pcr for fmdv was 935 and the specificity was 919 but this evaluation was performed only on a panel of clinically confirmed positive and negative cases4 an interesting study described the application of a long oligonucleotide microarray assay for identification of viruses that are known to cause vesicular or vesicular-like lesions in livestock animals the results suggested that the microarray assay could be a valuable tool for diagnosis of vesicular and vesicular-like diseases5 the assay was used on epithelium samples from vesicular lesions but the authors reported difficulty with template preparation furthermore the assay had varied sensitivity for different viruses further validation of the probe sets and optimization of sample preparation procedures are needed in our opinion it would be useful to have a diagnostic device that could correctly identify the etiology of important fever with rash such as measles rubella parvovirus hhv-6 rickettsial rash and scarletinal rash in humans central nervous system cns infections are acutely life threatening and warrant immediate diagnosis to enable specific antimicrobialantiviral therapy the etiology of bacterial meningitis consists of streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae type b neisseria meningitidis and listeria monocytogenes several viral agents that cause aseptic meningitis include members of the genus enterovirus herpes simplex virus hsv and mumps virus encephalitis is an acute inflammation of the white matter of the brain encephalitis with meningitis inflammation of the meninges is known as meningoencephalitis symptoms include headache fever confusion drowsiness and fatigue more severe symptoms include seizuresconvulsions tremors hallucinations and memory problems viral encephalitis may be sporadic or epidemic in its occurrence a common cause of encephalitis in humans is infection with hsv this condition occurs sporadically in all parts of the globe in contrast some viral encephalitis can occur as epidemics in geographically restricted areas dependent on vector distribution  eg japanese encephalitis which occurs in south and southeast asia encephalitis can also be caused by a bacterial infection such as bacterial meningitis spreading directly to the brain primary encephalitis or it may be a complication of a current infectious disease such as syphilis secondary encephalitis certain parasitic or protozoal infestations such as toxoplasmosis malaria or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems lyme disease andor bartonella henselae may also cause encephalitis boriskin et al6 developed a microarray-based virus detection assay for 13 viral agents that cause meningitis or encephalitis by targeting 38 target genes the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the assay were established as being 93 and 100 respectively the results were comparable to those of uniplex pcr which is considered a gold standard the authors investigated a variety of dna and rna neurotropic viruses including members of the herpesviridae and picornaviridae families the utility of this assay is limited because it is virus specific and strain-specific variations cannot be detected which could be a limitation for rna viruses because of genetic variation nucleotide polymorphism among rna virus strains in the antemortem diagnosis of infectious meningoencephalitis affecting humans molecular testing has gained significant currency a modification of pcr which uses consensus degenerate hybrid primers codehop has been used to identify and characterize novel infectious agents molecular testing is also gaining acceptance in veterinary infectious disease diagnosis tests such as conventional and real-time pcr have been shown to be useful in diagnosis of cns infections caused by agents such as canine distemper virus toxoplasma gondii neospora caninum rickettsial species and others the codehop approach has been used for canine meningoencephalitis including assays for rickettsial organisms borrelia spp bartonella spp and some viral families7 it must be emphasized though that such reported innovations need thorough evaluation in a clinical setting against tests that could be accepted as a gold standard zheng et al8 developed an mpcr-based dna microarray for simultaneous detection as well as species identification of seven human herpes viruses  namely hsv-1 hsv-2 vzv ebv cytomegalovirus cmv hhv-6a and hhv-6b primers and oligonucleotide probes were targeted at the highly conserved regions of the dna polymerase gene of human herpes viruses dna microarrays were made by printing the oligonucleotide probes onto special glass slides after amplification and labeling with cy5 the pcr products were hybridized on the microarrays chips the technique was compared with taqman probe-based real-time pcr the microarray had a lower limit of detection of 10 copiesl and showed no cross-reaction evaluation was performed on clinical cerebrospinal fluid csf samples from children the assay had sensitivity of 962 and specificity of 993 figure 1 shows the principle of the pcr-based dna microarray

 in a landmark development for diagnosis of neurologic infections shi et al9 reported an evaluation of a pcr micro-array that could detect seven viruses namely hsv-1 hsv-2 vzv ebv cmv hhv-6a and hhv-6b the mpcr product was genotyped by dna microarray technology the multiplex primers and oligonucleotide probes were specific for the highly conserved regions of the dna polymerase gene the assay did not show any non-specificity like the assay developed by zheng et al8 the assay developed by shi et al9 had a lower limit of detection of 10 copies of viral load the authors tested csf samples from children and reported sensitivity of 917 and specificity of 100 similar to the results reported by zheng et al8 a study by gaeta et al10 reported a quantitative real-time pcr assay for detection of six viruses causing meningitis and meningoencephalitis in csf samples the assay was able to detect hsv-1 hsv-2 ebv cmv hhv-6 and vzv correlating with clinical conditions herpes viral co-infections were documented in several patients the lower limit of detection was 250 genome copiesml or 10 copies per reaction the diagnostic sensitivity ranged from 898 to 941 for the different viruses that were tested which would be acceptable for use in clinical laboratories a rapid quantitative real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp assay was developed for detection of japanese encephalitis virus jev targeting the envelope gene the lower limit of detection was less than 1 plaque-forming unit pfu the assay was specific to jev it did not falsely detect other flaviviruses such as dengue virus and west nile virus wnv11 clinical evaluation of such tests is essential before a decision can be made on their usefulness figure 2 shows the principle of the lamp assay

 since cns infections are life threatening an attempt should be made to develop assay systems suitable for comprehensive etiologic diagnosis which would facilitate the prompt initiation of appropriate therapy such measures would be life saving and to a large extent would prevent neurologic sequelae sexually transmitted infections stis are infections of the genitourinary tract that are spread by venereal transmission they affect a wide age group from older teenagers to older adults and their prevalence is increasing stis constitute an infectious syndrome caused by multiple agents including bacteria viruses and parasites several of these infectious are clinically identifiable in males in females the infections may be asymptomatic several stis affect fertility especially among females eg pelvic inflammatory disease a consequence of chlamydial infection this group of infections should be considered high priority for developing accurate and easy pan-diagnostic devices detailed laboratory investigations aid specific diagnosis in both sexes a commercial closed system the cobas 4800 ctng test has been successfully used for high-throughput identification of chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae infections12 the assay was used on urine samples and showed sensitivity of 945 specificity of 995 a negative predictive value of 988 and a positive predictive value of 977 for c trachomatis and corresponding values of 929 100 997 and 100 respectively for n gonorrhoeae for urethralcervical swab specimens the sensitivity specificity negative predictive value and positive predictive value were 920 100 995 and 100 respectively for c trachomatis and 100 994 100 and 900 respectively for n gonorrhoeae it is now very clear that important blood-borne viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv hepatitis b virus hbv and hcv are efficiently transmitted through sexual routes thus assays detecting these viruses could be used in screening blood and blood products and for patients attending sti clinics a method has been developed based on real-time mrt-pcr performed within the microarray hydrogel pads in this assay double-stranded amplification products are simultaneously detected using nonspecific sybr green i dye by testing in separate pads bearing 5-immobilized specific primers it has been evaluated on reference strains and some stored plasma samples the lower limit of detection ranged from 10 to 15 genome equivalents per 25 l reaction assay for the three viruses that were tested the sensitivity and specificity were established to be 10013 globally human papillomavirus hpv is a very important sti agent multiple genotypes of this virus can cause genital warts and certain types of hpv-16 and -18 are now known to be involved in the etiology of cervical cancers early diagnosis of infections of this virus is therefore important a dna microarray chip assay based on light-scattering of aggregated silica nanoparticle probes has been developed14 here target hpv dna is sandwiched between the capture dna immobilized on the chip and the probe dna immobilized on the plain silica nanoparticle the spots where the sandwich reaction occurs appear bright white and are readily distinguishable with the naked eye visual detection was most efficient using 286 nm silica nanoparticles and 200 pm of target dna the authors demonstrated the development of such a portable nanodevice for detection and genotyping of hpv14 the lower limit of detection was 100 pm with a simple microscope illumination system and 200 pm to 1 nm with the naked eye the advantages include the low cost of the light-scattering detector system and the ability to use the system without the device by naked-eye examination also plain silica particles are readily available de mndez et al15 developed a line probe assay for detection and genotyping of hpv dna in abnormal papanicolaoustained cervicovaginal smears this method was reported to be efficient sensitive fast and useful in routine investigation for better clinical management of the patient it should be pointed out that the potential application of the line probe assay has not been sufficiently exploited figure 3 illustrates the principle of this assay

 previously tang et al16 developed a visual gene detection technique with high sensitivity and specificity for clinical applications the visual dna microarray was capable of simultaneous sensitive and specific detection of hiv-1 and treponema pallidum this assay uses a gold label silver stain glss coupled with asymmetric mpcr with this method 5-end amino-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on a glass surface and used as the capturing probes to bind the complementary biotinylated target dna gold-conjugated streptavidins are used in the microarray for specific binding to biotin the microarray spots develop black as a result of the precipitation of silver onto nanogold particles that are bound to streptavidin pcr products of hiv-1 and t pallidum were used as positive controls the results were comparable to real-time pcr findings the lower limit of detection of the assay was 106 copiesml of target dna amplicons prepared by conventional pcr and mpcr but 104 copiesml when prepared by asymmetric pcr and asymmetric mpcr subsequently tang et al17 developed a glss-dependent visual protein micro-array technique for simultaneous sensitive and specific detection of ureaplasma parvum and chlamydia trachomatis the authors used the n-terminus multiple-banded antigen of u parvum and the major outer membrane protein of c trachomatis in this assay the specific antigens are labeled with nanogold-staphylococcal protein a spa and immobilized on a glass surface treated with 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane the bound antigens are recognized by the complementary target antibodies applied to the prepared microarray surface the assay utilizes a sandwich format wherein the nanogold-spa probe is used as an indicator and glss is applied to amplify the detection signals and produce black images on array spots which are visible with the naked eye the lower limit of detection of the protein microarray assay was 2 ngml the sensitivity was comparable to that of the fluorescent detection method the results were found to be consistent with elisa and quantitative real-time pcr assay in clinical samples the current literature documents several successful attempts at developing diagnostic tools to aid diagnosis of the sti syndrome the assays require evaluation at various laboratories for field testing before wide use the majority of hemorrhagic fevers are caused by viruses and so are often termed viral hemorrhagic fevers vhfs this refers to a group of illnesses that are caused by several distinct families of viruses in general the term vhf is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome ie multiple organ systems in the body are affected characteristically the overall vascular system is damaged and the bodys ability to regulate itself is impaired these symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage bleeding however the bleeding itself is rarely life threatening18 the agents of vhf are all enveloped rna viruses their survival is dependent on an animal or insect host called the natural reservoir the viruses are geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live humans are not the natural reservoir for any of these viruses humans are infected when they come into contact with infected hosts however with some viruses after accidental transmission from the host humans can transmit the virus to one another human cases or outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers caused by these viruses occur sporadically and irregularly the occurrence of outbreaks cannot be easily predicted with a few noteworthy exceptions there is no cure or established drug treatment for vhfs because other diseases have similar clinical symptoms specific laboratory diagnostic tests are necessary to provide differential diagnosis especially during outbreaks specific diagnosis would help public health officials to institute appropriate measures to control the outbreak vhfs are caused by four distinct families of rna viruses arenaviridae lassa junin machupo sabia and guanarito filoviridae ebola and marburg bunyaviridae hantavirus and flaviviridae dengue virus and kyasanur forest disease virus all types of vhf are characterized by fever along with bleeding disorders and can progress to high fever shock and death in extreme cases some of the vhf agents cause relatively mild illnesses such as scandinavian nephropathia epidemica while others such as african ebola virus can cause severe life-threatening disease dengue virus causes illnesses ranging from classical dengue fever febrile illness to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome dengue virus has four distinct serotypes 1 through 4 each with the potential to cause clinical disease maneekan et al19 developed a single-tube mrt-pcr with a primer targeting the nonstructural protein region 5 ns5 of the dengue virus genome a highly conserved region for dengue virus serotyping the authors compared the new assay with a well established conventional pcr the mrt-pcr assay had sensitivity of 967 and specificity of 967 the lower limit of detection ranged from 01 to 0001 pfu per assay reaction for the different serotypes tested trombley et al20 designed taqman-based real-time pcr assays for specific and absolute quantitative detection of multiple hemorrhagic fever viruses the authors evaluated 48 formats and found 46 to be virus specific the limit of detection for the assays ranged from 10 to 0001 pfu per assay reaction these assays provided qualitative and quantitative data the clinical evaluation of these assays is awaited figure 4 depicts the taqman principle-based real-time pcr

 it is now recognized that these infections are an emerging disease threat and public health professionals will benefit from laboratories that are able to provide syndromic diagnosis initiatives toward this goal are in progress hepatitis is characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in liver tissue the condition can be self-limiting healing on its own or can progress to fibrosis scarring and cirrhosis hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms but often leads to jaundice anorexia poor appetite and malaise hepatitis is considered acute when it lasts less than 6 months and chronic when it persists for longer a group of viruses known as the hepatitis viruses cause most cases of hepatitis worldwide but hepatitis can also be due to toxins notably alcohol certain medications and plants other infections and autoimmune diseases acute hepatitis can be caused by hepatitis a virus hav hbv hcv hepatitis d virus hdv hepatitis e virus hev hsv cmv ebv yellow fever virus adenoviruses non-viral infections with t gondii leptospira species and coxiella burnetii hbv with or without superinfection with hdv and hcv are important agents in blood-borne transmissions nucleic acid testing platforms to detect hiv hbv and hcv include branched dna assay and real-time mpcr assays for use in blood banks and blood product testing21 because these viruses are either difficult or dangerous to culture such molecular methods have become the gold standard22 tang et al23 developed a novel assay based on an electrochemical immunosensor array for simultaneous detection of 5-type hepatitis virus antigens ie hav hbv hcv hdv and hev the 5-type hepatitis virus antibodies were immobilized on an electrochemical sensor array using nanogold particles and protein a as individual matrices the immunosensor array was used to capture their corresponding antigens from the sample solution with a one-step capture format the analyte detection depends on the electrical potential change from the native state to the analyte-bound state by using a two-electrode system all five types of hepatitis virus antigens were identified by the immunosensor assay within 5 minutes with a detection limit of 10 ngml moreover the assay did not show any cross-reaction or nonspecific binding this chip-based immunosensor array opens up new opportunities for high-throughput multi-analyte immunoassays for simple nanodevices that physicians could use at the point of care jothikumar et al24 developed a real-time rt-pcr assay for quantitative detection of hav and coxsackievirus b3 from environmental samples the extracted rna was compatible with quantitative rt-pcr with detection sensitivity of 08 pfu per reaction on the basis of these results the authors concluded that the developed assay could be applicable to detection of other pathogens in water and food wang et al25 reported a quantum dot qd-dna nanosensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret for detection of dna and a single mismatch in the hbv genome by examination of a synthetic 30-mer oligonucleotide containing the mutations rtm204m and rtm204v in the reverse transcriptase rt gene indicating resistance to lamuvidine used in the treatment of hbv infection the study used water-soluble cadmium selenidezinc sulfide qds with 3-mercaptopropionic acid subsequently oligonucleotides were attached to the qd surface to form functional qd-dna conjugates sandwiched hybrids were formed with the addition of dna targets and cy5-modified signal dnas into the qd-dna conjugates the resulting assembly allows the cy5 fluorophore the acceptor and the qd the donor to be brought into proximity resulting in fluorescence emission from the acceptor by means of fret following illumination of the donor the authors used an oligonucleotide ligation assay to detect single-base mutants in the hbv genome they showed that if there was a single-base mismatch this was recognized by the ligase hence the detection probe was not ligated and no cy5 emission was produced because of the lack of fret the qd-dna fret-based nanosensor assay had a lower limit of detection of 4 nm the advantages of this technique include the simplicity and efficiency of using a multi-label plate assay to detect single-base mutants in target dna using multicolor dyes rather than using a fluorimeter fluorometric methods are more complicated and time consuming for detecting and characterizing signals from such a qd-dna fret system this method is simple and efficient and could be potentially used for high-throughput multiplex detection of target dna and the mutants figure 5 shows the principle of qds

 hepatitis of different viral etiologies occurs in different parts of the globe in situations such as water-borne epidemics hav hev and iatrogenic situations hbv hcv the practicing physician will benefit from information on specific etiology for appropriate management with specific antiviral therapy quantitative assays such as those based on real-time pcr will give valuable information that will help in the monitoring of treatment diarrheal diseases affect all age groups and occur in many parts of the world especially in developing countries where children are particularly affected and can die from these diseases these illnesses can occur as epidemics via either water-borne or food-borne routes the etiology can be bacterial viral or protozoan early etiologic diagnosis could allow preventive public health measures and appropriate therapy enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec is a common pathogen worldwide and causes infectious diarrhea especially travelers diarrhea conventionally the organisms were characterized by physiologic assays immunoassays and pcr-based methods for detection of etec the heat-labile enterotoxin andor the heat-stable enterotoxin separate serotyping methods using antisera were required to determine the etec serogroup wang et al26 developed a dna microarray that could simultaneously detect enterotoxin genes and the 19 most common o-serogroup genes in etec strains the random pcr strategy used by the authors documented an effective alternative to mpcr for detection of pathogens using dna microarrays you et al27 developed a microarray technique for detection and identification of enteropathogenic bacteria at the species and subspecies levels from stool specimens the pathogens that were targeted were e coli vibrio cholerae vibrio parahaemolyticus salmonella enterica campylobacter jejuni shigella and yersinia enterocolitica the target was labeled with a fluorescence dye by mpcr and hybridized to the specific virulence gene probes immobilized on a microchip the dna microarray detected pathogens at concentrations as low as 58 genome copiesl the findings were compared and confirmed with species-specific conventional pcr nested pcr and sequencing this technique appears to be an attractive diagnostic tool for rapid and simultaneous identification of multiple enteropathogenic pathogens in clinical practice especially in patients with infectious diarrhea a combined mpcr and dna microarray with tyramide signal amplification was developed by jin et al28 for simultaneous detection of six human diarrheal pathogens namely yersinia enterocolitica shigella spp salmonella typhi v cholerae e coli o157h7 and brucella spp the method also distinguished v cholerae serotype o1 from serotype o139 and e coli o1 57h7 from o1 57non-h7 the assay was found to be 100 specific for diagnostic detection and surveillance of multiple human pathogens with a detection limit of 103 colony-forming units cfuml the sensitivity of dna microarray was based on the cut-off values and hybridization signals an mpcr assay was developed by morin et al29 for simultaneous detection of e coli o157h7 v cholerae o1 and s typhi targeting specific unique regions the assay was found to detect as few as 30 cells of e coli o157h7 and s typhi in clinical isolates assays such as these will need testing on clinical samples further to testing on isolates li et al30 developed a dna microarray targeting o-serotype-specific genes to detect ten serotypes of shigella shigella sonnei shigella flexneri type 2a shigella boydii types 7 9 13 16 and 18 and shigella dysenteriae types 4 8 and 10 and five serotypes of e coli o55 o111 o114 o128 and o157 the detection sensitivity was 50 ng genomic dna or 104 cfuml in mock stool specimens the results suggest that the assay could be useful in clinical diagnosis food safety and epidemiologic surveillance diarrheal diseases  especially those caused by diarrheagenic e coli and certain viruses such as rotavirus norovirus and other similar viruses  are today recognized as a global problem the problem is more severe in poor developing countries in tropical regions specific etiologic information is important for public health professionals to implement preventive measures here too assays using the dna-microarray or real-time mpcr platforms would be advantageous ophthalmic infections include infections of the conjunctiva conjunctivitis cornea keratitis both cornea and conjunctiva keratoconjunctivitis and the interior of the eye endopthalmitis these conditions are caused by different agents which include bacteria viruses and fungi viral infections tend to occur as epidemics and bacterial infections occur as small outbreaks hlinomazov et al31 evaluated quantitative real-time pcr for detection of hsv1 in corneal swabs an important causative agent in ophthalmic infections such as keratitis and keratouveitis the eligene hsv1 rt kit is an in vitro medical diagnostic device intended for use with the applied biosystems real time 7300 instrument abi7300 applied biosystems foster city ca usa this kit allows absolute quantitative analysis of the pcr product using elidna hsv1 qrt standard elisabeth pharmacon prague czech republic the detection limit described by the kit was 10 genome copies per reaction the results correlated with the clinical picture of the disease and offered exact identification of the viral dna in patients with herpes stromal keratitis a study was carried out using quantitative real-time pcr for detection of cmv in patients with epithelial stromal or endothelial keratitis of unknown origin the authors investigated different types of sample including tears corneal scrapings and aqueous humor specimens the study documented the utility of the quantitative pcr assay for diagnosis and monitoring of the clinical course of the disease32 since infections of the eye have the potential to cause vision loss early diagnosis and treatment are important because of the varied etiologies a dna microarray approach may hold the key congenital infections are infections that are likely to affect the fetus in utero if the mother has an active infection these are classically known as the torch agents which refer to infections with t gondii rubella virus cmv and hsv in developing countries some medical experts extend this acronym to torchs including syphilis caused by t pallidum the list may also be extended to include less common agents in this condition such as vzv hbv and hiv in hiv infection maternal transmission from the infected mother to the newborn occurs mainly during the childs birth for molecular testing of hiv either pro-viral dna or rna is targeted in blood or in plasma respectively alternatively hiv p24 antigen is tested to determine infection in infants using heated plasma or serum samples for early diagnosis levels of this antigen are reported to be significantly higher in transmitting mothers than in non-transmitting mothers33 early diagnosis of maternal infections that have a bearing on fetal health and development of the newborn is of great importance to obstetricians and perinatalogists several infections are recognized in this category and there have been some important developments in successful diagnosis of the multiple etiologies for example recent work toward a common molecular method for diagnosis of the torch group of infections has led to development of a qd-based protein microarray to simultaneously detect torch-related antibodies in sera the technique combines the principles of immunofiltration and qd-labeled probes for detection34 the newly developed assay was compared with standard elisa methods and was found to give statistically similar results but with a quicker turn-around time thus offering a rapid diagnostic tool the development and commercialization of such assays by investigators represent a great stride forward in infectious disease diagnostics in this review we use the term febrile illness to refer to communicable exogenous infections that present with pyrexia of short duration 2 weeks acute febrile illness this would include certain viral and bacterial infections some of these such as dengue fever and typhoid fever may have some distinguishing features to enable the physician to make a provisional diagnosis eg dengue fever is characterized by severe myalgia and retro-orbital pain whereas typhoid fever usually presents with prodromal gastrointestinal symptoms the other category is pyrexia of unknown origin puo very often patients are treated empirically and a specific diagnosis would obviously help in determining the appropriate use of antimicrobial or supportive therapy the classical definition of puo is fever of more than 102f for at least 3 weeks duration with a cause that remains undiagnosed even after detailed investigations generally puo is caused by bacterial or viral agents these include improperly investigated typhoid fever melioidosis tuberculosis q fever early hiv infection hbv infections and ebv infections 
salmonella spp are very important causative agents of food-borne disease a low-density dna-microarray containing 281 oligonucleotide probes has been developed to detect a wide range of specific marker genes associated with antibiotic resistance cell envelope structures mobile genetic elements and pathogenicity of this group of organisms a recently published study indicated that this dna microarray assay may be suitable for use in monitoring of food safety35 such measures are being implemented in developed countries including the us a rapid and sensitive microarray was designed for detection of chikungunya virus jev yellow fever virus dengue virus hantavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and h5n1 avian influenza virus in patients with puo the panel included nine genera and 16 virus species consensus genus-specific primers were used to reverse transcribe the viral target genes so as to minimize the interference of other viruses 70-mer oligonucleotides were used at the genus level and 50-mer oligonucleotides were used at the species level the second-strand synthesis was carried out with random primers the amplified products were labeled and processed for microarray analyses we agree with the authors who stated that this assay could potentially be used for clinical diagnosis36 a one-step single tube real-time rt-lamp assay was developed and evaluated with standard strains and clinical specimens spiked with different concentrations of virus strains for detecting the envelope gene of wnv37 the specificity of the rt-lamp assay was validated by the absence of any cross-reaction with other closely related members of the flavivirus group these results indicate that the rt-lamp assay is extremely rapid cost effective and highly sensitive detection limit  01 pfu of virus and has potential usefulness for rapid comprehensive wnv surveillance along with virus isolation andor serology37 the same group has developed a dengue virus serotype-specific rt-lamp assay in clinical isolates and serum samples from confirmed cases which did not cross react with wnv or jev the rt-lamp assay showed sensitivity of 011 pfu of virus 10- to 100-fold more sensitive than rt-pcr in patient serum samples with reference to the results of virus isolation the assay had sensitivity of 100 and specificity of 9338 respiratory infections are caused by a variety of microbial and viral agents some are important as opportunistic infections communicable agents causing infections that are community acquired may cause lower respiratory tract infections lrtis or upper respiratory tract infections urtis lrtis are more serious and may be caused by s pneumoniae or viruses respiratory syncytial virus rsv causes serious lrtis in young children in several parts of the globe in recent years two important global concerns have been avian influenza and pandemic swine influenza a study by agrawal et al39 demonstrated the use of antibody-conjugated nanoparticles for rapid sensitive and quantitative detection of rsv in this study dual-color qds or fret nanobeads were used for virus detection the nano-particles were characterized for sensitivity and specificity on cell culture lysates of different viruses the assay needs to be evaluated on clinical samples wang et al40 developed and evaluated a novel mpcr-based reverse line blot assay for simultaneous detection of 12 potential respiratory pathogens in children with community-acquired pneumonia the pathogens included s aureus s pneumoniae streptococcus pyogenes moraxella catarrhalis h influenzae h influenzae type b bordetella pertussis klebsiella pneumoniae legionella pneumophila mycobacterium tuberculosis chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumonia s pneumoniae and h influenza including type b were the most important pathogens detected multiple pathogens two or more were detected in 35 of specimens this study showed the assay to be a sensitive tool for identification of respiratory pathogens a recent development has been the use of dna-microarray platform technology the virochip for detection of viruses causing pediatric respiratory tract infections41 the virochip was compared with conventional direct fluorescent antibody dfa and pcr-based testing for detection of respiratory viruses on nasopharyngeal aspirate samples the virochip showed sensitivity of 8590 and specificity of 99 for rsv influenza a and the rhinovirusesenteroviruses that were tested it showed 19 greater detection than dfa interestingly the virochip was able to detect mixed infections as well unlike dfa and pcr41 in an important study on acute lrtis a cost-effective mpcr assay for use on nasopharyngeal aspirates was reported for detection of rsv influenza viruses parainfluenza viruses and human metapneumovirus the mpcr assay detected respiratory viruses in 352 of 301 samples this study in young children showed predominance of rsv mixed viral infections were detected in 188 of the children42 use of the more recently introduced rt-lamp assay has been reported for highly pathogenic avian h5n1 influenza virus infection43 the authors reported 100-fold higher sensitivity of this assay compared with one-step rt-pcr the assay was highly specific for the h5 subtype the development of platforms for agents causing lrtis is an exciting improvement in the field of molecular diagnosis of respiratory infections the term opportunistic infection refers to a group of infections causing diseases such as encephalitis or lymphadenitis in primarily or secondarily immunocompromised patients eg hiv-infected individuals or transplant recipients opportunistic infections can be caused by viruses bacteria protozoa or fungi the number of agents is very large and pathogen-specific diagnosis is available for the vast majority of these there are assays available that are designed to identify the pathogen causing encephalitis in immunocompromised patients for example real-time pcr assays for dna neurotropic viruses44 use of a pcr-based low-density dna microarray has been reported for pathogens known to cause granulomatous lymphadenitis45 the assay was used on dna extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue the mpcr amplicons were hybridized to glass slides containing probes from mycobacterium spp yersinia spp bartonella henselea and t gondii the study found that the technique was useful in making a specific diagnosis though it would benefit from inclusion of a broader range of probe sequences for additional species-specific assays the number of immunosuppressed patients is growing worldwide as a result of the widespread increase in transplantation programs in different parts of the globe as well as the still-smoldering hiv pandemic consequently the frequency of opportunistic infections is also increasing presently there are several platforms based on real-time mpcr or dna microarrays for important viral infections especially of the herpes group as discussed in section 22646 data available from different areas of the globe indicate similarity in the etiology of certain infectious conditions where the agents are latent in individuals and cause endogenous infections such as opportunistic infections among immunosuppressed individuals many of these infections are not communicable ie they are not transmissible to members of the community except in special settings however the vast majority of the infections are communicable exogenous and pose a public health threat because of their ability to cause outbreaks or epidemic infections such communicable diseases may spread globally eg avian flu and pandemic influenza swine flu whereas other infectious syndromes such as vhfs and some acute febrile illnesses occur in geographically restricted areas the etiology of several such syndromes has to be studied from region to region to identify the individual pathogenic agents in a given syndrome the individual agents causing geographically prevalent syndromes vary because of host and environmental factors eg poor sanitation and unsafe water and vectors the vectors arthropods or animal carriers zoonotic hosts are different in different geographic areas thus the etiology of infectious syndromes differs between north and south america between africa and asia and distinctly between temperate and tropical climates for example an important cause of febrile illness in india is s typhi which causes typhoid fever whereas in the far east the most frequent cause of febrile illness is burkholderia pseudomallei which causes melioidosis in the context of geographic variation of pathogen and disease manifestation one could cite the example of hantaviruses which are widely distributed rodent-borne viruses47 this group of viruses can cause two important syndromes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs in eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the americas48 hfrs is a clinically distinct febrile illness characterized by a hemorrhagic rash with renal dysfunction seoul virus is a hantavirus that is transmitted by domestic rats rattus rattus and has a global distribution because of the movement of rats to new areas through international shipping49 the disease caused by seoul virus infection hfrs therefore occurs around the globe sin nombre virus and other new world hantaviruses are transmitted by rodents of the subfamily sigmodontinae new world rats and deer mice5051 and cause hantavirus cardiac pulmonary syndrome hcps in the americas andes virus is transmitted by long-tailed pygmy rice rats and causes a severe form of hcps in south america5253 hence geographic region-specific data are vital before designing laboratory diagnostic tools another outstanding example of geographic variation is the absence of yellow fever virus which is transmitted by the mosquito aedes aegyptii in india this vector is involved in transmission of both dengue virus and yellow fever virus in south america whereas in india the same species of mosquito is involved in transmission of dengue virus and certain other flaviviruses that are not common in south america interestingly certain infectious agents are seen in geographically circumscribed areas  for example kyasunur forest disease is transmitted by hemophagous ticks and is seen only in the shimoga district of karnataka india54 similarly bartonella bacilliformis is transmitted by sandflies of genus lutzomyia causing oroya fever which is seen only in south america55 rocky mountain spotted fever is often considered endemic only in the us56 it is our premise that there is a need for epidemiologic surveillance data to determine the identity of infectious agents causing an infectious syndrome that is predominant in each region so that assays for appropriate syndromic diagnosis can be developed infectious disease diagnosis has historically been based on clinical acumen and laboratory procedures such as media-based culture for bacteria cell culture for viruses microscopy and serology often laboratory investigations have focused on established pathogens that are linked to the clinical conditions in essentially a hit or miss approach this approach is now considered by experts to be highly inefficient it is imperative that comprehensive epidemiologic data are obtained to allow development of assays that could be used in a given region of the world or globally current trends in the development of molecular and nanotechnology-based diagnostic tools are very encouraging the molecular techniques that hold special promise in this area are pcr-based dna microarrays realtime mpcr and nanotechnology-based devices for nanoscale reactions wherein the analyte is detected by a biosensor  the importance of understanding the humananimal

 d   the humananimal interface constitutes a well-recognized barrier for cross-species transmission of infectious agents that is increasingly appreciated in the one-health concept it depends on the continuum of contacts between humans and animals either directly or indirectly through their products and their environments the humananimal interface has sustained horizontal transmissions of so-called zoonotic pathogens from animals to humans causing individual cases of disease or sparking outbreaks of variable magnitude some of them eventually leading to devastating plagues arguably the humananimal interface has also mediated the vertical transmission and co-evolution of infectious agents from primates via early hominins to homo sapiensso-called heirloom pathogens cockburn 1971 these eventually resulted in the evolution and establishment of either well adapted non-pathogenic agents or remnants thereof such as endogenous retroviruses or alternatively of well adapted human infectious agents that developed into human pathogens with relatively high species specificity although generally less commonly appreciated the humananimal interface has also allowed the horizontal introduction of human pathogens into animal populations and of animal pathogens into new geographical areas and new host species the latter introductions have been driven to a large extent by human activities from ancient colonization of new worlds to more recent global trade and travel practices the humananimal interface has existed since the first bipedal steps of mankind and has undergone perpetual changes as human societies developed fig 1 it continues to face substantial changes today all the more dramatic as environmental and anthropogenic changes affecting humananimal interactions are accelerating dramatically understanding this versatile humananimal interface is crucial for characterizing the permanent yet continuously evolving risks of cross-species transmission of pathogens between animals and humans the attributes of the interface across centuries associated risks and illustrative examples of landmark as well as less known cross-species transmission events are the subject of this review
 the oldest putative hominins ardipithecus kadabba sahelanthropus tchadensis and orrorin tugenensis date back from the late miocene some 67 million years ago mya haile-selassie et al 2004 brunet et al 2002 senut et al 2001 femurs of the latter species provide the earliest evidence for bipedality the discovery of more than 110 specimens of a descendant hominin species ardipithecus ramidus dated from the pliocene 44 mya together with more than 150000 specimens of contemporaneous plant and animal fossils unveiled some of the paleobiology and ecology of the first hominins that lived in africa gibbons 2009 although earlier species may have been more primitive in a number of characters these three genera appear to be very similar they were probably largely bipedal although in a primitive way retaining arboreal abilities they inhabited woodlands with patches of forests and were more omnivorous than extant apes they likely fed both in trees and on the ground of browse and fruits and probably occasionally of eggs and small animals the shape and size of their canines indicate that they were less socially aggressive than extant apes later hominins australopithecus spp and paranthropus spp spanning from approximately 4 to 1 mya were fully bipedal and typically occupied a wider niche from woodland to grassland and more open environments their omnivorous diet was more flexible and included harder more brittle and more abrasive food including meat based on recent findings the usage of stone tools for flesh removal from bones and access to bone marrow dates back from at least 34 mya before the emergence of the genus homo about 11 million years later mcpherron et al 2010 although the pathogen legacy of early hominins to ourand sister extinctspecies may be regarded as largely speculative phylogenetic analyzes reveal long associations and co-speciation of a number of pathogens with the developing human species most compelling evidence has been obtained from distinctive patterns of genetic evolution of viruses from diverse families as well as of a few species of mycobacteria protozoans and ectoparasites the phylogeny of which mirrors that of their hosts a classic example is that of lice species which are strict ectoparasites of birds and mammals co-speciation of pediculus lice in primates is indicated by the divergence of the species parasitizing humans on the one hand and chimpanzees on the other some 56 mya around the time of divergence of the lineages of their respective host species weiss 2009 high host species specificity is a characteristic of most of so-called heirloom pathogens and the persistence or chronicity of the infection they typically cause appears to be a common determinant for co-speciation especially for host species living in social groups isolation of host populations upon geographical or behavioral separation likely resulted in isolation of pathogen populations and pathogen population bottlenecks leading the way to further diversification van blerkom 2003 together with strong selective pressures exerted by the host this is believed as the dominant force that led to correlations between host and pathogen phylogenies revealing ancient host-pathogen associations both representatives of dna and rna viruses have been proposed as ancient pathogens of hominins that eventually co-speciated with the human species the relative genetic stability of most dna virusesof which replication accuracy is safe-guarded by the host error-correcting machineryand their tendency to cause persistent infection likely have facilitated their host-linked evolution strong evidence for co-speciation with hominids exists at least for members of the herpes- papilloma- and polyomaviridae families van blerkom 2003 these three families of viruses have in common a wide host range but relatively strict species specificity persistence or chronicity of infection and intimate transmission modes mainly associated with mucosal skin or blood-borne contacts because of the similarity of their replicative strategy with that of dna phages herpesviruses are regarded as ancient viruses of which direct ancestors may have arisen at the dawn of parasitism phylogenetic analyzes of the genes of numerous species of herpesviruses revealed that their evolution and diversification closely followed that from their invertebrate all the way to their mammalian host species pointing to co-speciation mcgeoch et al 2000 2006 humans are infected with eight species of herpesviruses belonging to the three subfamilies of - - and -herpesviruses these subfamilies comprise both avian and mammalian viruses they arose around the time of the divergence of mammals from their reptilian ancestors some 180220 mya because birds and mammals diverged about 310 mya the emergence of avian -herpesviruses in a more recent era 80120 mya most likely indicates cross-species horizontal transmission between mammals and birds on the other hand the timescale of diversification of mammalian herpesviruses in these three subfamilies approximates that of mammalian diversification in particular the - and -herpesviruses and to a lesser extent the -herpesviruses show tight correlations with the phylogenies of primates rodents ungulates and carnivores fig 2 early hominins thus were likely already infected by viruses of each subfamily the most recent common ancestor mrca of herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 1-herpesviruses is estimated to have occurred about 8 mya further indicating that early homininslike humans todaywere already infected with a number of herpesviruses interestingly herpesviruses contain a repertoire of genes of host origin of which the products interfere with host immune responses and cellular regulation pathways these gene orthologs were captured by herpesviruses since the time of their emergence wang et al 2007 some are common to members of the three subfamilies indicating ancient capture others have been captured more recently sometimes independently in different lineages which can further be used to support a history of co-speciation similar to the herpesviruses poxviruses have a long history of gene capture resulting in gene orthologs that can provide insights into their past evolution mclysaght et al 2003 although the phylogeny of poxviruses tends to mirror that of their vertebrate hosts these viruses are also known to readily cross-species barriers one member of the poxviridae family molluscum contagiosum is nevertheless recognized as an ancient pathogen of hominins van blerkom 2003
 the evolutionary histories of members of the papilloma- and polyomaviridae families are other examples of likely host-linked evolution with phylogenetic trees largely congruent with the phylogeny of their mammalian host species van blerkom 2003 however their phylogenies are more complex than those of herpesviruses suggesting additional evolutionary mechanisms behind their diversity including cross-species transmission and recombination similarly it has been proposed that viruses belonging to the parvo- and adenoviridae families have co-speciated with their vertebrate hosts and infected early hominins yet definite evidence for this is lacking in contrast to dna viruses rna viruses have an error-prone genome leading to faster rates of evolutionalthough varying greatlyand tend to more often cause acute infections at least in host species living in social groups they have an unmatched ability to evolve and adapt to new host species and thus are generally less species-specific than dna viruses as a result cross-species transmission of rna viruses generally does occur more readily together with highly variable rates of evolution this makes it difficult to trace with certainty their ancient evolution van blerkom 2003 for example it is yet not possible to draw definitive conclusions on the possible associations of some of the hepatitis viruses with early hominins in particular hepatitis b virus belonging to the hepadnaviridae family dna viruses that use a rna intermediate during replication hepatitis a virus belonging to the picornaviridae family and hepatitis c and related gbv-c viruses belonging to the flaviviridae family although these viruses or their ancestors were present early during the emergence and evolution of homo spp in africa in contrast to other rna viruses members of the retroviridae family use a reverse transcriptase to generate a dna copy of their rna genome this dna copy may integrate into the cellular genome as provirus and as such exhibits slower rates of evolution endogenous retroviruses have derived from proviruses integrated into the genome of germ cells thus being carried along by subsequent generations of hosts as genetic traits they have under natural circumstances lost the ability to produce infectious particles they are transmitted vertically as signatures of ancient infections offering a spectacular means to explore ancient host-pathogen associations gifford and tristem 2003 the oldest endogenous retroviruses of vertebrate hosts are thought to have arisen 6080 mya today up to 8  of the human genome consists of endogenous retroviruses belonging to at least 31 distinct lineages most of which are present in extant old world monkeys and apes this suggests that they integrated into the primate genome more that 30 mya and were part of the early hominin legacy to humans furthermore the comparison of sequence data of antiviral genes demonstrated that the human trim5 gene coding for a potent antiretroviral protein has been under positive selection at least for the past 45 million years indicating ancient interactions and co-evolution of hominins and exogenous retroviruses emerman and malik 2010 members of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex mtbc are other strict human pathogens the origin of which may date back from the era of early hominins gagneux 2012 these bacteria cause life-long chronic or latent infection and are spread via close contacts limited genetic variation characterizes most mtbc isolates and suggests that these pathogens went through a bottleneck 2035 thousand years ago kya followed by rapid clonal expansion it was thought that the bottleneck marked the emergence of these pathogens in humans however analyzes of additional mtbc isolates sampled from human patients in east africa revealed ancestral lineages predating the bottleneck gutierrez et al 2005 the mrca of the mtbc may have occurred more than 25 mya and thus may have infected early hominins before further diversification not only pathogens spread by close contacts may have been major pathogens of early hominins eventually co-evolving with the human species vector-borne protozoans plasmodium spp and trypanosoma spp are believed to have had ancient interactions with hominins in particular the divergence of plasmodium falciparum causative agent of severe malaria in humans from plasmodium reichenowi which infects chimpanzees is thought to have occurred about 57 mya around the time of divergence of the chimpanzee and human lineages ollomo et al 2009 likewise early hominins were probably infected by trypanosoma brucei the causative agent of sleeping sickness in africa stevens et al 1999 the presence of trypanolytic factors in the serum of humans and extant apes may represent another indirect clue for ancient associations and co-evolution of hominins and trypanosomes stevens and gibson 1999 the complete picture of the diversity of the microbiome of early hominins may never be drawn the current genomic era along with the discovery of an ever-growing number of viruses and microorganisms in humans and animal species alike will provide increasing evidence for long-lasting host-pathogen associations maintained through the evolutionary development of the human species these associations will undoubtedly highlight the scope of the most primordial and ancestral humananimal interface the stone age is nearly contemporaneous to the emergence and evolution of the genus homo and encompasses the late pliocene the pleistocene and the early holocene the old and middle stone ages correspond to the paleolithic and mesolithic periods respectively spanning from approximately 25 mya to 12 kya the first homo species known to emerge was homo habilis which inherited the ability to use and manipulate stone tools from its australopithecine ancestors ability which would be maintained developed and refined through the evolutionary history of modern humans migration of homo spp out of the african homeland started as early as 18 mya with evidence of the presence of homo erectus in the middle east and as far as south-east asia bar-yosef and belfer-cohen 2001 limited but recurrent gene flow between populations may have occurred since then across eurasia and africa templeton 2002 
homo sapiens is thought to have originated in east africa around 200 kya it migrated out of africa about 80100 kya and colonized south-east asia and australia some 5060 kya central europe about 50 kya central asia 40 kya and the americas 1520 kya oppenheimer 2012 h sapiens lived in small nomadic groups of huntergatherers probably counting not more than 3050 individuals highly mobile their foraging strategy was directly associated with the distribution and availability of food resources it involved the development and use of a variety of specialized tools technologies and hunting strategies such as the development of fishing tools or the cooperative hunting of large game chatters 1987 the migration patterns of h sapiens across continents were likely associated in part with their exploitation of marine resources along coastal environments or with the migration of megafauna although most domesticated animals became associated with humans within the last 12 thousand years see below huntergatherers domesticated the wolf canis lupus in eurasia as early as 40100 kya giving rise to morphologically distinct domestic dogs 15 kya vila et al 1997 scavenging and eventually fishing and hunting together with the unprecedented mobility of homo spp represent behavioral innovations that drastically shaped the prehistoric humananimal interface the transition of homo spp omnivorous diet from predominantly herbivorous toward strongly carnivorous shaped it toward a predatorprey interface such an interface resulted in the acquisition of pathogens of prey including pathogens specialized in using predatorprey relationships for transmission such as helminths and eventually led to the establishment and evolution of novel human pathogens human tapeworms taenia spp likely originated from ancestral species using large african ungulates as intermediate hosts and carnivores as definitive hosts hoberg et al 2001 they were acquired by homo spp upon consumption of large game most probably bovids and adapted to the developing human species upon two independent host shifts at least 0817 mya other possible zoonotic transmission events followed by host shifts and adaptation to the human species include that of helicobacter pylori which may have colonized homo spp in the african homeland about 60 kya linz et al 2007 their original host species remains nevertheless unknown h pylori have been isolated in a wide range of animal species including carnivores and herbivores a number of primate pathogens may also have emerged in africa during early human evolutionary history as a result of cross-species transmission this indicates that close interactions between homo spp and other primates likely occurred potentially including predation and consumption of primate meat phylogenetic analyzes strongly support that the emergence and evolution of human t lymphotropic virus of type ii htlv ii belonging to the retroviridae family resulted from a simian-to-human transmission event that occurred at least 400 kya in africa vandamme et al 2000 a similar scenario may have led to the emergence of the various hepatitis viruses a b c and gb viruses and enteroviruses such as poliovirus belonging to the picornaviridae family in humans van blerkom 2003 yet further study on the extent of natural infection of primates by these or related pathogens are needed to reach definitive conclusions the unprecedented mobility of homo spp together with their flexibility in habitat usage likely also contributed to the emergence of new pathogens following novel exposure opportunities for example the increasing use of open environments by homo spp is thought to have promoted their infection by schistosoma spp trematodes using mainly fresh-water snails as their intermediate hosts the divergence of schistosoma spp infecting humans from those infecting rodents and ruminants is estimated to have occurred more than 1 mya despres et al 1992 the migration of homo spp out of their african homeland similarly led to contact with species of new worlds and new opportunities for cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens for example it resulted in the cross-species transmission of htlv i and plasmodium vivax in asia and of hepatitis b virus of subtype f as well as gb viruses of types a and b in south america van blerkom 2003 as previously primates were the most likely sources of these pathogens further supporting close interactions between primates and homo sppor sharing of habitatas the latter migrated out of africa in addition to the acquisition of novel pathogens human ancient migration across continents also resulted in the diversification of pathogens that had originated in the african homeland phylogenetic analyzes of pathogen diversity revealed that some may be used as valuable tools for reconstructing ancient human migrations van blerkom 2003 de the 2007 these include phylogenetic analyzes of papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses htlv h pylori and lice resulting in patterns which phylogeographically coincide with those of early humans these examples illustrate the role of prehistoric humans in disseminating pathogens to new geographical areas the role of prehistoric humans in introducing pathogens into novel host species is less clear however the phylogeography of htlv indicates that multiple cross-species transmission events have occurred between humans and other primates in both directions resulting in todays diversity in primate t lymphotropic viruses slattery et al 1999 verdonck et al 2007 it is likely that pathogens carried by domestic dogs similarly may have been introduced into new geographical areas or new host species at the time of human ancient migrations rabies virus of the rhabdoviridae family may be such a pathogen that disseminated as dogs were carried along to new continents in fact it has been suggested that infectious diseases may have significantly contributed to the extinction of new world megafauna prescott et al 2012 alroy 2001 although some scenarios depicted above remain largely speculative many characteristics of the humananimal interface are present remarkably early upon the emergence and evolution of our species in and out of africa it mediated both the cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens and the introduction of pathogens into new geographical areas and novel host species although not different from today the timescale is of a completely different order of magnitude in this light it is tempting to speculate that infectious pathogens associated with homo spp in its debuts may have had a major role in the evolution of our species van blerkom 2003 the new stone age or neolithic period spanning from approximately 12 to 5 kya marks the settlement of human bands the development of agriculture and farming and the domestication of various plant and animal species as food and feed resources at that time only one hominin species had persisted homo sapiens sapiens  gradual behavioral and cultural changesfrom mobile huntergatherers to settled village-farmersmost probably originated in the fertile crescent diamond 2002 and led to the development of the worlds first villages and towns such as jericho in the levant this town which limits were surrounded by a stone wall contained an estimated population of 20003000 individuals kuijt and goring-morris 2002 these behavioral and cultural changes yielded to the domestication of most valuable plant and animal species particularly abundant in this region including wild flora like wheats barley and peas as well as wild fauna like sheep goats cows and pigs diamond 2002 villages agriculture and domestication arose independently in at least four regions china mesopotamia south america and the eastern part of north america and further spread globally gradually replacing huntergatherer economies in most parts of the world the introduction of food production led to the explosive human population growth still unrelenting to this day and allowed the development of technology and societal organization while huntergatherers had lived in a relatively peaceful relationship with microorganisms by keeping their own numbers at a level the local environment could sustain the neolithic farmers created conditions that would eventually let humans experience and maintain crowd diseases pathogens were able to maintain themselves in large populations of humans animals or in the soil eventually preventing acute diseases from dying out as would have been the case in small bands of huntergatherers crowd diseases could arise only with the buildup of large dense communities agriculture could sustain 10100 times higher human population densities than did the huntinggathering lifestyle and sedentary farmers living amid their own sewage or even spreading their feces and urine as fertilizer on the fields provided ideal conditions for the emergence of both crowd and zoonotic diseases diamond 1977 while settlement and food production initiated these major demographic changes that would shape the scope of the humananimal interface in the ages to come domestication represents another major revolution affecting the prehistoric humananimal interface and completing its final shape as we know it today domestication is part of the first of major historical transitions that characterize the development of the modern human species and its relationships with the environment diamond 2002 domestication of plants and animals associated with the processing and storage of food prompted close and sustained interactions between humans live animal species and their products as well as demographic booms in both domesticated animals and commensal species husbandry practices generated crowded conditions for domestic livestock facilitating the emergence spread and evolution of infectious pathogens within these species agricultural practices opened rich ecological niches for todays commensals such as several rodent species spurring likewise unprecedented demographic growth of pest species their association with humans and unmatched fertile soils for their pathogens cross-species transmission of zoonoses to humans leading the way to eventual establishment and evolution of new human pathogens represents a small but crucial step across the domesticated humananimal interface many human pathogens likely have their origins in the neolithic revolution including mumps virus of the paramyxoviridae family smallpox virus corynebacterium diphtheriae and bordetella pertussis wolfe et al 2007 these pathogens typically cause acute infections therefore large human communities counting up to hundreds of thousands individuals are generally needed to sustain them independently of animal reservoirs the invention of food production would eventually allow for such demographic growth their strict establishment in human populations thus may have occurred somewhat later after domestication had set the stage for their original and recurrent cross-species transmission the respective hosts of origin of these pathogens whether domesticated commensal or wild remain to a large extent elusive while the phylogenetically closest species of measles virus and smallpox virus are rinderpest virus infecting cattle and camelpox or gerbilpox viruses respectively it is unknown whether these animal host species were sources or recipients of these human pathogens other pathogens with a large host range and low species specificity that are transmitted via environmental reservoirs also likely expanded their host range at the time of domestication to include the modern human species among them are the caliciviruses and rotaviruses which typically cause acute respiratory or gastro-intestinal infections although they may have been originally pathogens of domesticated commensal or even wild animal species cross-species transmission between humans and animals must have occurred in both directions for example frequent interspecies transmission of calici- and rotaviruses between humans cattle and pigs complicates the picture and makes it difficult to assess with certainty their origins in either host species van blerkom 2003 likewise the recent discovery of the human bocavirusa parvovirus with bovine and canine parvovirus ancestry suggests cross-species transmission and recombination of these viruses allander et al 2005 for other pathogens such as taenia spp it is recognized that humans were the source of the distinct species that have emerged in cattle and pigs at the time of domestication hoberg et al 2001 likewise a comparative genomic approach comparing m tuberculosis in humans to mycobacterium spp in animals suggested that they share a common ancestor around the time of the neolithic transition comas and gagneux 2009 cross-species transmission also occurred between animal species associated with the neolithic humananimal interface for example some strains of feline leukemia virus may have been acquired by domestic cats after cross-species transmission of retroviruses from commensal rodents during this period roca et al 2004 it is most probable that recurrent cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens without further establishment in the human population occurred also increasingly frequently as agriculture progressed these recurrent events may have been favored by the adaptation and evolution of commensal species such as rodents and anthropophilic insect vectors which in addition to domesticated animals may have created successful bridges between wild animal reservoirs and humans the destruction of wild lands with the ceaseless plowing of land and chopping of forests made by african farmers attracted rats mice ticks and fleas to live closer to humans and provided ideal breeding habitats for mosquitoes these early slash-and-burn techniques created the water-filled sunlit ruts that anopheles mosquitoes need for rapid breeding further setting the ground for malarias long relationship with humans nikiforuk 1991 in fact skeletal and dental indicators of health status demonstrate that early farmers generally had poorer health than foragers suffering from nutritional deficiencies as well as infections in particular those caused by intestinal parasites and vector-borne pathogens larsen 2006 domestication might also have favored the establishment of brucella abortus bacillus anthracis and the food-poisoning salmonella bacteria in cattle pigs or poultry thus increasing the risk of the corresponding diseases in the human population hare 1967 the impact of ancient human activities associated with settlements agriculture and domestication on microorganisms can be detected as dramatic genomic changes in species that eventually adapted to and associated with the human species these genomic changes include the increasing number of mobile elements such as insertion sequences in prokaryotes upon host shift mira et al 2006 this has been shown to occur for a number of pathogens of both humans and domesticated animals and plants during the neolithic major examples include b pertussis strict human pathogen causing whooping cough yersinia pestis causing plague in humans and transmitted by rodents via fleas burkholderia mallei primarily a pathogen of equids and pseudomonas syringae which specializes on tomato plants the expansion of insertion sequences in these species was estimated to have occurred several thousand years ago with a most recent estimate for b mallei coinciding with the more recent domestication of the horse 45 kya the nearly complete replacement of huntergatherer economies by farming economies followed the spread of these behavioral and cultural changes from the original homelands of agriculture to the rest of the world most domesticated plant and animal species as well as commensal species were brought across continents to new geographical areas this was likely accompanied by the spread of their infectious diseases and initiating new waves of introductions of both human and animal pathogens into new regions it has been suggested that distinctively low genetic diversity in a number of livestock parasites such as trichinella spiralis a zoonotic nematode parasite of swine compared to that of related pathogens of wild host counterparts may reflect ancient dissemination following the translocation of domesticated animals by early farmers rosenthal 2009 the neolithic revolution thus created new niches for pathogens with dense growing and mobile populations of domestic animals and commensals that characterize the domesticated humananimal interface up to this day the neolithic period gave rise to the development of pottery and technology associated with the processing and storage of cultured and domesticated food allowing for human unabated demographic growth and societal development eventually leading to the discovery manufacture and use of metals from 3 to 56 kya copper and bronze were used for tools and weapons before the use of iron and steel was discovered these last ages of prehistory initiated the transition into ancient history spanning from approximately 25 kya to the fifth century after christ characterized by the full development of writing centralized governments law codes social stratification empires and cities as well as the beginnings of organized warfare many pathogens that emerged in humans during the neolithic revolution were likely maintained and evolving in the human species because of increasing densities and population sizes of human communities eventually transitioning into historical ages dobson and carper 1996 while the early prehistoric humananimal interface was mainly centered on novel interactions between humans and animal species and their products the late prehistoric and ancient historical humananimal interface revolved increasingly around the dramatic demographic and societal changes affecting human populations most acute infections caused by strict human pathogens today require large population sizes to be maintained as childhood diseases or to recur as cyclic waves or epidemics links between communities generated by frequent migratory movements allow for the spread of traveling waves of disease and relative synchronies of local and regional epidemics grenfell et al 2001 because measles virus induces strong and long-lasting protective immunity it requires a large human population to persist and large metropoles are typically the sources of infection for other smaller communities resulting in pulses of synchronous waves starting in cities and radiating to smaller towns and villages the minimum population size needed for the maintenance of measles virus has been estimated to be in the range of 200500 thousand individuals similar critical community sizes likely existed for smallpox of which the most ancient physical evidence rests as pustules on the mummified skin of pharaoh ramses v hopkins 1980 nevertheless it is likely that these critical community sizes were smaller during these ancient times than today and that sequential outbreaks in smaller communities linked by emigration and immigration movements may have allowed their persistence dobson and carper 1996 indeed most ancient historical cities may have contained a community in which size ranged between 10 and 20 thousand individuals although babylon is considered the oldest and first city to reach a population of 200 thousand individuals during this period as illustrated in mesopotamia numerous cities were erected relatively close to each other allowing for trade and exchange between these urban communities in addition to long-distance trade with more distant cities it is therefore likely that the demographic conditions that developed at that time were slowly shaping the evolution of human pathogens causing acute infections crowded populations and poor sanitation also probably favored the maintenance and evolution of pathogens transmitted via environmental reservoirs and may have facilitated the evolution of changing virulence it is indeed remarkable that most pathogens of prehistoric humans were typically causing chronic or persistent infections potentially in combination with low levels of virulence while more modern humans at the beginning of classical history increasingly acquired pathogens causing acute infections andor more severe diseases for example bordetella bronchiseptica is a common pathogen infecting a wide range of wild and domestic mammals it generally causes very mild or asymptomatic chronic infection of the upper respiratory tract in these species b pertussis is a strict human pathogen which most probably emerged and evolved from a b
 bronchiseptica-like ancestor during the neolithic revolution but in contrast to the latter it may cause acute respiratory infection leading to whooping cough that can be severe and life threatening it has been proposed that the evolution of such an acute form of infection tightly depends on a critical population size above which acute pathogens are buffered from extinction king et al 2009 interestingly certain strains of b bronchiseptica cause more acute andor more virulent infections in swine and dogs and potentially evolved as a result of higher population sizes and densities of these domestic animals in fact ancient historical cities not only sheltered human communities but also retained characteristics of earlier villages in which domestic and food production animals were kept in close proximity to humans within the walls of towns together with poor sanitary conditions these crowded conditions facilitated the continued emergence and evolution of directly and indirectly transmitted pathogens in both domestic animals and humans while directly transmitted pathogens may have evolved toward more acute pathogens due to dense and large host populations king et al 2009 indirectly transmitted pathogens may have evolved toward more virulent pathogens as their transmission depended mainly on environmental reservoirs galvani 2003 the particular urban conditions of these ancient times created a unique humananimal interface characterized by close relationships between booming populations of humans and of domestic as well as commensal animals further subjected to intense trade and mixing a most successful melting pot for pathogens was realized initiating an unprecedented evolutionary boom in the diversity of human-associated scourges and plagues in particular these conditions seem to underlie the most famous epidemics of classical antiquity generally known as the plague of athens which broke out early in the summer of 430 bc and was masterly described by thucidides salmonella enterica sequences have been amplified in several victims unearthed from a mass burial site thus suggesting a retrospective diagnosis of typhoid fever the crowded and unsanitary conditions in the city besieged by the spartan army must have favored the spread of the epidemic and it is worth noting how one of the most outstanding features of thucidides account is the reported contraction of the disease by animals which might suggest the intriguing possibility that the strain of s enterica accounting for the plague of athens was an ancient strain not yet exclusively adapted to human hosts papagrigorakis et al 2008 importantly the emergence of these new scourges and plagues was eventually accompanied by the birth of medicine in europe with hippocrates corpus written and completed during the fifth century bc followed and further developed by galen at the end of the second century ad the rise of urbanization and trade that characterized the world from the bronze age to the end of classic antiquity contributed to the creation of a common microorganisms breeding ground through the development of world trade routes which by roman times effectively joined the populations and the disease pools of europe asia and north africa the pandemic waves of plague in the middle ages would soon have tested the efficacy of this communication system the middle ages and early modern history span from the fifth to the end of the eighteenth century ad this period is marked by invasions and wars between rival cultures and the modern colonization of new worlds via world trade and conquest routes organized warfare develops and the slow conquest of new territories is paced by horse gaits on land and sailing winds on seas the medieval humananimal interface is principally one of poverty and poor sanitation in part associated with colonization wars unrest and social stratification the major infectious diseases that predominated during this period and up to our early modern history were either crowd diseases caused by human-adapted pathogens such as smallpox measles cholera tuberculosis and leprosy or vector-borne and zoonotic diseases mainly associated with insect or rodent vectors such as plague typhus malaria and yellow fever precarious and poor sanitary conditions associated with the massive movements of humans along trade and conquest roads would drive the surge of these zoonotic pathogens on the one hand novel exposures of both colonists and indigenous residents to novel pathogens would follow the colonization and invasion of new territories on the other hand the vector or reservoir hosts of these new infections would be carried along and introduced into new regions and across continents the extent of the resulting epidemics the devastating human toll claimed by these pathogens and the disease they caused have been reported in writing with enough details so that their causative agents can be identified today with near certainty it is interesting to note that a newly discovered pathogen of domestic dogs canine hepatitis c virus is thought to have emerged during the middle ages 051 kya kapoor et al 2011 although its origin remains unknown it is tempting to speculate that it may have evolved from the human hepatitis c virus upon cross-species transmission favored by war and poverty eg following consumption of dead human liver or the poor sanitary conditions of these times the plague caused by the bacterium y pestis is a landmark disease that arose in the middle ages illustrating well the attributes of the medieval humananimal interface perry and fetherston 1997 it is transmitted to humans by rodents via fleas yet can also be transmitted directly between humans in its pulmonary form according to recent studies however the poor competence of fleas would not be fully compatible with flea-borne transmission alone which would prompt the potential role of body lice as an inter-human vector for bubonic plague ayyadurai et al 2010 it has been claimed that 200 million individuals may have fallen victim to plague throughout our recorded history since the athens plague was indeed typhoid fever the first indisputable plague epidemics occurred from 541 to 750 ad and it is widely known as the first plague pandemic or justinian plague the second pandemic often referred to as the black death 1347 to 1351 ad occurred in the fourteenth century its first epidemics in europe had an estimated death toll of 1728 million individuals representing 3040  of the population of europe and were followed by relentless epidemic cycles until late into the seventeenth century while the first plague pandemic may have contributed to the weakening of the byzantine empire the second pandemic is believed to have accelerated or directed dramatic changes in societal systems and medical education and practice anecdotally the plague epidemic of the mid 1660s forced the closure of cambridge university for 18 months during which newton laid the foundations of his famous discoveries in mathematics and physical science the medieval emergence of the plague in occidental regions was likely associated with the dissemination and expansion of one of its main reservoir hosts the black rat originally from south-east asia the black rat is thought to have colonized western regions along trade routes via land and seas mccormick 2003 it may have become infected with y pestis along the silk road from contacts with fleas of naturally infected burrowing rodents of the steppes of central asia with its commensal proclivity the black rat flourished in the great late roman cities rich in granaries and poor in waste treatment harboring large populations of fleas these expanding populations of rats fuelled plague epidemics among humans the re-emergence of the plague at the onset of the second pandemic has often been related to more violent introductions of the bacillus into plague-free populations as in 1346 the mongol army catapulted plague-infected corpses over the walls of the crimean city of caffa wheelis 2002 however subsequent spread occurred independently of this event and likely resulted from introductions of infected rats and fleas via trade routes across the mediterranean sea with sicily as black deaths first port of entry into europe although the reasons behind the intermezzo between the two plague pandemics remain a mystery the receding epidemics from the eighteenth century onwards may be due at least in part to the colonization of europe by the brown rat which does not harbor anthropophilic fleas and displaced the black rat from cities typhus is another disease caused by rodent pathogens rickettsia prowazekii and rickettsia typhi transmitted via lice and fleas respectively typhus has remained a scourge late into our modern history going hand in hand with war unsavory imprisonment and periods of unrest large epidemics sweeping across europe and asia occurred in the fifteenth century in contrast to plague it is believed that typhus spread eastward along the silk road typhus was also introduced into the new world upon its discovery there together with measles and smallpox it severely affected the natives who encountered these pathogens for the first time acemoglu et al 2003 these scourges likely shaped the fate of the colonization of the americas there is no evidence that native americans had suffered from the epidemic diseases that ravaged europe before the discovery of the continent in the fifteenth century to many european colonists native americans appeared more robust and healthier than themselves thus epidemic diseases traveling westwards found native americans unprotected by natural immunity the horrendous mortality registered since 1494 in santo domingo was possibly the result of a swine influenza epidemic as eight hogs taken on board columbuss ship appear to have brought the infection american pre-columbian indians had few if any domestic animals and were first exposed to domestic animal pathogens when columbus landed with horses cows sheep goats and pigs it was not long before north american indians were being decimated by human-borne diseases kraut 1994 on the other hand the colonization of new worlds by europeans also resulted in novel exposures to exotic pathogens such as plasmodium spp causing malaria and yellow fever virus of the flaviridae family in africa these mosquito-borne diseases were the main causes of high mortality in european colonists and settlers in africa and have largely hampered institutional and economic development on this continent acemoglu et al 2003 malaria and yellow fever were also introduced into the americas and spread as virgin soil epidemics into native and colonist populations alike due to the absence of prevailing immunity because of the acquired and in some cases genetic resistance of native africans to these diseases malaria and yellow fever likely were decisive factors in the development of the slave trade curtin 1968 these diseases and in particular yellow fever undoubtedly played a major role centuries later in the bargain sale of louisiana by napoleon bonaparte during the usa presidency of thomas jefferson the passing of slavery law for these new us territories eventually led to the crisis of the union an obvious and recurrent question associated with the humananimal interface of these times is why the exchange of dreadful pathogens between the americas and europe was so unequal and why not a single major killer from across the atlantic spread back to europe factors possibly contributing to the apparent absence of lethal crowd epidemics in the pre-colombian americas may include the late rise of dense human populations on this continent and the lack of intensive long-distance trade an intriguing interpretation points to the essential role of domestication and highlights how only five animals of any sort became domesticated in the new world namely the turkey mexico and us southwest the llamaalpaca the guinea pig andes region the muscovy duck tropical south america and the dog throughout the americas domesticated species were a rarity and typically remained isolated from each other possibly hampering the emergence of crowd diseases diamond 1977 2002 while major periods of unrest social stratification colonization and war define our early modern history industrial political and cultural revolutions are hallmarks of our late modern history spanning the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century industrial revolutions resulted in major innovations in the chemical electrical petroleum and steel industries eventually leading to the mass production of food resources associated with the development of mechanization and new preservation technologies political and cultural revolutions typically associated with major wars revolved mainly around the spread of social movements heralding the steady progress of globalization the industrial revolution marks a major historical and epidemiological transition characterized overall by decreased human mortality it is commonly accepted that the observed decreased mortality arose from improvement of the nutritional status in developed countries and to the advances of hygiene and medicine mckeown 1986 paradoxically major diseases also emerged at the industrial and modern humananimal interface due to dramatic changes in human and domestic animal populations during this period such cross-species transmission events would eventually recur more and more frequently as the industrial and developing societies progressed this initiated a third major epidemiological transition characterized by the current rise of emerging infectious pathogens and the ever-going race between infectious diseases and medicine barrett et al 1998 the dramatic changes associated with new technology often modified the environment to such an extent that they seriously affected interactions between humans animals and pathogens a typical example is that of sardinia in the second half of the nineteenth century where the oak forests covering the whole island were cut to be converted into coal used for industrial purposes and burned for the production of electricity andor heat or to be used in the rail network of the recently unified kingdom of italy deforestation followed by a dramatic reduction in rainfall severely affected the original sardinian climate and turned it into a hot and dry climate more typical of nearby africa with 8 months of drought followed by 4 months of unrelenting precipitations this favored the development of large areas of wetlands and marshes a perfect habitat for anopheles mosquitoes and the expansion of malaria tognotti 1966 it is intriguing to note that thousands of years after neolithic farmers had been chopping their forests at the birth of agriculture nineteenth centurys humans had altered their environment exactly in the same way the industrial revolution also resulted in a humananimal interface characterized by massive increase of domestic and food animal populations as well as intensification of farming and husbandry practicesstill continuing to this day these unprecedented crowd conditions are undoubtedly major drivers of the emergence and spread of pathogens in domestic animal populations allowing their increasingly more frequent cross-species transmission to humans as such this period of human history seems to repeat and expand the changes that occurred upon the neolithic revolution and first pre-historical transition however the development of new schools of thought led to improvements in hygiene and medicine that gradually limited the impact of directly and indirectly transmitted pathogens among the major discoveries are those of ignaz semmelweis pioneering antisepsis for obstetrical and surgical procedures and john snow elucidating the water-borne source of cholera by use of epidemiological investigations discoveries eventually leading to the development of the germ theory of disease embraced among others by louis pasteur joseph lister and robert koch the decline in the incidence of tuberculosis in the last decades of the nineteenth century paralleled the improvement in living conditions but probably owed more to a recognition that infected milk was a primary source of the pathogen and to public campaigns designed to improve hygiene in dairies and to encourage citizens to boil milk before drinking it halliday 2007 whereas improvements in hygiene and medicine certainly limited the impact of traditional pathogens to a large extent the industrial revolution and its impact on environment housing and working conditions favored transmission and emergence of novel pathogens among the more recent zoonotic pathogens that allegedly emerged in those years is the influenza virus of the orthomyxoviridae family although influenza virus epidemics may have occurred since the time of hippocrates the first well-described influenza pandemic is that of 1918 caused by the dreadful spanish flu virus taubenberger and morens 2006 influenza viruses are originally avian pathogens and in particular of wild waterbirds domestic species such as poultry and swine are susceptible to infection with these viruses and are typically the sources of zoonotic and eventually pandemic viruses that can sweep through the human population eventually giving rise to human-adapted seasonal influenza a viruses that claim tens of millions of human lives in interpandemic periods at the onset of the pandemic of 1918 both swine and humans were victims of the influenza virus that eventually resulted in the death of probably more than 50 million individuals this occurred at a time that war activities of world war i caused the deaths of about 8 million people the massive increase in both poultry and swine populations since the industrial revolutionand a fortiori in the last centuryis tightly associated with an increase in the diversity of avian and swine influenza viruses in these species as well as in the frequency of their cross-species transmission to humans fig 3 another zoonotic virus unknown until the beginning of the twenty-first century similarly is thought to have crossed the humananimal interface following the industrial revolution human metapneumovirus of the paramyxoviridae family is closely related to the avian metapneumovirus of poultry and causes respiratory infections in humans although it was described only in 2001 this pathogen has circulated widely in the human population worldwide probably since its emergence following avian-to-human transmission more than a century ago de graaf et al 2008
 the industrial and modern humananimal interface not only prompted cross-species transmission of novel zoonotic pathogens that could eventually adapt to humans it also affected the epidemiology of domestic animal pathogens leading to a high diversity of lineages as seen for avian and swine influenza viruses and to expanding geographical ranges for example the diversity of foot-and-mouth disease fmd virus of the picornaviridae family strains infecting domestic ungulates in eurasia is believed to stem from a radiation and rapid expansion event that occurred during the nineteenth century tully and fares 2008 cattle breeds imported to africa at the end of the nineteenth century introduced rinderpest virus in local breeds and wild ungulates sparking virgin soil epidemics that decimated entire domestic and wild populations although this virus did not pose a direct zoonotic risk its impact on ungulate populations translated into devastating famines in many african countries normile 2008 because of their dramatic impact the emergence and spread of pathogens in booming and expanding domestic animal populations were rapidly accompanied by the development of counter-measures and intervention strategies such as the restriction on movements of animals and the development and use of vaccination the ban on animal movements during an epidemic was first introduced by the king of france in 1739 and extended during the nineteenth century as a regulatory measure against rinderpest anthrax and fmd in europe blancou 2002 additional measures to be implemented included slaughter of infected animals and disinfection of premises and utensils the principles of vaccination pioneered by edward jenner in 1796 for the prevention of smallpox were applied and vaccines developed against a number of human and animal diseases a number which would not cease to increase ever since demographic changes and urbanization affected developing countries during this period but the improvement in nutritional and health status did not compare to those in developed countries at least in part due to the post-colonial disruption of infrastructures bush meat consumption is an ancient and primordial practice and resource in tropical and developing countries such as africa and asia it is increasingly used to sustain expanding human communities as well as in war zones to eventually have reached dramatic levels today wolfe et al 2005 this facet of the modern humananimal interface directly bringing in contact growing human populations with wild animal species and their products is also a major factor in the continued and increasingly more frequent emergence of zoonotic pathogens faced by human society up to this day up to 75  of current emerging zoonotic pathogens originate from wild animal species taylor et al 2001 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 almost a century ago it resulted in multiple cross-species transmissions of the causative agent of probably the most devastating modern human plague caused by human immunodeficiency virus hiv of the retroviridae family hiv infection eventually leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids a disease that has spread pandemically since the 1980s of the last century as seen previously there is a long history of cross-species transmission of retroviruses between humans and primates most probably as a result of blood-borne contact during butchering and consumption of primate meat hiv currently circulating in the human population emerged on at least seven independent occasions hiv-1 is divided into three lineages two of which were likely a result of chimpanzee-to-human transmission of simian immunodeficiency viruses siv while the third one may have resulted from a gorilla-to-human transmission event van heuverswyn et al 2006 hiv-2 is divided into six subtypes arising from at least four independent cross-species transmission events between sooty mangabeys and humans it has been estimated that the mrca of hiv-1 of group mwidely distributed in the human population and responsible for the bulk of the aids pandemicdates back from the beginning of the twentieth century while bush-meat hunting and consumption may have fuelled the cross-species transmission of the virus from chimpanzees to humans changes in human demographics and behavior in africa and the rest of the world at that time such as urbanization traveling sexual promiscuity as well as shared use of needles likely facilitated and eventually allowed its emergence worldwide spread and adaptation to the human species our contemporary history largely founded in the industrial revolution and built on the associated booming populations of humans domestic and food production animals has revealed the shrinking nature of our developed and developing world globalization appears to define our current human society mass movements of people from commuting to cross-continental scales are accompanied and associated with mass movements of animals and goods from unabated development to global tourism humans are exploiting and infringing on new habitats and new environments taking domestication agriculture urbanization industrialization and colonization to new and unprecedented levels creating a multi-faceted global humananimal interface the growth of domestic and food production animal populations is far from slowing down and rather paralleled by the unabated growth of the size and consumption levels of the global human population increasingly complex farming and trading systems are being developed as industrialization progresses to optimize the production efficiency of food animals and their products intensive farming and the tradingboth legal and illegalof live animals and their products have resulted in the global spread of zoonotic and non-zoonotic pathogens for example fmd virus because of its high infectivity is among the most devastating non-zoonotic pathogens trade and global movements contribute to spread around the world in 2001 the virus was introduced in the uk by feeding swine with illegally imported meat from asia where the virus is endemic sparking an epidemic in several european countries with heavy economical consequences gibbens et al 2001 in the uk alone the estimated agricultural and industrial costs associated with the epidemic reached up to 63 billion pounds thompson et al 2002 failure from following adequate heating treatment of swine feed was likely at the origin of this epidemic changes in the heating treatment of cattle offals in the uk in the 1980sused as meat and bone meal in ruminant feed being a protein-rich nutritional supplementresulted in the emergence of a zoonotic pathogen of a rare sort a non-degradable host protein or prion responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy the trade of contaminated meat and bone meal from the uk spread the pathogen among countries resulting not only in a devastating epidemic among cattle in and beyond europe but also in hundreds of human cases of the new variant of creutzfeldt jacob disease one or more decades later brown et al 2001 in asia the complex farming and trading dynamics of a wide diversity of poultry species are driving complex epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza viruses including the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus hpaiv h5n1 the trade of poultry typically sold live at wet markets allowed the emergence in 1997 of hpaiv h5n1 which infected 18 people leading to six deaths in hong-kong de jong et al 1997 it now circulates in a wide range of poultry and other bird species and has infected more than a dozen of mammalian species reperant et al 2009 to date it has caused about 600 documented hospitalized human infections with a case-fatality rate of close to 60  who 2012 if this virus were to acquire efficient transmissibility among humans as recently shown possible in the ferret model herfst s et al under reviewin press it could be at the basis of a pandemic of unprecedented severity in modern history several other avian influenza viruses of concern are low pathogenic viruses of the currently identified 17 h subtypes several of which have become established in poultry populations in china choi et al 2004 cheung et al 2007 swine influenza viruses are also candidate precursors of pandemic influenza viruses as demonstrated in 2009 the farming and trading practices applied to domestic swine populations in north america recently have been shown to generate conditions favorable for the emergence evolution and spread of diverse lineages with occasional cross-species transmission to humans nelson et al 2011 the latest pandemic virus of 2009 was a reassortant virus with gene segments from swine viruses of eurasian and american origins respectively further demonstrating the global circulation and exchange of influenza viruses and their gene pools smith et al 2009 the global movement of animals associated with legal and illegal trade is not restricted to food production animals and concerns as well pets including exotic species and wildlife chomel et al 2007 rabies a viral disease that kills about 50000 people annually likely has been introduced by humans via domestic dogs to new geographical areas since times immemorial it continues to constitute a recurring threat to countries where the virus is controlled successfully associated with the illegal importation of dogs and other carnivores from rabies-endemic countries today unless pre-exposure vaccination is practiced or post-exposure treatment is carried out rapidly this largely neglected disease is invariably fatal in humans and most warm-blooded animal species and thus is among the most serious diseases long associated with the domesticated humananimal interface yet domestication in our global society has taken unprecedented proportions with the trade of an increasing range of exotic pet species for example pet reptiles are an increasing source of salmonella infection in the early 1970s the us food and drug administration banned the distribution and sale of baby turtles after a quarter million infants and small children were diagnosed with turtle-associated salmonellosis nowadays it is estimated that approximately 3  of american households own 73 million reptiles the majority being iguanas burnham et al 1998 cdc is currently investigating an outbreak of human salmonella infections associated with feeder rodents ie rodents sold as food for pet reptiles and amphibians in the usa the same strain was implicated in a 2009 outbreak in the united kingdom and a 2010 outbreak in the usa both linked to frozen feeder rodents cdc 2012 due to their nature exotic pet species carry an unmatched range of exotic pathogens the outbreak of monkeypox virus in humans in the usa in 2003 was the result of the importation of infected african rodents including rope squirrels funisciurus spp gambian giant rats cricetomys spp and african dormice graphiurus spp which subsequently infected prairie dogs in quarantine in total 81 human cases of monkeypox were diagnosed di giulio and eckburg 2004 on a broader scale the legal and illegal trade of wildlife and wildlife products represents a major source of emerging infectious diseases from local scales involving bush-meat hunting and wet markets to cross-continental scales it expands the diversity of animal species coming into contact with humans and their domestic animals these diseases may affect humans their domestic animals or other wild animal species thus also expanding the dire consequences of their cross-species transmission across the contemporary humananimal interface although the animal reservoirs of filoviruses like ebola virus are unknown bush-meat hunting in africa in particular of primate species is typically incriminated as the source of recent violent outbreaks in humans wolfe et al 2005 as growing human populations in urban areas feed the demand for bush-meat intensive hunting and trade are likely to pose an increasing risk for the cross-species transmission of these and other pathogens in african countries wet markets in asia hosting a diversity of wild animal species were the sources of the novel coronavirus that triggered the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic in 2003 peiris et al 2003 as for ebola viruses the animal reservoirs of the virus were unknown at the time of its emergence in humans civet cats found infected with the virus at the wet markets were the stepping stones in the chain of transmission of this new pathogen to humans song et al 2005 for both filoviruses and the sars coronavirus bat species are now considered the most likely reservoir hosts li et al 2005 monath 1999 these two examples illustrate the complex cross-species transmission dynamics at the humanwildanimal interface that arise from the intensifying trade of wildlife and their products among the most spectacular examples of global spread of a wildlife disease is that of the emerging chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis affecting and threatening amphibian populations worldwide its emergence is thought to have followed the international trade of an african clawed frog xenopus laevis starting in the 1930s weldon et al 2004 the pathogen is now found on every continent that has amphibians and is likely the cause of the dramatic amphibian population declines and extinctions recently witnessed in many parts of the world the trading component of the contemporary humananimal interface has undoubtedly taken domestication and the exploitation of animal species to levels beyond the imaginable realizing unparalleled melting-pot conditions for the emergence of new human and animal pathogens agriculture born during the neolithic revolution continues to expand meeting the demands of our growing global society agricultural development in south america and asia has altered the population dynamics of new commensal species including a large diversity of rodent and bat species the discovery in the past decades of an ever increasing diversity of arena- and hantaviruses in south american rodent species of which some have caused severe disease in humans upon zoonotic transmission correlates with the agricultural development characterizing this part of the world charrel and de lamballerie 2003 zeier et al 2005 destruction of natural habitat for agricultural purposes has been associated with rodent colonization and population expansion that favored the cross-species transmission of these novel pathogens to the human species arena- and hantaviruses have co-evolved with their rodent hosts they cause asymptomatic chronic infections in these hosts and their phylogeny closely mimics that of their hosts in a similar way to that of the heirloom pathogens of humans cross-species transmission of these viruses typically may turn them from harmless to life-threatening pathogens for both humans and domestic animals while new world arenaviruses such as junin machupo and guanarito viruses cause hemorrhagic fever syndromes in humans new world hantaviruses such as sin nombre oropouche and andes viruses cause acute pulmonary syndromes most occurrences of these virus infections in humans are the result of zoonotic transmissions however most arena- and hantaviruses have only limited ability to transmit from human-to-human raising questions about the limiting factors that determine their adaptation to the human species eventually posing an epidemic or even pandemic threat in asia the destruction of natural habitat for agricultural purposes has been associated with fruit bat colonization and population expansion these were and continue to be at the origin of recurring outbreaks of henipavirus infections in domestic animals and humans field et al 2001 the development of fruit tree plantations integrated with pig farming in malaysia provided ideal conditions for the cross-species transmission of nipah virus see chapter in this volume fruit bats that colonized the plantations contaminated fruits with their virus-loaded saliva contaminated fruits eventually were eaten by pigs these developed respiratory and neurological disease and further transmitted the emerging pathogen to humans nipah virus is now known to circulate over most of the range of pteropus fruit bats in asia in bangladesh the virus is directly transmitted from bats to humans possibly via the consumption of contaminated sap juice and may also have limited ability to transmit between individuals the related hendra virus has likewise been transmitted from fruit bats to horses in australia and can further infect humans in contact with diseased horses upon zoonotic transmission field et al 2001 like agriculture growing urbanization worldwide infringes on natural habitats and creates favorable conditions for commensal species providing shelters and ample food resources to sustain their ever-growing populations urban and periurban environments are colonized by opportunistic mammalian and bird species favoring the emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens in europe the geographical range of the zoonotic tapeworm echinococcus multilocularis causing severe liver disease in humans is currently expanding deplazes 2006 this is in part associated with colonizing and flourishing populations of red fox definitive hosts in cities and periurban areas deplazes et al 2004 west nile and usutu viruses are flaviviruses transmitted by mosquito vectors with birds as reservoir vertebrate hosts in europe and north america where these viruses have recently emerged bird reservoirs notably passerines act as amplifying hosts up to city centers and densely populated areas humans bitten by infected mosquitoes act as dead-end hosts and may develop severe neurological disease hubalek and halouzka 1999 industrialization associated with the development of intensive food animal production and trading systems agriculture and urbanization has had strong impacts on the environment in particular by affecting the global climate these environmental changes may be affecting the humananimal interface in an unprecedented way this environmental interface is reviewed by colwell and dazsak in this volume the worldwide challenge of antimicrobial resistance although largely elicited by the abuse in medical practice has added a new dimension to the humananimal interface after the introduction of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine bacteria resistant to antibiotics rapidly emerged and the importance of spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from animals to humans became more and more recognized resistant bacteria from animals can be transmitted to humans not only by direct contact but also via food products of animal origin not only clonal spread of resistant strains occurs but also transfer of resistance genes approximately 50  of all antibacterial agents used annually in the eu are given to animals not only for therapy and prevention of bacterial infections but also as feed savers antimicrobial growth promoters or performance enhancers ape since 1969 molecules that are used for therapy in humans andor animals may not be used as ape in most eu-member states however many of ape that are used today in the eu are analogs of and show cross resistance with therapeutic antibiotics van den bogaard and stobberingh 2000 the establishment of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa in farm animals in the early 2000 has provided a reservoir of infection for humans and dairy cattle particularly in continental europe described as livestock-associated mrsa la-mrsa la-mrsa were significantly associated with veterinarians in contact with livestock and a strong direct association was found between la-mrsa acquisition and exposure to live pigs graveland et al 2011 while the modern relationships between humans and animal species and the environment have set the stage for increasingly more frequent cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens the mass movements of people from local to cross-continental scales allow their emergence and spread within local communities and around the world with unprecedented speed in particular global tourism and global business travel have accelerated the dynamics of emergence and spread of zoonotic pathogens complicating source tracing and control strategies exotic diseases are brought back upon return from exotic journeys and considerably expand the scope of differential diagnosis approaches upon presentation of often non-specific clinical signs such as fever neurological intestinal or respiratory symptoms current examples include spectacular cases of filovirus and bat rabies infections in the netherlands timen et al 2009 van thiel et al 2007 these infections did not result in onward transmission of the pathogens in the human population yet when emerging pathogens acquire the ability to transmit between individuals the globalization of the human society allows for their rapid spread around the globe making their efficient control difficult the unstoppable spread of the latest influenza pandemic within a matter of weeks in 2009 is a clear example of a lost race against a highly transmissible pathogen in 2003 the emergence of the sars coronavirus from wet markets in asia was followed by its global spread in a matter of weeks within 4 months more than 8000 cases of sars were reported in 26 countries with a case-fatality rate of 10  peiris et al 2003 the economic impact of the outbreak was estimated in the range of 30140 billion us dollars skowronski et al 2005 however for the first time in human history the control of the emerging pandemic was accomplished through an unprecedented pathogen discovery effort followed by an exhaustive public health effort both coordinated by who effectively nipping the first pandemic of the century in the bud although the global humananimal interface is the culmination to unparalleled levels of all its facets originally drawn at different periods of human pre-historical and historical development the race between the ever increasing range of infectious diseases fuelled by the complex mix of predisposing factors in our modern society is largely paralleled by the development of equally complex mix of intervention strategies invented and implemented by humans the latter includes the coordinated and timely use of the achievements of medical molecular mathematical social and other sciences recently this resulted in the timely identification of the sars coronavirus allowing concerted public health efforts to successfully control the emerging epidemic before the newly introduced pathogen could cause a full blown pandemic although this will prove much more difficult for more transmissible pathogens as was the case for the latest pandemic influenza virus of 2009 the sars episode is unique in our recorded history among other most successful and hard-won achievements of modern medicine are the eradications of two long-time plagues of humans and domestic animals smallpox and rinderpest respectively in both cases a combination of mass vaccination intensive surveillance and case containment successfully brought these pathogens that have devastated human and animal populations for at least thousands of years to extinction with last identified cases in 1977 and 2001 respectively normile 2008 fenner 1977 stimulated by these successes concerted public health efforts are currently applied for the eradication of measles and polio although these successful eradications may represent victories over infectious diseases and put the ball in our camp the dynamic nature of infectious pathogens in particular due to their epidemiological and evolutionary flexibility and adaptability call for words of caution against losing the ball from sight with the eradication of pathogens and the waning of immunity that had characterized the human population for millenia we start to face new challenges and issues by opening niches for colonization by related pathogens lurking in the animal world monkeypox virus may be considered a looming threat at the global humananimal interface which one day upon the regular interspecies transmissions could fully adapt to more efficient human-to-human transmission and fill the niche left empty by the eradicated smallpox virus stittelaar and osterhaus 2001 similar future threats may come from animal morbilliviruses after the eradication of rinderpest or the future eradication of measles de swart et al 2012 in the new era of cutting-edge technology the plethora of classical and novel molecular techniques currently leads to the discovery of an array of hitherto unknown human and animal microorganisms and viruses some of which may be candidates to fill newly emerging niches at the modern humananimal interface therefore perhaps rather than investing in trying to influence the complex mix of predisposing factors of emergence at the humananimal interface investment in these and other newly emerging technologies and intervention strategies may eventually lead to preventing disasters caused by emerging infections allowing us not only to win major battles but also to win the apparently never ending war between mankind and its relentlessly emerging microbial foes the humananimal interface has developed since the first bipedal steps of humankind into a complex pattern of interactions between humans and animals in recent eras strongly affected by the unprecedented impact that humans proved to have on their global environment by looking back into the evolution and history of our species it is tempting to conclude that the humananimal interface has significantly contributed to the shaping of this evolution and history via cross-species transmission of a large number of more or less versatile pathogens since the human impact on the global environment shows no signs of decline investment in a better understanding of the humananimal interface using our state-of-the-art technology may well secure a leading edge in the never-ending battle against infectious diseases coming from the animal world  difference in immune response in vaccinated and unvaccinated swedish individuals after the 2009 influenza pandemic isabelle magalhaes mikael eriksson charlotte linde rashid muhammad lalit rane aditya ambati rebecca axelsson-robertson bahareh khalaj nancy alvarez-corrales giulia lapini emanuele montomoli annika linde nancy pedersen l markus maeurer   the 2009 h1n1 pandemic h1n1 influenza flu a pdmh1n1 was first reported in mexico and california 1 as the virus spread globally it became evident that the infection was of moderate severity with a broad clinical spectrum of symptoms 2 early data from mexico suggested that pdmh1n1 may cause severe respiratory illness in otherwise healthy young and middle-aged people 3 it is now estimated that in the united states pdmh1n1 caused higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths in children and adults 1864 years of age than the flu of the previous season but lower rates of clinical events in adults over 65 years of age 4 this finding supports the notion that previous exposures to h1n1 in older individuals provides higher cross-protective immune responses than in younger individuals 5 in the autumn of 2009 pdmh1n1 vaccines pdm vaccines were available across the globe it was estimated that pdmh1n1 vaccination prevented 400010000 hospitalizations and 200500 deaths in the us 6 there are several unanswered questions concerning h1n1 flu infection and vaccination firstly the impact of previous immune responses induced by flu vaccinations or by flu exposures on the ability to mount new anti-flu immune responses 7-9 it is therefore of interest to map the adaptive humoral and cellular immune response prior to vaccination and prior to the onset of flu symptoms secondly the differential quality and quantity of humoral and cellular immune responses directed against flu targets induced either by flu vaccination or by flu infection has not been well defined thirdly several reports have discussed a silent infection with h1n1 in non-vaccinated participants yet the real extent of such a silent infection is difficult to determinein part due to cross-reacting antibodies abs from previous exposures or vaccines 10 antibodies as well as cd4 and cytotoxic cd8 t-cell immune responses play a critical role in the host defense against flu 1112 increased cellular reactivity to flu defined by ifn- productiona key cytokine in the pro-inflammatory response to fluin participants who have not experienced influenza-like ili symptoms has not been determined up to now this may help to identify silent flu infection in order to address these questions we designed a prospective study of

concentration of 25 gml ha we also tested the flu matrix antigens m1 and m2 present as peptides and used at a final concentration of 1 gml as control we used the cfp-10 antigen from mycobacterium tuberculosis we could not include the ah1n1california72009 antigens in the cellular assays since the test plates had to be prepared in advance due to quality control issues to ensure batch-to-batch consistency the pdmh1n1 antigen preparation was not yet available in the summer of 2009 and the assay worked only with freshly obtained heparinised blood in contrast to the cellular assay ab titres could be tested retrospectively if study participants experienced symptoms of ili they performed a nasal swab to be tested for 22 viral targets additional file 1 table s1 as described 14 swab processing and pcr are described in detail in the supplementary data section additional file 1 text material s1 this step was taken to link ili symptoms with the detection of defined viral pathogens in addition if the pcr tested positive for h1n1 a nurse visited the participant 14 days on average after onset of symptoms in order to obtain a blood sample which allowed study of the humoral and cellular immune response early after infection this was also performed for participants infected with coronavirus as a control group sera collected at study entry and after the flu season in the spring of 2010 and during a home visit in case of a positive h1n1 or coronavirus pcr detected from a nasal swab were stored at 80c until testing single radial haemolysis srh test against ah1n1california072009 was performed at the department of physiopathology experimental medicine and public health of the university of siena according to procedures described in detail elsewhere 15 diameters of the haemolysis area for each serum tested were measured sera with areas of haemolysis equal to or higher than 4 mm2 but lower than 25 mm2 were considered to indicate seropositivity but not protection haemolysis areas equal to or higher than 25 mm2 were considered to indicate seroprotection statistical analysis was performed on i the ifn- concentrations as a cellular response to flu and non-flu antigens ii the pcr-based virus detection iii the srh ab data and iv the questionnaire data including symptoms reported in a web-based questionnaire by the study participants during and after the flu season data were analysed using sas 92 software sas institute descriptive statistics were used and spearman analysis for independence was performed to verify integrity of data significance analysis was performed using the pearson 2-test students t-test and the wilcoxon-mannwhitney two-sample rank-sum test multivariate operations including operations on stratified variable dependencies and cluster analysis using the varclus procedure were used in the analysis based on the combined dataset constituents ie ifn- pcr antigen-specific abs symptoms and vaccination for each analysis the nature of the statistical test used is indicated in the corresponding figure legend and table after quality control ie exclusion of samples without identification the analysis group consisted of 1971 participants 1807 adults aged between 18 and 65 years median age 36 53 women 155 adults over 65 median age 71 years 65 women and 9 children with a median age of 8 years the baseline step autumnwinter 2009 is designated time point a and the event step autumnwinter 2009 is designated time point b altogether 466 study participants mailed a swab for viral pathogen analysis and 618 participants filed a self-report flu event questionnaire for 41 study participants a positive h1n1 or coronavirus pcr for controls triggered a home visit from a nurse to study the immune response at an early time point the final step spring 2010 is designated time point c where 918 study participants 466 of the initial number of participants again provided a blood sample see overview of the study in figure 1 this allowed us to study the humoral and cellular immune responses directed against fluand also against control antigensin an unbiased way pdmh1n1 swine flu rna could be detected in 27 swabs 24 from study participants and 3 from household members and coronavirus rna could be detected in 53 swabs from 51 study participants and 2 household members see overview of the swabs analysis in additional file 1 table s2 study participants reported their flu vaccination status in the web questionnaires 253 of study participants had received at least a single previous seasonal flu vaccination between 2006 and 2009 631 n  755 of the study participants who responded to the follow-up questionnaire in the spring received the pdm flu vaccine in 20092010 we evaluated the impact of previous flu vaccinations on ifn- production and ah1n1california72009-specific ab levels measured by srh at study entry table 1 the analysis showed significantly lower levels of ifn- production in response to ah1n1brisbane592007 ah1n1solomon islands32006 and bflorida42006 in blood from study participants who had previously received seasonal flu vaccination during the period 2006 to spring 2009 and who did not receive the pdm flu vaccine than in those without any seasonal flu or pdm vaccination during the same period p  004 we could not detect any significant differences in levels of ah1n1california72009-specific abs between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants notably both groups were considered seropositive at srh  4 mm2 but below protective levels srh  25 mm2 at time point a table 1 additionally for time point a we measured by the flu hemagglutination inhibition assay the presence of abs directed against ah1n1california72009 ah1n1brisbane592007 ah1n1solomon islands32006 ah3n2uruguay7162007 and ah5n1vietnam12032004 in 7 participants above 50 years of age who had received previous seasonal flu vaccination and 7 age-matched participants who had not received previous seasonal flu vaccination interestingly 2 and 3 participants out of 7 participants who did not receive seasonal flu vaccination showed measurable levels of abs specific for ah1n1brisbane592007 and ah1n1solomon islands32006 respectively but only 1 participant out 7 participants who had received previous seasonal flu vaccination showed measurable levels of abs specific for ah1n1solomon islands32006 data not shown in contrast to the differences observed at entry into the study time point a no differences were observed in ifn- production between study participants with or without previous seasonal flu vaccinations table 1 at time point c at this time point levels of ah1n1california72009-specific abs were below protective levels srh  25 mm2 in both vaccinated and unvaccinated participants we followed the study participants who gave blood at time points a and c and reported in the spring of 2010 their 20092010 pandemic vaccination status at time point a the levels of ah1n1california72009-specific abs and ifn- production in response to the flu antigens were comparable between participants who received after time point a the pdm flu vaccine and individuals who chose not to receive the vaccine seropositive at srh  4 mm2 but below protective levels srh  25 mm2 at time point c the levels of ah1n1california72009-specific abs were above protective levels srh  25 mm2 in pdm flu vaccinated participants the ab levels were significantly higher p  0001 than in non-pmd flu vaccinated study participants we also observed a statistically significant increase in ifn- production in response to all flu antigens except for bmalaysia25062004 including the flu matrix antigen m1 in blood from study participants who received the pdm flu vaccine in the winter of 20092010 compared to the non-vaccinated study participants p  004 table 2 note that m1 is not a designated component of the flu vaccine we examined whether ili symptoms segregated with the flu vaccination records 580 of study participants who were vaccinated also reported the experience of ili symptoms 65 study participants who received the pdm flu vaccine and filed their ili symptoms report later during the flu season ie after december 2009 and after they had received the pdm flu vaccine experienced significantly more symptoms than the 170 study participants who did not receive the pdm flu vaccine and also reported their ili symptoms after december 2009 vaccinated study participants reported 4 ili symptoms rather than 3 symptoms on average ie nasal discharge p  002 fatigue p  004 cough p  001 sneezing p  004 and chills p  005 table 3 the 45 study participants who received the pdm flu vaccine and mailed a swab later showed less frequent detection 645 of coronavirus rna p  003 but showed a higher percentage 1445 of rhinovirus rna p  001 in their nasal swabs as compared to the 139 study participants who chose not to get vaccinated but mailed a swab due to symptoms of ili 44139 we analysed the immune status from study participants who did not report any symptoms of ili since they were either i not exposed to pathogens leading to ili symptoms ii they may have been protected due to pre-existing anti-flu directed immune responses or pdm flu vaccination we show in table 4 significant differences time point c versus time point a in ifn- production and ah1n1california72009-specific abs in blood samples from study participants who received the pdm flu vaccine and reported no ili symptoms versus blood samples from unvaccinated study participants reporting no ili symptoms at time point c ie after the flu season we identified higher levels of ah1n1california72009-specific abs p  0001 and ifn- production in response to ah5n1vietnam12032004 p  003 to ah1n1brisbane592007 to ah1n1solomon islands32006 p  0001 as well as to the m1 matrix antigen p  001 in study participants who received the pdm flu vaccine next we examined ifn- production and ah1n1california72009-specific abs in blood from study participants vaccinated and non-vaccinated who reported ili symptoms table 5 we identified a slightly different immunological reactivity pattern as compared to the group of study participants who did not report any ili symptoms at all see above i the increase between time point c and time point a in the mean value of ah1n1california72009-specific abs in unvaccinated and vaccinated study participants was not statistically significant yet it reached protective levels 25 mm2 at time point c for pdm flu vaccinated study participants ii vaccinated study participants showed a significant increase in ifn- production in response to ah1n1brisbane592007 p  0001 to ah3n2uruguay7162007 to ah1n1solomon islands32006 p  001 and to ah3n2wisconsin672005 p  002 we analysed in greater detail the ifn- production and ah1n1california72009-specific abs from 21 study participants who tested positive for pdmh1n1 rna and received a home visit time point b after the ili symptom report table 6 biological material from participants who tested positive for coronavirus rna served as controls blood from participants with a positive pdmh1n1 pcr but not the coronavirus positive controls showed significantly higher levels of ah1n1california72009-specific abs p  0001 at time point b and at time point c as compared to time point a ie before the flu season participants testing positive for pdmh1n1 rna also showed significantly higher levels of ifn- production at time point b than at time point a p  001 in response to all flu antigens including m1 except for bflorida42006 and bmalaysia25062004 we observed significantly higher levels of ifn- production in response to only 3 flu antigens ah3n2wisconsin672005 ah1n1brisbane592007 and ah1n1solomon islands32006 in the flu season time point c as compared to the time point zero samples timepoint a thus the cellular immune response to the h1n1 infection was short-lived it was directed against a broad panel of flu targets defined by strong ifn- production and pronounced shortly after onset of symptoms ie at the time of the home visit this was not found to be true several months after the infection the cellular immune response defined by ifn- production was weaker and directed only against a narrow panel of flu targets time point c next we examined differences between ifn- production and ah1n1california72009-specific abs at time points a and c from i study participants who received the pdm flu vaccine and reported no ili symptoms and from study participants who did not receive the pdm flu vaccine and whose swab results did not test pdmh1n1 pcr positive and ii either reported at least one ili or iii reported no ili symptoms table 7 we observed significantly increased levels between time points a and c p  0003 of ah1n1california72009-specific abs in blood from participants who tested positive for h1n1 and did not receive pdm vaccination mean increase in ab titre srh 145 and from study participants who received the pdm vaccine mean increase in ab titre srh 8 ah1n1california72009-specific abs were above protective levels 25 mm2 for those both groups vaccinated or non-vaccinated at time point c no significant difference between time points a and c before and after the flu season concerning ah1n1california72009-specific antibody levels was observed in the group of participants who either tested negative for h1n1 or received flu vaccination regardless of the reported ili symptom status both groups were seropositive but exhibited antibody titres below protective levels we observed a very similar ifn- production profile in blood from participants who i did not receive the pdm flu vaccination ii tested negative for pdmh1n1 and iii reported no ili symptoms compared to those who tested h1n1 positive increased ifn- production in response to the flu antigens ah1n1brisbane592007 ah1n1solomon islands32006 ah3n2wisconsin672005 and ah3n2uruguay7162007 p  004 this study showed that pdm flu vaccination acalifornia72009 induced increased levels of ah1n1california72009-specific abs but also strong immune cellular responses measured by ifn- production in a whole-blood assay directed against flu a antigens from h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 strains flu b strains and the flu m1 matrix antigen we have not been able to include the pdm flu strain however increased ifn- production after vaccination suggested that acalifornia72009-specific t-cell responses were induced by pdm flu vaccination this would imply that pdm flu vaccine induced cross-reactive cellular responses did not only target the flu a h1n1 strains but also h3n2 h5n1 and flu b strains in agreement with this observation we showed that participants who received the pdm flu vaccination exhibited also a significant increase in ab titers directed against ah1n1solomon islands32006 and ah5n1vietnam12032004 while participants who did not receive the pdm flu vaccine exhibited only a significant increase in ah1n1california72009-specific abs but not in abs against the other flu a strains tested by the flu hemagglutination inhibition assay data not shown the flu vaccine studied in this report represents a split virus vaccine which is mainly composed of surface membrane glycoproteins yet traces of m1 have also been detected 16 as part of the vaccine formulation we tested m1 and m2 as targets for cellular immune responses in the current study the m2 protein is a proton-selective ion channel protein integral in the viral envelope of the influenza a virus m2 brings protons into the virion core acidification of virus interior leads to weakening of electrostatic interaction and leads to dissociation between m1 matrix protein and viral rib nucleoprotein rnp complexes 17 traces of m1 in the split vaccine may be responsible for the strong anti-m1 directed responses defined by ifn- production which has not been reported until now flu vaccines are produced and standardised based on their haemagglutinin and neuraminidase content and traces of the m1 proteins contained in the current standard vaccines may in part be responsible for conferring protective immune responses between flu a strains since the m1 protein is quite conserved 18 the m1-directed cellular immune responses along with traces of m1 proteins in split vaccines may in part responsible for the cross-reactive immune responses against h5n1 associated with the pdm flu vaccine since cd4 and cd8 t-cell responses directed against h5n1 have preferentially reported to focus on m1 or np nucleoproteins 19 in addition we showed at study entry that previous seasonal flu vaccination in 20062009 did not lead to an increased ifn- production in response to flu antigen components from 20062009 flu vaccines but was instead associated with significantly lower ifn- production in response to flu antigen components from 20082009 flu vaccines ah1n1brisbane592007 ah1n1solomon islands32006 and bflorida42006 a similar trend was observed when analysing h1n1brisbane592007- and ah1n1solomon islands32006-specific antibodies however at the end of the study we could not detect significant differences in ifn- production in response to flu antigens between previously vaccinated and unvaccinated participants this suggests that after the flu season previously vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were able to mount comparable immune responses as measured by ifn- production in the whole-blood assay a recent report showed that individuals with a history of seasonal flu vaccination exhibited after natural pdm flu infection or pdm flu vaccination a skewed ab response towards previously encountered flu antigens further proving the impact of previous flu vaccination on subsequent infection or vaccination 20 seasonal flu vaccination of children has been reported to interfere with the development of heterosubtypic immunity 21 and ab responses to pandemic h1n1 appeared to be reduced in participants who received seasonal flu vaccination 3 months prior to vaccination with the pmd flu vaccine 22 the report by skowronski and co-workers also suggested an association between the previous 20082009 flu vaccination and pandemic h1n1 illness in canada 23 the mechanisms underlying this finding are ill-defined and warrant further research to better understand the impact of seasonal flu vaccination ie the potential negative imprint of previous vaccinations on cellular immune memory responses reservations about flu vaccination including the notion that flu vaccination would not result in appropriate protection have been discussed in the public domain 24-26 one of the arguments is that flu vaccination may not protect against ili symptoms during flu the season this notion was corroborated in our study a number of study participants after pdm flu vaccination experienced more ili symptoms perhaps due to the observed increase in prevalence of rhinovirus infection in pdm flu vaccinated participants as compared to non-pdm flu vaccinated participants other reasons may account for these observations one of them being the low predictive value of the ili case definition 26 future prospective studies may address the question whether certain flu vaccines are able to increase cellular immune responses in the respiratory system particularly after encounter with the wildtype flu increased influenza-like symptoms may occur upon exposure to additional pathogens such as rhino- or coronavirus that stimulate flu-primed innate or adaptive immune responses this hypothesis is supported by the observation that infection with rhinovirus may have delayed the circulation of h1n1 most likely via activation of non-specific innate immune responses in the respiratory system 27 study participants who received the pdm flu vaccine showed similar ifn- production profiles in response to the flu antigens tested irrespective of the experience of ili symptoms however we observed that study participants who received the pdm flu vaccine and reported ili symptoms compared to non-pdm flu vaccinated participants with ili symptoms showed by the end of the study a comparable increase in acalifornia72009-specific abs and an increase in ifn- production in response to the flu a h1n1 and h3n2 strains this immune status could not be observed in participants who reported no ili symptoms irrespective of whether or not they received the pmd flu vaccination this suggests that some pmd flu vaccinated participants who reported ili symptoms may have been exposed to the h3n2 seasonal flu supporting previous observations that pmd flu vaccination did not affect the rate of h3n2 infections 28 the pdmh1n1 strain dominated the flu season in sweden in 20092010 but flu h3n2 and flu b were also present in 17 and 14 of the samples analysed by the swedish national influenza centre 29 the comparable increase in ah1n1california72009-specific abs in serum from unvaccinated and pdm flu vaccinated study participants who reported ili symptoms also suggests that non-pdm flu vaccinated study participants may have been exposed to the pdm flu we speculate that the non-pdm flu vaccinated study participants who reported ili symptoms had been exposed to the pdm flu these individuals exhibited lower levels of ifn- production in response to the h1n1 and h3n2 flu antigens as compared to pmd flu vaccinated study participants who reported ili symptoms this would also fit with the hypothesis that ifn- production directed against related flu antigens upon natural by pdmh1n1 infection is short-lived as compared to ifn- induced by pdm flu vaccination this notion was indeed corroborated we showed that shortly after a positive pdmh1n1 pcr ifn- production to most of the flu antigens was significantly increased yet declined by the end of the study may 2010 in contrast we could detect significantly higher levels of ifn- production in response to m1 which is not a designated vaccine component at the end of the study in pdm flu vaccinated participants this was not the case for study participants who tested positive for pdmh1n1 by pcr table 6 finally our observation that study participants i with a negative pdm flu pcr ii absent pdm flu vaccination and iii a negative ili symptom report showed increased ifn- production in response to most of the flu antigens concomitant with the absence of ah1n1california72009-specific ab increase suggests that these individuals may have been exposed to pdm flu ie that they were silently infected and developed a strong anti-pdm flu t-cell but not a b-cell response the detection of stronger cellular responses measured after the flu season directed against m1 from study participants who received pdm flu vaccination as compared to study participants who had a natural pdm flu infection argues for a more detailed analysis of the role of m1-specific cellular responses induced by vaccination m1 responses are currently discussed to be crucial in mediating protective anti-flu directed immune responses 30 and may therefore become an important component of future vaccines the prospective study layout of the lifegene ili cohort also demonstrates the value of a time point zero sample to gauge the immune response prior to a vaccination or exposure pre-existing humoral and cellular immune responses shape the nature of the immune response associated with immune protection or immune pathology the authors declare that they have no

research the national institutes of health nihsupported national primate research centers nprcs provide an effective infrastructure to supply and house nhpsabout 40000 total and mostly macaques macacafor the benefit of research into human disease other nhp species from africa eg african green and sooty mangabey monkeys baboons and chimpanzees and the new world eg marmosets spider and owl monkeys are also housed in nprcs and other facilities and have contributed significantly to research on aids and other infectious diseases when applicable we mention these other nhp species in the relevant infectious disease section the 16 species of macaques are found primarily in southern asia napier and napier 1985 they are omnivorous adaptable to almost any ecological niche and adapt well to captivity the species most commonly used in biomedical research are rhesus macaques m mulatta from india but no longer imported cynomolgus long-tailed or crab-eating macaques m fascicularis from southern asia and pigtail macaques m nemestrina from southeast asia the nih national center for research resources ncrr plans to increase the number of macaque breeding colonies including specific pathogen-free spf animals and set up a database to enable researchers to locate animals with particular characteristics ncrr 2004-2008 by experimentally inducing infectious diseases in such a closely related primate or occasionally studying naturally occurring infection investigators hope of course to gain valuable insight relevant to humans into disease mechanisms so as to develop improved therapies diagnostics and vaccines the opportunity is at hand to better achieve these goals because of the recent availability of the sequence of the macaque genome rhesus macaque genome sequencing and analysis consortium 2007 and of the genomes of many infectious pathogens and their insect vectors in particular much new information can be obtained about the agent-host relationship through the use of macaque-specific nucleic acid and protein assays in this article we review the various human infectious diseases for which macaques have served as models over the past century these models represent diverse pathogens including bacteria viruses fungi parasites and prions the categorization of specific agents in table 1 is based on a recent survey that explores the origins of human infectious diseases wolfe et al 2007 under each broad category the diseases are ordered according to viral bacterial and parasitic etiology and according to historical precedent or related infectious agents and diseases we have also included several nhp infectious agents that produce disease similar to related human pathogens many pathogens of humans are zoonoses diseases transmitted from animals to humans and several zoonotic pathogens are transmitted directly from human to human in particular zoonotic infections are the major source of emerging and reemerging diseases worldwide murphy 1998 palmer et al 2005 wolfe et al 2005 furthermore some human pathogens called anthropozoonoses can spread accidentally to nhps for most of the macaque models of infectious pathogens described in this review we mention important historical events or current relevance to human disease and focus on the most up-to-date research accomplishments because of space limitations we describe primarily recent and novel examples of infectious disease modeling in captive macaque species accordingly cited references are representative and by no means comprehensive we refer readers to other published resources for further information on human infectious agents including viruses graffe 1991 knipe et al 2006 bacteria mandell et al 2005 and parasites marquardt et al 2000 as well as for the historical impact of these pathogens karlen 1995 oldstone 1998 our goal is to focus on the macaque as an immensely valuable resource for a wide spectrum of comparative infectious disease research that benefits both humans and animals although fm burnet showed in the early 1940s that macaques were susceptible to influenza a virus graffe 1991 121 the principal animal models for extensive immunization trials and strain typing remained ferrets and mice recently researchers have used macaques to compare the pathogenesis of highly virulent influenza strains such as the reconstructed 1918 pandemic strain and the pathogenic bird flu strain h5n1 with a nonvirulent conventional strain h1n1 rimmelzwaan et al 2001 genomics and proteomics technologies with macaque-specific reagents have shown dramatic differences in gene expression in pulmonary lesions induced by the h5n1 influenza virus and tightly co-regulated genes expressed in peripheral white blood cells that might prove a marker of early infection baas et al 2006 apparent cytokine storms triggered by alveolar damage from h5n1 virus replication in the lungs induced an acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction at remote sites that were free of virus rimmelzwaan et al 2003 a similar transcriptome approach revealed that the virulent 1918 strain of influenza virus induced a lethal respiratory infection associated with an atypical innate immune response and an abnormal antiviral response kobasa et al 2007 a better understanding of the virus-host interaction in the macaque will aid development of interventions to modulate the hosts innate immune response to virulent influenza virus and facilitate early diagnosis a novel live vaccine incorporating the h5n1 hemagglutinin influenza virus gene in an avian newcastle disease virus vector and given via the respiratory tract to african green monkeys has induced high levels of h5n1 neutralizing antibodies and is therefore considered a candidate for clinical evaluation in humans dinapoli et al 2007 natural infection with hav associated with mild clinical disease has been detected in newly caught macaques le bras et al 1984 shevtsova et al 1988 whether of rhesus or human origin hav also causes experimental infection with little or no evidence of mild hepatitis in macaques mao et al 1981 however newly captured monkeys can be very sensitive to hav and its associated acute and chronic liver disease presumably due to the stress of acclimatization there is no compelling need to advance a macaque model as an efficacious hav vaccine has been licensed since 1992 natural infection with hbv-like virus associated with mild hepatitis has been observed in recently imported cynomolgus macaques from indonesia kornegay et al 1985 rhesus macaques can be experimentally infected with human hbv with no evidence of liver damage barker et al 1975 zuckerman et al 1975 however macaques from morocco m sylvanus developed liver pathology after intrahepatic inoculation with a replication-competent hbv dna plasmid construct gheit et al 2002 highly effective hbv vaccines have been licensed since 1982 so there is no need for an animal model for this virus hcv the major cause of post-transfusion hepatitis was isolated and cloned in 1989 choo et al 1989 mutations in the hcv genome allow this virus to avoid immune surveillance the outcome is chronic infection and difficulty in producing an effective vaccine cynomolgus rhesus and japanese macaques are resistant to experimental hcv infection abe et al 1993 therefore the chimpanzee which is susceptible remains the animal model of choice for hcv vaccine research however researchers are using the macaque model for hcv immunogenicity studies particularly in an effort to define vaccine regimens that produce stronger cellular immune responses capone et al 2006ab li et al 2003 rollier et al 2005 hev is an emerging human pathogen endemic to southwest and central asia the middle east north africa and mexico this virus which spreads by the fecal-oral route causes a significant number of acute hepatitis cases in humans including epidemics with high 20 mortality generally however most patients recover and chronic hev infection does not develop natural hev infection occurs asymptomatically in japanese macaques m fuscata and may be transmissible to humans hirano et al 2003 cynomolgus and rhesus macaques are quite susceptible to human hev subclinical infection aggarwal et al 2001 graff et al 2005 kawai et al 1999 and have been extensively used in recent years to demonstrate the protective efficacy of several antiviral recombinant and dna vaccines kamili et al 2004 li et al 2005b purcell et al 2003 zhang et al 2002 hgv isolated in 1995-1996 is distantly related to hcv it is readily transmitted by blood transfusion with a carrier rate of 2-5 in the general nhp population rhesus macaques are susceptible to experimental infection and disease with hgv or genomic rna ren et al 2005 xu et al 2001 however because there is no evidence that hgv is harmful to humans there is no need to develop anti-hgv vaccines tests or drugs the resurgence of mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb as a major global cause of death has been accelerated by the hiv epidemic and the appearance of multidrug-resistant mtb strains improved diagnostics drugs and vaccines are needed macaques are highly susceptible to human mtb as well as bovine and avian mycobacteria and manifest the complete spectrum of clinical and pathologic manifestations of human tbextending from active progressive disease to latency and healing capuano et al 2003 walsh et al 1996 natural outbreaks of human bovine or avian tb have occurred repeatedly over the years in captive macaques zumpe et al 1980 fifty years ago macaques were used to demonstrate the efficacy of the bacillus calmette-guerin bcg vaccine an attenuated strain of m bovis and to evaluate other vaccine approaches and test new drugs against lethal challenge with mtb good 1968 schmidt 1956 although researchers have confirmed these results in recent years langermans et al 2001 neither the bcg vaccine nor drugs have curtailed the global spread of tb but with modern macaque-specific reagents on hand this model is being resurrected interferon gamma release from antigen-specific t cells provides a useful immunologic correlate of protection against mtb infection baskin et al 2004 the macaque model is helping to better define immunodominant antigens conserved in different mtb strains that induce maximum protection when given alone or together with bcg brusasca et al 2003 mcshane et al 2004 such antigens could become the basis for better diagnostics and vaccines the macaque model can also be useful for the study of coinfection with siv the counterpart of hiv macaques experimentally coinfected with siv and bcg exhibit a fatal disseminated disease characterized by bcg granulomas in multiple organs chen 2004 shen et al 2002 because hiv-infected human infants vaccinated with bcg also experience a high risk of developing disseminated bcg disease von reyn 2006 the world health organization who does not recommend bcg vaccination for hiv-infected children who 2007 an siv-induced compromise of adaptive t cell responses may contribute to this tuberculosis-like disease zhou et al 2003 understanding mtb pathogenesis in the macaque can lead to better management and control of the human tb epidemic the macaque is a superior animal model for investigating the pathogenesis of h pyloriassociated gastritis and gastric cancer kodama et al 2005 about half of the worlds population is infected with h pylori a bacterium that grows only in the stomach and is acquired orally in childhood about 3 of those infected exhibit gastritis and stomach ulcers and about 1 progress to stomach cancer h pylori secretes urease which converts urea to ammonia and reduces gastric acidity thus enhancing gastric colonization h pylori injects a toxin caga gene product in gastric epithelial cells leading to their disorganization saadat et al 2007 antibiotics are effective in eliminating the bacterium from the host thereby preventing complications the macaque has proven to be a suitable model for understanding the biology and molecular pathogenesis of h pylori macaques are naturally infected with several strains closely related to that of humans and are also highly susceptible to the human strain doi et al 2005 dubois et al 1994 1995 solnick et al 1999 2003 they develop gastritis and antral erosions indistinguishable from those that occur in humans reindel et al 1999 shuto et al 1993 macaques also exhibit atrophic gastritis a precursor to adenocarcinoma in humans captive rhesus monkeys are frequently colonized with a related species h cinaedi either asymptomatically or in association with chronic colitis and hepatitis fernandez et al 2002 a modification of the h pylori outer membrane protein expression that occurs during experimental infection solnick et al 2004 may facilitate epithelial adherence and promote chronic infection analysis of the gastric transcriptional profile has revealed an expected upregulation of cell structural elements and inflammatory and immune responses as well as a novel downregulation of heat shock protein huff et al 2004 these studies also demonstrated an increased expression of virulence genes thought to encode the h pylori type iv structural pilus and its accessory proteins boonjakuakul et al 2005 a predominant th1-type immune response is induced early after infection and may be associated with apoptosis of gastric lymphocytes and epithelial cells mattapallil et al 2000 tanaka et al 2005 researchers have evaluated the result of short-term antibiotic treatment on h pylori infection and intestinal microflora in macaques tanaka et al 2005 several vaccination strategies including recombinant h pylori urease partially protect macaques against infection with this agent dubois et al 1998 macaques have played a major role in poliomyelitis polio research particularly vaccine development graffe 1991 the first indication that the poliomyelitis agent was a filterable virus came in 1908-1909 when the disease known since prehistory was experimentally induced in macaques by inoculation of filtered spinal cord from an infected individual humans are the only known natural host for poliovirus and it was not until 1949 that the virus could be grown in tissue cultures of nonhuman primate kidney cells african green monkey vero cells in order to type different strains of poliovirus about 30000 rhesus macaques were used over a 3-year period for experimental infection the serotyping drew on about 100 wild virus strains from numerous anatomical sources monkey sera were typed by virus neutralization assays and by 1951 scientists had identified three predominant immulogical types of virus with type 1 the most prevalent and most virulent such cell cultures also allowed the demonstration of viremia in monkeys and humans in 1951-1952 based on this research in the nhp model the salk inactivated 1955 vaccine as well as the koprowski and later sabin 1962 attenuated polio vaccines were tested for immunogenicity safety and efficacy in many thousands of human children and were proven to be protective and safe simian vacuolating virus 40 sv40 a polyomavirus was discovered in 1959 as a contaminant of inactivated poliovirus vaccine prepared in macaque cell cultures however there is no conclusive evidence to implicate sv40 virus of polio vaccine origin in any human disease shah 2007 the detection of sv40-related sequences by polymerase chain reaction pcr1 in some mesotheliomas and meningiomas suggests an association with a related agent in certain human cancers carbone and pass 2006 white et al 2005 there is no evidence of hiv or siv in polio vaccine stocks used in the first us polio immunization campaigns rizzo et al 2001 in an example of reverse zoonosis in 1957 a polio type 2 outbreak presumably of human origin affected six monkeys in the nhp colony in sukhumie russia lapin and andreevna 1963 no human infection or cases of wild polio have occurred in this country since 1979 and the americas were declared polio-free in 1994 however polio is still a concern in some poor underdeveloped countries in africa and asia use of the macaque is therefore still necessary for monitoring the potential neurovirulence of the live attenuated sabin polio vaccine which is now administered primarily in developing countries rezapkin et al 1999 because reversion to virulence remains a problem with this live attenuated vaccine it is no longer given in the united states a transgenic mouse carrying the human polio virus receptor gene cd155 has been developed for neurogenic virulence testing abe et al 1995 nagata et al 2001 but the global drive to eradicate polio will probably continue to depend on the macaque model to test for neurogenic virulence of the oral vaccine importantly the macaque has been used recently in poliovirus pathogenicity studies samuel et al 1993 and in efforts to develop a hexavalent vaccine against inactivated poliovirus influenza hepatitis b diphtheria tetanus and pertussis caulfield et al 2000 despite the availability of a licensed vaccine since 1963 measles is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality worldwide responsible for an estimated 345000 deaths in 2005 inadvertent transmission of either this virus from humans or the closely related distemper virus from dogs to captive macaques has caused numerous outbreaks with significant morbidity and mortality choi et al 1999 jones-engel et al 2006 willy et al 1999 experimental inoculation of wild measles virus strains in macaques produces a disease that closely mimics human measles in its clinical and pathologic manifestations including immunosuppression and occasional central nervous system cns1 complications albrecht et al 1977 kobune et al 1996 undetected cns infection of macaques with measles virus may have affected the results of neurovirulence tests done with some oral poliovirus vaccines contreras and furesz 1992 this animal model has been particularly valuable for studying measles virus pathogenesis in the normal and immunocompromised host hicks et al 1977 polack et al 1999 zhu et al 1997b cellular immunity appears more important than humoral immunity in clearance of the virus pahar et al 2005 permar et al 2003 during the past decade investigators have taken advantage of this excellent disease model to test new vaccine strategies adult macaques immunized with either the human measles virus vaccine attenuvax or the canine distemper virus vaccine were protected against challenge infection by human measles virus christe et al 2002 because maternal measles virus antibody can interfere with the active immune response experiments were done in infant macaques to compare several recombinant vaccines given in the presence or absence of preexisting immunity at least partial protection against challenge infection and disease was achieved in infant macaques in the presence of maternal antibody to measles virus by vaccination with 1 replication-competent or -defective vaccinia virus expressing measles virus hemagglutinin and fusion proteins stittelaar et al 2000 zhu et al 2000 2 recombinant bcg expressing the measles virus nucleoprotein zhu et al 1997a or 3 a measles virus dna vaccine premenko-lanier et al 2004 addition of interleukin il1-12 to a recombinant measles virus vaccine altered the t helper type 2 immune response but did not improve the immunosuppression associated with challenge infection hoffman et al 2003 very recently a live attenuated measles virus vaccine given by aerosol administration has been efficacious in macaques de swart et al 2006 the goal of the global initiative against measles is to reduce measles mortality through the use of the current vaccine in countries with high measles deaths such as india indonesia and pakistan the macaque model is essential for defining an effective antimeasles vaccine regimen to achieve this goal simian varicella virus svv shares 70-75 genetic identity with human varicella chickenpox and herpes zoster shingles virus vzv gray and oakes 1984 simian varicella virus svv causes a highly contagious disease often fatal in old world monkeys including macaques wenner et al 1975 it is not known whether these monkeys are the natural host for the virus nor is there any evidence that svv infects humans svv infection of macaques is very similar in clinical symptoms and pathogenesis to vzv infection in humans and therefore provides an excellent model gray 2004 like vzv svv establishes lifelong latent infection in neural ganglia where it may be reactivated eg after gamma irradiation antiviral therapy has been effective in limiting fatalities in svv epizootics lake-bakaar et al 1988 the entire svv genome has been cloned sequenced and transfected into vero cells to yield infectious virus allowing site-specific mutagenesis and insertion of foreign genes to study pathogenesis and viral latency and to develop vaccines gray et al 2001 the current live attenuated vzv vaccine is generally safe in humans but there are some concerns about duration of efficacy and safety macaques offer an opportunity to evaluate new attenuated vzv vaccines as well as subunit or dna vaccines respiratory syncytial virus rsv is a major cause of severe respiratory disease in infant and elderly humans young macaques are susceptible to experimental rsv infection and exhibit mild clinical disease mcarthur-vaughan and gershwin 2002 simoes et al 1999 an inactivated rsv vaccine developed in the 1960s caused enhanced disease after natural infection researchers reproduced this immunopathological phenomenon in macaques and showed that it was caused by antibody-dependent enhancement of rsv replication ponnuraj et al 2003 a vaccine-induced il-13-mediated hypersensitivity to subsequent rsv infection also contributed at least in part to this adverse reaction de swart et al 2002 the macaque model is now proving helpful for assessing the safety of novel rsv vaccines designed to prevent the immunopathology that occurs after rsv infection de waal et al 2004 this newly discovered human paramyxovirus is a causative agent of acute lower respiratory tract infection in very young children the elderly and immunocompromised patients the virus is ubiquitous acquired early in life and readily cultured in rhesus monkey kidney cells very recently experimental infection of macaques with metapneumovirus induced an asymptomatic infection with transient protective immunity against reinfection with the homologous virus strain kuiken et al 2004 van den hoogen et al 2007 cytomegalovirus cmv1 infection of macaques closely resembles that of humans in its prevalence and natural history congenital cmv infection in humans is the leading infectious cause of birth defects in newborns as in humans macaque cmv is generally present after puberty as an asymptomatic lifelong infection vogel et al 1994 nave rhesus macaques experimentally infected with rhesus cmv seroconverted and became infected but remained healthy lockridge et al 1999 rhesus cmv has been completely sequenced and its proteins are 60 similar to human cmv proteins hansen et al 2003 rhesus cmv encodes an il-10-like protein that has immunosuppressive properties lockridge et al 2000 spencer et al 2002 reactivation of cmv with associated inflammation occurs in immunosuppressed humans and macaques most dramatically evident in human and simian aids nave macaques experimentally infected with rhesus cmv and siv show an augmented siv pathogenesis sequar et al 2002 rhesus cmv has a strong affinity for endothelial cells encoded by a viral cyclooxygenase-2 homologue carlson et al 2005 rue et al 2004 a macaque model of intrauterine rhesus cmv infection exhibits a range of developmental abnormalities similar to those observed in humans congenitally infected with cmv barry et al 2006 tarantal et al 1998 development of an effective cmv vaccine to prevent congenital infection is a high public health priority initial results indicate that a rhesus cmv dna vaccine targeting the glycoprotein b phosphoprotein pp65 and viral il-10 induces low levels of neutralizing antibody and decreases viral load after challenge yue et al 2007 further work in this macaque model requires improving the level of vaccine protection b virus an alphaherpesvirus that is now completely sequenced perelygina et al 2003 is the macaque counterpart of herpes simplex virus hsv in humans like hsv b virus produces a ubiquitous lifelong infection in macaques and is present in almost all colony-bred animals in enzootically infected populations by the time they reach sexual maturity jainkittivong and langlais 1998 reactivation of the virus is usually asymptomatic but may occasionally cause a cold sore gingivitis or even fatal systemic infection carlson et al 1997 interestingly coinfection of macaques with siv or simian type d retrovirus seldom causes activation of latent b virus despite the frequent activation of other latent herpesviruses eg cmv and epstein-barr virus among 35 herpesviruses identified in nonhuman primates b virus is the only one known to be pathogenic for humans about 40 cases of zoonotic b virus infection have been reported over about four decades with a high incidence of encephalitis and death ostrowski et al 1998 rapid treatment with antiviral medications prevents disease complications and new antiviral drugs are in development focher et al 2007 a vaccine that could prevent or limit b virus infection in macaques would lessen the occupational risk for individuals that handle these animals to that end an inactivated b virus vaccine was tested for immunogenicity in macaques in the 1960s hull 1971 and in the 1990s a vaccinia virus expressing glycoprotein d given to rabbits conferred good protection against b virus challenge infection bennett et al 1999 most recently the immunogenicity of a dna vaccine against b virus has been tested in mice and uninfected rhesus macaques loomis-huff et al 2001 a low level of b virus neutralizing antibodies was induced in the monkeys that were not challenged future vaccine combinations will include live vectors such as vaccinia virus aimed at eliciting cell-mediated immunity which is important for protecting against b virus this lymphotropic herpesvirus causes roseola infantum in humans to determine whether hhv-6 might accelerate progression to aids in hiv-infected people researchers coinfected pigtail macaques with hhv-6 and siv hhv-6 infection alone in this species was asymptomatic yalcin et al 1992 but in the presence of siv it appeared to accelerate aids progression lusso et al 2007 yalcin et al 1992 also in vitro infection of macaque t lymphocytes with hhv-6 increased the levels of siv replication lusso et al 1994 this macaque model may help in investigations of both viral and host factors that influence the interaction between hhv-6 and hiv in progression to aids based on serology a related but as yet unidentified herpesvirus may be present in squirrel monkeys and a few macaques higashi et al 1989 yellow fever virus was the first described human pathogen transmitted by an insect aedes aegypti mosquito in 1927 researchers found that rhesus macaques were susceptible to the experimental induction of classical yellow fever from filtered human blood and used this animal model to successfully apply kochs postulates to a virus infection for the first time in virology stokes et al 1928 2001 almost 100 years later the complete genome sequence of ae aegypti has just been reported nene et al 2007 the natural sources of yellow fever virus are monkeys originally from tropical west africa with the spread of infected humans and aedes mosquitoes the virus has adapted to the americas interestingly yellow fever virus has never been reported in asia despite the presence of ae aegypti mosquito control led to eradication of the virus in cuba and panama at the beginning of the 20th century the first yellow fever vaccine was made in 1939 from the brains of experimentally infected macaques graffe 1991 later an attenuated live vaccine 17d was prepared in chick embryos and its neurotropic and immunogenic properties were tested in macaques mason et al 1973 this 17d seed virus is the source of the current human vaccine which has proven to be stable safe and efficacious when given as a single dose however occasional cases of fatal hemorrhagic fever have recently been associated with the 17d vaccine vasconcelos et al 2001 therefore for quality control testing of the potential neurovirulence of this vaccine continues in rhesus monkeys marchevsky et al 2003 the 17d yellow fever vaccine strain also now provides the vector for recombinant chimeric vaccines against other flaviviruses such as the japanese encephalitis chikungunya west nile and dengue viruses all of these vaccines have relied on rhesus monkeys for proof of efficacy and for neurovirulence safety testing as discussed below epidemic dengue has become more common since the 1980s and is now second only to malaria as the most important mosquito-borne ae aegypti disease affecting humans the global distribution of dengue is expanding and is now comparable to that of malaria each year 50 to 100 million cases of dengue fever occur and about 500000 of them exhibit severe dengue hemorrhagic fever which has a case fatality rate of about 5 the dengue agent belongs to one of four virus serotypes of the genus flavivirus there is no cross protection between serotypes and epidemics can be caused by multiple serotypes hemorrhagic fever is associated with superinfection with a dengue virus serotype distinct from the serotype of primary infection possibly via the mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement of virus uptake and replication investigators have documented natural asymptomatic infections of macaques in southeast asia with dengue and other flaviviruses eg japanese encephalitis chikungunya and sindbis viruses suggesting possible sylvatic transmission cycles inoue et al 2003 peiris et al 1993 no licensed vaccine for dengue is available but there has recently been progress with several recombinant live attenuated dengue virus vaccines in macaques rhesus monkeys are quite susceptible to experimental infection with dengue virus and have provided an important animal model for pathogenesis treatment and vaccine development using dna microarrays pcr and multiplex cytokine detection researchers have shown transcriptional activation of innate antiviral immune responses but no upregulation of certain cytokine genes 5 days after infection with dengue virus type 1 sariol et al 2007 attempts to suppress dengue virus type 2 early viremia in rhesus monkeys with recombinant human alpha interferon showed a temporary suppression of viremia but no effect on total viral burden ajariyakhajorn et al 2005 a recombinant modified vaccinia virus expressing the envelope glycoprotein of dengue type 2 virus protected rhesus monkeys against homologous viral challenge men et al 2000 a recombinant modified live chimeric yellow feverdengue type 2 virus vaccine chimerivax protected rhesus monkeys against challenge with wild-type dengue type 2 virus guirakhoo et al 2004 protection correlated with the production of neutralizing antibody this vaccine is now in phase 1 clinical trials most recently tetravalent live attenuated dengue virus vaccines given to rhesus macaques provided complete protection against viremia from dengue type 2 challenge but only partial protection against the other three serotypes blaney et al 2005 sun et al 2006 interference among the four vaccine viruses will require further dose adjustments to identify an optimal formulation for humans the availability of infectious cdna clones of several flaviviruses has made possible the construction of other new live chimeric flavivirus vaccines bearing attenuating mutations in which the protective antigens of various highly virulent as well as attenuated flaviviruses may prove useful in immunizing against diverse flaviviruses of public health significance for example a yellow fever virus chimera expressing the envelope genes of japanese encephalitis virus another flavivirus protected macaques against homologous virus challenge see below and a live dengue virus chimera bearing the envelope glycoprotein gene of an avirulent tick-borne flavivirus langat virus protected rhesus monkeys against infection with highly virulent closely related tick-borne flaviviruses pletnev et al 2001 spread by mosquitoes a aegypti a albopictus chikungunya virus has caused significant outbreaks of disease with similarities to dengue in tanganyika northern india malaysia and recently in italy pialoux et al 2007 the name is derived from the makonde tanganyika word meaning that which bends up in reference to the stooped posture that develops as a result of the diseases arthritic symptoms macaques are susceptible to experimental infection and have therefore been used to study mosquito transmission of the virus paul and singh 1968 and the feasibility of developing inactivated nakao and hotta 1973 or attenuated turell and malinoski 1992 viral vaccines because of the rapid reemergence of chikungunya virus the relative lack of knowledge of mechanisms of pathogenesis and lack of effective vaccines and therapies macaques will be very valuable for addressing critical issues in the virus-host relationship and for developing interventions japanese encephalitis virus jev is one of the most important causes of viral encephalitis worldwide and is spreading throughout most of china southeast asia and the indian subcontinent that a filterable agent was responsible for fatal encephalitis was first shown in 1933 by experimental transmission of jev to macaques karlen 1995 this virus was later shown to be transmitted between wild and domestic birds and pigs by culex mosquitoes formalin-killed and attenuated live vaccines have been in use for many years and the killed vaccine was given during the second world war to protect american troops in asia rhesus macaques are highly susceptible to a lethal infection that resembles fatal human disease by intranasal inoculation with jev myint et al 1999 in recent years macaques have been used to test several recombinant flavivirus vaccines including jev and west nile virus dean et al 2005 monath et al 2000 raengsakulrach et al 1999 in another study investigators showed that bonnet macaques immunized with the jev vaccine were protected against west nile virus whereas the west nile virus immunization only reduced the severity of jev disease goverdhan et al 1992 this mosquito-borne tropical disease virus causes major morbidity and mortality in livestock and humans in sub-saharan africa rhesus macaques are quite susceptible to experimental infection and about 20 develop a severe hemorrhagic disease peters et al 1988 they have been used to show the beneficial effects of antiviral drugs and alpha interferon treatment in protection against viremia hemorrhage and liver damage soon after infection cosgriff et al 1989 morrill et al 1989 peters et al 1986 both formalin-killed and mutagen-attenuated vaccines showed partial protection against challenge infection and disease in rhesus monkeys morrill and peters 2003 this animal model is also suitable for developing both new methods of rapid diagnosis and therapies for the disseminated intravascular coagulation dic and hemorrhage that occur in the severe disease among the numerous arenaviruses only four are known to cause disease in humans of these infection with lcm virus lcmv and lassa virus has been modeled in macaques lcm virus acquired from rodents originated in the old world but is now worldwide in distribution about 5 of common house mice mus musculus carry lcmv asymptomatically and pet hamsters can become infected through contact with wild mice human infection may be asymptomatic or result in a mild febrile illness or acute meningitis especially with laboratory exposure to guinea pigpassaged lcmv congenital infection can cause hydrocephalus and fetal death person-to-person transmission has not been reported in contrast lassa virus is localized to west africa also acquired from rodents and capable of causing severe often fatal disease in a minority of infected humans lassa fever virus can spread between humans and is manifested by hepatitis diffuse hemorrhages and cns damage experimental infection of rhesus monkeys with lcm virus given intravenously results in uniformly fatal hemorrhagic fever with encephalopathy walker et al 1982 whereas virus given intragastrically induces a spectrum of clinical outcomes characteristic of lassa virus infection in humans lukashevich et al 2002 macaques infected by the intragastric route were protected from lethal disease when challenged later by the intravenous route this protection correlated best with strong cell-mediated immunity rodas et al 2004 in the last 5 years research has established the lcmv infection of macaques as a surrogate for lassa virus infection of humans djavani et al 2007 the transcriptome of macaques experimentally infected with lcm virus showed a weak inflammatory response upregulation of il-6 expression evidence of hepatocyte proliferation and blood changes indicative of major alterations in eicosanoid immune response and hormone response pathways lukashevich et al 2003 research in the early 1980s showed that rhesus monkeys were also susceptible to lethal infection with lassa virus and that ribavirin treatment and immune plasma were beneficial jahrling et al 1984 these studies showed that shock in the macaque model of lassa fever is due to biochemical dysfunction of platelets and endothelial cells which leads to leakage of plasma and hemorrhage fisher-hoch et al 1987 passive antibody therapy alone or combined with ribavirin was effective in cynomolgus macaques against infection with lassa virus jahrling and peters 1984 in 1989 it was reported that rhesus monkeys were protected from fatal lassa fever by vaccination with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the lassa virus glycoprotein fisher-hoch et al 1989 further work with macaques has confirmed the efficacy and safety of this vaccine and established suitability for evaluation in humans fisher-hoch et al 2000 researchers recently reported a new and very effective vaccine for prevention of experimental lassa fever in macaques by immunizing with vesicular stomatitis virus as a carrier for the genetic material of lassa virus geisbert et al 2005 naturally occurring leprosy has been documented in chimpanzees sooty mangabeys and wild-caught cynomolgus macaques valverde et al 1998 experimental infection of rhesus macaques with m leprae caused clinical leprosy in about 50 of them gormus et al 1998 wolf et al 1985 coinfection with siv increased susceptibility with impaired response to m leprae antigens probably because of a loss of cd4 t cells bcg vaccination protected rhesus monkeys from experimental leprosy gormus et al 2002 experimental attempts to transmit m leprae from sooty mangabeys to rhesus macaques in the early 1980s led to the inadvertent transmission of siv and the induction of saids murphey-corb et al 1986 buruli ulcer a so-called neglected tropical disease hotez et al 2007 is caused by mycobacterium ulcerans and presents as disfiguring skin ulcers together with tuberculosis and leprosy this mycobacterial disease has become a major health problem in over 30 countries particularly in central africa m ulcerans was first identified in the environment in the 1990s using pcr amplification methods on aquatic insects obtained from endemic areas of africa thus transmission may occur by biting water bugs of the insect order hemiptera johnson et al 2005 in southeastern australia a recent outbreak of buruli ulcer was probably transmitted by mosquitoes johnson et al 2007 no specific vaccine is available but cross-protective efficacy against m ulcerans experimental infection has been achieved in mice by vaccination with either bcg or plasmid dna encoding antigen 85 ag85a of m tuberculosis tanghe et al 2001 however the lack of an experimental animal model that replicates the spectrum of human disease features in particular the extensive ulceration prompted a study on the intradermal inoculation of a cynomolgus monkey with m ulcerans walsh et al 2007 the inoculation sites developed ulcers within 2 to 4 weeks with the size and rate of progression proportional to the number of organisms delivered the macaque may thus provide a valuable model for further vaccine development against m ulcerans louse-borne rickettsiae r prowazekii and r tsutsugamushi the causes of epidemic typhus and scrub typhus respectively have affected the course of human history because of epidemics in armies and other crowded populations with poor hygiene a live attenuated vaccine against r prowazekii has been developed but its use in humans is accompanied by a substantial incidence of side effects including a mild form of typhus cynomolgus macaques are susceptible to experimental epidemic typhus infection gonder et al 1980 and have served as a model for the development of a scrub typhus vaccine made from either the recombinant outer membrane protein chattopadhyay et al 2005 or its dna ni et al 2005 infected macaques develop an r tsutsugamushi antigen-specific cell-mediated immune response macmillan et al 1985 the vaccine made from the outer membrane protein of r tsutsugamushi induced humoral and cellular immune responses but was not as effective as an attenuated live vaccine in preventing infection in macaques however this vaccine was able to reduce inflammation at the site of inoculation chattopadhyay et al 2005 considering that the worldwide incidence of malaria is over 300 million clinical cases with 13 million deaths annually the need for protective measures including vaccines remains imperative increasing drug resistance among malarial parasites adds to the difficulty of malaria control of the four species of such parasites that infect humans p falciparum of avian origin causes most deaths in africa and p vivax of macaque origin accounts for more than 50 of infections outside africa and 10 of those in africa escalante et al 1995 2005 macaques are susceptible to experimental infection with the sporozoites of p falciparum and p vivax as well as those of about 10 related indigenous plasmodium species eg p cynomolgi p fragile p coatneyi kawai et al 2003 both natural and experimental infections can cause clinical malaria and various antimalarial drugs successfully eliminate the parasitemia puri and dutta 2005 wengelnik et al 2002 experimental studies of pathogenesis or vaccinology use p falciparum p vivax or the indigenous macaque plasmodium species in 2002 researchers published the complete genome sequence of anopheles gambiae the primary mosquito vector of malaria in africa gardner et al 2002 three general types of malarial vaccines are in research and development 1 those that target the circumsporozoite cs protein expressed on the extracellular sporozoite and the intracellular hepatic stage of the parasite to induce sterile immunity 2 those that target the blood-stage merozoites to reduce disease burden and 3 those that target zygote development in the mosquito host to block transmission most vaccine research has focused on blocking the initial infection using irradiated killed sporozoites cs surface proteins recombined with hepatitis b virus surface or core antigen adenovirus recombinants or naked dna in various combinations and protocols heppner et al 2005 walsh et al 2006 wu et al 2006 most experiments have used mice or humans but macaques have also been used for immunogenicity efficacy and safety testing as well as in vaccine tests aimed at recombinant surface proteins of the merozoite or zygote stages coban et al 2004 dutta et al 2005 each of these three vaccine approaches has shown a degree of efficacy in mice macaques and humans but not of a sufficient magnitude to support widespread clinical application recently the transcriptional profile of host gene expression in whole white blood cells was tested in a rhesus monkey model of human p vivax malaria the results indicate a downregulation of genes involved in rna processing during the initial liver stage of infection and an upregulation of defense response genes ylostalo et al 2005 the macaque model may yet direct research efforts toward better vaccines and novel targeted therapies several schistosomia species parasitic trematodes infect about 250 million people in tropical and subtropical countries although mortality is low schistosomiasis can be very debilitating in about 5 of infected individuals snails are the intermediate host for cercariae which infect mammals by penetrating the skin and migrating hematogenously to many organs where the worms and their eggs cause inflammation s mansoni primarily affects the liver interestingly s haematobium causes squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder in egypt macaques are susceptible to experimental infection with s mansoni maddison et al 1979 meisenhelder and thompson 1963 juvenile rhesus monkeys appear most susceptible to infection perhaps because of a reduced type 2 cytokine response fallon et al 2003 rhesus monkeys have proven very useful for understanding the immunology of schistosomiasis because they develop a solid immunity to reinfection vaccination with a surface antigen gave partial protection against challenge in cynomolgus monkeys smith and clegg 1985 in rhesus monkeys chronically infected with shiv clade c coinfection with s mansoni reactivated viral replication and increased the expression of th2-associated cytokine response ayash-rashkovsky et al 2007 chenine et al 2005 these findings suggest that parasite-infected humans may be more susceptible to hiv-1 infection chagas disease occurs primarily in rural areas of south america and interestingly is absent in the old world its pathogenic agent is a flagellate protozoan named t cruzi which is related to the agent of african sleeping sickness the protozoa are transmitted to humans by the bites of triatomids kissing bugs a large natural reservoir for the organisms includes other infected humans domestic animals and wild animals such as rodents and monkeys infection has been described in both free-ranging and captive macaques kasa et al 1977 olson et al 1986 pung et al 1998 charles darwin may have acquired this disease ie cardiomyopathy morris et al 1990 from the bite of what he called a great black bug of the pampas a reduvius vinchuca darwin 1839 the acute phase exhibits a skin nodule at the site of the bite usually on the head and local lymphadenopathy chronic disease affects the nervous system digestive system and heart and causes about 50000 deaths annually mostly from heart failure due to associated cardiomyopathy both acute and chronic chagas disease models have been established in rhesus bonecini-almeida mda et al 1990 carvalho et al 2003 the acute phase includes parasitemia circulating specific igm and igg antibodies and hematologic alterations chronic disease occurs 15 to 19 years after infection with severe cardiac damage scientists recently reported that siv-induced immunosupression reactivated a previously unnoticed chronic infection of chagas disease in a rhesus monkey kunz et al 2002 african sleeping sickness is a major concern in 36 african countries particularly in east and centralwest africa where it is caused by subspecies of the protozoan trypanosoma brucei tb gambiense and tb rhodesiense respectively the disease is uniformly fatal if untreated the eastern version is a zoonosis with cattle as the main reservoir humans are the major reservoir for the western version which is less virulent rhesus macaques infected with tb rhodesiense developed a glomerulonephritis that was associated with activation of the alternate complement pathway nagle et al 1974 and development of antibodies to nucleic acid lindsley et al 1974 stump-tailed macaques experimentally infected with tb rhodesiense showed neurologic signs raether and seidenath 1976 there is no vaccine but early treatment with a trypanocidal drug diamidine was effective in eliminating parasites from the blood ascariasis has a global prevalence of approximately 800 million and is considered a major neglected tropical disease hotez et al 2007 fatal baylisascaris larva migrans acquired from raccoon feces occurred spontaneously in a colony of japanese macaques sato et al 2005 stump-tailed macaques experimentally infected with the nematode ascaris suum have served as a model for allergic bronchitis in particular because of the release of histamine leukotrienes and prostaglandins from bronchoalveolar mast cells wells et al 1986 lymphatic filariasis causes massive lymphedema or elephantiasis in approximately 25 million people throughout the tropics hotez et al 2007 to investigate whether wolbachia symbiotic bacteria in filarial nematodes contributed to the disease progression researchers established a rhesus monkey model of filariasis and found that monkeys infected with the filarial brugia malayi developed antibodies specific for wolbachia surface protein as well as antifilarial antibodies associated with lymphedema development punkosdy et al 2001 these findings suggest that wolbachia may be critical to the pathogenesis of elephantiasis the draft genome of b malayi predicts about 11500 proteins whose analysis will provide insight into the molecular basis of the mutual relationship with wolbachia endosymbiont ghedin et al 2007 this information will serve as a basis for rational drug design against filariasis onchocerciasis or river blindness has been a major cause of blindness because of the associated chorioretinitis elicited by the onchocerca volvulus microfilariae lesions resembling those of the human disease were induced by the injection of live o volvulus microfilariae isolated from infected humans into the eyes of cynomolgus monkeys donnelly et al 1986 semba et al 1991 in recent years however river blindness has been nearly eliminated by treatment with the antihelminthic drug ivermectin thus negating the need for this animal model human papillomaviruses hpv are the cause of cervical cancer in humans and therefore the basis of a recently released vaccine against cervical cancer about 50 of rhesus macaques from several different primate facilities are infected with indigenous papillomaviruses ostrow et al 1995 pcr analysis of genital samples from female cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys also showed that they are natural hosts of genital papillomaviruses which are genetically related to and have a genetic diversity similar to that of the hpvs chan et al 1997 cervical and vaginal epithelial neoplasms associated with papillomavirus were present in 5 of captive female cynomolgus macaques wood et al 2004 four viral types were associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cin which resembles human cin transfer of cervical cells positive for one of these high-risk papillomavirus types which are closely related to the highly oncogenic hpv16 to uninfected monkeys resulted in new cervical infections and the development of abnormal cytology wood et al 2007 cin and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix resulted from sexual transmission of papillomavirus in a rhesus monkey ostrow et al 1990 the macaque papillomavirus model should prove valuable for further research into the pathogenesis therapy and prevention of cervical cancer after intrathecal inoculation with t pallidum rhesus macaques became infected but cleared the infection from the central nervous system cns as happens in most humans with early syphilis marra et al 1998 local production of gamma interferon appeared to contribute to this process following intradermal inoculation infected macaques developed primary and secondary syphilitic lesions and in the presence of siv coinfection exhibited a delayed clearance of t pallidum from the site of infection and an impaired humoral immune response to this agent marra et al 1992 chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the united states with almost 1 million cases reported annually to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the causative microbe chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium that passes from an infected mother to her baby in the birth canal and causes trachoma a disease characterized by conjunctivitis leading to blindness in about half of the infants chlamydia is called a silent disease because most infected women and men have no symptoms if untreated infection causes pelvic inflammatory disease which may lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy this agent also enhances the likelihood of infection with hiv now sequenced the genome contains over 1 million base pairs coding for 894 open reading frames including numerous potential virulence-associated proteins stephens et al 1998 macaques have served as useful models for each aspect of c trachomatis infection intraocular inoculation produces conjunctivitis and trachoma taylor et al 1981 which are now either completely preventable with an oral vaccine of attenuated or killed bacteria taylor et al 1987 or reduced in severity with a vaccine made from the major outer membrane protein campos et al 1995 vaccine protection appeared to correlate with induction of a cell-mediated immune response intrarectal or intratubal inoculation of macaques causes proctitis quinn et al 1986 or salpigitis patton 1985 respectively which have proven useful for understanding pathogenesis van voorhis et al 1997 and evaluation of systemic antibiotics eg azithromycin patton et al 2005 and topical microbicides patton et al 2006 researchers have found that antibodies to a 60kda c trachomatis heat shock protein peeling et al 1999 and two proteins including the heat shock protein 60 localized to the bacterial inclusion bodies bannantine and rockey 1999 are markers of persistent infection and a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction lichtenwalner et al 2004 west nile virus wnv spread by mosquitoes first appeared in the northeastern united states in 1998 and has gradually spread across the north american continent causing approximately 20000 reported human cases the virus also infects birds and horses often lethally as well as macaques cohen et al 2007 ratterree et al 2003 which have milder symptoms a live attenuated recombinant vaccine has been constructed from an infectious clone of yellow fever virus 17d in which the envelope genes of wnv replace those of 17d arroyo et al 2004 preclinical immunogenicity and efficacy tests in macaques showed that this vaccine induced strong wnv-specific neutralizing antibodies t cell responses and was efficacious and safe monath et al 2006 the vaccine chimerivax-wn02 is licensed for use in horses

al 2002 passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies from rhesus macaques immunized with the hps andes virus dna vaccine strongly protected highly susceptible hamsters against experimental infection with the andes virus hooper et al 2006 the dna vaccineinduced antibodies also neutralized viruses that cause both hfrs and hps custer et al 2003 the emergence of sars in 2002-2003 affected global health and caused major economic disruption macaques have been injected by various routes with the causative coronavirus sars-cov including an infectious molecular clone initial transmission of sars-cov to cynomolgus macaques helped to prove that this virus is the primary cause of sars kuiken et al 2003 a mild form of this disease was induced with minimal clinical symptoms rapid clearance of virus and resolution of the pneumonia however parameters of infection were sufficiently apparent that it was possible to show some benefit from therapy with sirna given either prophylactically or therapeutically li et al 2005a pegylated alpha interferon also had a beneficial effect against sars-cov infection in macaques haagmans et al 2004 an inactivated sars-cov vaccine zhou et al 2005 and

ehrlichiae rickettsial agents classified in the family ehrlichiacae are obligate intracellular bacteria that share the tick vectors of other infectious pathogens such as borrelia burgdorferi the agent of lyme disease rodents particularly white-footed mice and white-tailed deer are implicated as natural reservoirs for granulocytic ehrlichia human granulocytic ehrlichiosis was first described in 1994 and is now considered an emerging human infectious disease investigators have described a simian model in which rhesus macaques developed classical granulocytic ehrlichiosis after intravenous inoculation with horse blood infected with ehrlichia from a human fatality foley et al 1999 this animal model may be important for further study of the diagnosis management and intervention and pathogenesis of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis lyme disease borreliosis is a spirochete infection b burgdorferi transmitted by the bite of a deer tick an initial flu-like syndrome with rash and arthritis usually responds to treatment with antibiotics especially if given early in the course of the illness however some patients that receive antibiotics develop a poorly understood chronic syndrome that features musculoskeletal neurologic psychiatric and cardiac manifestations a multiantigenic vaccine pachner et al 1999 and an outer surface protein vaccine philipp et al 1997 protected macaques from lyme neuroborreliosis a vaccine lymerix against b burgdorferi became available for humans in 1988 but was taken off the market in 1992 because of safety concerns fear that it might be triggering an autoimmune reaction and poor sales to better understand the pathogenesis of the chronic lyme borreliosis syndrome investigators have inoculated normal and immunosuppressed rhesus macaques with the causative spirochete and observed the animals for several years different species of b burgdorferi induced different patterns of infection immunity and inflammation pachner et al 2004 the transcriptome of the spirochete in the central nervous system of macaques showed contrasting profiles depending on steroid treatment narasimhan et al 2003 researchers detected the spirochete along with accompanying inflammation months to years after inoculation in the meninges heart and connective tissue elsewhere in the body particularly in immunosuppressed monkeys bai et al 2004 cadavid et al 2004 2003 philipp et al 1993 roberts et al 1998 increased expression of b lymphocyte but not proinflammatory cytokines was detected in the muscle tissue of chronically infected rhesus monkeys pachner et al 2002 
bartonella species are arthropod vectortransmitted blood-borne intracellular bacteria that induce prolonged infection in the host several cell types in particular erythrocytes can harbor bartonella these agents are ubiquitous in nature with a substantial reservoir of persistent infection in domestic and wild animals which can serve as a source of inadvertent human infection breitschwerdt and kordick 2000 infections in animals and humans may be asymptomatic or associated with chronic inflammatory diseases bacteremia with this agent is widespread in domestic and feral cats chomel et al 1996 and zoonotic spread of b henselae causes cat scratch disease other human diseases caused by bartonella species are trench fever b quintana oroya fever b bacilliformis bacillary angiomatosis b quintana and bacterial endocarditis b henselae b quintana these species appear to be reemerging often with few symptoms as a persistent bacteremia in immunosuppressed and homeless individuals particularly those infected with hiv-1 foucault et al 2006 koehler et al 2003 there are reports of natural infection with b quintana in captive-bred cynomolgus macaques orourke et al 2005 and of its transmission to rhesus macaques mooser and weyer 1953 in a 1926 study b bacilliformis the agent of oroya fever was experimentally inoculated into young rhesus macaques in which it induced the same symptoms as observed in human cases of oroya fever noguchi and battistini 1926 a recently developed macaque model for b quintana infection has revealed a relationship between changes in the outer membrane protein and different virulence properties during bloodstream infection zhang et al 2004 melioidosis a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium burkholderia pseudomallei is an emerging disease with a serious impact on animals and humans in the past century this agent has spread from east asia to many previously unaffected parts of the world infection in humans and animals occurs by inoculation ingestion or inhalation of the organism which is ubiquitous in the environment particularly in soil many species of domestic farm and wild animals as well as nonhuman primates are commonly infected in horses the disease is called glanders a recent review summarizes the current studies of melioidosis outbreaks in animals including nonhuman primates sprague and neubauer 2004 in macaques disease may include severe bronchopneumonia multiple abscesses and osteomyelitis detection of b pseudomallei infection is a major challenge because of poor induction of antibodies according to one reference hubbert 1969 a cynomolgus macaque was experimentally infected but there has been no further research to develop the macaque model of this emerging pathogen although eradicated from the world in 1980 by vaccinia virus vaccination smallpox virus retrieved from frozen stocks poses a significant threat as an agent of bioterrorism therefore improved drugs and perhaps vaccines are urgently needed with this purpose in mind investigators recently exposed cynomolgus macaques to several strains of variola virus through aerosol and intravenous routes jahrling et al 2004 depending on the dose the viruses induced either uniformly fatal disease resembling human smallpox or less severe systemic disease with lower mortality high virus levels led to multisystem failure depletion of t cells and disseminated intravascular coagulation cdna microarrays of host gene expression in circulating white blood cells during infection showed upregulation of cytokines including il-6 and alpha interferon which contributed to a cytokine storm previously called toxemia rubins et al 2004 monkeypox virus mpxv causes a natural and experimental disease in cynomolgus macaques similar to human smallpox zaucha et al 2001 and so this animal model can help to increase the effectiveness of antiviral drugs and candidate novel smallpox vaccines sporadic outbreaks of monkeypox also occur in humans in africa and in the united states and thus are a public health concern the reservoir is squirrels and other small mammals and monkeys and humans are accidental hosts hutin et al 2001 sale et al 2006 in 2003 an outbreak of monkeypox in humans in the central united states was caused by contact with pet prairie dogs and other mammals that had been shipped from gabon to texas and then transported to pet distributors in the chicago area di giulio and eckburg 2004 vaccinia virus immunization smallpox vaccine and modified vaccinia virus ankara affords long-lasting protection of macaques against monkeypox virus challenge earl et al 2004 heraud et al 2006 stittelaar et al 2005 vaccine protection is correlated with the induction of neutralizing antibody against monkeypox virus edghill-smith et al 2005b but the smallpox vaccine does not protect macaques with saids against a lethal monkeypox challenge edghill-smith et al 2005a a smallpox dna vaccine consisting of four vaccinia virus genes and a modified vaccinia ankara dna vaccine also protected macaques against otherwise lethal challenge with monkeypox virus hooper et al 2004 nigam et al 2007 treatment of macaques with antiviral compounds such as cidofovir 24 hours after lethal intratracheal mpxv infection was more effective at reducing mortality than vaccinia virus vaccination stittelaar et al 2006 more than 40000 people worldwide mostly in developing countries die annually from rabies because of the expense of the current vaccines derived from cell cultures and problems with stability efforts are under way to develop a subunit or dna vaccine macaques immunized with the rabies ribonucleoprotein were protected against challenge infection from a lethal dose of rabies virus tollis et al 1991 cynomolgus macaques immunized with dna encoding the viral glycoprotein survived virus challenge whereas nonvaccinated controls developed fatal rabies lodmell et al 1998 protection with both vaccines correlated with the induction of neutralizing antibodies very early 6 hrs postexposure treatment with interferon or a potent interferon inducer also significantly reduced mortality baer et al 1977 weinmann et al 1979 early 6 days postexposure dna vaccination given together with human rabies immunoglobulin also reduced mortality marburg and ebola viruses cause epidemics of hemorrhagic fever and are among the most virulent viruses that infect humans the reservoir hosts in africa are not known although small mammals possibly rodents or bats are suspected wild nonhuman primates including macaques are like humans accidental hosts these viruses are usually transmitted to humans through contact with an infected animal a summary of marburg and ebola virus infections in laboratory nhps is available schou and hansen 2000 a total of 23 marburg and ebola virus outbreaks have been reported among humans and monkeys since the first documented outbreak in marburg germany in 1967 most of the 1100 human cases with 800 deaths occurred in africa after contact with infected patients in 1989 ebola virus and simian hemorrhagic fever virus were isolated from a cynomolgus macaque imported to the united states from the philippines human animal handlers became infected but did not get sick dalgard et al 1992 in recent years there have been several outbreaks of human and animal ebola in gabon and republic of congo the epidemics were associated with different viral strains and high mortality of gorillas chimpanzees and duikers and resulted from the handling of infected animal carcasses leroy et al 2004 rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are highly susceptible to lethal infection with either marburg or ebola virus geisbert et al 2003b ebola virusinfected monkeys have been studied to gain insight into the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to the profound lymphopenia disseminated intravascular coagulation and hemorrhagic and septic shock that are characteristic of filovirus infection of humans the coagulation abnormalities are most likely triggered by immune-mediated mechanisms rather than by direct damage to endothelial cells lymphopenia is attributed to infection of dendritic cells blocking their maturation and thus inhibiting activation of lymphocytes and triggering bystander apoptosis reed et al 2004 release of tissue factor from monocytemacrophages is a key event in triggering disseminated intravascular coagulation dic in ebola virusinfected macaques and treatment with recombinant inhibitor of tissue factor helps to prevent dic and prolong survival geisbert et al 2003a by contrast treatment with recombinant alpha interferon or immunoglobulin has little benefit neutralizing antibodies fail to protect or alter the course of ebola virus infection in the monkeys oswald et al 2007 live attenuated recombinant vaccines protected macaques almost 100 against the ebola and marburg viruses one of the vaccines was based on replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus vsv expressing the envelope glycoprotein of the marburg virus hevey et al 1998 the vaccine induced cross protection against two heterologous strains of marburg virus daddario-dicaprio et al 2006a and also gave strong protection against lethal marburg virus challenge if given within 30 minutes after virus inoculation daddario-dicaprio et al 2006b similar protection against both ebola and marburg virus was achieved using venezuelan equine encephalitis vee virus as a vector to express the glycoprotein and nucleoprotein of ebola virus geisbert et al 2002 a recombinant adenovirus carrying the ebola virus glycoprotein was also protective most remarkably macaques that received a combination dna vaccine for marburg virus ebola virus vee virus and b anthracis developed protective immunity against each agent riemenschneider et al 2003 a recent report describes the protection of macaques against ebola virus by topical immunization through the respiratory tract with a human parainfluenza virus type 3 vaccine vector used to express the ebola virus surface glycoprotein bukreyev et al 2007 aerosolized bacillus anthracis spores are considered the foremost infectious biological threat in the united states it is therefore important to prepare and stockpile an anthrax vaccine because macaques are quite susceptible to experimental b anthracis inhalation-induced disease they represent an excellent model for testing vaccines and drugs fritz et al 1995 vasconcelos et al 2003 studies 50 years ago showed that it was possible to protect rhesus macaques against inhalation challenge with b anthracis spores by a cell-free vaccine containing alum-precipitated b anthracis toxin-derived protective antigen pa wright et al 1954 this vaccine ava was used to immunize individuals at high risk of occupational exposure more recently investigators have evaluated vaccines composed of a recombinant form of the pa in rhesus macaques hepler et al 2006 phipps et al 2004 williamson et al 2005 they found that the animals were fully protected against a lethal dose of aerosolized bacteria and that protection correlated significantly with neutralizing antibodies which also conferred passive immunity to b anthracis challenge of nave macaques a dna vaccine for anthrax is also efficacious in macaques riemenschneider et al 2003 transcriptional profiles of about 200 genes in pa-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc after anthrax vaccine gave a response representative of innate and adaptive immunity rogers et al 2006 these studies predict that the pa-based vaccines should be efficacious in humans this animal model has also been used for testing antibodies against inhalation anthrax given either alone or together with the vaccine kao et al 2006 kelly et al 1992 
francisella tularensis is a zoonotic bacterium widespread in north america as well as parts of europe and asia squirrels and rabbits are the main reservoir and transmission to humans occurs by deerflies mosquitoes and ticks or from the bite of an infected vertebrate tularemia is serious and often fatal outbreaks of naturally acquired tularemia have also been described in nonhuman primates including macaques matz-rensing et al 2007 rhesus macaques exposed to aerosol particles of f tularensis develop the full-blown pneumonic form of tularemia which is often fatal schricker et al 1972 this macaque model was used 40 years ago to develop an efficacious live attenuated tularemia vaccine tulis et al 1970 long-lasting vaccine protection correlated with the presence of strong cell-mediated immunity against f tularensis spread by rat fleas this macrophage-tropic coccobacillus has been one of the great epidemic scourges of humanity but the disease has largely disappeared in modern times due mostly to improved rodent control however direct human-to-human aerosol spread of yersinia pestis presents a current bioterrorism threat and has prompted efforts to develop a plague vaccine a case of chronic pneumonic plague in a rhesus monkey has been reported ransom and krueger 1954 a live attenuated y pestis vaccine proved to be effective in macaques meyer et al 1974 recently vaccination of cynomolgus macaques with flagellin a toll-like receptor agonist and a fusion of the f1 and v antigens of y pestis induced a strong antigen-specific igg antibody response and was protective against lethal respiratory challenge with y pestis honko et al 2006 williamson et al 2007 immunization of cynomolgus macaques with recombinant y pestis f1 and v antigens made in plant vector systems provided complete protection against lethal challenge with y pestis mett et al 2007 
brucella a small non-spore-forming gram-negative coccobacillus is a highly infectious biological warfare threat agent that causes severe human illness this bacterium is a facultative intracellular parasite of macrophages after aerosol exposure rhesus macaques develop a disease similar to that of humans mense et al 2004 percy et al 1972 macaques immunized with a live attenuated strain of b melitensis after priming with purified antigen were solidly protected from aerosol challenge with virulent brucella chen and elberg 1976 protection correlated with induction of antibody to the bacterial outer membrane lipopolysaccharide and of a th1 cytokine response transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are infectious prion diseases that affect the central nervous system and cause dementia in the search for occult viruses researchers in the 1960s and 1970s inoculated many nonhuman primates with cns tissue preparations from humans that had unexplained neurodegenerative diseases these experiments involved many macaques and sooty mangabeys housed at the california national primate research center2 blind passages were carried out in an effort to amplify a putative human virus surprisingly several of the human diseasesfor example kuru restricted to new guinea and creutzfeldt-jakob disease cjd of worldwide distributionwere transmissible to chimpanzees gibbon apes and several species of new world monkeys and macaques espana et al 1975 gajdusek and gibbs 1971 gibbs and gajdusek 1973 masters et al 1976 each disease featured spongiform noninflammatory pathology in the brain and was similar in this respect to other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies that occur in sheep scrapie mink deer elk chronic wasting disease cwd and cattle bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse spontaneous spongiform encephalopathy has also been observed in a young adult rhesus monkey bons et al 1996 these diseases are caused by abnormally folded protein aggregates called prions other prion-associated spongiform encephalopathies that commonly occur in older humans such as alzheimers disease are not infectious in recent years cynomolgus macaques have been inoculated with or fed brain homogenates from people with variant cjd or from cattle with bse as investigators analyzed the involvement of peripheral organs with the prion proteins herzog et al 2005 the bse agent readily adapted to macaques and exhibited the same molecular characteristics as the variant cjd agent lasmezas et al 2001 large amounts of the prion protein were present in lymphoid organs and smaller amounts in the nervous system lymphoid organs and blood thus represent a high risk for iatrogenic transmission of the infectious prions one macaque developed variant cjd-like neurological disease 5 years after oral exposure to the bse agent lasmezas et al 2005 prion disease research owes much of its progress to macaques used in the search for unconventional viruses naturally occurring infection with several strains of stlv is highly prevalent in asymptomatic african and asian nonhuman primates including both wild macaques and those in primate centers and zoos hunsmann et al 1983 lowenstine et al 1986 miyoshi et al 1983 the natural history and biology of stlv are very similar to those of human tlv watanabe et al 1985 both stlv and htlv are ancient viruses and htlv apparently arose from contact with stlv-infected nonhuman primates in the distant past recent studies have documented human infection with multiple stlv-1-like viruses among central africans exposed to monkeys either as house pets or through the bush meat trade wolfe et al 2005 nearly 90 of bush meat was found infected with stlv courgnaud et al 2004 no evidence has been found for the cross-species spread of stlv to primate handlers in the united states stlv-infected macaques do not serve as a practical model for htlv infection because the latent period is long 4 to 5 decades and the tumor incidence is low 1 unlike htlv stlv has not been linked to lymphomas immunosuppresion or neurological diseases in macaques experimental coinfection of cynomolgus macaques with stlv and siv showed no influence of stlv on the development of saids fultz et al 1999 studies using cynomolgus macaques 20 years ago showed that protection against htlv challenge infection was possible through immunization with recombinant htlv-1 envelope protein nakamura et al 1987 cynomolgus macaques were also protected against stlv challenge by vaccination with htlv gag and envelope subunits dezzutti et al 1990 vaccine protection correlated with the induction of antibodies to the envelope glycoprotein interestingly stlv infection of captive baboons at two primate facilities the sukhumi primate center in the republic of abkhazia and the southwest regional primate research center in san antonio texas has been linked to a relatively high incidence of lymphoma mone et al 1992 voevodin et al 1996 the sukhumi outbreak of lymphomas has affected more than 300 baboons since 1967 and molecular studies indicate that the causative stlv strain was introduced into the baboons by cross-species transmission from rhesus macaques coinfection of these baboons with an ebv-related herpesvirus may be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of lymphoma schatzl et al 1993 this could be a suitable animal model for htlv-associated lymphomagenesis simian type d retrovirus is an indigenous retrovirus of macaques that can cause outbreaks of an immunosuppressive and fatal wasting disease in cohoused animals gardner et al 2004 the prototype virus mason-pfizer monkey virus mpmv was discovered in 1970 chopra and mason 1970 but it wasnt until the early 1980s that the virus reemerged in macaques at several primate centers gardner et al 1988 letvin and king 1984 the associated disease was at first called simian aids saids but this term is now confined to the siv-induced disease in macaques and an occasional african nhp species eg african green and sooty mangabey monkeys srv differs from siv both in its pathogenesis and in being more distantly related to hiv srv is not a lentivirus unlike siv and hiv srv causes a generalized infection of both t and b cells maul et al 1988 is genetically stable and can be controlled by neutralizing antibodies whether induced naturally or by vaccines kwang et al 1987 marx et al 1986 many of the same opportunistic pathogens associated with siv and hiv infection also exist in macaques with siv infection interestingly srv-infected macaques are the major source of a kaposis sarcoma kslike lesion called retroperitoneal fibromatosis rf see the section on kaposis sarcoma in contrast to siv srv infection is not associated with b cell lymphomas or activation of latent ebv-like virus although humans do not harbor a type d retrovirus and are not susceptible to productive infection with srv we include it because it is an important model for retrovirus-induced immunosuppression and rf additionally srv must be eliminated in nhps used for research particularly in studies of siv-induced saids sfvs members of the spumavirus group are ubiquitous in macaques and other nonhuman primates in which they cause a persistent latent infection in the absence of any disease linial 1999 weiss 1988 humans do not harbor any spumaviruses but they can become infected by contact with sfv carrier monkeys a putative human foamy virus isolate was probably of chimpanzee origin herchenroder et al 1994 humans eg animal health workers or african hunters accidentally infected with sfv remain asymptomatic brooks et al 2002 engel et al 2006 jones-engel et al 2005 macaques harbor a homologue of human ebv whose biology in macaques appears identical to that of ebv in humans moghaddam et al 1997 the complete sequencing of both human ebv and the macaque ebv-related virus shows strong similarities rivailler et al 2002 like human ebv the macaque virus generally causes a lifelong asymptomatic latent infection key aspects of human acute ebv infection are reproducible in the macaque model including oral transmission atypical lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy and activation of b cells all features of infectious mononucleosis cytotoxic t cell responses are mostly responsible for containing virus replication fogg et al 2006 as seen in humans with aids the macaque ebv-like virus is activated in association with opportunistic b cell lymphomas that occur in the course of siv-induced simian aids or with post-transplant immunosuppression habis et al 2000 schmidtko et al 2002 activated ebv in macaques also causes oral lesions called hairy cell leukoplakia that manifest in human aids kutok et al 2004 nave macaqueswhether immunocompetent or immunosuppressed inoculated with human ebv levine et al 1980 or the rhesus counterpart feichtinger et al 1992 moghaddam et al 1997 rivailler et al 2004do not develop lymphomas in the relatively short observation period of 3 years or less two distinct lineages of rhadinovirusrv-1 or retroperitoneal fibrosis rfassociated herpesvirus rfhv and rv-2 or rhesus rhadinovirus rrv a more distantly related virusare related to kaposis sarcoma ksassociated herpesvirus kshv human herpesvirus 8 the causative virus of ks in humans schultz et al 2000 rfhv yet to be isolated and fully characterized as a replication-competent virus in vitro is associated with a spontaneous disease in macaques called retroperitoneal fibromatosis rf described in the 1980s in pigtail macaques m nemestrina giddens et al 1985 rf closely resembles human ks in its histopathology except for the lack of skin manifestations rf tumor cells contain multiple rv-1 genome copies and the pattern of infectivity and latent antigen expression is similar to that of human ks bruce et al 2006 genomewide transcription patterns for rrv closely resemble the transcription profile for kshv in infected fibroblasts dittmer et al 2005 rrv is only infrequently detected by real-time pcr at low levels in peripheral blood of healthy macaques and more frequently in siv-infected animals however rrv is not detected in saids-associated lymphomas or lymphoid hyperplasia ruff et al 2003 experimental infection of macaques with rrv alone or together with siv has induced generalized lymphadenopathy in a few animals but as yet no rf lesions or lymphomas estep et al 2007 mansfield et al 1999 wong et al 1999 if an infectious isolate or molecular clone of rfhv can eventually be derived it will be interesting to determine whether this agent can induce rf in macaques because rrv replicates at very low levels and induces no specific pathology it is unlikely to provide a useful animal model for disease renne et al 2004 group a rotaviruses are ubiquitous and infect most humans by the 3rd year of life these viruses are the single most important cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide nonhuman primates including macaques are naturally infected with simian rotavirus strains several of which eg sa11 yk1 have been used for experimental infection of macaques soike et al 1980 westerman et al 2005 in the natural simian host diarrhea is usually not manifest and neonatal serum antibody of maternal origin is not associated with resistance to rotavirus infection or disease however intragastric challenge of newborn and infant cynomolgus macaques with the simian rotavirus strain sa11 does induce diarrhea petschow et al 1992 newborn macaques also are susceptible to experimental infection and diarrheal disease from human rotavirus isolates leong and awang 1990 majer et al 1978 wyatt et al 1976 baboons and vervet monkeys are similarly susceptible to experimental infection with human rotavirus but do not develop diarrhea chege et al 2005 in 1998 a tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine was licensed by the fda as a live attenuated human vaccine however it was withdrawn when the incidence of intussusception in vaccinated infants increased above control murphy et al 2001 several human rotavirus vaccines are currently undergoing human trials about half of the us outbreaks of acute infectious nonbacterial gastroenteritis are due to norwalk virus outbreaks occur in camps schools nursing homes and on cruise ships and are associated with contaminated water and uncooked food antibodies against the virus are not protective the human virus has not been cultured in vitro but a murine norovirus isolate replicates in cell culture and has been useful for studies of pathogenesis in mice mumphrey et al 2007 wobus et al 2006 although neonatal pigtail macaques m nemestrina and adult rhesus macaques are both susceptible to experimental infection with norwalk virus rockx et al 2005 subekti et al 2002 clinical gastroenteritis was not exhibited tick-borne encephalitis is a nontropical zoonotic disease of increasing incidence in asia and europe especially germany and austria where mass vaccination campaigns have been organized this virus causes more than 10000 cases of encephalitis annually rodents are the maintenance host and tbe has been transmitted to dogs and horses as well as humans tbe virus has been isolated from over 20 species of ticks but the main vectors are ixodes persulcatus and i ricinus experimental infection of macaques results in viral persistence and encephalitis frolova et al 1985 kenyon et al 1992 pogodina et al 1981 a naturally occurring case of tbe was reported in a macaque at a german monkey park suss et al 2007 using the rhesus monkey model of intranasal infection a commercial vaccine protected against a wild-type virus isolate and elicited an effective immune reaction without any evidence of immune enhancement hambleton et al 1983 this effective vaccine is now available for individuals at risk suss 2003 simian hemorrhagic fever virus first isolated in 1964 palmer et al 1968 and now classified in the arteriviridae family smith et al 1997 can cause an acute severe disease with high mortality in macaques allen et al 1968 although not infectious for humans the macaque disease could be a model for studying the pathogenesis of viral hemorrhagic fevers in humans human b-19 parvovirus is associated with several distinct clinical syndromes including severe anemia spontaneous abortion and arthritis macaques are commonly infected either naturally or experimentally with simian parvovirus spv which is closely related to human parvovirus b-19 brown and young 1997 brown et al 2004 osullivan et al 1994 experimental inoculation of spv in nave macaques induces temporary arrest of erythroid cell production analogous to that observed in b-19 infection of humans osullivan et al 1997 similarly mid-term spv inoculation in macaque fetuses leads to fetal hydrops pcr detection of parvovirus infection in monkeys has proven to be more sensitive and specific than serology gallinella et al 2003 although there is no proven human infection with spv it must be considered a potential zoonosis especially given the ability of the virus to replicate in human bone marrow cells in vitro and the high level of viremia that develops in infected macaques sv40 the prototype polyomavirus pv indigenous in macaques is analogous to the bk and jc pvs in humans in humans with aids and macaques with saids activation of jc or sv40 virus respectively causes demyelinating cns disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy genetic analysis of natural sv40 isolates from the brains and kidneys of several macaques revealed that the enhancer sequence organization is different from that of the laboratory strain of sv40 ilyinskii et al 1992 furthermore another pv related to but distinct from sv40 was recently recovered from a number of cynomolgus macaques that were immunosuppressed to promote acceptance of renal allografts or xenografts van gorder et al 1999 this virus called cpv caused interstitial nephritis in many of the grafted and native kidneys as well as a late-onset ureteritis with stenosis in the graft recipients cpv represents an excellent model for the bk polyomavirus-induced interstitial nephritis and ureteral stenosis that occur in human renal transplant recipients researchers have recently discovered novel pvs in some human patients with acute respiratory tract infection gaynor et al 2007 a cynomolgus macaque model has been developed for study of this human disease gonder et al 1979 macaques were susceptible to experimental aerosol infection with coxiella burnetii and developed the clinical signs and pulmonary pathology characteristic of q fever infection in humans waag et al 1999 a killed c burnetii vaccine provided only partial protection against infection and disease kishimoto et al 1981 more recently the comparative efficacy of chloroform-methanol residue and cellular c burnetii vaccines has been evaluated in this macaque model of q fever waag et al 2002 toxigenic strains of e coli eg o157h7 are important causes of human morbidity and mortality for over 30 years macaques have served as models to investigate the pathogenesis and treatment of experimental e coli infection including pyelonephritis roberts 1975 prostatitis neal et al 1990 bloody diarrhea kang et al 2001 and septic shock coalson et al 1979 immunization with shiga toxin liposome conjugates protected macaques against lethal doses of e coli shiga toxin suzaki et al 2002 several recent macaque models of experimental endotoxic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation have monitored inflammatory cytokines and the effect of glucocorticoid treatment ji et al 2004 natural toxigenic e coli infection has been described in siv-infected infant and adult rhesus macaques with diarrhea mansfield et al 2001 the rhesus e coli isolate was genetically very similar to human isolates of the epsilon intimin subtype this enteric bacterium is a close relative of the cholera bacillus vibrio cholera and a common agent of infectious diarrhea asymptomatic infection is common in humans and captive macaques diseased individuals may exhibit bloody diarrhea morton et al 1983 tribe and fleming 1983 campylobacter has also induced fetal death in a rhesus monkey baze and bernacky 2002 animals and contaminated food are sources of the bacteria rhesus and pigtail macaques are susceptible to experimental infection and colitis from a human strain of campylobacter fitzgeorge et al 1981 russell et al 1989 interestingly early efforts to infect rhesus monkeys with the related v cholera were unsuccessful ivanoff et al 1978 listeriosis caused by the bacterium listeria monocytogenes is an important pathogen for humans and animals and can cause natural outbreaks in nonhuman primates hygienic food processing and storage remain the best preventive measures for both humans and nonhuman primates most human cases occur in immunocompromised individuals or as congenital infection often leading to stillbirths various foodstuffs of vegetable or animal origin are the sources of infection cynomolgus macaques were used as a model for infection with l monocytogenes isolated from either humans or nhps and administered orally farber et al 1991 systemic infection was documented with the shedding of this bacterium in the feces for several weeks animals that received 109 bacteria suspended in sterile whole milk became ill with symptoms of septicemia anorexia and diarrhea given to pregnant macaques the organism infected the fetus and caused stillbirths smith et al 2003 a rhesus macaque model of aerosol infection with the legionella pneumophilia was established in 1983 baskerville et al 1983 lung pathology similar to that seen in l pneumophiliainfected humans was documented by light and electron microscopy guinea pigs and marmosets are equally susceptible to infection and pneumonia so the macaque model has not been further developed severe acute shigella dysentery is among the most miserable of human diseases there is no animal reservoir but epidemics occur in locales that lack effective sanitation shigella outbreaks also occur in captive macaque colonies where special eradication programs may be necessary for control banish et al 1993 line et al 1992 mulder 1971 this agent is an important occupational zoonosis kennedy et al 1993 researchers in the 1970s experimentally infected rhesus macaques with s flexneri to investigate pathogenesis kinsey et al 1976 rout et al 1975 mucosal invasion of the colon was essential to the development of the fluid and electrolyte transport defect that led to the dysentery in addition jejunal transport abnormalities contributed to the diarrhea arthritis and amyloidosis in siv-infected rhesus macaques have been associated with s flexneri breakdown products in the intestine blanchard et al 1986 chapman and crowell 1977 urvater et al 2000 this development may be analogous to the arthritis increasingly seen in hiv patients who are free of other risk factors for arthritis 
streptococcus pneumoniae also known as pneumococcus diplococcus has long been responsible for high rates of pneumonia meningitis and otitis media worldwide particularly in young children and older adults over 30 years ago rhesus macaques were exposed to aerosols of influenza virus and s pneumonia the bacteria were cleared from the lower respiratory tissues but persisted in the upper respiratory tract berendt et al 1974 rhesus monkeys also served as a model for disseminated intravascular coagulation after experimental bloodstream infection hawley et al 1977 in 1995 a fatal case of s pneumonia meningitis was reported in a 3-month-old lion-tailed macaque m silenes at the baltimore zoo graczyk et al 1995 since the early 1990s several pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines have demonstrated effectiveness against infection in older children and adults and subsequent immunogenicity studies in rhesus macaques led to the development of newer polysaccharide vaccines now available for children from 2 to 15 months of age mcneely et al 1998 however adaptation of the adult vaccine is necessary to provide stronger and longer-lasting protection and higher efficacy in immunocompromised populations to help answer this need attempts are under way to develop a rhesus macaque model for pneumococcal vaccine assessment philipp et al 2006 group a streptococcal pharyngitis and resultant rheumatic heart disease are still highly prevalent in developing countries to better understand the pathogenesis of the acute pharyngitis and aid in the development of an effective streptococcal vaccine cynomolgus macaques were experimentally infected with group a streptococcus virtaneva et al 2005 acute and asymptomatic phases of disease were identified and bacterial colonization and severe throat inflammation correlated with superantigens and prophage virulence gene expression temporal changes in the transcriptomes were linked to the phase of clinical disease and host defense response chronic enterocolitis is a leading cause of morbidity in captive macaques a recent survey of fecal specimens from 100 immunocompetent rhesus macaques with or without chronic diarrhea revealed a multitude of potential enteric bacterial protozoan and parasitic pathogens sestak et al 2003 organisms associated with chronic diarrhea included campylobacter shigella yersinia adenovirus and strongyloides other enteric pathogens whether or not diarrhea was present included e coli carrying the shiga toxin virulence gene balantidium coli giardia lamblia enterocytozoon microsporidia and trichuris trichiura whipworm microsporidia could be experimentally transmitted to siv-infected rhesus monkeys green et al 2004 chronic diarrhea was associated with upregulation of certain cytokines eg il-1 il-3 tnf tumor necrosis factor-alpha and t lymphocytes cd4 cd69 in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue this roundworm causes trichinosis a common disease throughout the world that results from eating improperly cooked pork containing viable cysts of t spiralis in humans the parasite larvae localize principally in skeletal muscles and evoke generalized myalgia rhesus monkeys experimentally infected 30 years ago with t spiralis larvae developed trichinosis that showed clinical pathological and morphological similarities to the human disease cypess et al 1977 natural infection with toxoplasma gondii has been noted in several species of asian macaques most recently in toque macaques m sinica from sri lanka ekanayake et al 2004 infection is closely linked to human environments where domestic cats are common in a study of congenital t gondii infection researchers infected pregnant rhesus and stump-tailed macaques m arctoides with these protozoa wong et al 1979 no significant neonatal disease occurred despite cns infection antiviral treatment with a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine was effective in eliminating the parasite in both the amniotic fluid and the neonate whereas the parasite was detected in most of the untreated fetuses various degrees of periodontal disease from mild gingivitis to necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis noma associated with dental calculi are present in macaques and other nhps adams and bishop 1980 cohen and goldman 1960 schiodt et al 1988 noma is particularly associated with srv type d retrovirusinduced immunosuppression experimental periodontitis can be induced in macaques by placement of periodontal silk ligatures or orthodontic elastic as well as by surgical removal of alveolar bone schou et al 1993 the clinical pathological microbiological and immunological characteristics of spontaneous and experimental periodontitis in macaques are similar to those of humans macaques manifest a subgingival flora resembling that found in humans including members of actinobacillus porphyromonas bacteroides campylobacter and fusobacterium in cynomolgus macaques antibody titers and relative levels of p gingivalis were inversely correlated suggesting that a humoral immune response may be efficacious in reducing overgrowth with this bacterium persson et al 1994 thus the macaque model is highly suitable for developing vaccines against periodontitis this survey illustrates the versatility of the macaque as an animal model for translational human infectious disease research additionally natural infections of macaques with agents related to human pathogens extend the value of these animals a further major benefit of this research is the alleviation of infectious disease for macaques as well as other primate species comparative studies in both human and macaque hosts are needed to address continuing problems caused by many infectious diseases that remain intractable factors such as increased travel population growth and changing ecology are giving rise to new and emerging infectious diseases recent advances in genomic proteomic metabolomic and related technologies make macaque models all the more timely for studies aimed at improving the treatment and control of infectious diseases in humans and macaques alikeone medicine in action  foreward molecular epidemiology of viral infection in asia hiroshi ushijima yuki eshita   dengue virus belongs to flaviviridae and is transmitted in a cycle involving humans and aedes mosquitoes in forest areas a cycle including primates and mosquitoes also exist
6
 to date two manifestations dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are known
4
 
7
 the symptoms are same among the four serotypes once immunity is developed in a human it remains lifelong and reinfection with the same serotype does not occur however other serotypes may then cause disease because of the incomplete protection of the first infection more than tens of millions of people have dengue fever and more than hundreds of thousands of people are reported to have dengue hemorrhagic fever every year dengue virus is approximately 11 kb positive single stranded rna virus it consists of structural proteins of core membrane and envelope and seven nonstructural proteins envelope protein is the target of neutralizing antibody and hemagglutinin inhibition antibody serotypes of dengue virus 1 2 3 and 4 are originally classified using antiserum but recently they have also been classified with envelope gene analyzes the similarity of envelope gene is more than 90 at the same serotype and 65 at a different serotype moreover dengue virus serotype 1 2 3 and 4 are divided into three six four and one genotypes respectively
8
 there are common and different genotypes in serotypes 13 in asia africa pacific islands and caribbean islands some genotypes appear in specific areas during a limited period each year variation of envelope gene affects the virulence of these viruses and other structural and nonstructural proteins might also affect the virulence
7
 host immune response also affects the virulence of these viruses at present there is no clear explanation for the dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever japanese encephalitis virus belongs to flaviviridae and is the prototype of japanese encephalitis antigenic complex
4
 
9
 humans are infected through the virusinfected culex mosquito bites one of 3001000 infected persons can develop encephalitis nearly 20 of encephalitis cases die and approximately 50 recover with sequel approximately 50 000 encephalitis cases and 10 000 death cases are annually recorded life cycle of culexpigbirdculexhuman is well known but there is no evidence of human to human transmission pigs and birds are effective viral amplification hosts serving as natural hosts for infection the gene of japanese encephalitis virus is approximately 11 kb positive singlestranded rna the composition of structural and nonstructural proteins are the same as in dengue virus the serotype is one but between four and six genotypes exists in the envelope gene geographic variation has also been reported
10
 
11
 although the induction of mutation in envelope gene affect the difference in neurovirulence other structural and nonstructural genes also affect neurovirulence phylogenetic tree of nucleic acids are mainly envelope gene antigen of antigenantibody reaction is also an envelope antigen yellow fever virus belongs to flavivirus

4
 
8
 hemorrhagic fever type has a high mortality rate aedes mosquitoes act as vectors in africa and haemagogus mosquitoes are vectors in south america humans are natural hosts in africa and the virus is maintained through the cycle of aedeshumanaedes transmission in contrast monkeys are natural hosts in south america and the virus is maintained through the cycle of haemagogusmonkeyhaemagogus humans are mainly infected in forest areas by mosquito bites the virus spread to the united states with the transportation of africans to the united states
1
 at present yellow fever is not prevalent in asia its structural and nonstructural compositions are same as dengue virus two genotypes are found from envelope gene analysis group i was isolated in east and central africa group iia in west africa and group iib in america
12
 
13
 although the envelope gene makes the differences of infectivity and pathogenicity other structure and nonstructure genes also affect infectivity and pathogenicity envelope gene and proteins are used for diagnosis and molecular epidemiology
8
 the virus survives through the cycle of bird and culex mosquito usually there are no symptoms in humans however this virus can cause encephalitis especially in the elderly the virus can also cause death in humans although this is rare and deaths are more common in birds and horses west nile virus has been found mainly in africa and often in the middle east south europe and west asia however it was reported in the united states in 1999
14
 at the time of writing there are no reports of west nile fever disease in asia except india considering the spread of west nile virus in the united states outbreaks in asian countries are highly likely to occur in the near future the virus has been detected in culex mosquito birds and animals in urban areas in the united states viremia is found in the early stages of the infection and the virus is transmitted through the placenta and blood transfusion also two genotypes are known genotype i is found in europe and the united states and genotype i and ii are found in africa
15
 genotype i viruses can be further subdivided based on the origins of the viruses european and the united states australia and india kunjin virus is common in australia table 1
16
 st louis encephalitis virus is common in the united states and belongs to genus japanese encephalitis virus

4
 the virus is carried through the cycle of bird and culex mosquito human and cattle are often infected rabies virus belongs to rabdoviridae and is approximately 12 kb negative single stranded rna virus the virus causes zoonosis among human animals and birds
19
 the virus in the salivary glands of animals invades from the bitten site other routes such as corneal transplant eye injury and respiratory infection have also been reported
20
 the virus infects muscle cells and moves to peripheral nerves and eventually moves and grows in central nervous cell it is fatal when it infects the brain in japan rabies infections were first reported in humans in 1954 and in animals in 1856
21
 wild foxes wolves skunks raccoons and bats are natural hosts in forest type rabies and it has spread worldwide with the exception of a few countries including japan dogs are a common cause of the spread of urban type rabies in asia africa and middlesouth america pre or postexposure prophylactic vaccinations are useful for the prevention of virus invasion to the central nervous system the virus consists of nucleoprotein n protein nonstructure protein ns protein membrane protein m protein glycoprotein g protein and large protein l protein g protein is closely related to infection neurotoxin and is a target for infection control recombinant vaccine has been developed using the g gene negri body in neuronal cells is found in the hippocampus of infected animals the negri body is composed of virus nucleoprotein the nucleoprotein gene is conserved well and isuseful for molecular epidemiological analyses of the infected area genotype 1 serotype 1 of classical rabies in asia europe africa and the united states develop in separate clusters the cluster is also differentiated within asia sequence also has further small variations in the philippines between luzon island and mindanao island
22
 rabies virus was previously thought to have only one serotype but a new type which shows the symptom of classical rabies has been found in bats one example is australian bat virus of genotype 7 and a case of human death involving this genotype has been reported

 hantavirus belongs to genus hanta of bunyaviridae it is divided into two groups the first group includes the virus which spreads in eurasian continent and causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome the other group is widespread in south and north america and causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome there are 24 species serotypesgenotypes four species cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and six species cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
23
 the virus is secreted through urine stool and saliva from rodents humans who aspirate or contact the virus can have the disease in infected rodents infection persists without symptoms hantavirus causes zoonosis except for one species bunyavirus consists of three negative stranded rna l m and s each segment codes l protein polymerase envelope protein g1 and g2 and nucleoprotein np the molecular epidemiological analysis is mainly done in nucleotides of m gene three different clusters were discovered 1 hantaan virus dodrava virus seoul virus and thailand virus from murinae rodents 2 puumala virus from arvicolinae rodents which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and 3 sin nombre virus new york virus bayou virus black creek canal virus andes virus lagna negra virus from sigmodontinae rodents which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
24
 
25
 nipah virus is a negative single stranded rna virus and belongs to paramyxoviridae an outbreak of nipah virus was recorded in 19981999 in malaysia
26
 this virus was transmitted from pig to humans and it caused encephalitis in approximately 40 of infected persons pigs were infected from the urine of fruit bats living in the forest of nipah pig to pig and pig to human transmission occurs through saliva and urine human to human transmission is rarely recognized respiratory syndrome is common in pigs but convulsions abnormal movement and miscarriage are also recognized the mortality rate for this virus is low the virus infects dogs cats and horses with the rise of the antibody level the virus reached singapore via pigs imported from malaysia more than 10 humans were infected and one person died hendra virus is similar to nipah virus and was discovered in horses and spread in australia in 1994
27
 it was transmitted to humans and caused respiratory symptoms currently classification of nipah virus and megapneumovirus is recommended as belonging to the genus henipavirus because the molecular size of these viruses are approximately 18 kb and different from other viruses of paramyxoviridae 1516 kb
27
 
28
 
29
 a new virus metapneumovirus was discovered in 2001 in a child with respiratory symptoms
30
 the same group had been recognized in animals and this was the first report in humans this virus was included in mononegavirus negative single strand rna virus the virus belongs to genus metapneumovirus subfamily pneumovirinae in family paramyxoviridae but does not belong to genus pneumovirs which includes respiratory syncytium virus
30
 the virus has characters of paramyxoviridae that is glycoprotein and fusion protein however there are no characteristics of hemagglutinin and pneuraminidase respiratory syncytium virus has been known to have one serotype genotype but recently it was divided into subgenus suserotype a and b
31
 there are differences within one subtype across geographic locations and time more detailed analysis is required for the complete understanding of metapneumovirus almost all children aged 5 years old have antibodies against metapneumovirus
30
 
32
 this was found in countries worldwide including japan
33
 coronavirus is approximately 2731 kb plus single stranded rna virus there are genus coronavirivirus and torovirus human coronavirus was cultured in human tracheal cells in 1965 coronavirus was discovered in vertebrates and birds membrane protein envelope protein spike and glycoprotein with hemagglutinin and esterase function and nucleoprotein have been observed coronavirus causes mainly respiratory infection however it can also cause gastrointestinal infection and rarely neuronal infection outbreaks of gastroenteritis have also been reported molecular epidemiological studies understanding of variation of serotype and reinfection are not well established for this virus human coronavirus spreads mostly in children in winter infection routes are droplet andor airborne infection and fecusoral infection human coronavirus 229e and oc43 strains were known long before the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus outbreak in china
34
 
35
 severe acute respiratory syndrome first occurred in kuangtung in guangdong province in china threehundredandfive people had respiratory disease and five persons died at that time following that a sars outbreak occurred in hotels hospitals and condominiums in hong kong in march 2003 finally it spread to 29 countries including vietnam taiwan singapore and canada and was spread mainly via travellers the disease spread in hospitals where health workers and relatives of sars patients were in close with patients fortunately sars disappeared in june 2003 more than 8000 people were infected and more than 800 people died of sars in the 2003 outbreak considering the course of this disease the disease started from the breeder of palm civet in guangdong province and it is a zoonosis the transmission route is usually droplet andor air infection however fecusoral infection and contact infection also occur effective management of a new respiratory infection is not easy research on diagnosis treatment and prophylaxis are under way in order to counter the reappearance of sars in the winter of 2004
36
 there are four serotypes in coronaviridae and they are described in table 1 there is some variation in the sars coronavirus although the variation is minor and at this time there is no need for subtyping

 changes in viral gene and host defense mechanisms are important factors in the spread of infection changes in habit and environment also affect the spread of infection molecular approach nowadays gives us quick and detailed analysis in this paper we have briefly described the following viruses at the molecular level flaviviruses dengue virus japanese encephalitis virus yellow fever virus west nile virus zoonotic viruses rabies virus hantavirus and new viruses nipah virus metapneumovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  recent advances in hantavirus molecular biology and disease islam hussein tm abdul haseeb absarul haque mohammad mir a   two major outbreaks that occurred in the past led to the discovery of hantaviruses and directed the attention of researchers toward the hantavirus-associated diseases the first outbreak occurred during the korean war 19501953 with more than 3000 cases of illness reported among the united nations troops the disease was initially named korean hemorrhagic fever and is now commonly referred to as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs the second outbreak which occurred in the four corners region of the united states in 1993 triggered the attention of the world health organization toward a new highly lethal disease the disease was initially referred to as four-corner disease and is now called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hcps hantaviruses cause serious human illness with a mortality rate that ranges from 15 for hfrs to 50 for hcps twenty-five years after the korean war the etiologic agent of this disease the hantaan virus htnv was identified in the striped field mouse apodemus agrarius lee et al 1981a further studies revealed that the newly identified virus belonged to the bunyaviridae family in 1981 a new genus termed as hantavirus was introduced into the bunyaviridae family which included the viruses that cause hfrs fig 21
 further investigations revealed that unlike other members of the bunyaviridae family hantaviruses did not have an arthropod vector and exclusively establish a persistent infection in the population of their specific rodent hosts the landmark discovery of htnv encouraged more efforts to identify the etiologic agents of hfrs-related disease in asia europe and the united states these efforts led to the discovery of haantan-like viruses in other rodents from far east russia china and south korea dobrava virus dobv a distinct hantavirus was isolated from apodemus flavicollis a agrarius and apodemus ponticus in europe avsic-zupanc et al 1995 avsic-zupanc et al 2000 golovljova et al 2000 jakab et al 2007 klempa et al 2005 klempa et al 2008 klingstrom et al 2006a in 1980s a rat-born seoul virus seov was found to cause hfrs in urban areas of asia chan et al 1987 kim et al 1995 around the same time period puumala virus puuv the etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica a milder form of hfrs reported in 1930s in europe was identified in bank voles myodes glareolus clement et al 2003 despite these early efforts the lack of advanced technology delayed the identification of etiologic agents of hfrs however the etiologic agent and rodent reservoir of hcps the sin nombre virus snv were discovered within few weeks after the 1993s outbreak in the four corners region of the united states hjelle et al 1994 nichol et al 1993 after this outbreak other hantavirus strains causing hcps were discovered and more than 2000 cases of hcps have been reported throughout the americas aquino et al 2003 barclay and rubinstein 1997 bayard et al 2004 bohlman et al 2002 chu et al 2006 fulhorst et al 1997 hjelle et al 1994 hjelle et al 1996 jiang et al 1997 johnson et al 1997 jones et al 2008 nichol et al 1993 vincent et al 2000 currently the hantavirus genus includes more than 21 species and more than 30 genotypes avsic-zupanc et al 2000 chu et al 2006 although many more remain undiscovered due to the lack of advanced technology in other parts of the world including africa middle east and the indian subcontinent for example recent discoveries of shrew-born hantavirus in several countries support the existence of other hantavirus species worldwide arai et al 2007 kang et al 2009a annually 150000200000 cases of hantavirus infection are reported worldwide due to high emergence and significant mortality of hantavirus infections a serious attention from research scientists and world health organizations is required to promote public awareness and accelerate efforts for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases here we summarize the findings about the microbiology of hantaviruses with an emphasis on nucleocapsid protein glycoproteins gn gc and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp a brief synopsis about different aspects of hantavirus-associated disease is also presented in this chapter hantavirus particles generally appear spherical or pleomorphic in electron micrographs fig 22
 they range in diameter from 80 to 120 nm goldsmith et al 1995 martin et al 1985 hantaviruses have tripartite single-stranded negative-sense rna genome that encodes an rdrp large or l segment two glycoproteins medium or m segment and a nucleocapsid protein n small or s segment the negative-sense genomes serve as templates for producing positive-sense complementary rna crna and messenger rna mrna the total size of the rna genomes ranges from 11845 nucleotides for htnv to 12317 nucleotides for snv hooper and schmaljohn 2001 jonsson et al 2010 schmaljohn et al 1985 schmaljohn et al 1986 the viral rna segments are coated with the nucleocapsid protein forming three helical ribonucleoprotein rnp complexes fig 22 the viral rdrp is associated with these nucleocapsids dahlberg et al 1977 obijeski et al 1976 the sequences at both the 3 and 5termini of each rna segment are complementary forming panhandle structures that are specifically recognized by the n protein and were shown to be important for viral transcription and replication viral mrnas contain untranslated regions utrs at both their 5 and 3ends that flank the open reading frame orf of the encoded viral protein the 5utr of viral mrna contains trinucleotide repeats uaguaguag which were suggested to be involved in n-mediated translation initiation of viral mrna similarly a triplet repeat at the 3utr of vrna has been proposed to play a role in the prime and realign mechanism of transcription initiation by the viral rdrp hewlett et al 1977 mir and panganiban 2004 mir and panganiban 2005 mir and panganiban 2010 pettersson and von bonsdorff 1975 raju and kolakofsky 1989 hantaviruses are enveloped with an outer lipid bilayer derived from the golgi membranes fig 22 the envelope carries two viral-encoded glycoproteins gn and gc in the form of heterodimers which assemble into higher order oligomers and appear as projections or spikes on the outer surface of the virion hepojoki et al 2010a huiskonen et al 2009 huiskonen et al 2010 overby et al 2008 the virion consists of  50 protein 2030 lipid 7 carbohydrate and 2 rna mccaughey and hart 2000 obijeski and murphy 1977 hantaviruses can be easily inactivated by treatment with lipid solvents or nonionic detergents which destroy the viral envelope schmaljohn and nichol 2007 hantaviruses infect multiple cell lines including endothelial epithelial macrophages dendritic and lymphocytes the replication cycle begins with the attachment of virus particles to host cell surface receptors goldsmith et al 1995 mackow and gavrilovskaya 2001 markotic et al 2007 raftery et al 2002 spiropoulou 2001 several studies suggest that the attachment is mediated by the interaction of viral gn protein with integrin receptors on the surface of host cells fig 23
 the 1 and 3 integrins are considered to be the receptors for apathogenic and pathogenic hantaviruses respectively gavrilovskaya et al 1998 mir and panganiban 2010 larson et al 2005 however it has been reported that hantaviruses can infect cells lacking integrin receptors suggesting that integrins may not be the only receptors that hantaviruses employ to attach to host cells mou et al 2006 after attachment cell entry is mediated via clatherin-coated pits and virions are ultimately delivered to lysosomes fig 23 within the endolysosomal compartment virions are uncoated and three viral capsids are released into the cytoplasm jin et al 2002 viral rdrp initiates transcription and generates three mrnas one from each viral rna segment s m and l the translation of s and l segment-derived mrnas occurs on free ribosomes while m segment-derived mrnas are translated on the rough endoplasmic reticulum er the glycoprotein precursor is intrinsically cleaved at a highly conserved amino acid motif waasa generating two glycoproteins gn and gc respectively lober et al 2001 ruusala et al 1992 spiropoulou 2001 after glycosylation in the er both gn and gc are transported to the golgi complex laying the foundations for final destinations where virions are maturated antic et al 1992a plyusnin et al 1997 ravkov et al 1998 ruusala et al 1992 after initial rounds of transcription viral rdrp switches to the replication mode and generates three viral genomic rnas which are encapsidated by the viral n protein to form three nucleocapsids mature viral nucleocapsids are transported to specific destinations on the golgi membrane that are studded with the gn and gc proteins however the molecular mechanisms governing the specific recognition and encapsidation of viral genome by n transport of capsids to golgi and budding of nascent virions into and out of golgi complex are still unknown mechanisms of incorporation of viral rdrp into virus particles are fascinating and need more attention there are reports suggesting that the assembly and maturation of new world hantaviruses take place on the plasma membrane ravkov and compans 2001 the evidence supporting this pathway for assembly and maturation is based on observations that snv and black creek canal virus bccv particles were not observed in infected cells however localization of n protein from both old and new word hantaviruses on golgi apparatus favors the possibility of their maturation on golgi ramanathan and jonsson 2008 ramanathan et al 2007 ravkov and compans 2001 spiropoulou et al 2003 several studies showed that n binds specifically to a region near the 5terminus of vrna which is indicative of its function during encapsidation gott et al 1993 jonsson et al 2001 mir and panganiban 2005 osborne and elliott 2000 severson et al 1999 it was also reported that n differentially interacts with minus-sense vrna plus-sense crna and mrna cell culture-based experiments have demonstrated that encapsidation requires full-length vrna or crna molecules since no mrna molecules were detected in viral nucleocapsids jin and elliott 1993 moreover snv n protein was shown to play the role of rna chaperone that facilitates transient dissociation of misfolded rna structures and creates opportunities for the folding of rna into biologically functional and thermodynamically stable higher order structures mir and panganiban 2005 a three-dimensional 3d structural model of n protein is still lacking however the functionally important regions have been identified in several mutagenesis studies the rna-binding domain of n protein was mapped to the central conserved region that extends from amino acid 175 to 217 li et al 2002 in addition the lysine residues dispersed between positions 175 and 429 and three more residues including e192 y206 and s217 located in the rna-binding domain were also shown to be important for rna binding severson et al 2005 hantavirus n protein undergoes proteinprotein interaction and forms stable trimers both in vivo and in vitro it has been shown that trimeric n recognizes the vrna panhandle with specificity and high affinity mir et al 2006 n-panhandle interaction has been proposed to mediate the selective encapsidation and packaging of vrna genome during virus assembly alfadhli et al 2001 alfadhli et al 2002 kaukinen et al 2001 kaukinen et al 2003 kaukinen et al 2004 mir and panganiban 2004 using the multicoil prediction algorithm wolf et al 1997 coiled-coils spanning amino acid residues 134 and 3880 have been predicted for the n protein of several hantaviruses including htnv seov snv prospect hill virus phv and tula virus tulv alfadhli et al 2001 both n- and c-terminal regions have been implicated in mediating the homotypic interaction between n molecules and putative coiled-coil motifs in the n-terminal region of n protein have been proposed to facilitate trimerization a head-to-head tail-to-tail model for trimerization was proposed where three monomers of n protein are brought together via interaction of their n-terminal coiled-coil domains this initial contact is followed by the interaction between the c-terminal -helices that form a shared hydrophobic space and thus consolidate the trimer formation alfadhli et al 2001 alfadhli et al 2002 kaukinen et al 2001 kaukinen et al 2003 kaukinen et al 2004 apart from its role in packaging n has been found to be involved in transcription and replication of viral genome in conjunction with viral rdrp or by interacting with template rna during replication blakqori et al 2003 bridgen and elliott 1996 ikegami et al 2005 kohl et al 2004 pinschewer et al 2003 viral mrnas are translated by the host cell translation machinery recent studies have shown that snv n protein binds to mrna 5 caps and 40s ribosomal subunit with high affinity and specificity fig 24
 these interesting findings have suggested that in the host cell cytoplasm where cellular transcripts are competing for the same translation machinery n protein facilitates the translation of hantaviral mrnas by preferentially loading ribosomes onto capped viral transcripts klempa et al 2008 further studies have shown that the sequence guaguag in the 5utr of hantavirus mrna is sufficient for preferential n-mediated translation initiation mir and panganiban 2010 n-mediated translation initiation mechanism is different from the complex translation initiation strategy used by eukaryotic cells it is likely that n initiates the translation of capped mrna without the requirement of eif4f complex an amalgam of three initiation factors eif4e eif4g and eif4a panganiban and mir 2009 in host cells after the completion of translation the mrnas are deadenylated and decapped followed by degradation by exonucleolytic digestion from both 5 and 3ends in the 53 degradation pathway the decapping enzyme dcp2 in coordination with several other proteins removes the 5 mrna cap followed by degradation by exonuclease xrn1 this degradation mechanism takes place in discrete cytoplasmic foci called processing bodies p-bodies beckham and parker 2008 interestingly a detailed analysis by confocal imaging revealed that n resides in cellular p-bodies further studies revealed that cellular 5-capped mrna oligoribonucleotides are rescued by n in virus-infected cells and stored in p-bodies for the later use as primers by the viral rdrp during transcription initiation mir et al 2008 moreover it was reported that n protein has distinct cap and rna-binding sites that independently interact with mrna cap and viral genomic rna respectively in addition n can simultaneously bind to both mrna cap and vrna n undergoes distinct conformational changes after binding to mrna cap vrna or both the conformationally altered n with a capped primer loaded at the cap-binding site specifically binds the conserved 3 nine nucleotides of vrna 3aucaucauc and assists the bound primer to anneal at the 3terminus the annealed primer is later elongated by the rdrp and a nascent viral mrna is synthesized therefore it was suggested that the cap-binding site of n in conjunction with rdrp plays key roles during the transcription and replication initiation of vrna genome mir et al 2010 taken together these observations imply that n has a role in generating the capped rna primer in p-bodies and also assists the capped primer to anneal to the 3terminus of vrna template during transcription initiation fig 24 n protein performs some ambassadorial functions by interacting with some cellular proteins to facilitate viral dissemination in infected cells for example interaction of n with actin filaments has been reported to mediate the transport of newly synthesized viral rnps to the plasma membrane ravkov et al 1998 it was also shown that n protein interacts with the fas-mediated apoptosis enhancer daxx a death-domain adaptor protein which transduces death signals through the jun n-terminal kinase jnk pathway yang et al 1997 in similar studies interaction of n protein with daxx and small ubiquitin-like modifiers sumo-1 pathway components in infected cells has been reported alfadhli et al 2002 cho et al 2002 kaukinen et al 2003 lee et al 2003 the site of rna synthesis among the viruses of the bunyaviridae family was believed to be the cytoplasm of the host cell this was based on a study on la cross virus in which the newly synthesized rna was found to be in the cytoplasmic fraction where it was monitored by pulse-labeling followed by cell fractionation rossier et al 1986 but based on later studies on localization of the two viral proteins essential for rna synthesis namely l and n it is now thought that rna synthesis among bunyaviruses is membrane associated kukkonen et al 2004 studied the localization of l-gfp fusion protein and found it to localize in the perinuclear region kukkonen et al 2004 this is consistent with the fact that rna synthesis of all positive-stranded viruses is membrane associated salonen et al 2005 further studies on other viruses of this family will be required to confirm if that is a general mechanism employed by these viruses similar to all the other negative-sense rna viruses hantavirus genomic rna segments contain utrs on both the 5 and the 3ends the termini of the utrs are partially complementary to each other due to which the segments fold to make a panhandle-like structure chizhikov et al 1995 kukkonen et al 1998 meyer and schmaljohn 2000 padula et al 2002 several minireplicon systems in which reporter genes such as renilla luciferase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase are flanked by the utrs have been developed for members of the bunyaviridae family blakqori et al 2003 dunn et al 1995 flick and pettersson 2001 flick et al 2003 lopez et al 1995 studies based on these minireplicon systems have shown that 5 and 3utrs serve as promoters for replication of the segments and transcription of the encoded reading frames the utrs are encapsidated by nucleocapsid protein and associate with rdrp both in the host cells and in the virion and only these nucleocapsids are believed to be functional templates for mrna synthesis and rna replication by the viral rdrp the viral rdrp is responsible for the synthesis of viral mrna several unique features involved in this process are detailed here sequence analysis of the 5termini of mrnas of several bunyaviruses has revealed the presence of short 1018 nucleotides nontemplated 5end sequences bishop et al 1983 garcin et al 1995 simons and pettersson 1991 these sequences were later found to be derived from the 5ends of host mrnas by a mechanism similar to cap-snatching originally described for influenza virus in this mechanism a viral endonuclease cleaves the 5termini of the host mrnas and uses them as primers to initiate the transcription of viral mrnas bouloy et al 1978 krug 1981 krug et al 1979 plotch et al 1981 the endonuclease activity required for cap-snatching is believed to reside in the viral polymerase itself patterson et al 1984 based on the observation that all the mrnas contain a g residue at  1 position a prime and realign mechanism for mrna synthesis in the bunyaviridae family was proposed in this mechanism the g residue of the capped primer snatched from the host mrna aligns with a c residue upstream of the 3terminus of the viral template the primer is elongated few nucleotides by rdrp the extended primer detaches and realigns to the 3end of the terminus and then extends further to complete the mrna synthesis garcin et al 1995 termination of mrna synthesis and polyadenylation of the synthesized mrna has been shown to vary among s m and l segments hutchinson et al 1996 synthesis of s segment mrna terminates downstream of a ccaccc motif found around 200 nucleotide downstream of the 5end of the vrna template the s segment mrna is not polyadenylated hutchinson et al 1996 the synthesis of the l mrna extends to the 5terminus of the l vrna and is also not polyadenylated hutchinson et al 1996 however the m segment of snv was found to be polyadenylated and a potential polyadenylationtranscription termination signal was mapped and was found to be conserved among all hantaviruses hutchinson et al 1996 replication of the vrna genome is carried out by the viral rdrp through an antigenomic rna crna intermediate unlike mrna the crna is exact complement of the viral genomic segments without any cap structure and host-derived sequences bishop et al 1983 eshita et al 1985 garcin et al 1995 obijeski et al 1980 raju and kolakofsky 1987 the crna was shown to be encapsidated by the n protein patterson et al 1984 the 5terminus of the vrna in hantaviruses was found to contain uridine monophosohate pu instead of triphosphate pppu chizhikov et al 1995 garcin et al 1995 this observation was explained by a prime and realign mechanism for crna and vrna synthesis garcin et al 1995 briefly after elongation by few nucleotides the capped rna primer with a terminal g residue slides back on the 3 triplet repeat sequence of crna template leaving a protruding gtp that is nonaligned with the 3end the protruding gtp is subsequently cleaved off by the polymerase leaving a pu residue at the 5end garcin et al 1995 the promiscuous nature of polymerization by rdrps due to lack of proof reading ability is thought to be the primary source of evolution in rna viruses this gives the virus an ability to replicate in different hosts and become pathogenic to humans but the virus has to maintain a close window of variation to avoid the error catastrophe as too much of these errors may lead to generation of nonviable genome and reduction of the overall viral fitness crotty and andino 2002 drake et al have estimated an error rate of approximately 1 mutationreplicationgenome for hantaviruses drake 1999 the mean rate of evolutionary change in hantaviruses has been approximated to be within the range of 102104 substitutionssiteyear ramsden et al 2008 rna viruses employ several mechanisms to generate useful variations and to edit deleterious ones which include reassortment and recombination barr and fearns 2010 natural reassortment has been detected among hantaviruses henderson et al 1995 li et al 1995 plyusnin et al 1997 and several experimental reassortants have been generated in the laboratory by infecting different strains of the same hantavirus ebihara et al 2000 rodriguez et al 1998 recently handke et al were able to generate in vitro reassortants between pathogenic puuv and nonpathogenic phv handke et al 2010 rna recombination in viruses usually occurs by a copy choice mechanism in which a replicating polymerase stops copying one rna molecule and switches to another copper et al 1974 worobey and holmes 1999 a recombinant tulv was successfully generated through homologous recombination by infecting vero e6 cells with one strain and by providing s crna of another tulv strain via plasmid-driven expression plyusnin et al 2002 a recent study in bunyamwera virus bunv has shown that recombination may also occur near the end of the templates to keep the ends intact walter and barr 2010 the envelope glycoproteins are encoded by the viral m segment rna they are expressed as a glycoprotein precursor gpc polypeptide which is cleaved by host signal peptidase in the er lumen to generate n-terminal g1 or gn and c-terminal g2 or gc fragments fig 27
 fazakerley and ross 1989 spiropoulou et al 2003 cleavage occurs after a highly conserved pentapeptide waasa motif lober et al 2001 the gpc has neither been detected in infected cells nor in cells transfected with a plasmid encoding m segment mrna but was only detectable by in vitro translation of rna transcripts therefore it was suggested that the proteolytic processing of the gpc occurs during translation pensiero and hay 1992 schmaljohn et al 1987 ulmanen et al 1981 gn and gc are type i transmembrane proteins modified by n-linked glycosylation with the n-terminus exposed on the surface of the virion and the c-terminus anchored in the membrane shi and elliott 2004 they have high tendency to form disulfide bridges due to their high content of cysteine residues 47 antic et al 1992a snv gpc is 1140 amino acids in length the gn of snv consists of 652 residues mw  75 kda with a predicted transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail ct domain of 142 amino acids gc is 488 residues in length mw  55 kda and has a predicted shorter ct of eight amino acids spiropoulou et al 2003 htnv gpc has four hydrophobic domains domain i extends from position 1 to 17 domains ii position 441515 and iv position 10971127 are the transmembrane domains of gn and gc respectively spiropoulou et al 1994 domain ii is very long and the actual membrane spanning portion is not well defined domain iii extends from position 627 to 648 and ends with the highly conserved pentapeptide motif waasa before the n-terminus of gc spiropoulou 2001 most enveloped viruses bud from the plasma membrane into the extracellular space however in the case of family bunyaviridae many members of this family mature by budding into the lumen of the golgi complex progeny virions are then released by fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane kuismanen et al 1982 schmaljohn and nichol 2007 additional evidence suggests that the assembly of new world hantaviruses eg snv and bccv may occur at the plasma membrane ravkov et al 1997 the reason why some viruses have evolved to bud from the golgi membranes is poorly understood but it might be due to the presence of golgi retention signals in viral glycoproteins which allow them to accumulate in the golgi complex after their maturation in the er antic et al 1992b shi and elliott 2002 spiropoulou et al 2003 there is no clear consensus on the exact location of these golgi targeting signals in different members of family bunyaviridae and it appears that different viruses even within a single genus have their own strategies for golgi targeting shi et al 2004 for members of the bunyavirus genus this signal was mapped to the n-terminus of gc lappin et al 1994 the same signal was reported to be located in the transmembrane domain and ct of gn for members of genus phlebovirus andersson et al 1997 gerrard and nichol 2002 matsuoka et al 1994 it was also suggested that translocation of gn and gc from the er to the golgi complex depends on their interaction and heterodimerization because neither of them was able to leave the er when expressed individually deyde et al 2005 ruusala et al 1992 shi and elliott 2002 spiropoulou et al 2003 hantaviruses enter the cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis the acidic environment of the endosome facilitates fusion between the viral and cellular membranes with a consequent release of the viral nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm jin et al 2002 viral glycoproteins mediate attachment of virus to endothelial cells via interaction with surface 3 integrin receptors arikawa et al 1989 gavrilovskaya et al 1998 gavrilovskaya et al 1999 gn has a 142-residue c-terminal ct which plays important roles in viral assembly and hostpathogen interactions the lack of a matrix protein in hantaviruses which plays an important role in the assembly and budding of many enveloped viruses is thought to be substituted by a direct interaction between the nucleocapsid and envelope glycoproteins several lines of evidence seem to substantiate this model the ct of gn of uukuniemi virus was shown by alanine scanning mutagenesis to mediate the packaging of a minigenome encoding a reporter gene into virus-like particles vlps overby et al 2007 also the ct domain of both gn and gc was shown to be indispensible for the replication of bunv shi et al 2007 a highly conserved cysteinehistidine-rich region of the gn tail was recently shown by nmr spectroscopy to form two classical zinc fingers estrada et al 2009 this suggested an involvement of this domain in nucleic acid binding or proteinprotein interactions however it is not yet clear whether the ct interacts with the rna genome or the protein component of the rnp during assembly more recently the n protein of puuv was shown to coimmunoprecipitate with the glycoprotein complex mapping of the interaction sites revealed that the n protein has multiple binding sites in the ct of gn and was also able to bind to the predicted ct of gc hepojoki et al 2010b a clear association between viral glycoproteins and virulence was established by comparing the pathogenicity of virulent and attenuated or genetically reassorted strains of htnv in an experimental newborn mouse model sequence comparison identified single amino acid changes in gn and gc as the genetic determinants responsible for the observed difference in viral virulence ebihara et al 2000 isegawa et al 1994 gn consists of an external domain a transmembrane domain and a c-termianl ct spiropoulou 2001 the ct of gn appears to be a multifunctional virulence determinant that helps the virus to evade host innate responses and ensures productive infection in human endothelial cells it contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs itams these are cell-signaling elements involved in regulating the functions of immune and endothelial cells and their presence in gn ct suggests a direct role in hantavirus pathogenesis geimonen et al 2003b rig-i retinoic acid-inducible gene i is an rna helicase that triggers the cellular innate interferon ifn immune response upon detection of viral double-stranded rna yoneyama et al 2004 the gn ct of the pathogenic new york-1 virus ny-1 v was shown to inhibit the rig-i-directed ifn responses alff et al 2006 alff et al 2008 to counteract this effect it seems that cells have evolved a mechanism for downregulating gn expression by targeting this protein for proteosomal degradation via polyubiquitination of the ct geimonen et al 2003a these findings have created some controversy in the literature it was initially reported that the gn cts of pathogenic ny-1 v htnv and andes virus andv but not the nonpathogenic hantavirus phv are exclusively degraded via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway in cos7 cells sen et al 2007 however this view was challenged by wang et al who reported that the gn cts of the nonpathogenic tulv and phv were proteosomally degraded in hek-293 and vero e6 cells therefore it was concluded that this degradation is not related to viral pathogenesis wang et al 2009 unlike other members of the bunyaviridae family hantaviruses are not transmitted by biting insects human infection occurs accidentally via inhalation of contaminated rodent excreta hart and bennett 1999 rodents are the main natural reservoir where the virus can establish asymptomatic persistent infection within rodents the disease is transmitted horizontally mainly through aggressive behavior such as biting and scratching lee et al 1981a it is mainly a rural disease associated with the risk factors of farming hunting and camping because those activities bring humans into close contact with the rodent reservoirs simpson et al 2010 the only hantavirus that causes disease in urban areas is seov because its host is the domestic rat mir 2010 human-to-human transmission is very rare and was reported only for andv in argentina padula et al 1998 approximately 150000200000 cases of hantavirus infection are reported annually worldwide hart and bennett 1999 the geographic distribution of the disease reflects the distribution of the rodent host hence the classification of hantaviruses into two main groups old world and new world jonsson et al 2010 occurrence of hfrs and hcps depends on the type of virus causing the infection borges et al 2006 hfrs is primarily considered a eurasian disease which was first reported in korea in 1951 and is caused by old world hantaviruses for example htnv seov dobv and puuv more than 150000 cases of hfrs are reported annually half of which occur in china only peters et al 1999 hcps appears to be confined to the americas and is associated with new world hantaviruses for example snv ny-1 v and andv it was first discovered in 1993 in the four corners region of the southwestern united states nichol et al 1993 approximately 300 cases of hcps are reported each year in north and south america muranyi et al 2005 snv which infects deer mouse is the major cause of hcps in north america fabbri and maslow 2001 rodents of the subfamily murinae within family muridae and the subfamilies arvicolinae neotominae and sigmodontinae within family cricetidae are considered to be the main natural reservoir hosts of hantaviruses old world hantaviruses which cause hfrs are carried by rodents of myodes rattus and apodemus genera and new world hantaviruses which cause hcps are carried by the rodents of the subfamily sigmodontinae recently numerous novel hantaviruses from various sorcid and talpid insectivores have been discovered arai et al 2007 kang et al 2009a kang et al 2009b song et al 2007a song et al 2007b song et al 2007c but none of these viruses have been associated with any human disease an apparent coevolution of hantaviruses with their reservoir hosts is evident by the commonly observed close association of each hantavirus species with a certain rodent species moreover phylogenetic analyses of hantavirus sequences and mitochondrial sequences from their rodent hosts suggest a long-standing coevolutionary history of hantaviruses with their rodent carriers jackson and charleston 2004 plyusnin 2002 plyusnin and morzunov 2001 depending on the population density up to 50 of any given population of rodents are seropostive and considered as silent carriers for hantaviruses through experimental infections and field surveys it has been shown that the transmission among rodents is exclusively horizontal and it occurs via inhalation of infected aerosols through saliva or excreta biting and other aggressive behavioral interactions botten et al 2002 glass et al 1988 hinson et al 2004 hutchinson et al 2000 kariwa et al 1998 lee et al 1981a lee et al 1981b root et al 2004 unlike other rodent-borne viruses such as arenaviruses there is no vertical transmission from the dam to its offspring and maternal antibodies can protect offspring from infection for several months kallio et al 2006 taruishi et al 2008 this view has been recently disputed by calisher et al 2009 and several scenarios have been presented for the transmission of hantaviruses from infected to uninfected hosts calisher et al 2009 in general infection of the rodent hosts by their respective hantaviruses is thought to be asymptomatic and no overt disease is produced however several recent studies have reported development of some disease symptoms in the reservoir hosts such as pulmonary edema and periportal hepatitis in white-footed mouse peromyscus leucopus infected with ny-1 v lyubsky et al 1996 and snv-infected deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus netski et al 1999 infection of hantavirus in the rodent host may also cause growth retardation as observed in rattus norvegicus infected with seov childs et al 1989 and p maniculatus infected with snv kanerva et al 1998 nevertheless the general absence of an overt illness in rodent hosts despite a persistent and lifelong infection is believed to be a smart way of survival for hantaviruses by which they avoid killing their own hosts it also highlights an amicable relationship between the virus and its host that was developed over hundreds of thousands of years of mutual interaction the survival of rodent hosts in spite of the chronic viral infection is mediated by a combination of hosts unique immunity against the virus and the viral genetic variability which helps it evade the hosts defense mechanisms schonrich et al 2008 persistently infected rodents shed the virus in urine feces and saliva inhalation of virus-contaminated aerosols is the major route of transmission to humans however the general view that rodents are the only infection source for humans has been disputed by zeier et al 2005 it has been suggested that the close proximity of domestic animals such as cats dogs pigs and cattle with rodents may cause some transmission events of hantaviruses to these animals this species jump may cause the virus to evolve differently and result in more dangerous forms of the virus which could be more pathogenic to humans zeier et al 2005 the incubation period of hfrs is about 3 weeks but can range from 10 days to 6 weeks jonsson et al 2010 kramski et al 2009 the clinical course is classically subdivided into five overlapping phases febrile hypotensive oliguric diuretic and convalescent schmaljohn and hjelle 1997 the febrile phase lasts for 35 days and is characterized by flu-like symptoms thirst nausea and vomiting the febrile phase is followed by a hypotensive phase which lasts for few hours to 2 days and is characterized by thrombocytopenia and petechial hemorrhage retroperitoneal edema and abdominal pain the subsequent oliguric phase lasts for few days to two weeks the mortality rate is 15 with the majority of deaths occurring during the hypotensive and oliguric phases due to the complications of vascular leakage renal failure and acute shock patients who survive these complications usually progress into the diuretic phase and show improved renal function with subsequent convalescence and recovery peters et al 1999 the incubation period of hcps ranges from 9 to 33 days young et al 2000 the clinical disease course of hcps is usually divided into prodromal cardiopulmonary and diuretic or convalescent phases the prodromal stage which usually lasts 36 days is characterized by flu-like symptoms such as fever headache chills and muscle pain abdominal pain nausea vomiting and dizziness may occur this phase usually progresses rapidly to a severe respiratory disease characterized by nonproductive cough and dyspnea in contrast to hfrs the increased permeability and fluid leakage occur exclusively in the lungs instead of the kidneys this bilateral pulmonary edema is usually visible in chest x-rays boroja et al 2002 thrombocytopenia hemoconcentration and leukocytosis are the most prominent hematologic findings simpson et al 2010 rapid deterioration cardiac insufficiency and respiratory failure caused by edema and hypotention shock and death may occur within 210 days after the onset of illness in almost 50 of cases patients who survive the acute phase recover within 57 days and enter the diuretic phase nolte et al 1995 zaki et al 1995 hantavirus infection occurs via inhalation of infectious virus particles into the lungs the inhaled viruses bind to 3 integrin receptors on the surface of pulmonary endothelial cells macrophages and dendritic cells dcs where virus replication mainly occurs gavrilovskaya et al 1998 capillary leakage is the hallmark of hantavirus infection however the sequence of events from inhalation of infectious virus particles until pulmonary capillary leakage remains poorly understood it was proposed that dcs play the role of a trojan horse by helping the dissemination of virus throughout the body immature dcs located near the respiratory epithelial cells engulf inhaled virus particles which can replicate in those cells without causing cell death during their maturation dcs migrate from the lungs to the lymph nodes where they present the engulfed antigen to immune cells raftery et al 2002 the mechanisms by which pathogenic hantaviruses cause capillary leakage is an area of active research accumulating pieces of experimental evidences suggest that multiple immunopathologic mechanisms rather than direct viral-induced cytopathic effects are responsible for the disruption of vascular endothelium and the subsequent capillary leakage associated with hantavirus diseases borges et al 2006 sundstrom et al 2001 in puuv-infected patients elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase ldh indicative of cellular damage correlated with high levels of serum perforin granzyme b and epithelial cell apoptosis markers these findings suggested that tissue damage is due to an immune reaction and that epithelial apoptosis contributed significantly to the damage klingstrom et al 2006b some changes in the endothelial cell barrier functions might be related to the use of 3 integrins as receptors it was shown that the initial interaction of the infecting virus with 3 integrin receptors disturbs the integrin-directed migration of endothelial cells which is essential for maintaining vascular integrity gavrilovskaya et al 2002 the cellular immune response to infection involves strong stimulation of hantavirus-specific cytotoxic cd8 t lymphocytes ctls which are released in large numbers into the blood the severity of the disease was shown to correlate with the number of ctls in the blood kilpatrick et al 2004 this vast excess of activated ctls is partly due to the lack of downregulation of t-cell function as evidenced by low serum levels of cytokines released by regulatory t cells such as tgf- in hcps patients chen and yang 1990 mills 2004 the intense antiviral immune response can contribute to the increased permeability of endothelial cells in two ways first the elevated levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines such as tnf- il-6 and il-10 released during the acute phase by activated t cells and infected endothelial cells increase the vascular permeability resulting in pulmonary edema linderholm et al 1996 second it was shown in transwell permeability assays that hantavirus-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes could directly lyse human endothelial cells infected with snv hayasaka et al 2007 the exact mechanism of kidney failure in hfrs is unclear renal disease has been attributed to deposition of immune complexes and the presence of inflammatory cell infiltrations with subsequent tubular damage mccaughey and hart 2000 sironen et al 2008 diagnosis of hantavirus infection in the clinic relies on the establishment of a history of rodent exposure symptoms suggestive of respiratory or renal involvement blood exams showing severe thrombocytopenia and positive serological tests virus isolation from clinical samples is difficult due to the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies mccaughey and hart 2000 high titers of igm and igg antibodies against hantavirus n and gn proteins are detectable in the sera of patients during the acute phase enabling reliable serological confirmation of infection bostik et al 2000 elgh et al 1997 groen et al 1994 snv gn antibodies are highly specific and do not cross-react with gn antigens of other hantaviruses hjelle et al 1994 jenison et al 1994 the most widely used serological tests for diagnosis of hcps are igm capture and igg indirect elisas li et al 2002 a rapid test for snv and seov in the form of a strip immunoblot assay has been developed which relies on antigens derived from recombinant snv n and gn proteins and seov n protein the assay was demonstrated to be highly sensitive and specific because it could identify all patients with acute snv infection during the early course of the disease with no false-positive results hjelle et al 1997 immunohistochemical detection of hantavirus antigens has been particularly useful in establishing retrospective diagnosis of hcps from fixed tissue samples peters et al 1999 rt-pcr assays have also been used but results should be always interpreted with caution due to the potential of cross-contamination and have to be always substantiated by positive results from immunodiagnostic assays moreli et al 2004 no specific antiviral therapy is currently available for treating hantavirus infections management of infected patients relies solely on supportive therapy in an intensive care unit until the virus is cleared by the immune system muranyi et al 2005 ribavirin a broad-spectrum nucleoside analogue antiviral drug has been shown to possess both in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against hantaviruses huggins et al 1986 medina et al 2007 severson et al 2003 a clinical trial showed decreased virus titers morbidity and mortality rates in hfrs chinese patients huggins et al 1991 another trial on hfrs patients in korea showed significant reduction in fatality and improved prognosis when given early in the course of the disease as well as a reduction in the risk of renal insufficiency rusnak et al 2009 intravenous injection of ribavirin was generally well tolerated by hcps patients chapman et al 1999 however a placebo-controlled double-blind trial of intravenous ribavirin in hcps patients was ended prematurely due to low rate of enrollment mertz et al 2004 therefore ribavirin does not seem to have any clinical application in hcps patients due to the lack of conclusive clinical data passive administration of neutralizing antibodies for puuv has been shown to protect macaques against virus challenge however no human clinical trials were conducted klingstrom et al 2005 despite many efforts that have been invested in developing a safe effective vaccine to protect against hantavirus infection currently no fda-approved vaccine is available in the united states ulrich et al 2002 a formalin-inactivated htnv vaccine hantavax produced from mouse brain-derived virus is licensed for use in korea since the 1990s efficacy studies showed that 97 of human volunteers receiving this vaccine developed high titers of specific neutralizing antibodies after a booster dose however the induced humoral immune response was short lived cho and howard 1999 another formaline-inactivated vaccine produced from suspensions of vero cells elicited a neutralizing antibody response in mice which was fivefold higher than hantavax choi et al 2003 however it is unlikely that these vaccines can provide protection against all hantaviruses the n gn and gc proteins of hantaviruses are highly immunogenic bharadwaj et al 2002 therefore different approaches were taken to develop recombinant vaccines using proteins expressed in baculovirus vaccinia virus and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae chu et al 1995 schmaljohn et al 1990 yoshimatsu et al 1993 recombinant n proteins of puuv and dobv expressed in yeast were shown to induce a protective immune response in rodent models dargeviciute et al 2002 geldmacher et al 2004 moreover deer mice immunized with recombinant deer mouse cytomegalovirus pcmv expressing snv gn developed an antibody response to snv rizvanov et al 2003 although highly protective in mouse models a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the s and m segments of htnv proved to be inefficient in a phase ii clinical trial it elicited neutralizing antibodies in only 72 of the 142 participating volunteers mcclain et al 2000 several other studies using naked dna vaccines containing the m or s genome segments of snv and seov have shown similar success in rodent models but no clinical administration has been reported bharadwaj et al 1999 hooper et al 1999 frequent emergence of zoonotic viruses is a serious concern to human health for example the recent emergence of h1n1 swine flu has created havoc in human lives especially in pregnant women and young children who were predicted to be most susceptible for this new virus species history witnesses the emergence and reemergence of numerous pathogens in the past century with an estimated frequency of one new pathogen every 18 months many of these new pathogens were zoonotic rna viruses such as hantavirus h1ni swine flu nipah virus hendra virus ebola virus west nile virus and sars severe acute respiratory syndrome cornovirus jones et al 2008 morens et al 2004 despite their significant devastation to human lives the ecology and natural history of these zoonotic viruses are still a mystery the principles that govern their stable maintenance in their natural reservoirs compulsions for switching their hosts mechanisms of recombination and reassortment molecular mechanisms of their transfer survival and adaptation in the new host are the interesting areas that remain poorly understood the natural hosts of these zoonotic viruses continue to be the reservoirs for the generation of new pathogenic strains and probable causes of future pandemics that pose serious threat to human lives hantaviruses cause hfrs and hcps when transmitted to humans but maintain a persistent infection in their rodent hosts coevolutionary existence of hantaviruses and their rodent hosts provides insights into mechanisms by which these zonotic viruses manage to exist in the environment for millions of years with a potential to infect humans upon transmission however understanding the mechanisms by which hantaviruses maintain a persistent infection in their rodent hosts without a disease may provide insights into the possible approaches that could be used for the treatment of hantavirus-associated disease in humans excessive proinflammatory cytokine tnf- and cd8 responses in humans are hypothesized to mediate the pathogenesis of human hfrs and hcps suggesting that anti-tnf therapy might be helpful during the treatment since hcps is comparatively a rare disease funding for the development of an hcps vaccine is not a high priority for many countries however with the increasing number of hcps cases especially in south america vaccine efforts for hcps may receive better appreciation due to the requirements of high-containment laboratories for hcps-causing viruses plasmid dna gene gun-based approaches will be preferred for the development of an hcps vaccine dissecting the molecular mechanisms of hantavirus replication in host cells will provide insights about the new potential targets for the design of antiviral therapeutic agents for the treatment of hfrs and hcps for example the newly discovered translation initiation mechanism operated by hantavirus nucleocapsid protein demonstrates how a single viral protein lures the host cell translation machinery for the preferential translation of viral mrnas in virus-infected cells where cellular transcripts are competing for the same translation apparatus mir and panganiban 2008 shutting down this viral translation initiation strategy might inhibit virus replication in infected cells in addition viral rdrp uses capped rna primers to initiate the transcriptionreplication of viral rna genome capped rna primers are generated from host cell mrnas by a unique cap-snatching mechanism this mechanism is well understood in influenza virus however recent studies suggest that hantaviral cap-snatching mechanism might be different from influenza virus mir et al 2008 in-depth understanding of cap-snatching mechanism will reveal novel targets that could be used for the design of antiviral agents for the treatment of diseases caused by a broad spectrum of viruses that use cap-snatching mechanism to initiate transcriptionreplication of viral genome currently the studies of hantavirus biology and pathogenesis are limited due to the lack of an animal model and a complete reverse genetic system for these viruses although a minigenome system for htnv has been reported flick et al 2003 reverse genetic system will generate hopes for screening chemical libraries to identify molecules with antiviral therapeutic potential for the development of attenuated vaccine candidates and for the investigation of molecular mechanisms involved in hantavirus replication gene expression as well as virus assembly and budding  hantavirus infection and the renal syndrome geraldo bezerra da silva junior elizabeth de francesco daher elvino barros stefan de oliveira vilges lvaro faccini-martnez adolfo   the first cases of hantavirus infections were reported during the korean war 19511953 where soldiers who came into contact with rodent-infested environments developed fever myalgia hemorrhagic manifestations acute renal failure and hemodynamic instability 13 twenty-five years after this event an rna virus of the genus hantavirus family bunyaviridae was isolated from wild rodents of the species apodemus agrarius subsequently this new agent was called hantaan in reference to the korean river where the first cases occurred and the rodents were captured 4 soon after that studies showed that the korean hemorrhagic fever was not an exclusive disease of that region and was likely to occur in countries such as russia china and scandinavia 1 so it was verified that the korean hemorrhagic fever was just one of the variants of a group of diseases that manifested by hemorrhage and acute renal failure which led the world health organization to denominate it hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs 1 hfrs is caused by the viral variants hantaan seoul dobrava and puumala 5 6 in brazil the presence of the seoul virus has been reported since the 1980s 7 with the subsequent description of infections in humans 8 and virus circulation in urban rodent populations of the genus rattus 9 10 the first record of human hantavirus infection in the americas was carried out in the united states in the four corners region new mexico arizona colorado and utah in may 1993 where an outbreak of an acute respiratory disease called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps was reported 11 12 in later studies related to the first cases in south america an important cardiac involvement was described which resulted in the change of the nomenclature to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hcps 13 in brazil the first cases of hcps were reported in november of the same year from an outbreak that occurred in a rural area of the municipality of juquitiba state of so paulo the similar cases showed clinical pictures that included respiratory failure and their serological and histopathological exams confirmed hantavirus infection thus characterizing it as the first outbreak of hcps in brazil 14 the perpetuation of hantavirus infection in nature occurs by rodent interactions associated with food competition at times of food deficit or overcrowding fights are frequent which results in contact with saliva or excreted material thus maintaining the infections in enzootic cycles 15 recent studies have also identified other mammals  bats marsupials and shrews  carrying hantavirus infections however the participation of these animals in enzootic and epidemic cycles is not yet well established 16 the hantavirus transmission to humans occurs by inhalation of aerosol-dispersed viral particles present in rodent droppings and saliva 17 rarely contagion can also occur through the bite of infected animals inoculation into the skin or mucous membranes with solution of continuity or ingestion of water or food contaminated by the virus 18 despite the severity of hcps oligosymptomatic and even asymptomatic cases of human hantavirus infection are known to occur these cases are confirmed due to the presence of hantavirus antibodies in the general population detected in serological surveys including in individuals with no epidemiological history 19 the incubation period of the disease may vary from a few days to 2 months the minimum period recorded was 3 days and the maximum period recorded was 60 days most cases show the first signs of the disease around 2 weeks after the exposure 18 the median duration of the disease from symptom onset to cure or death is 5 and 13 days respectively 20 the hfrs is given different names throughout its distribution area hemorrhagic nephritis in the former soviet union songo fever or epidemic hemorrhagic fever in china korean hemorrhagic fever in korea epidemic nephropathy in scandinavia epidemic nephritis or epidemic hemorrhagic fever or balkan nephritis in europe and epidemic hemorrhagic fever in japan 24 based on the isolation and characterization of the hantaan virus 25 it was verified that the hfrs had a geographical distribution across several asian and european countries such as japan china manchuria and russia extending to other southeast asian countries and africa 24 26 hfrs is currently endemic in eurasia where the main etiological agents are the hantaan and seoul viruses in asia china south korea and the far east of russia in addition to the seoul puumala and dobrava viruses in europe central northern alpine massif balkans and western russia 27 lethality rates are higher with hantaan and dobrava virus infections 510 when compared to the puumala and seoul viruses 1 28  with the expansion and geographical migration of the rat rattus norvegicus from the old world the seoul virus was introduced into the americas and is now considered a virus with a cosmopolitan distribution 29 on the american continent the presence of the seoul virus has been confirmed in brazil argentina and the united states 710 3032  hcps is distributed from canada to southern argentina in north america cases have already been identified in canada especially in the south of the country in the united states the cases have a fatality rate of around 4050 being endemic in most of the american states with clusters of cases in the american southwest 21 26 33 there are no reported human cases of hcps in mexico central america except panama 34 and the caribbean although some hantaviruses have already been identified in rodents captured in mexico and costa rica 35 36 in south america besides brazil cases have already been confirmed in argentina uruguay chile paraguay bolivia venezuela and colombia 18 21 35 3741 in argentina in 1993 the first cases of hcps outbreaks were reported and identified in people who had as a common risk situation the exposure to a place with agricultural production and grain planting which attracts rodents this country has three major transmission areas and has already characterized at least seven different viral genotypes the average case fatality rate has been approximately 23 42 also in argentina the first cases with proven person-to-person transmission were detected caused by the andes virus 43 in chile hcps was described in 1995 with most cases being reported in the south of the country the reported cases were more frequent among males 72 working in agricultural andor forest environments 50 and with a mean age of 315 years with an overall case fatality rate of 4070 38 44 both in argentina and chile where the main etiological agent of hcps is the andes virus hemorrhagic manifestations and acute renal failure are common clinical characteristics in affected patients 45 46 in 1995 the first case of hcps was recognized in paraguay the emergence of the disease which occurs mainly in the chaco paraguayan region was attributed to an invasion of rural homes by rats from a floodplain region that was flooded during torrential rain the case fatality rate ranged from 10 to 20 and approximately 38 of the patients were males with a mean age of 29 years hantavirus infection is quite common among the indigenous population where prevalence coefficients of up to 40 have been detected 47 in uruguay cases of hcps have a case fatality rate of 25 and since the first diagnosis in 1997 few cases have been reported the disease most often affects young adult males 789 and has been associated with rural activities or entering enclosed places or environments with the presence of rodents being restricted to the southern region of the country 48 bolivia has few reports of cases which sporadically occur since 1997 49 in 2002 and 2013 venezuela and colombia respectively reported their first cases 35 41  hcps is the main clinical pattern in brazil cases have been identified in all regions average of 150 cases per year most frequently in the south southeast and midwest regions with an average case fatality rate of 385 40 the highest incidences are detected in the states of mato grosso do sul and santa catarina fig 142 and there is no well-defined seasonality with cases occurring throughout all months of the year with certain regional variations 20 the risk factors for hantavirus infections include involvement in agricultural domestic and leisure activities that are associated with human exposure to rodents or their excreted materials 20 40 thus men of economically productive age are the ones most often affected by hcps in brazil six variants of hantavirus have been associated with hcps juquitibaaraucaria araraquaraparano castelo dos sonhos anajatuba laguna negra and rio mamor 18 21 50 51 although there are few current studies on the seoul virus in brazil 10 studies carried out in the late twentieth century indicate that the virus circulates in both humans and urban rodents of the genus rattus in addition to describing cases with clinically indistinguishable and hfrs-compatible manifestations probably underdiagnosed in the presence of suspected cases of leptospirosis of which clinical manifestations are similar 710  hfrs is characterized by an incubation period of 742 days during which subclinical or oligosymptomatic infections are not uncommon classically clinical evolution is divided into five phases febrile hypotensive oliguric diuretic and convalescence these periods may overlap and in mild cases not even occur the onset is abrupt and manifests with high fever chills retro-orbital headache photophobia myalgias abdominal pain nausea and vomiting diffuse cutaneous hyperemia affecting the face neck and upper chest and petechiae on the soft palate and armpits are common physical findings the liver can be palpated in a significant number of cases liver impairment is more common in infections caused by the seoul virus many patients recover slowly from this phase but some develop hypotension and shock which usually occur before the 5th or 6th day the blood pressure drop may be mild but some patients develop refractory shock which requires the use of vasoactive drugs sudden albuminuria is frequent at the end of the fever phase during the hypotensive phase thrombocytopenia 70000mm3 proteinuria 3000 mgday decreased urinary density hemoconcentration hematocrit 50 and leukocytosis are common sometimes with leukemoid reaction bleeding is common in the oliguric phase and can be observed in the conjunctiva skin and mucosa digestive tract and central nervous system microscopic hematuria is also frequent at this stage renal function deteriorates increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen usually 24 hours after hypotension with the onset of oliguria or even anuria which requires the use of dialysis methods recovery from this moment onward can be rapid with the onset of intense diuresis above 3 l per day hydroelectrolytic disorder hypokalemia hyponatremia hyperphosphatemia and episodes of arterial hypertension deaths are due to kidney failure in the oliguric phase andor shock in the hypotensive oliguric or diuretic phase this disease should be clinically differentiated from leptospirosis and other viral hemorrhagic fevers that occur in the same areas of occurrence of hantavirus infections 26 5256 although uncommon some patients can have renal sequelae in the first months or years after the convalescence phase such as increased glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria however such sequelae tend to disappear over time without evidence of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal failure 57 recent studies in europe have indicated that smoking in addition to being a common condition in patients infected with puumala virus is a risk factor for developing acute renal failure and severe disease 58 in the prodromal phase the most frequent manifestations are fever myalgia back pain abdominal pain asthenia severe headache and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea fig 143 this unspecific condition may last from 1 to 6 days or for up to 15 days and then regress approximately 70 of the cases in brazil develop into the cardiopulmonary clinical phase dry cough may already be present at the end of this stage 18 it is characterized by the onset of coughing which is usually dry although in some cases it may be productive accompanied by tachycardia tachydyspnea and hypoxemia such manifestations may be followed by a rapid evolution to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema hypotension and circulatory collapse the chest x-ray shows in 60 of cases bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrate that rapidly evolves with alveolar filling especially in the hila and pulmonary bases pleural effusion mainly bilateral of small magnitude is a common finding the cardiac area is normal the cardiac index is low and the peripheral vascular resistance is high the opposite of what is observed in septic shock renal impairment may appear but it is usually mild to moderate although acute renal failure may occur especially in infections by the bayou black creek canal and andes virus the case fatality rate is high at this stage usually around 45 17 18 laboratory diagnosis of cases of hantavirus human infection is commonly performed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa which aims to detect mainly the igm antibodies associated with recent infection such diagnosis is possible even in the acute phase of the disease because antibodies in hcps appear with the onset of signs and symptoms 13 17 18 the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr methodology  which detects hantavirus rna in clinical samples is extremely useful and practical for the diagnosis of hcps 17 18 hcps laboratory findings although not characteristic may support the diagnosis of a suspected case of the disease data from complete blood counts obtained during the prodromal period such as elevated hematocrit presence of immunoblasts atypical lymphocytes and thrombocytopenia may be the evidence that respiratory impairment can occur within hours even if the chest x-ray results are normal 59 60 the most commonly found chest x-ray alterations are progressive bilateral interstitial infiltrate hilar and peribronchial congestion and pleural effusion after 2448 hours air-space consolidation rapidly evolves and pleural effusion progressively increases if the evolution is favorable these radiological abnormalities disappear within a few days 61 other signs and symptoms have been reported and in some cases the disease may not progress from the prodromal stage or clinical symptoms may be completely absent 59 based on clinical symptomatology early disease recognition is not easy and may be mistaken by endemic diseases prevalent in the same areas such as dengue leptospirosis and influenza 18 26 54 62 diseases of infectious
origin leptospirosis influenza and parainfluenza dengue yellow fever and rift valley fever coxsackie virus infections adenovirus and arenavirus lassa fever infections trichinellosis malaria pneumonia viral bacterial fungal and atypical septicemia rickettsiosis histoplasmosis and pneumocystosis 18 26 54 62 noninfectious diseases acute abdomen of variable etiology acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema interstitial pneumonia by collagen disease systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease cobpd 18 26 in both hfrs and hcps viral infections start with the endothelial cells of the lung microvascularization after viral replication the virus disseminates through the lymphatic route to other organs and tissues the pathogenetic mechanisms of hantavirus infections seem to originate from an autoimmune response since they do not induce increased capillary permeability by themselves the disease severity increases after the immune response the viral infection triggers an immune response with the activation of defense cells including thymus-dependent cytotoxic lymphocytes l-tcd8 55 recognized as an infectious vasculitis small vessel endothelium is a major target in hantavirus infection producing endothelial activation vascular dysfunction secondary to the immune response and inflammatory mechanism thrombin formation fibrinolysis and increased platelet consumption 63 in addition to being massively present in the lungs defense cells are also found in peripheral blood as atypical lymphocytes once activated these cells are capable of producing cytokines that will act directly on the vascular endothelium as well as stimulating macrophages to produce more cytokines such as interleukin 1 il-1 interferon gamma ifn- and the tumor necrosis factor tnf these substances acting directly on the capillary can lead to increased vascular permeability which allows massive fluid leakage into the interstitial space and later into the alveoli triggering pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure in the case of hcps 55 in the kidneys especially in the podocytes glomerular endothelial cells and tubular epithelial cells hantaviruses join and enter via v1 integrins and components of the complement system cd55 and gc1qrp32 64 under basal conditions -integrins contribute to the regulation of the vascular integrity endothelial cell permeability through restriction of vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and in platelet functions 63 the viral infection inhibits normal regulation of -integrins inducing an increased endothelial cell response to vegf and producing a significant increase in vascular permeability 63 additionally there is redistribution and decrease in intercellular junctions explaining the classical proteinuria in the acute phase of the disease 63 urinary loss of low molecular weight proteins 1 and 2 microglobulins suggests that tubular involvement also contributes to proteinuria 63 increased vascular permeability in different organs including the kidneys explains the typical characteristics of hantavirus infection hemoconcentration hypotension shock abdominal pain due to retroperitoneal edema and pleural effusion 63 to date the reasons why there are groups of hantavirus that trigger greater pathogenesis in the renal system in the case of hfrs or in the lungs and heart in the case of hcps are unknown 18 hantavirus infections usually have little histopathological evidence of cell damage and no pathognomonic lesions are found 62 the lungs are the most frequently injured organs in hcps where pulmonary edema is described with discrete hyaline membrane interstitial lymphocyte infiltrate immunoblasts and activated macrophages 65 66 renal hantavirus infection is typically described as acute tubulointerstitial nephritis 55 findings in the histopathological study include cell infiltrates leukocytes plasma cells monocytes macrophages polymorphonuclear cells edema and interstitial hemorrhages medullary hemorrhages alterations in the tubular epithelium and lumen generalized capillary damage with intratubular alterations and interstitial edema and sporadically glomerular involvement with hypercellularity and mesangial expansion fig 144 55 56 58 the severity of acute renal failure is due to the level of tubulointerstitial and glomerular damage 55 however glomerulonephritis is a rare consequence of hantavirus infection 56 a study published in 2015 carried out in france characterized renal histopathological findings in 17 patients diagnosed with hfrs secondary to puumala virus infection 67 interestingly interstitial hemorrhage and acute tubular necrosis were commonly described but interstitial nephritis was not frequent moreover renal microvascular inflammation presence of t cells and macrophages was observed with cortical peritubular capillaritis and in the medullary portion of the vasa recta there is no treatment with antiviral drugs specific for hantavirus any suspected case of hantavirus should be transferred to the intensive care unit icu as soon as possible 18 
unspecificprodromal form the treatment of patients with mild forms of the disease is symptomatic hydration when necessary should be carefully provided to avoid volume overload strict control of vital data regarding hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters is required to prevent triggering or worsening of the cardiorespiratory condition in the case of hcps 18 severe form in patients with more severe forms and worsening hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters careful intravenous iv fluid infusion is recommended which if excessive may precipitate pulmonary edema adequate management of fluid intake is the main therapeutic element fluid balance is another parameter of great importance requiring control of diuresis bladder catheterization not mandatory and renal function the volume of iv fluids should be sufficient to maintain the preload and ensure adequate renal plasma flow maintaining a negative or at least zero fluid balance so as not to increase pulmonary edema maximum 2500 ml in 24 hours for adults colloidal and plasma solutions may be employed to achieve a negative or zero fluid balance sufficient to optimize volemia with central venous pressure cvp  6 cm of fluid and maintain good renal flow in critically ill patients central venous access is recommended for preload evaluation and monitoring 18 early vasoactive cardiotonic drugs should be introduced to maintain hemodynamic conditions and prevent shock such as norepinephrine from 001 to 10 gkgmin which allows their use in a concentrated solution allowing a low volume of infusion as a second option dopamine 25 gkgmin at dopa dose and 510 gkgmin at beta dose both iv should be used continuously dobutamine 815 gkgmin should be reserved for refractory cases in combination with more than one vasoactive drug when decreased myocardial performance is suspected considering its use alone in the presence of severe hypotension may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias when these drugs are not available adrenaline and phenylephrine are used as second-choice drugs 18 in more critically ill patients continuous hemodynamic and ventilatory support and monitoring is required oxygen supply should be administered ensuring arterial saturation of at least 90 in patients who require it in cases of mild respiratory failure and stable clinical status early noninvasive ventilation bilevel positive airway pressure ventilatory support bipapcontinuous positive airway pressure cpap may be applied patients with more accentuated respiratory distress and o2 saturation  80 with signs of respiratory fatigue and chest x-ray compatible with severe ards should be assisted with invasive mechanical ventilatory assistance in this condition peep positive end-expiratory pressure between 10 and 18 cm3 of h2o should be established in an attempt to reduce edema and the risk of pulmonary bleeding in mechanical respiratory assistance the controlled pressure mode is used adjusting the inspiratory pressure so that the inspiratory peak of 3540 cm3 is not exceeded maintaining an adequate co2 exchange 3545 cm3 18 in the controlled volume modality whenever possible the tidal volume can be adjusted to 57 mlkg of body weight in an attempt to control with fio2  60 varying as necessary 18 in cases of hfrs in addition to the hemodynamic support the maintenance of the hydroelectrolytic balance is crucial 28 56 the use of nephrotoxic agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided 56 in patients with acute renal failure with hemodynamic stability intermittent hemodialysis is usually the first-choice procedure 28 56 in critically ill patients multiorgan dysfunction syndrome pulmonary edema fluid overload hydroelectrolytic disorders encephalopathy and acute renal failure continuous renal replacement therapy is indicated 28 56 antiviral drugs such as ribavirin and interferon- have been used to treat both hcps and hfrs but scientific evidence suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness of these drugs is ideal when started prophylactically or at a very early stage of the disease 28 56 recent evidence has indicated icatibant a drug used for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema attacks which acts as a bradykinin type 2 receptor antagonist reducing the increase in vascular permeability and inhibiting vasodilation as a possible therapeutic option in severe cases of hantavirus infection 56 finally the isolation of the patient under barrier protection conditions apron gloves and mask with n95 filters is recommended considering the reports of person-to-person transmission already reported in the literature 68

 it is noteworthy that in brazil although hcps is the predominant clinical pattern there are studies that confirm the circulation of the seoul virus in both humans and urban rodents of the genus rattus in addition to the description of cases with manifestations compatible with hfrs clinically indistinguishable and probably underdiagnosed in the presence of suspected cases of leptospirosis 710 therefore infections caused by this virus should be suspected in patients with acute febrile syndrome thrombocytopenia and proteinuria or acute renal failure with exposure to urban rodents 70 suspected case with the following laboratory test resultsreactive serology for hantavirus-specific serum antibodies of the igm class orpositive tissue immunohistochemistry identification of hantavirus-specific antigensorpositive rt-pcr for hantavirus

any suspected case that during the investigation has a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of another disease or does not meet the previously defined confirmation criteria
 in parallel with the investigation of the human case environmental surveillance activities are triggered called eco-epidemiological surveillance actions which imply activities at the probable site of infection aimed at identifying the prevalent rodent species and among them determining the probable reservoir and the circulating hantavirus variant 18 71 these studies aim to expand the knowledge about the epidemiological behavior of hantavirus infections in a given area contribute to the knowledge about the natural history of the disease and assist decision-making regarding prevention and control actions 18 serological studies on wild rodents have been carried out since 1993 when the first cases of hantavirus were detected due to these studies the identification of new hantavirus reservoirs new genera and species of wild rodents and new variants has been systematically performed 17 18 serological surveys in human populations may also support the assessment and recognition of transmission areas and studies carried out in brazil have reported a prevalence of between 2 and 18 depending on the study site and age group investigated the most interesting data from surveys performed in brazil are from badra et al 72 who retrospectively analyzed 19871990 samples from a blood bank of residents of the municipality of cacia dos coqueiros  state of so paulo and found a prevalence rate of around 5 even before the confirmation of the first cases of the disease in the americas the prevention of hantavirus infection is based on the use of measures that prevent human contact with wild and urban rodents and their excreta waste eliminated from the organism 73 protective equipment is recommended for individuals who work in environments with rodents gloves goggles and masks with pff3 filter 18 the control measures should include actions that prevent rodents from coming close such as mowing the land around the house adequately disposing of existing debris keeping food stored in closed rodent-proof containers and other measures that prevent the interaction between man and wild and urban rodents in places where the presence of these animals is known 18   steven

of hps are unusual although hps has been reported in countries that are in close geographic proximity or in travelers to disease-endemic areas 6 7 8  fortunately none of the persons exposed to the patient reported symptoms consistent with hps during the incubation period and none who were tested seroconverted seroprevalence surveys in chile among healthcare worker contacts of patients with hps

increasingly recognized as a cause of respiratory infections worldwide children and infants appear to be most at risk 2-7 although hbovs role in immunocompromised patients remains unclear we report on a child with disseminated hbov infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct hbov dna was detected at high levels in nasopharyngeal aspirates npas and in blood and stool samples a

days 21-47 subsequent plasma days 61 68 75 88 219 npa day 219 and stool day 219 samples were negative for hbov dna however the ability of hbov to cause persistent infection as do other members of the parvovirinae subfamily cannot be excluded future investigations are needed to address this hypothesis here we report on disseminated hbov infection in an immunocompromised patient whether the clinical course in this case was more severe or prolonged than it would have been for hbov infections in non-hsct children remains unknown due to the lack of long-term observations in immunocompetent children the dramatic increase of hbov load in npas and viral dissemination most likely resulted from progressive impairment of cellular immunity as indicated by simultaneous cmv reactivation moreover the increased viral load might have also been a consequence of steroid addition to immunosuppressive therapy to control gvhd the contribution of hbov to respiratory disease remains ambiguous because 2 npa samples were also rhinovirus positive additional studies are required to investigate the pathogenic role of hbov in double or multiple infections association of hbov with the patients continued diarrhea is in accordance with previous studies 8 9 10  prolonged fecal shedding has important implications for isolation measures in transplantation units more studies in immunocompromised patients are required to evaluate the spectrum of pathology caused by this emerging virus to the editor isoniazid is a fi rstline drug in the treatment of tuberculosis its uses include prevention as well as cure isoniazid is usually well tolerated although its common side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort rash allergy hepatitis and peripheral neuropathy hematologic disorders such as eosinophilia thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are rarely reported 1 pure red cell aplasia prca is an uncommon disorder in adults prca occurs secondary to drug exposure in 5 of patients 30 drugs have been implicated 2  and few reports involving isoniazid have been published we report a case of isoniazid-induced prca in 2006 a 79-year-old woman sought care at a public assistance hospital in paris she reported having had asthenia breathlessness and decreased appetite for 2 weeks she had had node-negative localized gastric adenocarcinoma 2 years earlier which had been treated by partial gastrectomy and pulmonary tuberculosis in 1948 which had been treated by partial pneumonectomy as a result of a pleuropulmonary tuberculosis relapse diagnosed 6 weeks earlier she was receiving antituberculous treatment with rifampin 400 mgday isoniazid 150 mgday ethambutol 800 mgday and pyrazinamide 1000 mgday she received no other concomitant medications her initial physical examination showed nothing abnormal laboratory analysis showed hemoglobin 63 g dl leukocyte and thrombocyte counts within normal limits 1 reticulocytes and zero schizocytes other test results liver

antigen showed no abnormalities which lessened the likelihood of a tumor relapse bone marrow aspiration from the sternum showed a hypocellular marrow with complete absence of the erythroid series a normal myeloid series and megakaryocytes the marrow fi ndings were consistent with prca in view of previous reports of isoniazid-induced prca 3-5 we suspected this drug to be responsible in this case isoniazid was withdrawn and other antituberculous drugs were continued the patients hemoglobin level rose to 106 gdl and reticulocyte count to 3 over 10 days no blood transfusion was required drug-induced prca is a rare blood disorder in adults and has already been reported in isoniazid-treated patients 3 4 5  for this patient other causes for anemia eg drug-induced hemolytic anemia digestive malignancies viral causes known to date hematologic malignancies and autoimmune disorders were excluded 2  the favorable outcome after isoniazid withdrawal increased the likelihood that isoniazid was the cause although rechallenge with isoniazid could have confi rmed isoniazid as the cause it is not an ethical option because of the hazardous adverse effects the exact mechanism for isoniazid-induced prca remains unclear but the demonstration of antibodies reacting with nucleated red blood cells in 50 of cases suggests an induction of autoimmunity 4 5  this hypothesis is supported by previously reported cases in which prca relapses occurred when treatment with isoniazid was resumed 3 5  the intrinsic imputability of isoniazid also relies on the lack of a dose-effect

ricardo soto-rifo fernando valiente-echeverra craig mccormick   the control of the translation and turnover of mrnas plays fundamental roles in the regulation of gene expression eukaryotic cells have developed different mechanisms to control these processes in order to respond to environmental stress such as heat shock uv irradiation hypoxia endoplasmic reticulum er stress and viral infection among those mechanisms is the assembly of non-membrane-delimited bodies called rna granules that contain rna-binding proteins rbps and translationally silenced mrnas 12 the classification of rna granules is based on a number of factors including their subcellular localization nuclear cytoplasmic axonal etc the presence of specific markers the cell type where they are assembled germ cells neurons response to stimuli stress viral infection dynamic behavior and proposed functions sites of mrna storagedecay stress response etc 3 the nucleus contains the nucleolus nuclear speckles nuclear stress bodies the transcription factory cajal bodies the gemini of cajal bodies the histone locus body paraspeckles and pml bodies all of which have specific regulatory functions reviewed in 45 the cytoplasm harbors the polar and germinal granules stress granules sgs processing bodies p-bodies or pbs and neuronal granules 67 many rna viruses have evolved mechanisms to modulate the assembly of different rna granules in this review we will summarize the regulation of sgs and pbs by different virus families sgs are composed of target mrnas bound to translation initiation factors eif4g eif3 pabpc1 eif2-p eif5a to allow the rapid restoration of translation once the stress is gone 1928 many other proteins are involved in sg formation such as mrna binding proteins that provide translational control or mrna stability tia-1 tiar hurelavl1 fxr1 pum1 6293031 proteins related to mrna metabolism g3bp1 g3bp2 p54rckddx6 pmr1 smn staufen1 dhx36 caprin1 zbp1 hdac6 adar 203233343536 and signaling proteins mtor rack1 traf2 37 moreover interferon-stimulated gene isg products such as pkr adar1 rna-sensing rig-i-like receptors rig-i mda5 lgp2 rnase l and oas have been shown to colocalize with sgs following viral infections 3839  pbs contain components of the mrna decapping machinery dcp12 lsm1-7 edc3proteins 4041 scaffolding proteins ge-1hedls 41 deadenylation factors ccr1 caf1 not1 42 nonsense-mediated decay nmd proteins smg5-6-7 upf1 4043 and translation control factors cpeb eif4e-t 3244 most recently patel and colleagues showed that gw-bodies which also are ribonucleoproteins rnps involved in mrna decay are distinct from p-bodies gw-bodies are unique in that they contain gw182 a large scaffolding protein containing an n-terminal domain composed of gwwg motifs the n-terminal gwwg motif-bearing domain has been shown to bind to ago2 while the c-terminus interacts with the ccr4-not deadenylation complex 45 moreover gw-bodies have a different spatial-temporal regulation because they play a major functional role in mirna-mediated gene silencing rather than degradation 45 as a result of virus infection isgs can also be found in pbs 46 given that sgs and pbs are highly dynamic many proteins have been described as being part of both rna granules apobec3g ago2 brf1 ddx3 fast ttp etc 29474849 suggesting that mrnas can move between both mrnps thus regulating rna homeostasis a comprehensive list of sg pb and sgpb components is provided in table 1 members of the family herpesviridae and poxviridae are enveloped double-stranded dna dsdna viruses herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv-1 shuts off host protein synthesis by impairing the activation of eif2 kinases through the virion host shutoff vhs protein 129 us11 130 icp345 131 and glycoprotein b gb 132 during hsv-1 infection the sg components tia-1 tiar and ttp are upregulated but do not form sg however infection with vhs-defective hsv-1 triggers sg assembly 133134 relying on pkr activity in the absence of vhs 135 recently finnen and colleagues have shown that infection with hsv type 2 hsv-2 impairs arsenite-mediated sg assembly while the sg induced by treatment with pateamine a are not affected 136 the blockage in arsenite-induced sg assembly is dependent on vhs as cells infected with a vhs defective hsv-2 mutant form sgs late during infection 137 human cytomegalovirus hcmv infection suppresses the assembly of sgs in cells treated with the er stressor thapsigargin 138 while simultaneously inducing an unfolded protein response upr and activating perk but limiting eif2 phosphorylation to maintain viral rna translation 139 vaccinia virus vv a member of poxviridae family replicates within the cytoplasm in large foci called dna factories that co-opt sg proteins such as g3bp1 caprin1 eif4e pabp and eif4g 140141 vv appears to utilize sg components for different purposes the g3bp1caprin1 complex aids vv transcription 140 viral translation initiation is dependent on eif4eeif4gpabp and the viral protein i3 associates with eif4g to recruit viral ssdna 142 suggesting that sg components may link vv transcription and translation 141 tia-1 is not sequestered in dna factories 143 however infection with a vv mutant lacking e3l which activates pkr induces aggregates that contain tia-1 eif3b g3bp1 and usp10 called antiviral granules avgs given that they restrict viral replication 94 the family reoviridae is composed of non-enveloped virions with a 912 dsrna segment genome the prototypical member of the family rotavirus causes the shut off of host protein synthesis 144 and despite inducing eif2 phosphorylation sg assembly is not induced likely due to the translocation of pabp from the cytoplasm to the nucleus 144 the persistent phosphorylation of eif2 during rotavirus infection is pkr-dependent as a consequence of the high amount of viral dsrna in the cytoplasm 145 by contrast mammalian orthoreovirus mrv induces sg assembly during the early stages of infection at a step between viral uncoating and viral mrna transcription and requires phosphorylation of eif2 which is important to promote virus replication 146 however despite high levels of phosphorylated eif2 sgs are disrupted at later times during mrv infection 147 recently carroll and colleagues showed that the nonstructural protein ns is recruited to sgs but its expression alone was not able to modulate assembly suggesting a relationship between viral factories and sgs 148 all members of the picornaviridae family are composed of non-enveloped particles evidence indicates that poliovirus pv proteinase 2a induces assembly of sgs early post-infection between 2 and 4 h 16149 which are dispersed later in the infection through the cleavage of g3bp1 by the pv 3c proteinase 3cpro 150 interestingly at a later time post-infection aggregates containing viral rna and tia-1 but excluding the bona fide sg components eif4g and pabp are observed suggesting that tia-1 aggregation is unlinked from sg formation 151152 encephalomyocarditis virus emcv and coxsackievirus b3 cvb3 also disrupt sgs by cleavage of g3bp1 through a mechanism similar to that used by pv 50153 by contrast theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev and mengovirus a strain of emcv inhibit sg assembly through the expression of the leader l protein maintaining the g3bp-1 intact 154155 a mutant mengovirus in which the zn-finger domain of l is disrupted induces g3bp1 aggregation in a pkr-dependent manner 155 suggesting that a g3bp1-caprin1-pkr complex could induce innate immune activation during mengovirus infection 156 in 2005 mcinerney and colleagues showed that semliki forest virus sfv a member of the togaviridae family composed of enveloped virions is able to induce eif2 phosphorylation promoting sg assembly at early stages of infection 157 however at late times post-infection concomitant to an increase in vrna levels sfv is no longer able to promote sg assembly 157 it was determined that the sfv-induced sg disassembly is caused by the c-terminal domain of the viral nonstructural protein 3 nsp3 which forms a complex with g3bp1 sequestering it into the vrna replication complex 158 chikungunya virus chikv nsp3 also sequesters g3bp1 and forms specific virus-induced cytoplasmic foci that lack the sg marker eif3 and are resistant to cycloheximide treatment 159 later scholte and colleagues demonstrated that g3bp2 a close relative of g3bp1 containing a similar domain architecture which is recruited into sgs 160 colocalized with chikv nsp23 161 g3bp2-containing complexes differs from the replication and transcription complexes rtcs suggesting a role of g3bps in the early step of the chikv replication cycle 161 in contrast rubella virus rubv induces g3bp1 aggregates that colocalize with viral ssrna and non-structural viral protein p150 suggesting a potential post-replicative role in encapsidation 162 finally the infection with sindbis virus sinv another alphavirus induces the assembly of g3bp1 aggregates which interact with nsp2 nsp3 163164 and nsp4 165 in addition it has been shown that sinv-derived vectors induce the assembly of bona fide sgs containing tia-1 eif4e and eif4g in a pkr-dependent manner 166 the flaviviridae family are composed of enveloped virions and west nile virus wnv was the first virus reported to block sg assembly li and colleagues showed that the 3 stem loop in the viral genome is able to capture tia-1 and tiar 167 in addition emara and colleagues expanded these observations to dengue virus denv-infected cells where tia-1tiar are found in rtcs 168 however the chimeric wnv w956ic which produces high levels of early viral rna activates pkr and subsequently induces the sg assembly 169 in another report xia and colleagues showed that denv-infected a549 cells were able to induce g3bp1 aggregates independently of tia-1 170 in addition a proteomic analysis found that g3bp1 g3bp2 caprin1 and usp10 interact with denv rna 171 and it was reported that g3bp1 g3bp2 and caprin1 regulate the translation of isg mrnas thus protecting denv replication from ifn-mediated antiviral effects 172 consistent with these findings tia-1 and tiar were also recruited to sites of tick-borne encephalitis virus tbev replication indeed eif2 becomes phosphorylated and sgs containing g3bp1 eif3 and eif4b are induced in tbev-infected cells 173 on the other hand the japanese encephalitis virus jev core protein was shown to sequester g3bp1 and usp10 through an interaction with caprin1 resulting in the suppression of sg formation 174 there is also evidence showing that infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv a flaviviridae pestivirus impairs the arsenite-mediated sg assembly despite the fact that bvdv n-terminal protease npro is able to interact with several rna granules components such as yb-1 igfbp2 ddx3 ilf2 and rha dxh9 175 contrasting the aforementioned flavivirus hcv modulates the sg assembly by controlling the phosphorylation of eif2 ariumi and colleagues reported evidence indicating that hcv infection delocalizes components of sgs g3bp1 atx2 pabp1 to lipid droplets lds while garaigorta and colleagues reported that hcv induces the assembly of bona fide sgs in a pkr-dependent manner this report also demonstrated that tia-1 tiar and g3bp1 play a pivotal role in several steps of the hcv life cycle 176 in addition ruggieri and colleagues observed rapid cycles of sg assembly and disassembly during the hcv infection depending on the eif2 phosphorylation state 177 they reported that while sg assembly is regulated by dsrna promoting phosphorylation of eif2 mediated by pkr sg disassembly is regulated by a rapid eif2 dephosphorylation through both protein phosphatase 1 pp1 and its regulatory subunit growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible 34 gadd34 177 recently another component of sgs ddx3 has been reported to bind the hcv 3 utr and ikk leading to its activation to induce ld biogenesis 178 however late in infection ddx3 and g3bp1 localize with the hcv core protein around lds in order to initiate viral particle assembly 179180 these observations could explain the oscillation of sg assemblydisassembly detected in hcv-infected cells 177 and how sg formation is necessary for hcv rna replication assembly and egress 176181182 the infection with cricket paralysis virus crpv a member of dicistroviridae family prevents the aggregation of rox8 and rin drosophila sg marker homologs of tia-1 and g3bp-1 respectively even in the presence of various stressor such as arsenite pateamine a or heat shock 183 although the crpv 3c proteinase is sequestered in sgs cleavage of the rox8 or rin is not detected in crpv-infected cells 183 the family coronaviridae is composed of membrane-enveloped virions and one of the most significant features of coronaviruses is the expression of downstream genes via transcription of multiple 3 nested subgenomic mrnas 184 it has been shown that both mouse hepatitis coronavirus mhv and transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev induce tia-1tiar aggregates with a concomitant increase in eif2 phosphorylation levels 185186 mhv promotes sg assembly at early times post-infection 185 while tgev induces sg assembly at later times post-infection 186 during tgev infection the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein ptb is redistributed to the cytoplasm associated with both tgev grna and subgenomic mrna sgmrna and confined to tia-1tiar aggregates 186 finally caliciviridae family is composed of non-enveloped virions and recently humoud and colleagues showed that the feline calicivirus fcv infection triggers eif2 phosphorylation without inducing sg assembly 187 this report demonstrated that the fcv viral 3c-like proteinase ns6 inhibit sg assembly by cleaving g3bp1 187 on the other hand the murine norovirus 1 mnv1 infection triggers eif4e phosphorylation to control the translational machinery of the host cell 188 but does not impair sg assembly 187 the family of orthomyxoviridae is composed of enveloped virions with a segmented negative ssrna genome 184 influenza a virus iav suppresses the assembly of sg during viral infection by expressing the non-structural protein ns1 which inhibits pkr activity 189 the ability of iav to interfere with sg assembly is reverted with the expression of an ns1-mutatant virus unable to bind dsrna 189 or by expressing an ns1-deficient iav which promote sg assembly containing retinoic acid inducible gene i rig-i-like receptors rlrs such as rig-i mda5 and lgp2 or isgs such as pkr rnasel and oas 39 the ns1-mediated inhibition of sg assembly is dependent on the interaction with the rna-associated protein 55 rap55 190 besides ns1 the nucleoprotein np and polymerase acidic protein x pa-x also contribute to block the sg assembly independent of eif2 phosphorylation 191 in addition given that ddx3 has been implicated in the sensing of viral rna to modulate ifn production and sg assembly reviewed in 180 thulasi raman and colleagues showed that ddx3 interacts with np and colocalizes in sgs upon infection with an iav mutant lacking ns1 suggesting a novel antiviral function for ddx3 192 junin virus junv is a virus belonging to arenaviridae a family of enveloped virions with a bi-segmented negative-sense single strand rna -ssrna genome that prevents sg assembly by impairing the phosphorylation of eif2 193 while the expression of junv nucleoprotein n andor the glycoprotein precursor gpc are enough to inhibit sg assembly 193 in addition arenavirus rtcs contain ribosomal proteins l10a and s6 and translation initiation factors eif4g and eif4a and g3bp1 194 suggesting a role of the sg component in the viral replication cycle vesicular stomatitis virus vsv a virus in the family rhabdoviridae induces the phosphorylation of eif2 and promotes the assembly of sg-like particles that contain tia-1 tiar pcbp2 viral replication proteins and rna but not the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 eif3 nor eif4a 195 suggesting that the sg-like structures may play a role in the vsv infection cycle members of paramyxoviridae family are composed of enveloped virions respiratory syncytial virus rsv induces sg assembly mediated by pkr and its formation enhanced rsv replication 196197 given that rsv infection forms cytoplasmic inclusion bodies ibs to mediate viral replication lindquist and colleagues observed that hur another sg component localized to ibs 196 as well as mda5 and mavs proteins suggesting a role in the suppression of ifn production 198 moreover it was recently reported that rsv sequesters phosphorylated p38 p38 p and o-linked n-acetylglucosamine ogn transferase ogt into viral ibs inhibiting the mapk-activated protein kinase 2 mk2 pathway and suppressing the assembly of sgs respectively 199 measles virus mev has the capacity to affect the innate and adaptive immune response through the accessory viral proteins v and c 200 interestingly while infection with a protein c-deficient mev efficiently induces sg assembly mediated by pkr wild-type mev does not 38 however wild-type mev induces the assembly of sgs in adar1-knockdown cells suggesting a role between the viral c protein and adar1 in modulating the assembly of sgs 38 sendai virus sev infection slightly induces sg assembly while short transcripts generated from the 3-ends of antigenome rna sev trailer rna interact with tiar to prevent the assembly of sg 201 in addition recent data showed that sev viral c protein also play a role in impairing sg assembly and ifn production 202 this study revealed that sev c-deficient recombinant 4c- infection forms sg-like structures containing rig-i and unusual viral rna species suggesting that these structures could be reminiscent of anti-viral stress granules avsgs reviewed in 180 bunyaviridae are a large family composed of enveloped virions with a tri-segmented -ssrna genome 184 the peculiarity of bunyaviruses is that they require a capped oligonucleotide which is scavenged from host mrnas to initiate its own mrna synthesis a process called cap-snatching 184 these mechanisms take place in pbs where the viral n protein binds to cap structures of cellular mrnas and the endonuclease domain of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp cleaves cap-downstream sequences in a range of 1018 ribonucleotides 203204 this capped-rna fragment is used as a primer for mrna synthesis by the viral rdrp interestingly one report with sin nombre virus snv a member of the hantaviruses genera showed that the cellular mrnas target of cap-snatching are mrnas with a premature stop codon ptc which have been addressed to pbs for degradation through the non-sense mediated decay pathway nmd 205 another report with the rift valley fever virus rvfv from the phlebovirus genera showed attenuation of the aktmtor signaling pathway which in turn increases the activity of 4ebp12 proteins leading to the arrest of cap-dependent translation 206 although sg formation would be expected upon inhibition of translation this report demonstrated that sgs are instead disassembled during rvfv infection it is noteworthy that during attenuation of aktmtor 5 top-containing mrnas including those coding for translation initiation factors these are selectively targeted to sgs notably the authors observed that 5-end sequences from top mrnas are included in rvfvs mrnas captured by the cap-snatching mechanism in pbs those data suggest that rvfv temporally induces sgs to nucleate important mrnas and in turn promote mrnas cargo from sgs to pbs where finally rvfv uses these cellular mrnas for cap-snatching indeed decay of the core of translation machinery would not represent a problem for bunyaviruses since it has been described that snv n protein is capable of replacing the entire eif4f complex eif4e eif4a and eif4g and binding the 40s ribosomal subunit thus recruiting the translation machinery to its own mrnas 207208 moreover it is widely accepted that bunyaviruses do not have a polya tail at the 3-end of their mrnas indeed there is evidence showing that bunyamwera virus bunv and andes virus andv have a 3 utr which replaces the polya tail function and interestingly the translations of those mrnas are polya binding protein pabp-independent 209210 these findings show that bunyaviruses use complex mechanisms of transcriptiontranslation that are potentially interconnected with cytoplasmic rna granules on the other hand bunyaviral proteins like other viral proteins have evolved mechanisms to inactivate pkr and inhibit the ifn response similarly to the non-structural protein ns1 from iav 211 or ns4a from dengue virus 212 studies with orthobunyaviruses hantaviruses and phleboviruses have shown that the non-structural protein from the s segment nss acts as an inhibitor of the ifn response 213214215216 as well as glycoprotein gn and the capsid n protein from hantaviruses 217218219 for example the capsid n protein from andes hantavirus andv is an inhibitor of pkr dimerization impairing its activation however the translation shut-off is not observed in hantavirus-infected cells 220 in contrast rvfv infection promotes a shut-off of global translation where nss protein mediate pkr degradation by the proteasome 221222 undoubtedly the field of cytoplasmic rna granules related to the transcription and translation of bunyaviruses already began to show interesting findings which will help to answer some ancient questions linked to the molecular mechanisms of its replication cycle as it has been thought that transcription and translation are coupled like in prokaryotic systems 223224 however the sg formation has not been addressed to date recently nelson and colleagues showed that the infection with ebola virusebov member of filoviridae family composed of enveloped virions does not trigger eif2 phosphorylation or sg formation however sg components are sequestered within viral inclusions where they colocalize with viral mrna 225 in addition viral protein vp35 not only prevents sg formation by blocking pkr activation but also disrupts sg formation independently of eif2 225 retroviruses are enveloped positive ssrna viruses which synthesize complementary dna cdna by reverse transcription that is integrated into the host chromosomal dna 184 the oncoretrovirus human t-cell leukemia virus htlv-1 causes a blockade of sg assembly mediated by the viral regulatory protein tax legros and colleagues observed that tax interacts with histone deacetylase 6 hdac6 a critical component of sg to block sg assembly 226 tax also interacts with usp10 inhibiting sg assembly and enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species 227 on the other hand human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 significantly impairs sg assembly in favor of the assembly of staufen1-containing hiv-1-dependent ribonucleoproteins 228 indeed we showed that hiv-1 gag blocks sg assembly irrespective of eif2 phosphorylation 229 in addition we reported that the interaction between the n-terminal domain ntd of the capsid domain of gag p24 and host eukaryotic elongation factor 2 eef2 are critical for the sg blockade while that eef2 depletion not only lifted the sg blockade but also resulted in impaired virus production and infectivity 229 interestingly we also reported that hiv-1 gag mediates the disassembly of preexisting sgs via an interaction with g3bp1 229 and more recently it was shown that g3bp1 binds hiv-1 unspliced mrna grna in the cytoplasm of macrophages to inhibit viral replication 230 at the same time we reported that the hiv-1 unspliced mrna grna promotes the assembly of a pre-translation initiation intermediate with ddx3 another sg component and a subset of translation initiation factors such as eif4gi and pabpc1 suggesting that these intermediates may serve to concentrate the grna and eifs in order to enhance the efficiency of polysome association 231 it is noteworthy that the mechanism associated with sgs-blockage by hiv-1 gag was dependent on the kind of stressor as such sodium selenite se causes 4ebp1-mediated mrna translational arrest and the subsequent assembly of non-canonical type ii sgs 232 recently cinti and colleagues showed that in hiv-1-expressing cells under se treatment gag interacts with eif4e reducing hypophosphorylated 4ebp1 associated with the 5 cap in order to promote the disassembly of sgs 233 in contrast to hiv-1 the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 hiv-2 induces the spontaneous assembly of sg 231 as such the hiv-2 grna recruits tiar to form a novel viral mrnp where the switch between translation to packaging could occur 231 adenovirus regulates its gene expression over the time of infection triggering an accumulation of viral late mrna in the cytoplasm 184 to prevent viral mrna degradation the early protein e4 11k binds rckp54ddx6 relocalizing it with pb components such as lsm-1 ge-1 ago2 and xrn1 to aggresomes sites where these proteins are inactivated 237 in contrast within the human papilloma virus hpv the oncoprotein e6 commands the re-colocalization of pkr in pbs suggesting an antiviral effect for these granules 46 finally during hcmv infection pb components such as dcp1a edc4 rckp54ddx6 and rap55 increased in a translation-independent manner requiring cellular but not viral rna synthesis 238  a recent report showed that rotavirus infection triggers a significant time-dependent decline of pbs components xrn1 dcp1 pan3 but not gw182 239 pan3 but not xrn1 and dcp1 undergoes accelerated turn over in response to rotavirus infection while xrn1 and dcp1 were translocated to the nucleus 239 as well as pabp 144 in the case of flaviviruses wnv and denv infections reveal a reduction in pb formation 168 indeed wnv sequesters several components of pbs such as lsm1 gw182 xrn1 ddx3 and rckp54ddx6 in viral replication factories to promote viral replication 240 furthermore it has been shown that rckp54ddx6 binds a stem-loop present in the denv 3 utr inhibiting pb formation 171 interestingly flaviviruses including yellow fever virus yfv and denv generate a subgenomic flavivirus rna sfrna as a product of grna degradation by xrn1 at pseudoknot 3 241 the sfrna and xrn1 colocalized in pbs and were essential for viral cytopathogenicity 242 in addition moon and colleagues showed that inhibition of xrn1 by sfrna-interaction results in accumulation of uncapped cellular mrna 243 likewise hcv infection relocalized pb components to viral factories close to lipid droplets such as rckp54ddx6 lsm1 xrn1 patl1 ago2 and ddx3 181182 the depletion of these components has a detrimental role over hcv replication 181182244 while rckp54ddx6 lsm1 and patl1 play a central role in hcv translation and replication 245246 however the disruption of pb mediated by depletion of rap55 does not affect hcv replication 247 together these data strongly suggest that hcv co-opts several pb components to ensure viral replication but if pbs are formed they do not have an inhibitory effect during viral infection on the other hand infection with picornaviruses such as pv and cvb3 entirely disrupts pb formation through the virally-induced cleavage of dcp1a mediated by viral protease 3c as well as the degradation of xrn1 and pan3 mediated by the proteasome 248 it has been recently shown that expression of pv-protease 2a also blocks pb formation more efficiently than protease 3c 149 however the mechanism remains unclear furthermore crpv infection only disrupts gw182dcp1 aggregates but not ago1ago2 suggesting that these pbs components could have a differential role in viral infection 183 moreover the u-rich region close to the 3-end of sinv mrnas interacts with hur generating a dramatic translocation of the host protein out of the nucleus stabilizing viral transcripts during infection and subsequently preventing the assembly of pbs 249 the negative-strand rna viruses are known to use cap-snatching mechanism to initiate its own mrna synthesis however for iav this process occurs in the nucleus while that for bunyavirus occurs in pbs mir and colleagues showed that hantavirus nucleocapsid protein n avoids the 5 cap degradation of cellular mrnas protecting them from dcp1adcp2-mediated decapping 204 in addition the interaction of n protein with 5-cap instead of eif4eeif4f allows the hantavirus transcripts to escape from pb and recruit ribosomes 207 in the case of iav the interaction of rap55 with ns1 impairs pb formation but also prevents the capture of np in the pbs 190 lastly the protein apobec3 apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 provides anti-hiv-1 activity while being a pb component that interacts with ago2 dcp1a dcp2 and ddx6 47115 however the viral infectivity factor vif protein induces apobec3 degradation preventing its incorporation into virions 47 affecting its subcellular localization degradation rates and antiviral properties 250 several groups have reported that depletion of pb components or risc components including ddx6 lsm-1 gw182 xrn1 dgcr8 dicer and drosha increases the viral production and that grna and gag protein localize to pbs 251252253 nevertheless grna localization in pbs has not been detected by others 228254 and the depletion of ago2 or ddx6 resulted in the inhibition of hiv-1 replication 255256 likewise abrahamyan and colleagues reported a dramatic decrease in the abundance of pbs around grna-foci in hiv-1-expressing cells even in cells treated with sodium arsenite 228 suggesting a relocalization of pb during the hiv-1 infection given that the events of hiv-1 capsid assembly have not been associated with pbs reed and colleagues demonstrated that assembly intermediates ais containing hiv-1 gag gagpol and vif 257 are formed by the recruitment of ddx6 and atp-binding cassette protein e1 abce1 256 on the other hand the overexpression of mov10 a putative rna helicase that associates with apobec in risc complexes and that was found in pbs can inhibit viral replication and reduce gag expression 258259 in addition it was reported that the recruitment of mov10 and apobec3g into virions is independent of localization on their pbs 260 however given the discrepancy between these reports more work is needed to elucidate the role of pbs and their components during the hiv-1 replicative cycle although significant advances have been made to understand how viruses modulate the assemblydisassembly of rna granules there are still outstanding questions that need to be addressed for example could these mechanisms be targets of new antiviral drugs what are the molecular mechanisms andor signaling pathways that transport mrnas from one rna granule to another do post-translational modifications that serve as signals to modulate the formation of rna granules exist to answer these questions several reports have helped us to comprehend the molecular biology of rna granules 261262263264265266267268269270 however further work is necessary to determine the viral mechanisms that modulate the rna granules in addition emerging evidence has related rna granules with innate antiviral immunity as part of the integrated stress response finally understanding how viruses counter anti-viral stress responses lays the groundwork for new strategies to bolster host cell immune defenses against invading pathogens  animal models for highly pathogenic emerging viruses david safronetz thomas geisbert w heinz feldmann   over the past several decades sporadic and often isolated outbreaks of diseases associated with high lethality have led to the discovery of a diverse array of novel highly pathogenic viruses belonging among others to the filoviridae arenaviridae bunyaviridae paramyxoviridae coronaviridae and flaviviridae recent examples include lujo virus which caused five known human infections in southern africa four of which were fatal and represents the first pathogenic arenavirus discovered in africa in over forty years severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus a previously unidentified tick-borne bunyavirus which emerged in china with mortality rates as high as 30 and a novel coronavirus which is responsible for severe acute respiratory distress in humans in the middle east 1 2 3 although individual agents often display a limited geographical distribution which is usually dictated by the home range of specific zoonotic reservoirs or vectors when combined they have worldwide distribution with representative high consequence viral pathogens present in most human populations the severe disease manifestations and frequently high mortality rates associated with these viruses coupled with the risk of intentional release make the development of appropriate medical countermeasures a high priority however the unpredictable nature of these infections the rare occasions of outbreaks the usually small number of affected people along with their predilection to occur in remote areas of developing countries severely hamper the evaluation of therapeutic modalities against these agents directly in humans in situations where evaluating the efficacy of medical countermeasures in humans is impractical preclinical testing of therapeutics relies on the use of animal models of disease regulating this process the united states food and drug administrations fda animal rule provides guidelines relating to study design and endpoints pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and the appropriateness of animal models which must be followed in order to utilize data generated from in vivo disease models for licensing purposes 4 the purpose of this article is to review animal models of disease for emerging viral pathogens with specific emphasis on emerging viruses associated with high mortality rates and discuss their suitability in the context of the fdas animal rule the intent of any disease model is to provide insight into the pathogenesis of disease for the purpose of designing and testing potential medical countermeasures to prevent the disease to achieve this an ideal disease model should faithfully reproduce all the hallmarks of the human condition as closely as possible in an immunocompetent animal following a realistic challenge dose via an appropriate exposure route in addition to these conditions the animal rule stipulates that in vivo models must be based on a challenge virus that is a wild-type etiological agent of human disease in general nonhuman primates nhps including cynomolgus and rhesus macaques african green monkeys and marmosets fulfill the criteria of the fda animal rule for most highly pathogenic viruses making them the gold-standard for studying pathogenesis and evaluating potential medical countermeasures although it should be noted that not all nhp species are equally susceptible to all agents logistically working with nhps is far more labor intensive than working with rodents however frequently nhp models are the best characterized model for this group of pathogens due largely to a wealth of commercially available reagents in general the pathogenesis of emerging viral diseases in humans is poorly defined and not well understood because of safety concerns autopsies are rarely conducted on fatal human cases suspected to have died from a highly pathogenic viral agent further the remote locations where cases typically occur limits the availability of sophisticated instruments required to thoroughly analyze specimens collected during the course of disease in this regard the disease course in nhps is often better defined than the human condition which it is meant to model and therefore much of our current understanding of pathogenesis for many high consequence viral pathogens has come from experimental infections of nhps on the basis of the similarity to humans nhp models provide the best predicative value as to how a specific therapeutic or vaccine will work in humans however it should be noted that even when a vaccine or therapeutic is thoroughly evaluated in nhp models there is still uncertainty regarding its efficacy in humans since for this group of agents no human vaccines or therapeutics have been thoroughly evaluated in humans table 1
 for ethical financial and safety reasons nhps are not frequently utilized as a first line model which necessitates the development characterization and use of other typically small animal models commercially available rodents predominantly mice and guinea pigs are commonly utilized as primary disease models for infectious agents including emerging viral pathogens due largely to their ease of use while these models often provide important proof of concept data used to justify further evaluation of specific medical countermeasures their use in licensing procedures is limited because many small animal disease models for emerging and highly pathogenic viruses often do not fulfill the fda requirements the main constraint for these models is the requirement of a model being developed on a wild-type etiological agent of human disease often rodent adaptation is needed to establish small animal disease models for high consequence viral pathogens not only with a large variety of commercially available reagents but also a diverse array of genetic backgrounds including the on-going collaborative cross project humanized mice and specific gene knockouts mice offer an important tool for infectious diseases research and historically have been used as a first attempt in model development while imperative to advancing our understanding of pathogenesis knockout mice especially those with impaired immunological functions are not ideal for testing therapeutics and therefore will not be discussed further similarly although suckling mice have commonly been used as an initial determination of virulence especially for arboviruses they cannot be utilized in therapeutic or vaccine studies and therefore will not be further discussed often wild-type high consequence viruses do not cause disease in immunocompetent adult mice however mouse models have been developed by serially passaging specific agents resulting in host-adapted viruses perhaps the most utilized mouse model for emerging viruses is the mouse-adapted ebola model 5 following inoculation via the intraperitoneal route mice infected with mouse-adapted ebola virus develop lethal disease which appears similar to human ebola virus infection with respect to high titer viremia tissue tropism lymphocyte apoptosis and cytokine production however mice infected with the adapted ebola virus variant lack the characteristic coagulopathy which is an important hallmark of ebola hemorrhagic fever the overall impact of the lack of coagulopathy in mice is uncertain however recent reviews of the published literature suggest the predictive power of testing therapeutic in the mouse model is rather low 5 historically guinea pigs have been utilized as secondary models following mice and before higher order models like nhps similar to mouse models the development of lethal disease models in guinea pigs often require host adaption of pathogens for example guinea pig-adapted ebola the use of guinea pig disease models is further hampered by a lack of commercially available reagents which diminishes the ability to completely characterize disease in these animals however their use as model animals is imperative especially for viral pathogens which are naturally harbored by mice or rats for example arenaviruses lassa and lujo viruses readily infect and cause disease in inbred strain 13 guinea pigs without earlier host-adaption 6 hamsters offer an intriguing option for small animal disease models and their use in infectious diseases research is undergoing a renaissance most notably in the field of emerging viral pathogens in 2001 a hamster model of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps was described in which hamsters challenged with the highly pathogenic south american andes virus develop signs of disease which accurately mimic human hps to date the hamster model of hps remains the only described disease model for this relatively rare but frequently fatal disease of humans 7 the highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses nipah and hendra lethally infect hamsters with disease manifestations similar to those observed in humans 8 importantly depending on the challenge dose of nipah or hendra virus hamsters develop either neurological or respiratory signs of disease which are the predominant disease symptoms in humans 9 the similarities in disease manifestations coupled with the overall ease of handling of these animals makes the hamster model of nipah and hendra virus disease the preferred small animal model over other described options including ferrets and cats a hamster model for ebola virus hemorrhagic fever was also recently described and although it is based on an adapted virus mouse-adapted ebola virus the disease course in hamsters appears to more closely resemble the human condition including coagulopathy 10 although to date a few studies have been published utilizing the recently described hamster model of ebola hemorrhagic fever the similarities in disease manifestations observed in hamsters and nhps suggest the results of efficacy testing of vaccines or therapeutics against ebola virus infection in the hamsters will be more predicative of results in the nhp model and presumably humans 11 it is interesting to note that compared with mice and guinea pigs the disease manifestations observed in hamster models appear to more closely recapitulate the human condition the commercially available stocks of syrian hamsters in north america were established over 60 years ago and are all offspring of three initial animals 11 despite the initial genetic bottleneck colonies of syrian hamsters are outbred though genetically and immunologically these animals are not well characterized it is plausible that hamsters are deficient in specific host responses which enhance the virulence of human pathogens for example it has been previously demonstrated that hamsters have muted inducible nitric oxide response which may increase susceptibility to specific pathogens 12 the main detraction of hamster models is the extremely limited amount of commercially available reagents currently the impetus for reagent development falls on individual laboratories specializing in hamster models however in order for these models to gain momentum and become thoroughly characterized the commercial sector will need to become involved table 2
 despite limitations of specific small animal models the data generated from them have served as an important benchmark and justification for further evaluation in higher order models currently there are no murine models described for highly pathogenic viruses which meet the animal rule requirements due largely to the need for adapting viruses to create disease models guinea pigs models are available for wild-type nonhost adapted lassa and lujo viruses and although further characterization is necessary these models should qualify as appropriate disease models the use of hamsters in this line of research is gaining interest and in the past few years models for andes virus hps nipah and hendra viruses have been comprehensively characterized and should be considered as first line models for these agents although many small animal models do not conform to the animal rule their use in evaluating vaccines and model-appropriate therapeutics should not be discounted for example with a plethora of immunological reagents the immunogenicity of vaccines can be readily evaluated in mice further these models all provide a convenient method to evaluate and compare the specific effects of antiviral agents on virus replication in an in vivo setting for ethical reasons many believe that animal experimentation must follow a hierarchical approach with experiments in mouse models leading to work in secondary bridge models including hamsters and guinea pigs and if the data warrant it final testing in an apex nhp model it is important to note that although preferable it is not always necessary to demonstrate a beneficial result of a specific medical countermeasure in two disease models the nhp will always be considered as the apex model for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics against highly pathogenic viruses and in some situations the only appropriate model for example many agents discussed in this article are known to have immunomodulatory effects in humans although proof of concept experiments could be performed in small animal models based on the vast differences in the immune systems of humans and rodents any therapy aimed at reversing or minimizing deleterious immune responses associated with specific viral agents could only accurately be modeled in nhps and possibly humanized mice under appropriate study conditions most if not all disease models even those which do not completely meet the criteria set forth by the fda can be utilized to address specific scientific questions therefore in the correct settings these models will provide valuable information regarding pathogenesis andor therapeutic or vaccine efficacy however it is time to reconsider the tiered approach to research in laboratory animals and instead of focusing on proof of concept studies in lower order animals consider the predictive power of specific models in order to generate useful data for the purpose of licensing compounds and vaccine for human use papers of particular interest published within the period of review have been highlighted as of special interest of outstanding interest

the question whether or not viruses are alive has caused considerable debate over many years yet the question is effectively without substance because the answer depends entirely on the definition of life or the state of being alive that is bound to be arbitraryeugene v koonin and petro starokadomskyy 1
 the first edition of this book published 7 years ago includes the following ill-conceived statement viruses lack key features that distinguish life from nonlife they depend entirely on host cells for replication they do not partake in metabolism and do not yield energy they cannot adjust to changes in their environment ie no homeostasis nor can they respond to stimuli most scientists consider viruses to be mobile genetic elements that travel between cells much as transposons are mobile genetic elements that travel within a cell 2 as nonliving organisms dependent entirely on host cells for their continued existence viruses have done extremely well for themselves 3 every class of living organism hosts viruses viruses are literally everywhere in our environment and are the most abundant life form in the oceans in terms of numbers of organisms 4 the number of different species of viruses seems to far exceed the species of eukaryotes bacteria and archaea 5 6 a single class of newly characterized aquatic viruses the megaviridae appears to have more species and more phylogenetic diversity than all of the bacterial and archaean species found in ocean water 7 viruses have been on earth for a very long time 8 9 the evidence suggesting that viruses preceded the appearance of other classes of living organisms is based in part on the observation that some archaeans bacteria and eukaryotes have homologous genes that code for capsid proteins such as would be derived from a class of viruses the simplest explanation for homology for a viral-type gene in all extant cellular forms of life is that an ancient gene came from viral species that lived at a time that preceded the emergence of newer forms of life 10 over the aeons retroviruses have had a chance to insert lots of dna fragments into eukaryotic species at least 8 of the human genome is composed of fragments of rna viruses 11 12 13 glossary capsid over the past 7 years the evidence and the arguments supporting viruses as living organisms has won a great deal of support consider the following points 
viruses replicate and create virocells
 viruses employ the replicative machinery that they find in host cells manufacturing viral assembly plants in the process after infection host cells forego many of their normal functions and the newly synthesized viral products produce disturbances in cellular physiology so-called cytopathic effects the host cells become something more akin to a viral factory than to eukaryotic organisms and these new living entities are referred to as virocells indicating that the virus has created its own form of cellular life glossary virion 
viruses exhibit chemical structural and physiological diversity
 viruses display great diversity in their range of hosts habitat size genes mechanisms of infection and capsids unlike eukaryotes viruses have a range of genomic types which include double-stranded dna single-stranded dna double-stranded rna positive sense single-stranded rna negative sense single-stranded rna single-stranded rna with a reverse transcriptase and double-stranded dna with a reverse transcriptase viruses of each type breed true meaning that a virus of any type will replicate to produce viruses of the same type thus the types of viruses determined by their genomic structure and replicative modes can be organized as biological classes 
viruses do not lead a totally intracellular life
 viruses are accused of having no life outside of their host cells it has long been assumed that extracellular viral existence is relegated to long-term storage a lifeless viral genome double-wrapped in a protein capsid and an envelope that is mostly purloined from the cell membranes of a former host it has been recently demonstrated that some viruses enjoy life outside of their hosts the acidianus tailed virus can be cold-stored at room temperature for long periods without changing their morphology when the temperature rises they undergo a structural transformation forming bipolar tails 14 this tells us that viruses can react to external stimuli and perform biological activities much as free-living organisms do 
viruses evolve and speciate
 it has long been accepted that there are different distinctive species of viruses the definition of a viral species as suggested in 1985 is essentially the same definition as any other species of living organism an evolving gene pool 15 despite the high mutation rate of viral genomes there is sufficient stability in their genomes particularly in genes that code for constitutive proteins to establish a phylogenetic lineage for classes of viruses by examining relatively conserved genomic sequences 16 presumably much of the stability of viral species is imposed by host organisms how so all viruses must replicate within a host and the process by which a eukaryotic cell is infected and transformed into a virocell is very complex viruses are forced to adapt some level of host preference and must fine-tune all their functions to the available conditions within the host 17 thus for viruses to successfully replicate they must evolve into relatively stable species and this is what we observe when we study viruses glossary evolvability 
virus speciation yields phylogenetic lineages ie descendant families
 in 2017 the ictv international committee on taxonomy of viruses recognized 9 orders 131 families 46 subfamilies 803 genera and 4853 different viral species 18 the number of known viral species 4853 is thought to represent a tiny fraction of the total number in the next section viral phylogeny we will discuss the various concepts and methods that have led to a rudimentary phylogeny of the viruses 
viruses participate in the evolution of eukaryotic organisms
 some of the greatest evolutionary leaps among eukaryotic organisms can be attributed to genes taken from noneukaryotes eg mitochondria and chloroplasts the viruses have also contributed to eukaryotic evolution and its fair to say that if it were not for viral genes you would not be reading this book it would be left to some octopus or insect to finish out the chapter specifically at least four major advancements can be attributed to retroviral genes inserted into ancient eukaryotic genomes1the acquisition of adaptive immunity in class gnathostomata the jawed vertebrates and every descendant class 19 glossary adaptive immunity2the acquisition of the placenta in class theria ie the placental mammals plus the marsupials which have a rudimentary placenta3the maintenance of pluripotent stem cells important in embryogenesis is achieved in part with transcripts of stem cell-specific long terminal repeat retrotransposons themselves derived from retroviral sequences 20 21 glossary transposon4in class mus containing the common house mouse an muerv-l retrovirus capsid gene domesticated to code an antiviral factor 22 23
 we should note that the adaptation of retroviruses does not always have purely beneficial consequences for the individual members of a species oncogenes many of which have a retroviral origin are genes that play a key role in driving cells toward a cancer phenotype oncogenes are highly conserved genes indicating a beneficial role for the species otherwise they would not be conserved nonetheless oncogenes clearly have a deleterious effect on some individuals within the species ie by causing cancer one particularly striking example occurs in a polycythemia strain of mice carrying the friend murine leukemia virus all the mice of this particular strain have polycythemia a condition characterized by a sustained increase in the number of circulating red blood cells it seems that the resident virus codes for a nonfunctional env viral envelope gene the protein coded by the degenerate env gene serves as a mimic for the normal erythropoietin gene of the mouse causing an increase in red cell production ie polycythemia 24 25 participating in eukaryotic evolution and accounting in no small way for the generation of new species and new strains of species as viruses certainly do are itself a biological function and another indicator of viral life 
life is what we choose to make of it
 are viruses living organisms or are they simply sequences of nucleic acid that have the wherewithal to move from cell to cell much of the debate focuses around the definition of life 1 26 how we define life is somewhat arbitrary and we can certainly produce a definition of life that includes the viruses if that is what we choose theres no urgency to the matter once our robots become self-replicating well need to address the definition of life anew when that time comes perhaps robots will take the lead and create a definition for life that includes organic viruses and software viruses 
who is the better class of organism virus or human
 for a moment lets put our tongues in our cheeks and pretend that we are viruses 8 as viruses what would we think of humans and other eukaryotic organisms would we be willing to accept humans as fellow living organisms or would we point to the following list of disqualifiers to conclude that humans just dont make the grade1humans cannot replicate they merely procreate
 in an effort to strengthen their species gene pool humans undergo a strange mating process in which the chromosomes of both parents are hopelessly jumbled together to produce an offspring that is unique and unlike either the father or the mother in doing so humans miss out on the replicative process performed with the greatest enthusiasm by every virus self-replication is one of the fundamental features of life because humans cannot replicate themselves they barely qualify as living organisms at least this is what the viruses think2humans do not react in a manner that preserves the survival of their own species
 humans have created a variety of weapons that are fully capable of wiping out all of human life viruses generally respect one anothers right to co-exist3we can thank viruses for the existence of humans
 viruses are constantly donating dna to humans and humans have used this dna to evolve 12 in point of fact if there were no viruses there would be no dna replication no adaptive immune system no placentas and no humans 27 we also see that viral species acquire genes from their hosts and that viruses retain these genes as they evolve presumably the acquisition of host genes confers some survival advantage upon the virus nonetheless viruses are a self-sufficient class of organism and no specific instance comes to mind wherein a viral species depended on a human gene for its survival4humans may have descended from viruses
 nobody really knows much about the earliest forms of life and there is plenty of room for conjecture its quite feasible that the earliest genetic material consisted of sequences of rna and that these rna molecules moved between the earliest forms of cells if this were the case then the earliest genomes were essentially rna viruses and this would place humans as direct but distant descendants of viruses there is a current theory among many competing theories that the first eukaryotic nucleus was a giant virus that was not totally successful in transforming its proto-eukaryotic host into a virocell 8 28 29 a hybrid giant virusvirocellproto-eukaryote may have stabilized and replicated to form an early nucleated cell the first eukaryote5humans serve viruses not vice versa
 we are taught to think of viruses as fragments of nucleic acids wrapped by a capsid ie the virion to a virus extracellular existence must be akin to a state of suspended animation virions come back to life when they invade a eukaryotic cell and create a virocell a living organism consisting of the hijacked eukaryotic cell whose nuclear machinery is redirected to synthesize viral progeny if every eukaryotic cell is conceptualized as a potential virocell then every eukaryotic species is a potential slave owned by the viral kingdom the viruses probably think theyre doing us a favor frankly most of the cells in a metazoan body lead a vegetative existence doomed to a fully differentiated postmitotic and short existence viruses re-animate postmitotic cells and create a thriving center for viral life from a lackluster population of eukaryotic cells as virocells 
how is it that you keep mutating and can still be the same viruschuck palahniuk in his novel invisible monsters
 if we accept that viruses are living organisms on equal footing with bacteria achaeans and eukaryotes then we must accept the challenge of creating a classification of viruses based on phylogeny descent from evolving ancestral species and abandon viral groupings based solely on phenetics ie based on physical similarities there is a problem with the notion of a purely phylogenetic classification of viruses it may be impossible glossary phenetics lets take a look at a few of the impediments to establishing a viral phylogeny that is comprehensive testable and credible1large number of known and unknown viral species
 simply put the greater the number of species the more work is required to prepare a taxonomy every new species requires a certain irreducible amount of study and if new species are being discovered at a rate that exceeds our ability to describe and classify known species then the list of unassigned species will become infinitely long over time2lack of any accepted concept of a root virus
 the classification of cellular organisms is built on the premise that each of the major classes ie bacteria archaeans and eukaryotes has a root or founder class with a hypothesized set of class-defined features from which all subclasses descended in the case of viruses we really have no way of describing the ancestor of all extant viruses and we do not have a strong reason to assume that all the viruses we see today came from any single class of viruses furthermore we define viruses as being obligatory parasites requiring one of the major classes of cellular organisms for a host if this were the case then viruses as we have come to define them could not have existed prior to the existence of host organisms to parasitize hence if viruses existed prior to the emergence of cellular life then the root of the viruses was not a virus insofar as they could not have parasitized cellular hosts if the root of the viruses was not a virus then it may have been almost anything and we could not rule out the existence of multiple root organisms accounting for the widely varying versions of viral genomes that we observe today games of phylogenetic logic are harmless fun but they illustrate how it is impossible to create a top-down classification of viruses if we know nothing about the biological features that would define the top class3high rate of mutation in viruses
 for the most part viruses do not repair their genomes a notable exception is the megavirus cafeteria roenbergensis 30 presumably we will find that other megaviruses have dna repair pathways but the small simple viruses have rates of mutation in dna and rna with no mechanism to repair the damage this means that genome-damaged viruses have two choices to die or to live with and replicate their mutations consequently viral genomes tend to degenerate quickly producing lots of variants species mutability is particularly prevalent among the rna viruses eg influenza virus newcastle disease virus and foot and mouth disease virus mutational variations of a virus seldom produce a new species instead variations produce diversity in the viral gene pool of the species if new mutations do not produce an alteration in the specificity of host organisms or in the construction of the virocell then the variant viral replicants resulting from mutations will usually preserve their membership in the same viral species glossary virocell still all those viral genomic variants complicate the job of the viral taxonomist basically the high rate of mutation in viruses yields lots of genomic variation among viral populations making it easy for bioinformaticians to detect species diversity where none exists we can easily imagine a situation wherein new species are discovered and old species are declared extinct because we simply do not have the time and manpower to carefully examine every genomic variant for the structural and physiologic features that determine its correct taxonomic classification bioinformaticians off-handedly refer to the variant genomes resulting from mutations and replication errors as quasispecies 31 for the traditional taxonomist who is trying to create a simple phylogenetic classification of viruses the vague concept of quasispecies must be particularly exasperating4multiparental lineage of viruses
 viral reassortment is a process wherein whole segments the equivalent of viral chromosomes are exchanged between two viruses infecting the same cell viral reassortment has been observed in four classes of segmental rna viruses bunyaviridae orthomyxoviridae arenaviridae and reoviridae following reassortment a new species of virus may appear and this new species will contain segments of two parental species this poses a serious problem for traditional taxonomists who labor under the assumption that each new species has one and only one parental species 32 it is the uniparental ancestry of biological classifications that accounts for their simplicity and for the concept of lineage wherein the ancestry of any species can be computed from an uninterrupted line of classes stretching from the species level to the root level when a species has more than one parent then its lineage is replaced by an inverted tree the tree branches outwards with each class reaching to more than one parent class iteratively producing a highly complex ancestry wherein the individual classes have mixed heritage bioinformaticians have no problem creating multiparental classifications and have used them to organize and model for biological processes eg pathways and molecular components eg genes and proteins 33 they call such constructs ontologies and have an assortment of computational tools to construct deconstruct and analyze complex representations of class relationships the pros and cons of single-parent class relationships versus multiparent class relationships have been argued at great length in the bioinformatics literature and cannot be fully explored here 34 35 suffice it to say that no matter how many species we must accommodate a simple classification will always provide an ordered set of class relationships that can be fully absorbed by the human mind ontologies are highly complex often uncomputable and chaotic eg providing different analytic solutions with repeated analyses of the same data 34 it remains to be seen whether the ontologic model can be usefully applied to viral classifications 
hope for a viral classification based on phylogeny
 despite these four listed impediments to viral classification there is reason to hope that there will one day be a complete set of viral classes and a simple set of lineages that connect each viral class to a defined root organism a sense of hopefulness is based in no small part on observations of the physical world despite our sense that anything is possible in the vastness of space we see an awful lot of sameness throughout the universe wherever we aim our telescopes we see galaxies most of which are flat and spiral often having about the same size and composed of the same objects stars planets gas dust and black holes a small set of physical laws impose stability everywhere at once and the result is the somewhat repetitious universe in which we live likewise despite the large number of species living on our planet they are all variations of a few common themes that can be encapsulated under a simple classification about a half billion years ago the early metazoan classes ie animals evolved at a rapid rate producing dozens of body plans that we can examine in ancient shale deposits this period which lasted about 40 million years or so is known as the cambrian explosion the same body plans that evolved during the cambrian explosion account for nearly all of the classes of animals that live today this is to say that since the cambrian no new body plans have gained entry into the metazoan world much has been written about the cambrian explosion much of it focused on why metazoan body plans are so few and why the world lacks newly evolved entries 36 we have observed as a general rule of biology that no matter how easy it may be for a class of organisms to speciate there always seems to be a limited number of general classes into which all the species can be assigned it is as though the evolutionary process itself confines classes to a smaller and smaller repertoire of available designs when we think that we have encountered a class of life that is too complex for simple classification we are usually proven wrong for example in the first two-thirds of the 20th century the classification of bacteria was considered a hopeless task insofar as bacteria of different classes were known to exchange dna among themselves in a general process known as horizontal gene transfer if bacteria were constantly exchanging genetic material then it seemed that every bacteria was an amalgam of other bacteria and could not be sensibly classified be that as it may bacteria were found to have a convincing phylogenetic order based on the ancestral lineage of highly conserved species of rrna that distinguished the bacteria from archaeal bacteria and further distinguished the classes and subclasses of bacteria 37 38 in the case of viruses that mutate at a high rate that exchange large pieces of their dna that extract dna from their host organisms and that produce an uncountably large number of diverse species one might think that a classification would be an impossible task not so instead we are finding fundamental molecular motifs that can be used to classify viruses into biological groups that share phylogenetic origins 39 16 for example despite the sequence variations that occur in rapidly mutating viruses scientists are finding that the three-dimensional folds of protein molecules are conserved and that viruses can be grouped into the so-called fold families which can in turn be grouped into fold super families that preserve phylogenetic relationships among viral lineages 39 among the retroviruses it has been shown that viral ancestral lineages can be determined by looking at inherited variations in the so-called global genomic properties eg translational strategies motifs in gag and pol genes and their associated enzymes 16 we shouldnt be surprised that viruses like every other class of organism falls into a rather limited set of phylogenetic classes because all viruses are parasitic we can see why all viral species are constrained to evolve in a manner that maintains their host compatibility 17 a demonstration of host-specific constraints on viruses is found by examining the specificity of viruses for the highest classes of organisms virus infections are found in class archaea class bacteria and class eukaryota but there is no instance in which any single class of viruses is capable of infecting more than one of these classes of cellular organisms furthermore within a class of cellular organisms there are only rare instances of classes of virus that can infect distantly related subclasses for example there are virtually no viruses that can infect both class animalia and class plantae rare exceptions are claimed 40 furthermore as the host evolves so must the virus hence we might expect to find ancestral lineages of viruses that shadow the lineage of their host organisms the relatively recent discovery of ncldvs nucleocytoplasmic large dna viruses popularly known as giant viruses has greatly expanded our notion of viral existence 45 46 the life of an ncldv is not much different from that of obligate intracellular bacteria eg rickettsia the ncldvs with their large genomes and complex sets of genes have provided taxonomists with an opportunity to establish ancestral lineages among some of these viruses 45 46 at this time the classification of viruses is somewhat crude anything you choose as a classifying principle fails to biologically unify the subclasses for example if you classify viruses by their genomic molecules ie dna or rna single strandedness or double strandedness you will find that subclasses with the same genomic type will have dissimilar structures envelope size shape proteins and capsid when we list viruses based on method of contagion by persistence within host ie acute chronic latent or persistent toxicity lytic immunogenic or by target cell specificity no consistent taxonomic correlation is found though we cannot as yet classify viruses strictly by their evolutionary lineage we can usefully group viruses based on the physical characteristics of their genomes the baltimore classification divides viruses into seven groups based on whether their genome is dna rna single stranded or double stranded the sense of the single strand and the presence or absence of a reverse transcriptase here are the classes of the pathogenic viruses this classification though nonphylogenetic in concept has the great advantage of being comprehensive every known virus can be assigned to a group within the baltimore classification

group ii single-stranded dna

group iii double-stranded rna

group iv positive sense single-stranded rna

group v negative sense single-stranded rna ssrna

group vi single-stranded rna with a reverse transcriptase

group vii double-stranded dna with a reverse transcriptase

 it is worth repeating that when we use the baltimore classification or any alternate viral classification for that matter we must grudgingly accept the fact that biologically relevant features of grouped viruses will cross taxonomic boundaries consider the arboviruses arbovirus is a shortened name for arthropod borne virus the arboviruses fall into several different groups of viruses the principle vectors of the arboviruses are mosquitoes ticks mosquito-borne arboviruses are members of class bunyaviridae group v flaviviridae group iv or togaviridae group iv tick-borne arboviruses are members of class bunyarviridae group v flaviviridae group iv or reoviridae group iii over 500 arboviruses infecting a variety of animals have been described 47 the arboviruses organized by their transmission vectors as shown below cross multiple viral groups

 it would seem that we do not know enough about the origin and phylogeny of the different classes of viruses to create a true classification wherein viruses of a class share a common set of inherited relationships there is however hope for a future in which viruses can be organized by phylogenetic principles highly innovative work in the field of viral phylogeny is proceeding from a variety of different approaches including inferring retroviral phylogeny by sequence divergences of nucleic acids and proteins in related viral species 16 tracing the acquisition of genes in dna viruses 41 and dating viruses by the appearance of viral-specific antibodies in ancient host cells 12 because viruses evolve very rapidly it is possible to trace the evolution of some viruses with precision over intervals as short as centuries or even decades 39 42 43 44 it should be noted that before the advent of ribosomal sequence analysis and as recently as the early 1970s bacterial phylogeny was considered a hopeless field 37 bacteria were grouped by morphology nutritional requirements and enzymatic reactions eg hemolysis coagulase etc without much attention to phylogenetic relationships the field of viral phylogeny is quickly catching up with the phylogeny of living organisms

 members of class herpesviridae are commonly known as herpesviruses these viruses produce acute disease characterized by lytic ie cytopathic effects in infected cells and latent disease characterized by recurrences of disease sometimes spanning the life of the host after cells are infected by virus particles the viral genome migrates to the host nucleus where replication and transcription of the viral genes occurs after a latent phase viruses may precipitate a lytic phase manifesting as clinical disease the recurring disease may be clinically distinct from the initial infection eg chicken pox the initial varicella virus infection is followed decades later by shingles some of the herpesviruses are dna transforming viruses the human herpesviruses are epstein-barr virus herpes simplex viruses varicella virus and human herpesviruses 6 7 and 8 and cytomegalovirus epstein-barr virus infects almost all adults its persistence makes it one of the most prevalent human pathogens it manifests acutely as mononucleosis a pharyngitis accompanied by lymphocytosis increases lymphocytes in the peripheral blood with morphologic alterations in infected lymphocytes splenomegaly and hepatomegaly may occur the generalized symptoms of the disease particularly fatigue may extend for months or longer and some cases of mononucleosis recur epstein-barr virus is a dna transforming virus and accounts for several cancers including hodgkin lymphoma burkitt lymphoma nasopharyngeal carcinoma and central nervous system lymphoma a role for the virus in several autoimmune diseases has been suggested herpes simplex type 1 causes cold sores and herpes simplex types 2 causes genital herpes both diseases may recur after initial infection as mentioned herpes virus varicella-zoster causes chickenpox on first infection and herpes zoster also known as shingles on reactivation herpesvirus simiae also known as b virus infects macaque monkeys without causing severe disease in rare circumstances humans may become infected with this virus from the monkey reservoir human infection typically results in a severe encephalopathy human herpesvirus type 6 hhv6 and type 7 hhv7 produce exanthem subitum also known as roseola infantum and as sixth disease readers should not confuse sixth disease with fifth disease fifth disease also known as erythema infectiosum and slapped face disease is caused by parvovirus b19 these diseases take their names from an historical diagnostic dilemma faced by pediatricians who regularly encountered six clinical syndromes of childhood rashes four of the childhood rashes had known etiologies the fifth and sixth rashes both caused by organisms that were not yet identified were referred to as fifth disease and sixth disease subsequently the viral causes of these two diseases were discovered but the numeric names held human herpesvirus type 8 hhv8 is a dna transforming virus that can cause kaposi sarcoma primary effusion lymphoma and some forms of castleman disease kaposi sarcoma is a cancer characterized by focal proliferations of small blood vessels occurring most often in the skin immunosuppressed patients eg transplant recipients who are carriers of the latent hhv8 virus may develop kaposi sarcoma within a few months of immunosuppression interestingly if immunosuppression is halted the kaposi sarcoma may regress 49 it is presumed that sustained viral replication is necessary for early tumor growth cytomegalovirus infects about half of the world population with most individuals suffering no ill effects once infected the virus usually persists for the life of the individual in a minority of cases particularly among immune-compromised individuals eg organ transplant recipients and aids patients and newborns the virus may produce severe neurologic disease the disease is known as cytomegalic inclusion body disease and as the name suggests cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusion bodies characterize actively infected cells when the virus is transmitted transplacentally by mothers infected during their pregnancy the newborn may suffer developmental damage to the brain and other organs fig 71

 members of class orthopoxvirus produce disease characterized by pustules of the skin and lymphadenopathy the smallpox virus is remarkable for its extremely narrow host range humans only the virus infects the skin and the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract where it produces a pustular weeping and rash in the respiratory mucosa the rash interferes with breathing if the disease becomes hemorrhagic the prognosis worsens smallpox is reputed to have killed about 300 million people in the 20th century prior to the widespread availability of an effective vaccine smallpox has been referred to as the greatest killer in human history its mortality rate was 3035 which is significantly less than some of the hemorrhagic viruses eg ebola virus group v has a mortality rate of nearly 90 no doubt death rates climbed because the disease was easily communicable via aerosols fomites bodily fluids or direct contact with patients with rash currently smallpox has the distinction of being the only infection of humans which has been declared eradicated it should be noted that there are a few closed societies for which the status of smallpox in the population is unknown eg north korea aside from the remarkable success of vaccination eradication was no doubt made possible because smallpox has no animal reservoir at this time vaccination is not routinely performed and is reserved primarily as an antiterror measure for personnel entering a zone where there is a bioweapons threat variola minor is a virus closely related to variola major that produces a milder disease these diseases are known by various names including alastrim cottonpox milkpox whitepox and cuban itch infection with variola minor is thought to produce cross-resistance to variola major and vice versa vaccinia virus is the laboratory-grown poxvirus of obscure heritage that does not precisely correspond to known viruses that reside outside the laboratory or clinic ie not quite cowpox not quite variola vaccinations with vaccinia virus have been known to produce in rare cases a variety of clinical disorders ranging from vaccinia localized pustular eruptions to generalized vaccinia to progressive vaccinia to vaccinia gangrenosum and to vaccinia necrosum other conditions associated with vaccinations include eczema vaccinatum and postvaccinial encephalitis smallpox vaccination aside from eradicating mankinds greatest killer may have heretofore unrecognized public health value the number of currently known pathogenic organisms their variant subtypes their ability to mutate and the emergence of newly encountered pathogens make it impossible to develop vaccines for every organism that infects humans consequently vaccine experts are searching for vaccines that confer immunity partial or full for several different pathogens or for several variants of a single pathogen 50 an interesting development in this field is that the smallpox vaccine may confer limited protection against hiv human immunodeficiency virus infection both viruses enhance their infectivity by exploiting a receptor ccr5 on the surface of white blood cells this shared mode of infection may contribute to the cross-protection against hiv that seems to come from smallpox vaccine it has been suggested that the emergence of hiv in the 1980s may have resulted in part from the cessation of smallpox vaccinations in the late 1970s 51 buffalopox cowpox and monkeypox produce diseases in animal reservoirs and rarely infect humans human infections occur from close contact with infected animals and manifest much like smallpox but milder members of class parapoxvirus infect vertebrates particularly sheep goats cattle and red squirrels orf virus causes sore mouth or scabby mouth disease of sheep and goats humans though rarely infected may develop painful hand sores a similar condition can occur in humans who handle the udders of cows infected with milkers nodule virus class molluscipoxvirus contains one species infectious in humans molluscum contagiosum virus molluscum contagiosum is an eruption of wart-like skin lesions that are easily diagnosed on histological examination by their distinctive cellular inclusions so-called molluscum bodies there are no known animal reservoirs infection is spread from human to human treatment is not always necessary as individual lesions will regress within two months however auto-inoculation of the virus may produce new skin lesions thus prolonging the disease members of class yatapoxvirus infect primates in equatorial africa infections can spread to humans by insect vectors tana poxvirus produces a pock-forming skin infection with fever and lymphadenopathy in infected humans ie like a mild form of smallpox the yaba monkey tumor virus produces histiocytomas in monkeys histiocytomas are proliferative lesions of fibrous tissue that yield tumor-like nodules these virally induced histiocytomas in monkeys grow rapidly following infection and then regress over the ensuing month 52 yaba monkey tumor virus and yaba-like disease virus like all members of class yatapoxvirus are considered potential human pathogens

 class mimiviridae discovered in 1992 occupies a niche that seems to span the biological gulf separating living organisms from viruses members of class mimiviridae are complex larger than some bacteria with enormous genomes by viral standards exceeding a million base pairs and encoding upwards of 1000 proteins the large size and complexity of class mimiviridae exemplifies the advantage of a double-stranded dna genome dna is much more chemically stable than rna and can be faithfully replicated even when its length exceeds a billion base pairs a double-stranded dna genome can be protected by dna repair enzymes and by external modifications to the dna structure class megaviridae is a newly reported october 2011 class of viruses related to class mimiviridae but larger 45 as previously noted the life of a mimivirus is not very different from that of obligate intracellular bacteria eg rickettsia the discovery of class mimiviridae inspires biologists to reconsider the nonliving status relegated to viruses and compels taxonomists to examine the placement of viruses within the phylogenetic development of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus is a possible human pathogen some patients with pneumonia have been shown to have antibodies against the virus 53 though myxoma virus is not a human pathogen it seems appropriate to include some mention of this member of class poxviridae due to the role humans have played in its history myxoma virus produces a fatal disease myxomatosis in rabbits the disease is characterized by the rapid appearance of skin tumors myxomas followed by severe conjunctivitis systemic symptoms and fulminant pneumonia death usually occurs in 2-14 days after infection in 1952 a french virologist hoping to reduce the rabbit population on his private estate inoculated a few rabbits with myxoma virus the results were much more than he had bargained for within two years 90 of the rabbit population of france had succumbed to myxomatosis european rabbits introduced to australia in the 19th century became feral and multiplied by 1950 the rabbit population of australia was about 3 billion seizing upon the myxoma virus as a solution to rabbit overpopulation the australians launched a myxoma virus inoculation program in less than 10 years the australian rabbit population was reduced by 95 54 nearly 3 billion rabbits died a number very close to the number of humans living on the planet in the mid-1950s this plague on rabbits was unleashed by a committee of humans who decided that it was proper to use a lethal rabbit virus as a biological weapon without commenting on the moral implications of animal eradication efforts it is worth noting that rabbits are not the only mammals that can be exterminated by a pathogenic virus humans should take heed

 parvovirus b19 is the agent that causes fifth disease so named because the diseases was the fifth type of common childhood exanthem among six rashes listed in textbooks until the 1980s the cause of this fifth listed exanthem was unknown so it came to be known as fifth disease other names for fifth disease are erythema infectiosum and slapped face disease human herpesviruses 6 and 7 cause the sixth childhood rash sixth disease the rash of fifth disease results from an immune response of the host to the virus particles essentially fifth disease is an allergic phenomenon and not the direct cytopathic effect of the virus infection by parvovirus occurs from contact usually via respiratory droplets with actively infected hosts the virus is known to infect humans and dogs serologic evidence indicates that at least half of the human population has been infected with parvovirus b19 members of class parvoviridae characteristically grow in rapidly dividing host cells using host processes to support their own replication the target cells for the parvovirus b19 are the dividing precursor erythroid cells another name for parvovirus b19 is erythrovirus b19 indicating the target cell for the virus in the active stage of infection huge amounts of virus are produced death or dysfunction of the target hematopoietic blood precursor cells can lead to a transient pancytopenia ie anemia of all blood cell lineages in rare cases aplastic anemia may occur in which most of the precursor erythroid cells are destroyed leading to a massive decline in circulating mature forms when aplastic anemia occurs it usually occurs in individuals who have a concurrent condition that requires an excessive production of blood cells to maintain the normal blood profile of mature cells these conditions include autoimmune hemolytic anemia sickle cell anemia and inherited blood dyscrasias that increase the fragility of red blood cells or that decrease the life span of red blood cells basically a coinfection with parvovirus b19 is the last straw for bone marrows that are barely keeping pace with the bodys demand for erythrocytes the intense viremia that occurs in parvovirus b19 infection and the small size of parvovirus particles may predispose to cross-placental transmission occurring in some cases of infection in pregnant women though rare parvovirus may cause miscarriage or hydrops fetalis fluid accumulation in the fetus with anemia bocavirus has been associated with some cases of respiratory disease and diarrhea in young children though it is rarely detected in healthy persons there is indication that it can occur in up to 9 of pediatric patients hospitalized with lower respiratory infections 55 bocavirus should not be confused with bocas virus a type of coronavirus group iv sen virus sen-v is a newly discovered single-stranded nonenveloped dna virus that has been found in the blood of donors and recipients of transfusion blood 56 in addition another group ii virus tt virus also known as transfusion transmitted virus or torque teno virus has been isolated from transfusion blood tt virus is currently a suspected hepatitis virus at this time the pathogenicity of both sen-v and tt viruses are in doubt hence neither virus is included in the list of group ii virus pathogens

 aside from rotavirus there are three genera that infect humans of which two produce disease the orothoreoviruses infect vertebrates including humans but no disease has been linked to the infections the two disease-producing infectious genera are coltivirus and orbivirus colorado tick fever is endemic in the rocky mountains in contradistinction to rocky mountain spotted fever a rickettsial infection that has no restricted affinity for the rocky mountains coltivirus takes its name from the disease ie colorado tick fever virus as the name suggests colorado tick fever is carried by a tick in this case dermacentor andersoni and produces a fever the fever is often accompanied by myalgia headache and photophobia in a small percentage of children with colorado tick fever encephalitis may follow orbiviruses have been implicated in several rather obscure fever-associated conditions kemerovo fever found in western siberia and transmitted by ticks orungo fever found in central african and transmitted by mosquitoes and changuinola fever found in northern south america and transmitted by sand flies of class phlebotomus human rotavirus

 the group iv viruses have a positive sense rna genome positive sense rna can be translated directly into protein without a dna intermediate and without creating a complementary rna strand to replicate its genome though a complementary rna strand is required the positive rna strand serves as a template for an rna-dependent rna polymerase yielding a complementary rna strand to form a dimer with the template strand the double-stranded rna subsequently serves as the template for a new positive sense genome the positive-strand rna genome is independently infectious for most group iv viruses this means that in the absence of a capsid envelope or enclosed proteins the rna molecule when inserted into a cell is capable of using host cell machinery to construct additional viruses such viruses can be extremely small in an experiment conducted in the late 1960s sol spiegelman and his coworkers developed a method by which smaller and smaller viral rna molecules could be isolated that were capable of replicating if provided with a specific rna-dependent rna polymerase and substrate nucleotides a minimalist infectious viral genome was eventually selected which was only 220 nucleotides bases in length 58 as discussed in the overview we know very little about the phylogenetic relationship among viruses consequently we subclassify the group iv viruses based on structural similarities symmetry of capsid presence of absence of a viral envelope and size there are six subclasses of the group iv single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses picornaviridae togaviridae coronaviridae hepeviridae caliciviridae flaviviridae and astroviridae as expected within each class viruses share structural similarities but there are no properties other than the defining property of a sense single-stranded rna genome that extends to all six classes of the group iv viruses for example some classes have envelopes ie flaviviridae togaviridae coronaviridae and others do not ie caliciviridae picornaviridae hepeviridae and astroviridae

 single-stranded rna viruses are grouped into viruses with a positive sense negative sense and ambisense positive sense rna viruses are those that have the same direction as human mrna positive sense virus genes can be translated to yield protein with the same cellular machinery that translates mrna these are the group iv viruses negative sense rna is complementary to mrna negative sense rna must be converted to positive sense rna or to dna before it becomes biologically available for translation or replication respectively the group v viruses are single-stranded negative sense rna viruses that use an rna-dependent rna polymerase packaged within the virus particle to produce positive sense rna within the host cell the group vi viruses are single-stranded negative sense rna viruses that use an rna-dependent dna polymerase so-called reverse transcriptase packaged within the virus particle to produce a complementary strand of dna the synthesized strand of dna is subsequently used as a template to yield a double-stranded dna molecule that contains the genetic information from the viral genome the ambisense single-strand rna viruses contain at least one positive sense rna segment admixed with negative sense rna genomically an ambisense virus is a concatenation of a group iv virus positive sense single-stranded and a negative sense virus nevertheless transcription in ambisense viruses is coupled with translation of the viral genome to a complementary rna strand a process that is characteristic of the group v viruses 61 consequently the ambiviruses are currently included in the unassigned subclasses of the group v viruses among the group v rna viruses pathogenic to humans there is one assigned class of viruses class monongavirales which includes the following subclasses bornaviridae filoviridae paramyxoviridae and rhabdoviridae the remaining class v viruses belong to unassigned subclasses ie with no named taxonomic superclass or unassigned genera ie belonging to no assigned class the unassigned viruses include the ambisense viruses the unassigned classes are arenaviridae bunyaviridae and orthomyxoviridae deltavirus is an unassigned genus the group v viruses are numerous and it would be unproductive to describe each virus in detail the following discussion will include viral disorders that typify their class or that highlight recent findings that might have been omitted from previously published virology texts a listing of the group v viruses along with their associated diseases and clinical conditions arranged by subclass is provided at the end of this section

hepatitis viruses several of the viruses that cause hepatitis are provided with names that are easy to remember but impossible to reconcile as a coherent biological class these are hepatitis a b c d e f and g pathogenic viruses that attack any particular organ need not all belong to the same biological class and the named hepatitis viruses are no exception belonging to groups iv v and vii in addition not all pathogenic viruses that infect the liver belong to the named hepatitis viruses yellow fever virus which has killed millions of people throughout history is a group iv hepatitis virushere is a list of the named hepatitis viruses

phenetics an approach to classification wherein objects are grouped together based on a shared set of physical features in this book we make the argument that phenetics is an improper approach for biological classifications insofar as two distantly related species may share a physical similarity eg ability to fly or aquatic life without having any close ancestral relationship without having a close genetic relationship and without sharing many metabolic pathways as the biologist george gaylord simpson put it individuals do not belong in the same taxon because they are similar but they are similar because they belong to the same taxon 69transposon also called transposable element and informally known as jumping gene the name transposable element would seem to imply that a fragment of the genome ie the transposable element physically moves from one point in the genome to another this is not the case what actually happens in the case of class ii transposons is that a copy of the dna sequence of the transposon is inserted elsewhere in the genome resulting in the sequence now occupying two different locations in the genome in the case of class ii transposons the dna sequence of the transposon is translated into rna then reverse-transcribed as dna and reinserted at another location likewise resulting in two of the same sequence in two locations in the genome 70 you can see how transposable elements might bloat the genome with repeated elements some transposons are the ancient remnants of retroviruses and other horizontally transferred genes that insinuated their way into the eukaryotic genome because transposon dna is not necessary for cell survival the sequences of transposons are not conserved and mutations occurring over time yield degenerate sequences that no longer function as retroviruses a role for transposons in the altered expression of genes in cancer cells has been suggested 71virion the infective form of a virus outside the host cell viruses can be thought of as having two alternating forms the virion and the virocellvirocell the name given to a host cell that has been commandeered by a virus to devote its cellular machinery to the mass production of virus particles when we think of viruses a living organisms it is best to envisage the virocell which consists of a viral factory built from the wreckage of the host cells and not the virion which is simply a vehicle for transporting a virus safely from host to host
  hantaviruses in the americas and their role as emerging pathogens brian hjelle fernando torres-prez   emerging pathogens cause new or previously unrecognized diseases and among them emerging zoonotic diseases are a major concern among scientists studying infectious diseases at different spatial and temporal scales 12 changes in biotic and abiotic conditions may alter population disease dynamics and lead to the emergence of zoonotic infections 36 during the last decades several outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have occurred affecting both purely-local and worldwidepandemic involvement of human populations among the conspicuous examples are influenza a ebola virus hepatitis c virus severe adult respiratory distress sars coronavirus and human immunodeficiency virus which challenge prevention and control measures of public health systems 7 in the americas the recent outbreak of pandemic influenza a subtype h1n1 became a major target for control due to its rapid spread and uncertainties in virulence and transmissibility yet vaccine availability was limited when significant activity occurred in advance of the traditional influenza season 8 however in the last century outbreaks of several viral-related diseases have emerged or re-emerged involving arenaviruses and dengue viruses and more recently hantaviruses and the expansion of the geographic range of west nile virus among zoonotic diseases small mammals are hosts of several pathogenic rna viruses especially arenaviridae and bunyaviridae hantavirus 911 hantavirus infections became a concern in the americas after the description of an outbreak of acute respiratory distress occurred in the four corners area in 1993 12 the newly recognized disease hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hcps or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was linked to infection by the newly-discovered sin nombre virus snv and the rodent peromyscus maniculatus deer mouse was identified as the reservoir 13 however hantavirus infections have a much longer history a review of ancient chinese writings dating back to approximately 960 ad revealed descriptions closely resembling hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs the syndrome caused by old world hantaviruses 14 during the twentieth century cases of acute febrile disease with renal compromise were described from several eurasian countries and japan often in association with military engagements 15 hfrs as a distinct syndrome however was first brought to the attention of western medicine in association with an outbreak that occurred among united nations troops during the korean conflict between 1951 and 1954 where more than 3200 soldiers were afflicted 16 it took more than two decades until the etiologic agent hantaan virus htnv was isolated from the striped field mouse apodemus agrarius detected in part by the binding of antibodies from patient serum samples to the lung tissues of healthy wild-caught field mice 1718 the virus was later found to represent the type species of a new genus hantavirus of the family bunyaviridae although it was later apparent that the first hantavirus to be isolated was the shrew-borne thottapalayam virus 19 the categorization of hantaviruses as belonging to the family bunyaviridae is due in part to the consistent presence of three rna genomes that are circularized in vivo as a result of the presence of terminal complementary nucleotides that help fold the genome into a hairpin morphology first described for the uukuniemi phlebovirus 1920 table 1 is a list of the predominant serologically distinct pathogenic hantaviruses many other named genotypes are described but such other pathogenic forms are generally closely related to andes or in some cases sin nombre virus hantavirus discovery continues at a rapid pace after the identification of snv in 1993 approximately 43 genotypes have been reported in the americas alone figure 1 with 20 of those associated with clinical cases of hcps most hantaviruses worldwide have been identified in murid or cricetid rodents of the subfamilies murinae arvicolinae neotominae and sigmodontinae as their main reservoir but the discovery of hantaviruses in insectivores soricidae talpidae on at least three continents 2122 shows that the genetic diversity of hantaviruses is far higher than expected during virus maturation the precursor form gpc is processed using a membrane-bound protease into gn and gc a cleavage that occurs and appears to be signaled after the conserved peptide signal waasa at the c-terminal of gn 24 although the two proteins can be expressed independently through transfection they can be retained in the wrong cellular compartment er or aggresome they thus must be co-expressed to allow them stability so that the two can be assembled correctly in the golgi 252729 a number of activities and properties have been identified for the hantavirus envelope glycoproteins including some features that are suspected to be involved in the pathogenicity of the disease-causing serotypes a possibility that has engendered experimental attention the glycoproteins are the known or presumed ligands for at least two distinct cellular receptors the 3 integrin chain and decay accelerating factor or daf 3031 with gc1qrp32 also identified as another potential entry receptor 32 comparisons with the tick-borne encephalitis virus e protein led tischler et al to consider the gc glycoprotein as a potential class ii fusion protein perhaps imparting fusion activity to the virion and this hypothesis has gained support in other studies 3334 additional activities have been identified with or claimed to be related to gn for many of these studies an underlying premise has held that there are differences between the glycoproteins of pathogenic hantaviruses relative to viruses in the genus that are dubbed to be non-pathogenic while it is true that it has not yet been possible to link prospect hill virus phv to human disease the absence of evidence for its pathogenicity should perhaps not be equated with the evidence of its absence one might only consider that the level of disease eg lethargy fever proteinuria and azotemia associated with infection of nonhuman primates by phv is not significantly different from that recorded for nonhuman primate models using the known-pathogen puumala virus puuv 3536 for the purpose of this discussion we will presume that apathogenic hantaviruses are indeed apathogenic while some studies have suggested that gn glycoproteins are directed more rapidly into the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway than are apathogenic forms others have interpreted differences in the handling of gn glycoproteins across hantavirus species by the ubiquitin-proteosomal system as independent of pathogenicity 3739 some investigators have directed their efforts toward identifying a differential capacity either kinetic or in absolute magnitude in the ability of pathogenic and apathogenic hantaviruses to elicit an interferon response in cells one premise that emerges is that apathogenic forms would tend to induce an earlier innate response that would render it more likely that the virus would be quickly cleared or rendered less competent in its replication so as to blunt any pathological response in the host 4042 the anti-hantavirus innate response can in some cases be attributed to viral interaction as a ligand of tlr-3 but not in others and in endothelial cells it appears not to require more than the viral particle itself even when introduced in replication-incompetent form 4344 proteins and mrnas prominently induced by hantaviruses include mxa and ifit-1 isg-56 and others including some with known or suspected anti-viral activity those hantaviruses often highly pathogenic strains that fail to induce a potent antiviral response are suspected or presumed to have a more potent interferon-pathway antagonism mechanism relative to other viruses a mechanism that acts positively to prevent an effective innate response from forming at least early in infection 4245 yet some instances are reported wherein highly pathogenic hantaviruses such as snv are also able to induce expression of interferon-stimulated gene mrnas even very early in infection with isg proteins as expected taking longer to appear in the cell 44 anti-interferon activities have also been attributed to the nss protein that may be elaborated in cells infected by serotypes that encode this protein 46 other investigators have examined the activities of hantavirus glycoproteins and other proteins that might themselves directly affect some aspects of the pathogenic progression associated with hantavirus infection of humans such as vascular permeability changes while early attempts to directly cause increases in permeability of endothelial monolayers with viral particles or viral infection were largely disappointing hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating veg-f-induced endothelial permeability 4748 the shorter 50-kd nucleocapsid or n protein is a structural component of the viral nucleocapsid along with the genomic viral rna segments as an rna-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments with high affinity 4950 it limits the access of the rna to host nucleases and helps to render viral replication a closed process within the cytoplasm it also acts as a peripheral membrane protein as does the l protein 51 an activity that could play a role in its presumed but not yet demonstrated function as matrix 52 until recently it had not been appreciated that n has a wide variety of other activities some of which can be linked not only to fundamental requirements of replication but also to the interference with an array of the intracellular processes of the normal cell thus an interaction between the amino terminus of the hantavirus n protein and the cellular protein daxx has been proposed with the suggestion of potential pro-apoptotic consequences 51 n is also reported to interact with actin microfilaments and the sumo-1 protein 5354 using reporter-gene based assays connie schmaljohn and her colleagues have reported that hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by nf kappa b nf-b the effects on nf-b expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide lps 55 in the cytoplasm of infected cells n protein can be found in cellular p bodies where it sequesters and protects 5 caps it may locate the caps through its interaction with dcp1 a key constituent of p bodies during hantavirus infection the viral rnas become concentrated in p bodies through their interaction with n and dcp1 the n protein demonstrates preferential protection of mrnas engineered to prematurely terminate their encoded protein in comparison to native mrnas 56 n protein has been increasingly linked to viral replication and translation sometimes in previously unanticipated ways it is among a growing family of diverse viral proteins that can serve as a nonspecific rna chaperone an activity that should facilitate the l polymerases access to vrna for transcription and replication in that it can transiently dissociate misfolded rna structures 57 some of n proteins effects on translation might not immediately be recognized to be adaptive in nature it can replace the entire eif4f translational initiation complex simultaneously presenting the ribosome with a replacement for the cap-binding activity of eif 4e binding to the 43s pre-initiation complex as does eif 4g while replacing the helicase activity of eif 4a which is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order rna structure 5658 these three factors normally work together to achieve translational initiation in p bodies n proteins ability to bind at high affinity to capped native cellular oligoribonucleotides along with its activity in protecting capped rnas from degradation likely facilitates the access of capped oligonucleotides for use in transcriptional initiation by l polymerase cap snatching trafficking of n for viral assembly classically n protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location widely considered to be the golgi 27 the n proteins of hantaviruses are found in association with particulate fractions and confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies have shown that n tracks along microtubules but not with actin filaments 52 the ultimate destination for n for its assembly into viral particles is the golgi and it traffics there via the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate complex ergic also known as vesicular-tubular cluster 52 a dominant negative inhibitor dynamitin associated with dynein-mediated transport reduced ns accumulation in the golgi later studies suggested that the specific dependence on microtubular transport is specific to old world hantaviruses such as htnv but that the new world hantavirus andv is instead associated with actin filaments 59 however recent data indicates that microtubular transport is indeed utilized for the new world hantavirus snv 60 the continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells specifically is among the several factors that make 3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses it is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte the virus seeds local endothelium where the first few infected cells give rise ultimately to a primary viremia a process that appears to take a long time for hantavirus infections 6263 by the time that secondary viremia emerges the agents of the more severe forms of hfrs and hcps have begun to achieve sufficient mass as to induce through pamp-prr interactions and other means the expression of proinflammatory cytokines 64 for hcps that expression favors the pulmonary bed and lymphoid organs yet for unknown reasons spares the retroperitoneum and in general the kidney in hfrs the situation is reversed and yet it is often not appreciated that the expected preferential tissue tropism of hfrs-associated viruses and their hcps-associated counterparts for the renal and pulmonary beds respectively is not as one would predict through the manifestations of the two diseases local elaboration of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators is considered to be a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms with those abnormalities sometimes culminating in shock and death yet it is not hypoxemia due to the prominent pulmonary edema that leads to death in most fatal cases of hcps but rather intoxication of the heart by as-yet-undefined mediators that leads to the low cardiac output state and the associated shock syndrome 6465 it is tempting to speculate that mediators produced in the lung in connection with the inflammatory infiltrate can percolate through the coronary circulation with minimal dilution in hcps a disadvantageous consequence of the close anatomic juxtaposition of the two organs thus at least three classes of potential mechanisms some overlapping and all certainly nonexclusive of the others could be presumed to underlie the pathogenesis of hcps these include 1 innate immune mechanisms the nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamp with the pattern recognition receptors prr of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified the prototypical htnv appears to be recognized by tlr-3 43 such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of hla-dr in dendritic cells 66 and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells 67 2 direct viral effects the observed correlation between viral load and disease severity leaves the possibility open that hantavirus particles or rna can themselves have toxic effects on cells or on signaling some investigators have favored direct viral toxicity acting through the inhibition of endothelial cell barrier function as an explanation for much of the capillary leak although there is widespread agreement that multiple mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis likely operate simultaneously in the affected patient 68 a potentially important clue toward the mechanism by which hantavirus infections deplete blood platelets and in some cases cause hemorrhagic manifestations was advanced by the recent discovery that pathogenic hantaviruses are able to recruit platelets to adhere to endothelial cell surfaces with 3 integrin used as a critical binding element 69 3 pathogenic effects caused by the activities of specific viral macromolecules we have reviewed some of the activities associated with the gn gc and n virally-encoded polypeptides in previous sections testing models of pathogenesis can be done more effectively when there is an animal model that mimics key aspects of the disease there is no such model that closely mimics hfrs but animal models exist for both the asymptomatic carriage of puuv and snv by their native carrier rodents the bank vole myodes glareolus and the deer mouse p maniculatus as well as a syrian hamster model using andv or the related maporal virus from venezuela for which an hcps-mimetic disease is observed 7073 the andv-syrian hamster model has a number of features in common with the human disease as well as some differences unlike the neurologic diseases that have been possible to elicit with htnv the hamster model for hcps appears to be caused by capillary leak that results in pulmonary edema and the production of a pleural effusion with exudative characteristics typically the hamsters die between 11 and 14-d post-inoculation reflecting a slightly accelerated incubation period in comparison to human infections as with human hcps the microscopic examination of the lung reveals abundant fibrin deposition thickened alveolar septa and viral antigen expressed abundantly in the microvascular endothelium andv-infected hamsters fitted with physiologic monitoring devices exhibited diminished pulse pressures tachycardia and hypotension that appear to closely mimic the shock that is believed to be the proximate cause of demise in patients who succumb to hcps 6574 compared to the human disease andv-infected hamsters exhibit exceptionally high titers of live andv in their tissues with much of the viral replication occurring in hepatocytes which are spared in the human disease titers of live andv in some cases exceed 108g whereas hantavirus isolates from human tissues have been notoriously difficult to obtain despite the universal occurrence of mildly-elevated hepatic enzymes in patients with hcps hepatic enzymes do not appear to be present at elevated levels in the blood of diseased hamsters even immediately before death 75 the protracted incubation period associated with hantavirus disease gives the host considerable time to mount a mature immune response against the virus thus in contradistinction to infections of comparable severity and related symptomatology associated with arenaviruses and filoviruses hantavirus infections of humans are associated with antibody responses of significant titer by the time symptoms commence despite this observation it appears to be possible that natural variation in individual neutralizing antibody responses among patients with snv infections can be linked to disease severity suggesting that administration of antiviral antibodies could prove effective therapeutically 76 in the case of andv infection new evidence has emerged indicating that the apparent clearance of the virus from the blood does not result in the complete removal of antigenic stimulus by the virus suggesting that the virus may persist perhaps in some as-yet undetermined immunologically privileged site 77 a role for t cell-mediated pathological responses in hfrs and hcps has been the source of speculation for a variety of reasons the severity of snv-associated hcps may have made it more apparent that the onset of pulmonary edema tachycardia and hypertension seemed to be all but universally temporally associated with the appearance of a spectrum of highly-activated cells of the lymphoid lineage in the peripheral blood cells with a close morphologic similarity to these immunoblasts were detected in the congested heavy lungs of patients who came to autopsy as well as in lymphoid organs and in the portal triads 637880 these observations led to speculation that some component of hantavirus pathogenesis could be linked to the appearance of antiviral t cells that could stimulate or contribute to the appearance of a storm of mediators and the associated capillary leak phenotype subsequent studies have borne out the expectation that a significant fraction of the immunoblast population in patients with hcps are t cells with specificity for specific class i hla-presented epitopes of viral antigens including gn gc and n 778183 presumably the antiviral activities of such cells manifested in part through their elaboration of mediators in the affected interstitium can contribute to the endothelialcapillary leak that lies at the heart of hantavirus pathogenesis because early cases of hcps often came to autopsy it became possible to examine necropsied tissues for expression of cytokines the study by mori et al 1999 revealed high relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines including tnf il-1 il-6 providing evidence in favor of a cytokine storm model for pathogenesis 64 the authors believed based on the morphology of cytokine-secreting cells that both monocytes and lymphocytes were contributing to the production of cytokines that proinflammatory mediators are found in elevated levels in the plasma as well as the renal interstitium of patients with acute hantaviral illness has been recognized for some time as well 8485 while diagnosis of hcps as well as hfrs is best accomplished with igm serology in the acute stage of snv infection rt-pcr can also be used if blood cells or blood clot are used instead of plasma or serum where sensitivity even using nested pcr primers drops to about 70 8688 in a facility at which many cases of hcps are treated the university of new mexico medical center in albuquerque a diagnostic service has long been offered in which the patients hematologic findings are analyzed to establish the probability that a patient has hcps the combination of thrombocytopenia elevated abundance of immunoblast lymphocytes left-shifted polymorphonuclear cell population without strong morphologic evidence for their activation and elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit values is highly specific for hcps and allows clinicians the ability to put presumptive-hcps patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo which is believed to have saved many patients from a lethal outcome 89 human infection by hantaviruses is thought to follow contact with secretions or excretions produced by infected rodents in the united states 538 human infections by hantavirus were reported through late december 2009 90 with new mexico arizona and colorado exhibiting the highest case-loads while the prototypical central american hantavirus in central america was rio segundo virus of reithrodontomys mexicanus from costa rica the first human disease appeared some years later in panama where choclo virus chov arose as the etiologic agent and is believed to be responsible for all known cases of hcps the fulvous pygmy rice rat oligoryzomys fulvescens has been identified as the rodent reservoir 91 in panama the first cases of hcps albeit with little or no evident cardiac involvement were reported in 1999 and since then 106 human infections have occurred with a 26 mortality rate 92 serosurveys of mammals in mexico and costa rica have found anti-hantavirus antibodies 9396 and seroprevalences ranging between 06 to 16 in human populations were reported despite the absence of known hcps cases 97 in south america hcps cases have been indentified in argentina bolivia brazil chile paraguay and uruguay and evidence for human exposure to hantaviruses have also been reported in venezuela 98 and per 99 in southern south america andv is the main etiologic agent with cases in chile and argentina reported since 1995 in chile 671 cases of hcps due to andv have occurred during the period 20012009 100 since 1995 more than 1000 hcps cases have been reported in argentina 101 in brazil approximately 1100 hcps cases have been identified between 1993 and 2008 102 case-fatality ratios in those three countries have been similar ranging from 30 argentina 36 chile and 39 brazil hantavirus infections occur more frequently in men than women although the malefemale ratio is highly variable for example panamanian communities showed a ratio of 55 men to 45 women 103 while in chile the ratio is more biased to males 71 104 in the paraguayan chaco the male-female ratio approaches 50 105 in north america by december 2009 63 of case-patients were males 90 all ethnic and racial groups seem to be susceptible to hantavirus infections and the differences between certain groups as indigenous and non-indigenous are more likely correlated with the type habitat where the population resides eg rural versus urban areas in fact rural communities account for the highest hantavirus incidences overall and are therefore at higher risk 92105111 although the importance of peridomestic settings as a major area of exposure has also been emphasized 112113 the main mechanism by which humans acquire hantavirus infection is by exposure to aerosols of contaminated rodent feces urine and saliva 114115 this can occur when humans reside in areas in close proximity to those that rodents inhabit live in areas infested with rodents or when rodents invade human settings which are more frequent in rural habitats there is a long history of human co-existence with rodents raising questions about the apparent recent increases in hantavirus-related illnesses especially hcps other than an apparent association with el nio southern oscillation enso events in some regions 116117 the recent increases in incidence of hcps do not seem to follow a readily-defined temporal or spatial pattern however some landscape features such as habitat fragmentation or human-disturbed areas may influence rodent population dynamics and impact viral incidence 118121 despite the stochasticity associated with contraction of hantavirus infection certain scenarios have been recognized as posing higher risk human activities in poorly ventilated buildings that aerosolize particulates that are then inhaled ie cleaning shaking rugs dusting are frequently identified among patients admitted for hcps 11122 outdoor activities are thought to convey lower risk due to lability of hantaviruses to uv radiation and the presumed tendency to be dispersed in wind although certain environmental conditions seem to maintain the virus for longer periods outside its natural host allowing for indirect transmission 123 an alternative but uncommon route of virus transmission is by rodent bites 124126 field workers handling mammals are potentially at higher risk of exposure with hantavirus infections although when quantified through serosurveys the absolute risk appears rather slight 127 a new study in colorado suggests the possibility that a rodent bite may have been the proximate vehicle for outdoor transmission of snv 128 which re-emphasizes the use of personal protective equipment during field work activities 129 as a particular case within hantaviruses person-to-person transmission has exclusively been documented for the south american andes virus 130135 the identification of this transmission route has been made using both molecular tools and epidemiological surveys but the mechanism of interpersonal transmission is not well established recent findings show that family clusters and specifically sexual partners share the greater risk of interpersonal transmission although sexual transmission per se can be neither inferred nor refuted presently 130135 interestingly andv may also be shed by humans through other biological fluids such as urine 136 illustrating the particular properties that differentiate this virus from other hantaviruses although interpersonal transmission seems to be unique for andv viral rna of puuv has been detected in saliva of patients with hfrs and some patients with snv-hcps have viral rna in tracheal secretions 88137 hantaviruses in the americas are naturally hosted by rodents muridae and cricetidae as well as shrews soricidae and moles talpidae figure 1 three shrew and one mole species have been reported to host hantaviruses and their pathogenicity for humans remains unknown 22138139 at least 15 rodent species have been identified as carriers of different pathogenic hantaviruses with some south american genotypes such as castelo do sonhos cdsv or hu39694 only identified after human infections figure 1 hantaviruses typically show high species-specificity and no intermediate host 140 however some hantavirus genotypes have been described in the same rodent species such is the case of playa de oro orov and catacamas catv identified in oryzomys couesi 141142 or maporal mapv and choclo chov hosted by o fulvescens 91143 in north america both muleshoe and black creek canal hantaviruses have been detected in geographically-distant sigmodon hispidus 144145 also one hantavirus genotype eg juquitiba-like virus may be carried by more than one rodent species o nigripes oxymycterus judex akodon montesis another example is laguna negra virus lanv which after being identified in calomys laucha 146 has also been reported in c callosus 147 the rapid increase in the discovery of new hantaviruses and the identification of their hosts does not seem likely to end soon as new small mammal species are screened 95 this subject is complicated by continued controversy in the criteria for the classification of distinct hantaviruses 148149 which is also tied to host taxonomic classification and taxonomic rearrangements cross-species transmission is a major process during spread emergence and evolution of rna viruses 6150 particularly within hantaviruses spillover to secondary hosts are increasingly identified as more extensive studies are performed 151156 for example andv is the predominant etiologic agent of hcps in south america and o longicaudatus the main rodent reservoir spillover in at least four other rodent species that co-occur with the reservoir have been identified with abrothrix longipilis showing the second higher prevalence to andv-antibodies and there is presently no question that the virus is extremely similar genetically between the two host rodents 157158 in north america spillover of bayou virus bayv may have occurred from the main reservoir o palustris to s hispidus r fulvescens p leucopus and b taylori 159161 hantavirus spillover is more likely to occur with host populations inhabiting sympatric or syntopic regions 151162 and cross-species transmission would presumably have greater chances of success if the host species are closely related 163 an interesting exception is found between oxbow virus oxbv and asama virus asav in which a host-switch process seemed to have occurred between mammals belonging to two families talpidae and soricidae likely as a result of alternating and recurrent co-divergence of certain taxa through evolutionary time 138 hantaviruses are horizontally transmitted between rodents and are not transmitted by arthropods unlike other viruses of the family bunyaviridae spillover infection to nonhuman mammals usually results in no onward or dead-end transmission but if humans are infected may result in high morbidity and mortality 122164 during the spring of 1993 an outbreak of patients with hcps due to snv occurred in the four corners states resulting in more than 60 case-fatality among the initial cases many involving members of the navajo tribe 12121 in panama an outbreak was reported during 19992000 in los santos and 12 cases where identified with three fatalities 165166 this represented the first report of human hantavirus infections in central america in south america the first largest identified outbreak occurred in the chaco region in northwestern paraguay during 19951996 seventeen individuals were identified with snv antibody elisa or were antigen ihc positive out of 52 suspected cases 167 major outbreaks due to andv occurred in 1996 in southern argentina 131134 in southern chile clusters of patients presented with hantavirus illness in 1997 158 in brazil the first outbreak was identified in the brazilian amazon maranho state in 2000 and involved small villages that resulted in a 133 prevalence of those tested 398 total residents 168 the factors that trigger hantavirus outbreaks are still poorly understood probably because they result from several interacting biotic and abiotic features whose key parameters are difficult to model however the use of new modeling approaches that involve geographical and environmental features seem to be promising in predicting potential hantavirus outbreaks andor areas of higher risk 169172 because hantaviruses are known to be directly transmitted from infected to susceptible hosts the first natural approach is to relate outbreaks to the ecology of the viral hosts hantavirus transmission and persistence in rodent populations depends on several factors that interact to affect ecological dynamics of the host which in turn is strongly influenced by the behavioral characteristics of individual rodent species to landscape structure and environmental features 173174 viral transmission depends on contact rates among susceptible hosts and despite the prevailing notion that a higher density increases encounters and hence secondary infected hosts contrasting patterns relating rodent population size and virus prevalence can be found 175 in addition it has been shown that snv transmission follows a contact heterogeneity pattern where individuals in the population have different probability of transmitting the infection 176 the understanding of viral transmission proves to be far more complex when species other than the main reservoir host are incorporated in the model in fact recent studies have shown that higher hosts species diversity is correlated with lower infection prevalence in north america for p maniculatus 177 in central america for o fulvescens reservoir of choclo virus and zygodontomys brevicauda reservoir of calabazo virus 178 and in south america for akodon montensis reservoir of jabora virus 162 contact rates vary according to the spatial distribution of populations and seem to be strongly influenced by landscape structure for example snv prevalence in p maniculatus was higher in landscapes with a higher level of fragmentation of the preferred habitat 179 in addition certain properties of the landscape such as elevation slope and land cover seem to be useful in detecting areas with persistent snv infections and therefore thought to be refugial areas where the virus can be maintained for years 169 changes in the natural environment of reservoir species such as forest fragmentation and habitat loss may alter population abundance and distribution and lead to hantavirus outbreaks as observed in the azurero peninsula of panama 118119 also differences in the microhabitat including overstory cover may lead to differences in the ecological dynamics within populations and affect the rate of exposure to the virus 180 differences in hantavirus infections through contrasting landscapes in the latitudinal span have been found in rodent populations of o longicaudatus in chile suggesting that humans are differentially exposed to the virus 107181 rodent population dynamics are affected by seasonal changes of weather and climate 182183 in the case of the enso-associated outbreaks a complex cascade of events triggered by highly unusual rains in the precedent year have been postulated to result in an increase of primary production and rodent densities also increasing the likelihood of transmission of the virus to humans but it has proved difficult to precisely demonstrate the suggested intermediate events such as increased rodent densities in the increased caseload 116121184 in south america effects of climate change and hantavirus outbreaks have not been well studied despite the knowledge that several rodents species that are reservoirs of emerging diseases have dramatically been affected by events like el nio 185 changes in host population dynamics are also affected by seasonality which may lead to disease outbreaks when processes that equilibrate rodent populations from season to season are interrupted 186 viral emergence may continue to be promoted as human-introduced changes continue to increase in the environment at different geographical scales human incursions into previously uncultivated environments may lead to new contacts between rodent reservoirs and humans increasing the likelihood of contracting infections 187 these changes may also alter rodents population structure and dynamics and interspecies interactions creating conditions that may lead to viral outbreaks viral establishment in new hosts and emergence of hcps 102162 even with seemingly slight ecological disturbance to the virus-host system 188 certain pathophysiologic characteristics including thrombocytopenia and shock of hantavirus diseases of humans bear substantial similarity to the hemorrhagic fevers induced by other viruses such arenaviruses filoviruses and flaviviruses despite sharing essentially no sequence similarities therewith such observations raise questions about whether such commonalities in pathogenesis are chance similarities of phenotype or instead report the presence of common molecular mechanisms among the viruses in this review we discuss the general properties discoveries and epidemiologyecology of the new world forms of pathogenic hantaviruses and also seek to identify some of the characteristics of the viral macromolecules and immunologic mechanisms that have been proposed as potential direct mediators of the pathogenic events that characterize the human disease hcps while it is unlikely that expression of any particular viral protein or rnas in isolation can be relied upon to replicate key phenotypes of infection by the complete virus some of the findings have been sufficiently consistent with what is known of the pathogenesis in vivo that they offer plausible first-pass leads in the search for therapeutic targets we look forward to the mechanistic revelations that will follow the inevitably expanded usage of powerful methods such as deep sequencing ever-more advanced imaging and microscopic methods and animal models that can at last be said to be close mimics of human hantavirus disease  contextualising the 2019 e-cigarette health scare insights from twitter wasim ahmed xavier marin-gomez josep vidal-alaball   electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes are handheld battery operated devices that heat liquid and deliver an aerosol that simulates smoking they may also be referred to as electronic nicotine delivery systems ends in certain literature in conjunction with the increased use of these devices 1 a health concern has emerged linking the use of e-cigarettes with pulmonary illness 234 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the us food and drug administration fda are investigating a multistate outbreak of lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarette or vaping products 56 all of this information is generating widespread debate which we can be framed as a health scare 78 similar to other scares such as the current covid-19 scare as well as the h1n1 virus swine flu trans fats ebola and the mobile phone usage health scare 910 health scares can be described as campaigns that attempt to alert the public of a particular substance or activity that can lead to a negative effect on health 11 tobacco can be traced back thousands of years and was grown as a crop from around 50003000 bc led by the communities in the andes south america ram nathan balraj 2017 native americans would cultivate and smoke tobacco for medicinal and ceremonial purposes tobacco eventually spread around other continents and eventually all around the world 12 henceforth it had many thousands of years to become ingrained within human culture and society in the early years of the 20th century cigarette and nicotine marketing through print television and radio only helped to boost sales in recent years and after the dangers of traditional forms of smoking e-cigarettes have risen in popularity the tobacco industry is argued to be one of the most profitable and deadly industries that exists with cigarette retail values in 2013 hitting  722 billion and there being 57 trillion cigarettes in circulation 12 in todays digital world it is possible for consumers and the general public to offer their views and opinions across social media platforms one of the most open platforms to converse about public health is twitter where it is also possible to extract tweets for academic research purposes previous research has utilised twitter to identify public views key discussions content and stakeholders related to health scares 131415 twitter can be used to study and understand the context of the current e-cigarette health scare twitter is an important platform to study because it has the potential to shape mainstream news because tweets can be embedded in online news stories as well as highlighted in traditional media such as tv or radio amplifying their reach health scares need to be studied in the context in which they occur and one method of studying them is through the use of twitter 1016 this is because twitter provides citizens with a platform that permits the rapid sharing of public views and opinions and allows these views to become viral and highly shared regardless of their factual truth henceforth this is an important and significant area to study moreover the debate around the safety of e-cigarettes is likely to be of interest to a wide variety of stakeholders our study sought to examine an influential time-point related to e-cigarettes from 2019 when there was a heightened interest in e-cigarette safety we identified a gap in knowledge as no previous empirical work has conducted an analysis of twitter data related to this time point moreover this is an important topic to study because it aims to build an understanding of how social media may play a role in the global dissemination of amateur and unfounded speculation against accepted medical research this type of research is increasingly important as we find medical studies being socially challenged by various social media networks at an increasing rate we utilised a mix of social network automated text and link analysis in order to identify network structures influential users the most utilised words and hashtags  we sought to address the following research questionswhat was the overall shape of the network structure on twitter related to the e-cigarette debatewhat key themes andor topics emerged when twitter users conversing about e-cigarettes on twitterwho were the key stakeholders and what types of content were they sharing on twitter related to the e-cigarette debate a further objective of the study was to review existing literature in order to develop a flowchart for consumers to assess the safety of e-cigarettes by analysing public views from twitter and by drawing up current advice from health authorities and domain experts this flowchart is likely to be of interest to consumers and public health agencies across the world we retrieved data from twitter using nodexl related to the time when the first study was published linking cancer and vaping in mice nodexl utilises the search application programming interface api we retrieved data using the keywords ecigarette or e-cig or ecig or vaping and we were able to retrieve a sufficient amount of tweets the tweets in the network were tweeted over the 17 h 37 min period from monday 07 october 2019 at 2120 coordinated universal time utc to tuesday 08 october 2019 at 1458 utc the graph represents a network of 14912 twitter users we utilised social network analysis which is an established method of studying social media content and a complete overview of network shapes and structures can be found elsewhere 17 within our network graph there was an edge for each replies-to relationship in a tweet an edge for each mentions relationship in a tweet and a self-loop edge for each tweet that was not a replies-to or mentions the graph was directed and vertices were grouped by cluster using the clausetnewmanmoore cluster algorithm the graph was laid out using the harelkoren fast multiscale layout algorithm figure 1 below shows a social network analysis of tweets from early october 2019 which relates to a time period when the first academic study was published linking vaping to cancer in mice figure 2 is zoomed into group 2 and labels the influential users within the group from group 3 onwards we have abbreviated the word group to g the network graph highlights that there were different clusters of discussion taking place on twitter during this time with two large groups and several smaller groups indicating a number of communities that had emerged related to this topic the ten largest groups were labelled there was also a sizeable isolates group group 1 which indicated that a number of twitter users were tweeting about e-cigarettes without mentioning or replying to other twitter users in figure 2 we zoom into group 2 in which discussions were formed around a number of influential user accounts such as president donald trump the world health organisation and fox news alongside this network graph we were also able to identify the most frequently used words hashtags websites and most influential users in the network which are described below table 1 below displays the most frequently occurring words during this time period it highlights that mentions of e-cigarettes were made in conjunction with the scientific work that linked them to cancer  the most frequently occurring words in group 1 are displayed in table 2 below here it can also be seen that many of these words centred on the news story linking vaping to cancer the most frequently occurring words in group 2 the second largest cluster of twitter users are highlighted in table 3 below it is important to note that the word-count numbers listed above would also contain hashtags that used those words  these words in group 2 highlighted the polarisation on twitter as certain hashtags were against the idea of any restrictions on vaping by governments and twitter users expressed this through the use of the hashtag wevapewevote whereas those against e-cigarettes would use hashtags such as vapeban the most frequently occurring hashtags overall are summarized in table 4 below these hashtags highlighted division and polarisation on twitter as some hashtags related to campaigns against vaping such as vapeban whereas other hashtags such as wevapewevote were pro-vaping there were more twitter users using pro-vaping based hashtags than against them the top url shared on twitter during this time was entitled lung damage from vaping resembles chemical burns report says published in the new york times n  341 18 the other urls consisted of an article by the consumer news and business channel cnbc n  229 titled researchers find e-cigarettes cause lung cancer in mice in first study tying vaping to cancer further websites also appeared such as an article titled expert reaction to study on ecig vapour and cancer in mice which was published by the science media centre n  124 interestingly the article contained reactions from two professors with expertise in tobacco research and both noted that the study linking e-cigarettes and cancer to mice was potentially seriously flawed in its relevance for human vapers another article titled juul is sued by school districts that say vaping is a dangerous drain on their resources published by the new york times was also shared n  88 these results are summarized in table 5 below  influential users were ranked by the betweenness centrality algorithm using nodexl influential users consisted of cnbc which had 33 million followers and the news anchor of columbia broadcasting systems cbs nightly business report who had 313 thousand followers the reason for the prominence of cnbc was because they had published an article on october 7th titled researchers find e-cigarettes cause lung cancer in mice in first study tying vaping to cancer a citizen who tweeted the study and noted the findings of the study for the reason for not following trends received over 400 retweets and 18 thousand likes also became influential and had 61 thousand followers the user was characterizing e-cigarettes as a societal trend with dissent towards those who were using e-cigarettes a user replied to this tweet indicating that the fear around e-cigarettes seemed irrational when traditional e-cigarettes were still being sold other influential accounts consisted of the centres for disease control cdc with 124 million followers who tweeted about cases of lung damage of users of mostly illicit e-cigarettes containing the tetrahydrocannabinol thc and gregory conley with 181 thousand followers who is a tobacco harm-reduction advocate and supporter of e-cigarettes who was tweeting at this time table 6 below provides a summary of the influential users in the network  much of the content around this time related to twitter users sharing the news story linking vaping and cancer in mice furthermore our tweet clustering word and hashtag analysis revealed two further main themes taking place within the overall network related to twitter users who were broadly speaking either pro-vaping or anti-vaping in order to confirm this finding we utilised content analysis to categorize tweets until thematic saturation occurred and we found two additional main themes related to pro-vaping or anti-vaping views  twitter users who were supporting vaping tweeted how using vaping products had helped them stop smoking and also highlighted how the current issue around vaping was very specific to certain illicit types of vaping products that contained tetrahydrocannabinol thc arguments were also made towards vaping serving a function in harm-reduction as it was comparably safer than smoking twitter users against vaping requested for people to stop using e-cigarettes and for tougher legalisation on vaping products below we provide anonymized tweets related to these two main themes there were a number of twitter users who would share their own positive personal experiences of using e-cigarette devices other twitter users were concerned about the increased focus on younger people using e-cigarettes there were also twitter users who noted the dangers of cigarettes compared to e-cigarettes there were also twitter users who criticised the study linking cancer and vaping in the above tweet extract the user employed the hashtag vapingsavedmylife which was used by twitter users to indicate the life-saving potential of vaping there were also twitter users who called for people to quit vaping other twitter users called for parents to inform their children that e-cigarettes were unsafe there were also a number of general comments noting that e-cigarette use was likely to be dangerous  another twitter user noted from the tweet extracts above we can see that there was a diverse range of views and comments noting that e-cigarettes were unsafe  this study showed the effects of a research study linking cancer in mice to vaping on twitter the study was tweeted by several mainstream media outlets and dominated discussions of e-cigarettes on twitter the study however was questioned by several experts as they noted that the study conducted on mice could not be generalised to humans our study highlighted the impact of academic research on twitter when it is disseminated through the mainstream media the publication of the study caused great concern over the safety of e-cigarettes on twitter and users of the platform were quick to point out that e-cigarettes were still a much safer alternative to traditional smoking for instance health authorities such as the national health service in the united kingdom still noted that e-cigarettes contained a fraction of the risk when compared to that of traditional cigarettes 19 however the publication of the study linking cancer to mice may have incorrectly been interpreted and understood by some members of the public who would now believe that e-cigarettes were just as unsafe andor more unsafe when compared to traditional tobacco based cigarettes current advice provided by centers for disease control 202122 notes that e-cigarettes are likely to be safer than smoking traditional cigarettes our recommendation to health authorities is to offer guidance to the public in order for citizens to make informed decisions about whether e-cigarettes are safe to consume a key aspect of assessing whether vaping is safe depends on whether an individual is already engaged in using traditional cigarettes andor rolled tobacco products however information disseminated to consumers around the safety of e-cigarettes can be confusing and vague moreover we found that twitter users tended to be unsure about the safety of e-cigarettes henceforth based on a review of the literature and the advice provided by the centers for disease control the national health service nhs and cancer research uk 202122 we developed a flowchart as shown in figure 3 that could be utilised by consumers and medical professionals when making a decision about whether e-cigarettes are likely to be safe or unsafe based on their circumstances  by analysing public comments on twitter we were able to identify potential points of confusion by consumers and combining our results with that of current medical advice led to the development of the flowchart above social media may be a source of information for a subset of the population and it is important to analyse this information from a public health surveillance perspective our findings can also be contrasted with previous empirical work in this area a study published in 2018 23 conducted an analysis of e-cigarette discussions on twitter from 2012 to 2015 which examined the reasons for using such devices the study found that one of the most popular reasons for using e-cigarettes was to quit traditional cigarettes and twitter users were positive towards e-cigarette devices moreover they found that 43 of twitter users were able to give up traditional cigarettes which demonstrated the potential of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation the findings of this study were similar to our present study which also found that there was a sizeable pro-vaping community on twitter a further study 24 published in 2014 looked at a specific case study containing tweets for and against public health policy related to the chicago department of public health this study also found pro- and anti-e-cigarette views such as that they promote smoking cessation but also that they are harmful and foster nicotine addiction a further study in the united kingdom 25 surveyed 3538 current and 579 recent smokers in november and december 2012 it was also found that there were mixed views among the public about whether e-cigarettes were more or less harmful than traditional cigarettes with a number of citizens unsure of their safety at the time these results further highlight the need for easy-to-understand guidance for consumers and our flowchart developed above will be of interest to health authorities this paper conducted an analysis of current debates surrounding e-cigarette usage on twitter we identified two main themes that arose which were either based on pro-vaping or anti-vaping views and this method has been utilised in previous research 26 our work adds to the body of literature demonstrating the potential of twitter for health research 27 we then developed a flowchart by reviewing existing literature which can be used to inform public health information dissemination a limitation of our study is that we examined only english-language tweets which may have led to more tweets from english-speaking countries such as the united states and the united kingdom furthermore there may have been some tweets not related to e-cigarettes in the dataset   single- and multiple viral respiratory infections in children disease and management cannot be related to a specific pathogen jrme wishaupt o tjeerd van der ploeg ronald de groot florens versteegh g nico hartwig g   acute respiratory tract infections ari frequently occur in young children assessment of disease severity is often difficult and repeated observation over time is recommended 1 most aris in young children are of viral origin traditionally clinical guidelines on this subject focus primarily on respiratory syncytial virus rsv and influenza virus flu as these are considered the most significant viral pathogens 1 2 risk factors for a more severe disease course are best known for rsv 3 4 although these fail to predict outcome in individual patients nowadays real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assays have been introduced in many hospitals and the number of viruses found in nasal wash specimens nws of children with ari is growing the role of many of these viruses in disease severity and clinical course is still unclear since studies differ with regard to design age at inclusion recruitment criteria the manner of data collection assay sensitivity and the type of viruses studied 5 rt-pcr test results are positive in up to 7295 of symptomatic children and up to 4068 of asymptomatic children depending on age diagnosis and detection method 6 at the same time the number of viral co-infections which are detected by rt-pcr has also grown to 43 6 interpretation of these test results is even more challenging literature on this subject is growing some reports suggest there is no relation between multiple respiratory viral infections and disease severity 711 while others report a higher disease severity in children with a multiple respiratory infection 12 13 practical dilemmas about cohorting of patients with different viral pathogens have not yet been solved 14 in a previous controlled clinical trial we showed that rapid reporting of rt-pcr test results to the pediatrician did not influence patient care 15 the aim of the current study was to determine if rt-pcr test results are related to clinical data in children with respiratory symptoms we investigated clinical symptoms management and outcome in these children and correlated these findings to the specific virus determined by rt-pcr we additionally investigated clinical differences between single- multiple- and rt-pcr negative ari this study is part of the evidence-trial evaluation of viral diagnostics on respiratory infections in children a multi-center controlled clinical trial to evaluate viral rt-pcr diagnostics for ari in pediatric patients 15 in summary the trial was conducted during two consecutive winter seasons 20072008 and 20082009 in two dutch teaching hospitals with comparable populations the reinier de graaf hospital in delft joined in the second season by the groene hart ziekenhuis in gouda the evidence study-protocol was approved by the regional medical ethics committee ccmo number nl1383909806 in the current study a selection of the evidence-dataset is used to analyze the clinical aspects in relation to the viral pathogens children younger than 12 years old with respiratory symptoms who visited the emergency department or pediatric outpatient clinic were included more than 90 of these children were assessed by the primary physician before referral to the hospital informed consent for study participation was sought after the nws was obtained because nasal washings are part of standard diagnostic procedures indications for hospital admission were made on clinical grounds eg need for extra oxygen feeding difficulties apneas as observed by the parents children with underlying anatomical airway abnormalities eg bronchopulmonary dysplasia or other significant underlying disorders eg syndromal disorders psychomotor retardation malignancies were excluded we also excluded newborns that had been hospitalized since birth patients with asthma or suspected asthma were not excluded patients could be included multiple times during the two study periods provided that sampling of nws was at least 14 days apart to ensure that the children had a new episode of ari in addition patient data were reviewed retrospectively to certify that the sample was taken in a second episode of respiratory symptoms patients with positive rt-pcr results for chlamydophila pneumoniae mycoplasma pneumoniae and bordetella pertussis as single or multiple infection were excluded in order not to trouble comparisons of the virus groups with respect to clinical data patients with a positive viral rt-pcr and a clinical confirmed pneumonia were not excluded blood cultures or other bacterial cultures were not standard procedures but were performed on clinical grounds patient enrollment criteria are presented in fig 1
 ari was defined as a new episode of respiratory symptoms of the upper andor lower airways upper respiratory tract infection urti was defined as any episode of rhinorrhea nasal congestion sore throat erythematous pharynx earache or erythematous eardrum lower respiratory tract infection lrti was defined as respiratory symptoms with tachypnea and abnormal pulmonary auscultation rales crackles crepitations wheezing or prolonged expiration hypoxia was defined as a pulse oximetric peripheral oxygen saturation of 92 and was not a criterion for lrti as it is involved in urti as well x-ray confirmation also was not used in the definition because of a restricted use of ionizing radiation in pediatric practice tachypnea was defined by age-dependent cut-off values 16 wheeze was defined as high-pitched whistling sound heard coming from the chest on expiration apnea was defined as one or more episodes of respiratory pauses regardless of duration observed by caretakers physicians or nurses dyspnea was defined as difficulty of breathing with chest retractions use of auxiliary respiratory muscles or nose flaring in single- dual- and multiple infections rt-pcr was positive for respectively one two or more than one virus clinical data were prospectively collected with use of a standardized form by the treating physician tables 1 2 and 3 summarize the data collected missing information laboratory results and when available radiology reports were retrieved from the patients medical electronic record

 rsv was positive in 200331 single infections 604 78106 736 dual infections and 91126 722 multiple infections rsv was positive in all of the most frequent combinations of dual infections data not shown the distribution of the viruses per month is shown in fig 2 peak incidence of flu in both seasons was in january and february other viruses were isolated throughout both winter seasons
 the original study was a randomized controlled clinical trial 15 a chi-square test showed an equal distribution of the virus groups between intervention- rapid reporting of pcr-results to the clinician and the control late reporting group data not shown the overall admission rate in single viral infections was 252331 761 extra oxygen supply was administered to 149252 591 and nebulizer therapy to 91252 361 hospitalized children although the p-value indicated a significant difference between the virus groups with regard to the number of times that antibiotics were initiated it was not possible to explore this difference using the pearson chi-square test there were no significant differences between the virus groups with regard to the mean number of days with antibiotic treatment extra oxygen supply nebulizer therapy and the number of children with feeding problems due to respiratory distress resulting in a need for tube feeding there were also no significant differences between the virus groups regarding mean or maximum crp count and mean or maximum white blood count table 3 the multivariate analysis for length of hospital stay los included age dss lrti antibiotic treatment oxygen therapy nebulizing therapy and single virus groups in the univariate analysis rsv and rv were the virus groups that were correlated with longer hospital stays in the multivariate analysis the only variables that were correlated with longer hospital stays were oxygen therapy and nebulizer therapy irrespective of the viral pathogen for dss there was a significantly adjusted p-value whereas the multivariate regression coefficient was negative table 5 in a multivariate sub analysis for oxygen therapy including rsv rv and flu rsv was significantly correlated with longer duration of oxygen therapy p  0020 for nebulizer therapy and duration of antibiotic treatment there was no significant correlation with these viruses data not shown
 the characteristics per virus group are presented in tables 1 2 and 3 and are highlighted per virus group below
rsv rsv was the most frequently detected virus and was found in 200 out of 331 604 single infections the mean age of children with rsv was 58 months and they were significantly younger than children with flu or hbov rsv positive children were significantly more often hospitalized than hcov positive children the dss for children with rsv and hbov was significantly higher than for those with hcov and flu the mean dss for rsv was 149 the second highest after hbov dss 191 this was significantly higher than for instance flu dss 79 apneas occurred in 7200 35 of rsv single infections one child was rt-pcr positive for rsv as single pathogen despite a first vaccination with palivizumab it was a 2 month old boy born after 32 weeks of gestation with a mild disease course dss 13 los 4 none of the children in the study were treated with the antiviral drug ribavirin
rhinovirus rv was the second most commonly identified single virus infection 30331 91 the mean age of children with rv was young 54 months the dss was not significantly different compared to those of other viruses
human metapneumovirus for hmpv there were no significant differences compared to the other viruses with regard to age dss and admission rate
coronavirus children with hcov had the lowest mean age 51 months of all virus groups the mean dss was 86 which was significantly lower than for rsv or hbov the admission rate was 1024 417 the lowest of all virus groups
influenzavirus the mean age at onset of disease for flu was 151 months which was significantly higher than for rsv and some other viruses the mean dss was 79 lowest of all virus groups and significantly lower than for rsv none of the patients was treated with antiviral drugs like oseltamivir
adenovirus for hadv there were no significant differences compared to the other viruses with regard to dss and admission rate
bocavirus the mean age of children with hbov was 186 months which was significantly higher than for rsv rv and hcov the mean dss was also highest 191 which was significantly higher than for flu the admission rate was 910 900 although the admission rate was the highest of all virus groups this difference was not significant the mean number of days of nebulization therapy with salbutamol and ipratropium bromide was 22 sd 22 days highest of all although this was not significant compared to the other viruses
parainfluenzavirus the mean dss for children with piv was 139 third highest after hbov and rsv the number of times that antibiotics were initiated was highest for piv 69 667
 patients with a confirmed viral ari had a significantly higher dss fever los extra oxygen supply and antibiotic treatment than patients with a negative rt-pcr result table 6 nebulizer therapy and the admission rate did not significantly differ between these groups
 within the group of viral confirmed ari children with single- and multiple viral infections did not significantly differ with regard to dss fever admission rate los extra oxygen supply nebulizer therapy and duration of antibiotic treatment when initiated table 6 sub analysis per group was performed for rt-pcr negative single- dual- triple- and quadruple infections no significant differences were found data not shown a sub analysis of the five most common dual viral combinations rsvhcov rsvrv rsvhadv rsvhmpv rsvpiv was performed in order to investigate whether these groups differed in clinical symptoms and management there were no significant differences between the groups with regard to dss p  0958 admission rate p  0318 los p  0906 extra oxygen supply p  0456 nebulizer therapy p  0210 and antibiotic treatment p  0339 data not shown the high number of rsv positive children their young age high admission rate and high dss was expected since rsv is well known to have a great disease burden in young children 20 rv usually is the most frequently found virus in young children and enteroviridae peak in late summer and autumn 21 however in our study rv was not frequently found as a single pathogen possibly due to the sampling period in the winter the high admission rate and moderate dss stresses the growing evidence that rv is associated with a more severe ari in young children 2224 in our study clinical data of patients with hmpv did not differ to patients with other viruses this is in line with literature in which patients with rsv and hmpv were virtually indistinguishable with regard to symptoms and laboratory findings 25 we did not find the typical male to female ratio of two to one as reported earlier 26 for the coronavirus group dss percentage of hospitalizations the number of days with extra oxygen and the number of days with nebulization was low suggesting a mild disease course this was in contrast with the relative high median number of days in hospital only one specific patient was responsible for this effect it was a 2 year old boy with a double sided pneumonia dss 19 maximum crp 51 mgml treated with intravenous antibiotics for 7 days the mean age of children positive for flu was relatively high and most children were infected during the second winter season in their life a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the influenza-season lasts only a few weeks during a winter season 21 as adults are also frequently infected young children may be protected by circulating maternal antibodies against flu during the first months of their life 27 the low dss for flu was also remarkably as flu is considered a potential virulent pathogen especially in young children 2 possibly our inclusion criteria children with ari may miss children with fever without a source or a sepsis like syndrome as is frequently seen in young children with influenza another important note is that our inclusion period was before the flu-a h1n1 2009 pandemic occurred the circulating flu-a strains have changed in composition and this may have an effect on the clinical presentation of flu nowadays a recent study showed a more severe disease course in children with flu-a compared to flu-b 28 the dss for hbov was high in our study similar results were found in a recent study showing that hbov as a single pathogen can cause severe ari 29 the mean age of children with hbov in our study was significantly higher than for children with rsv rv and hcov which has not been reported before a possible explanation is again protection by maternal antibodies as reviewed by jartti protection by vertical antibody transfer is common at age  2 months after this age hbov antibody-titers decline and are lowest at age 612 months after 12 months seroprevalence of hbov increases again until age 6 years at that time almost all children have circulating hbov antibodies 30 apneas are an important concern in young children with bronchiolitis in our study apneas occurred in seven out of 200 35 rsv single infections comparable with data found in a recent review 31 however apneas occurred also in non rsv-infections 4131 31 the clinical data and risk factors for children with apneas have been published elsewhere 18 although we showed some significant differences in clinical data between the virus groups a specific clinically recognizable pattern per virus group could not be defined all virus groups showed overlapping clinical symptoms patients with a positive rt-pcr result were different from children with a negative rt-pcr result except for admission rate and nebulization therapy table 6 a possible explanation is that asthma patients were not excluded in this study and nebulization therapy is sometimes started as test treatment in children with ari and wheezing episodes patients with multiple infections were significantly older than patients with single infections as is also previously reported 11 32 a possible explanation is a higher daycare attendance in older children where crowding of children leads to virus transmission 33 34 indeed in our study daycare attendance appeared more often in children with a multiple infection patients could be included multiple times in our study to ensure that this was not in the same period of illness an interval of at least 14 days between two nws samples was chosen in a sub analysis of the repeat cases rt-pcr showed different viruses in 34 out of 35 patients between the first and second illness period in one patient both nws were positive for rsv-a but these samples were taken in different years in 22 out of these 35 patients rt-pcr was positive for multiple viruses there is increasing interest in the importance of viral load whether viral load determined by cycle threshold values of rt-pcr assays may contribute to disease severity andor to a better understanding of the role of multiple infections lay outside the scope of this study this subject will be addressed in a separate paper a limitation of this study is the small number of patients in some virus groups even after clustering of viral subtypes this might have led to over- or underestimation of some effects the clustering of different virus subtypes itself could potentially lead to underestimation of some more harmful subtypes some investigators showed a more severe disease course of rv subtype c 35 while others found a similar disease severity between subtypes a and c 36 our rt-pcr assay could not differentiate between different subtypes of rv for rsv an equal disease severity between the subtypes a and b is assumed 37 we clustered flu-a and flu-b and as mentioned above inclusion of patients was before the flu-a h1n1 2009 pandemic occurred secondly bias may have been introduced in our study since most children were referred to the hospital only after initial assessment by a primary care physician as is common in the dutch healthcare system therefore patients with milder disease may be underrepresented this is also reflected in the high admission rate of 761 in single-infections and 743 in all aris in this study we used a modified scoring system to avoid subjective terms like moderate or severe a concern in the interpretation of clinical severity using a dss is the lack of uniformity between scoring systems for young children with ari in literature the severity score of gern et al was also used in a study correlating viral load and disease severity of rsv patients 38 we also used a modification of this scoring system in a recent study 18 another concern is the lack of uniformity of case-definitions a strict definition of urti ear nose throat region or lrti bronchi and lung tissue is difficult in young children since classical criteria like tachypnea and hypoxia are not restricted to lrti in conclusion clinical management and outcome in children with ari are not determined by the type of virus children with one specific virus do not have a specific clinically recognizable pattern and children with single- and multiple viral ari are clinically indistinguishable los is determined by duration of extra oxygen supply or need for nebulizer therapy the impact of rt-pcr for special indications is outside the scope of this paper as is the role of rt-pcr for other clinical purposes such as management of cohorting of inhospital patients however at this moment for the general pediatric patient management the impact seems limited in these settings rt-pcr assays should be restricted to pathogens for which therapy is available eg the clinical course can be influenced such as for rsv flu and bordetella pertussis  a formal critique of the value of the colombian pramo juan afanador  this article presents conceptual and methodological frameworks to prioritise interventions on the colombian pramo the mode of analysis that our work takes up is that of questioning value and related categories as definite empirically perceived phenomena we contend that the valuation of ecosystem services -even in its post-normal forms -and the ecosystem services framework not only fail to examine value-based categories but reproduce the problematic aspects of value-based social relations which ultimately bear on the ecological issues affecting the pramo upon this premise we set out to formalise a computational dialogical scenario where arguments stating distinct and often contradictory actions delineate possible forms of appropriating the pramo while motivating the examination of their defining sociality intrinsic goodness see eg davidson 2013 -and more concrete acts on nature -eg the importance of implementing agripastoral practices compatible with environmental conservation see eg lliso et al 2020  -are naturally linked to value prices and their accompanying categories -in this manner modern capitalist praxis is reproduced within new and existing domains given the neoclassical antecedents of ves -that is given the econometric origins of its methods and their various degrees of microeconomic soundness -it may be tempting to advance the idea that non-neoclassical approaches to ves may prevent the above moment of social praxis see eg gmez-baggethun et al 2016 and kumar and kumar 2008  however the sole invocation of the valorisation of value inherent in valuation -in any approach to valuation -induces a form of fetishistic use of value ie the implicit subjectification of the category of value as an agent of social interaction -as an automatic subject as it were kurz 2019 therefore a similar process of social reproduction is prompted by non-neoclassical approaches to ves -eg those employing non-monetary techniques under the principles of integral valuation see eg jacobs et al 2016 and gmez-baggethun et al 2014 -so long as valuation is constituted as an affirmative action around the category of value out of these observations our work is laid out as a critique of ves here we present an attempt to break with the basic categories of ves in the context of the social constructs that we identified with the guantiva-la rusia pramo in colombia this break alludes to the analytical negation of values underlying formal logic which primarily rests upon the enlightenment ideology classical logics and the view that consistency imposes a bound on rationality our main argument affirms that the relations of value-dissociation ie the fetishistic use of value and its gender dissociation manifestations scholz 2013 have long become the natural basis of social interaction through a process of assimilation and reproduction not unlike the one described before noys 2010 hemmens 2019  we maintain that within this process ves acts as a form of theoretical praxis furthering value fetishism towards the constitution of the valorisation of value as an inexorable mandate to which everyone within its orbit must conform under the penalty of economic ostracism we trace the root of this assimilation process to the making of a consistent world ie one that does not contradict capitalist social praxis by means of a narrative of the conservation and protection of nature through its rational exploitation see eg mea 2005 and lliso et al 2020 hence we examine the rationality behind the decisions made in a community-based organization of local farmers embracing the relations of value-dissociation within the guantiva-la rusia pramo employing a paraconsistent logical model of discursive analysis that reveals the immanent contradictions and material implications of the conscious reshaping of their sociality embedded in a computational environment where individual arguments interact in a common dialogical setting our paraconsistent model will not only serve to inquiry the rationality of modern capitalist relations but will also suggest various actions on the pramo in this sense our work can be seen as a form of counter-valuation we start off from the category of value and the esf and by negating them a distinct methodological praxis can be discerned the outcomes of our approach will be presented using graph-theoretic tools such as networkbased arrangements and various centrality measures newman and ziff 2001 kamvar et al 2003 brandes and pich 2007 opsahl et al 2010  additional sensitivity analysis will be conducted using bayesian methods -markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods -to obtain stable states of the networks kruschke 2013 these statistical and graph-theoretic techniques operate on a metaanalytical level with respect to our logic-based proposal that is to say that these latter techniques are but instrumental to conveying our contribution 2  the ecosystem services framework esf renders the idea of people benefiting from their natural environment amenable to the accrual of economic profit or more generally value de groot et al 2002 mea 2005 carpenter et al 2006  esf thus beckons the valuation of ecosystem services ves as a means to signalling natures contribution to the reproduction of value barbier et al 2009 villa et al 2009 fisher et al 2010 gmez-baggethun et al 2016  for value is the central category of modern capitalist societies and the valorisation of value -ie economic growth sublimated into economic development -their driving force see eg mankiw 2016 and holden et al 2017  ves is in this sense inscribed in an interpretive approach to modern capitalist praxis not only invoking assumptions that are instrumentally validated in a retroactive manner but also taking for granted precisely those historical and material conditions which ves is meant to interpret and in doing so reproduce overlooking the historical basis of esf and ves has important practical consequences when ves practitioners elicit value a moment or specific field of the social praxis embodied in the valorisation of value is inaugurated allowing value to mediate other social constructs built around the idea of nature since the patterns of actions that make up the capitalist social praxis are presupposed within this new ambit value takes on a transhistorical quality that justifies its allencompassing and unreflective usage see eg badura et al 2016 and gmez-baggethun and martn-lpez 2015  in this manner axiological considerations -eg the belief in natures 1 arxiv200502810v1 csai 3 may 2020 the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a discussion on value rationality and ves which problematises our central theme section 3 characterises the pramo from a critical perspective in section 5 we present our dialogical model through an example based on classical logic giving way to a formal rendition of the ideas presented thus far in a dialectical dialogical game in section 4 the results of implementing our approach in the context of the pramo are summarised in section 6 the last section discusses our findings and provide suggestions for future work modern capitalist societies function upon a mode of reproduction rather than a system of circulation holden et al 2017 varian 2018  that is commodities have to be the object of production before they can become the object of circulation and the interplay of all forms of social mediation occurring therein constitute our mode of life -the capitalist social praxis andrews 2002  in this sense we maintain that value is formed through the expenditure of effort in the production of commodities abstracted into working hours which is then realised transactionally in its priceregulated money form kurz 2019  put differently value is the central category of the capitalist social praxis for it is the body of abstract labour and exchange hence inextricably bound up with prices and money as argued in section 1 the dynamics of value have a rare quality since value is manifested as pure social mediation despite having well-defined historical and material bases its dynamics are those of an automatic subject hemmens 2019 kurz 2019  value is reproduced for the sake of its own reproduction while conditioning the continuation of the reproduction itself the subjectification of value is then sealed by the internalisation of these categories as second nature through our being socialised within them -a form of social mediation that we term value fetishism in line with the less comprehensive concept of commodity fetishism marx 2019  in general other usages of the word value referring to the assignment of relative importance or the generation of axiological judgements may or may not be confined to such etymology within ves domain the notion of value is used indistinctly either adducing an innocuous semantic liberty or invoking an useexchange interpretation kosoy and corbera 2010  the former is but the evocation of said second nature while the other propounds the essentialisation of the appropriation of nature as a socially productive activity akin to labour -to abstract labour as the kernel of value see eg jacobs et al 2016  both meanings are affirmed by the esf through its ecosystem service typology see eg arias-arvalo et al 2018  bela et al 2015 and sagoff 2008  the claim made by ves that multiple values occur naturally within each esf category is then consequential upon the fetishistic use of the value category immanent in the valorisation of value see eg de groot et al 2002  fisher et al 2010 and bela et al 2015  in such immanence the valuation of varied values seems straightforward -an action that requires no thorough examination the price-tagging aspiration of monetary techniques is seen as an effort to signal the importance of nature in a way intelligible to the making of decisions while the antinomic character of non-monetary values is expelled through the recognition of a multiplicity of values in order to be later recuperated into the same decision-making rhetoric kosoy and corbera 2010  this unreflective usage furthers the fetishist forms of social praxis built around value normalising ves as an exhaustive and objective description of our relation with nature 1  here a type 1 see the definition of total economic value in eg pearce and moran 1994 and adger et al 1995  3 of instrumental reason is at work where since the purposes of ves are taken for granted and self-explanatory valuation practitioners need only consider the adequacy of their methods to said purposes as these ends are not submitted to categorical reflection and reflective thought is believed to come to its own when it rejects any status as absolute reason devolves into a tool for coming to terms with the preestablished social praxis agamben and heller-roazen 1999  through this partial self-supression instrumental reason via ves realises itself as the capitalist transformation of the world in its allegedly ecological facet and in this process instrumental reason becomes objective reason for it reproduces the validity of the fetishistic treatment of value noys 2010  continued reflection at the categorical level -such as ours -is contested as speculative lucubration precisely because the fetishistic relation has already been constituted as a natural necessity the validity of ves is judged on the basis of its conformity to the sociality from which it stems implying in turn that the validity of its results is judged on their consistency with respect to the capitalist social praxis it is as though objective reason would give way to an equally objective form of instrumental rationality jappe 2017 hemmens 2019  in the context of ves -and most likely in other domains of theoretical and practical activity kurz 2019  -objective reason is but the partial reflection on value and its dynamics whence rationality surges as a gauge of consistency with respect to said reflectiveinterpretive moment rationality in the previous sense is expected from valuation practitioners as much as it is required from the subjects of valuation bela et al 2015 barbier et al 2009 gmez-baggethun et al 2016 jacobs et al 2016 kumar and kumar 2008  whether rationality substantiates in its laxer -eg procedural rationality simon 1976 wakker 2010 and ecological rationality glymour 2001 hogarth and karelaia 2007 -or more stringent -eg economic rationality simon 1996 -forms it is considered the defining quality of human agency rationality is then posed as the conformity of means and ends prescribed by the process of the valorisation of value thus subjectifying the abstract capacity to act in accordance to the reproduction of value -thus reinaugurating the automatic subjectivity of value jappe 2013 hemmens 2019  the assumption that rationality holds is equivalent to the hypothesis that the world is consistent routley and meyer 1976  -that our capitalist sociality is consistent yet more formally the consistency hypothesis is the thesis that the class of all truths t contains no contradictory pairs of the form a and a where a is the negation of some predicate a routley and meyer 1976  of course t does not exhaust the class of all statements for it is an empirical truth that the world is not trivial likewise it is empirically true that the world is fraught with inconsistencies we are therefore inclined to believe that inconsistency does not lead to triviality and that its analytical appropriation as opposed to its treatment is better suited to achieve the break -albeit partial -from the internal contradictions of the social relations fostered by ves the core inconsistency of our modern forms of socialisation lies in the fact that we have created economic laws technological imperatives and similar structures revolving around value which ended up shaping the conditions of the world in a way that their mediating role has become our social actuality lukcs 2017  put differently value can only be produced by labour yet labour is continually eroded by the reproduction of value mainly by its estranging of labourers from their own creations commodities kurz 2019  therefrom arises a more palpable inconsistency the reduction of value contained in each commodity induced by the erosion of labour has to be compensated by an increase in the total mass of commodities produced bringing about ecological consequences which will ultimately hamper said productive expansion ves practitioners ostensibly set out to treat the latter contradiction gmez-baggethun et al 2016 gmez-baggethun and martn-lpez 2015 bela et al 2015 badura et al 2016  they intend to elicit value from nature where they believe lays dormant so as to better inform the commodity production system adger et al 1995 arias-arvalo et al 2018  ves is from their perspective a mechanism to do away with the contradiction not persuaded by the belief that all that exists is in some way valuable for we recognise that the underlying rationality of this credence is value-based by construction we adopt a negative dialectical approach to valuation instead of treating inconsistencies we operate on them not necessarily to transcend them but to discern other forms of sociality adorno 1990  this determination will not only have to deal with the fact that value relations are inconsistent but also acknowledge that the inconsistency of value relations is not trivial which in turn implicates that the classical logic underpinning instrumental rationality is inadequate to fulfill these requirements priest 2008  value relations being inconsistent means that they engender contradictions and that these contradictions are empirically valid value relations being non-trivial while inconsistent means that not everything follows from the recognition of their internal contradictions classical logic as the cornerstone of rationality does not allow for contradictions or whenever present they provoke the explosion of the analytical model sitting on top in the sense that by effect of the disjunctive syllogism the validity of any other premise can be deduced from an inconsistent argument priest 2008 berto 2007  for instance it is perfectly classically rational to accelerate economic growth if it is the case that the production of commodities increases and the biophysical conditions underpinning such increment deteriorate however the coexistence of both premises is not valid within the same classical framework our critique embraces contradictions and inconsistency but it is not irrational it is not irrational in the sense that aristotles principle of non-contradiction is should be correct in our foregoing proposal both in its syntactical and semantical formulations wedin 2004  that is using the  symbol to denote conjunction aristotles principle a  a is valid hence true as is the statement indicating that no statement is both true and false which as will be shown in section 5 is guaranteed by the bivalent features of our models semantics thus we join routley in claiming that there are genuine contradictions in things routley and meyer 1976  in section 5 we will construct a methodological framework conducive to a logical model that allows for inconsistency and contradictions -a paraconsistent and dialetheic one the resulting model will be at the centre of a computational environment for the reproduction of the dialogues determining how the pramo is appropriated based on the notion of value presented hitherto before detailing the methodological upshot of our considerations a brief account of the guantiva-la rusia pramo is in place the andes contain some of the most abrupt environmental contrasts they rise from the sea coast to volcanoes and glaciated massifs and then descend rapidly into the tropical amazon basin brush 1982  in colombia these transitions occur on a horizontal distance of 400 km parra et al 2009  the great volume of compressed material within such a narrow space has produced varied landscapes of great diversity intermontane valley floors covered in some places with tropical forests and in others with desert vegetation which ascend steeply through temperate forest belts to pramo or permanent snow corts-duque et al 2013  the pramo is an alpine biome characteristic of the high tropical andes somewhat arbitrarily defined as those grassland ecosystems occurring above 3000 masl rivera-ospina and rodrguez-murcia 2011  geologically these areas are relatively young and have been subjected to the effects of glaciations which resulted in cycles of morphological fragmentation and reconnection flantua et al 2019  this flickering connectivity explains the unique flora of the pramo and its pivotal role in the cycling of water sugden 2019  the vegetation structure of the pramo is one of the most complex among grasslands hofstede 1995 ramsay 2014  the dominant growth forms of the pramos along the colombian andes are stem rosettes espeletia spp constituting an emergent vegetation layer above high up to 1 m growing tussock grasses and dwarf shrubs diazgranados and snchez 2017  an additional lower vegetation layer may be present with ground rosettes sedges and short-growing grass species diazgranados and snchez 2017  stem rosettes are plants with the caulescent rosette growth form smith 1979  these plants have unbranched or semiwoody stems supporting rosettes of evergreen leaves which are generally marcescent remaining on the stem after they senesce smith 1979  it is probable that the caulescent rosette form provides a buffering effect against the diurnal fluctuations in temperature and the seasonal fluctuations in rainfall allowing the plant to trap moisture through its dense pubescence diazgranados and snchez 2017  it has been observed that dew accumulation in the rosettes is sufficient to cause stem flow increasing soil moisture sifting of fog and rain by the rosette leaves would have a greater effect hofstede 1995  if the espeletias leaves absorb enough moisture a net movement of water from leaves to roots and then to soil might occur provided the soil water potential is significantly lower than the plant water potential hofstede and rossenaar 1995  although the exact mechanisms and processes through which the pramo vegetation contributes to the regulation of water are not fully understood the low levels of evotranspiration induced by the vegetations capacity to intercept and store water are judged crucial in the cycling of water toward adjacent river basins buytaert et al 2006  it is the much better known structure of the pramo soils and accidented toporgaphy of rough steep valleys and almost flat plains the factors commonly invoked to explain the pramos high water regulating capacity buytaert et al 2006  in conjunction these properties are believed to explain an average net contribution of water to local hydrological systems of approximately 1400 mm or 665 km 3  per year hincapi et al 2002  on the western side of the eastern branch of the colombian andes raises the guantiva-la rusia pramo complex spreading over several municipalities of the provinces of santander and boyac judging by its more evident biophysical features the altitudinal range of the complex varies from 3100 masl up to 4280 masl corts-duque et al 2013  however the recognition of its role in the provisioning of water is prevalent among the people living within its buffer zone and even in areas well below this belt of cloud forest rivera-ospina and rodrguez-murcia 2011 -communities which along with those inhabiting the pramo we term paramunos the locations circumscribing the guantiva-la rusia include the municipalities of charal and encino in santander and also the municipalities of duitama and beln in boyac table 2 presents the distribution of the area of the pramo complex among the different municipalities as per the official delimitation criteria rivera-ospina and rodrguez-murcia 2011 duitama paipa beln charal and encino despite not having the largest share of the total pramo area concentrate the economic activity of the region rojas et al 2017  until not so long ago dairy farming cattle raising wood extraction -from endemic oak quercus humboldtii spp forests -for charcoal production and the cultivation of potatoes constituted the bulk of the economic activities within the complex rojas et al 2017  these activities typically involved the clearing of large areas of pramo and forest through burning or grazing at regular intervals of one to several years rojas et al 2017  more recently the demographic changes induced by the mediation of value relations in the sense of section 2 reduced the intensity of these practices while the appropriation of the relations themselves produced a move away from them burning grazing and cultivating above the 3000 masl threshold are now considered an affront to collective interests for they have been observed to cause negative impacts on the water regulating capacity of the pramo via structural changes in its soils buytaert et al 2006  so not only are these activities little effective on pramo lands inherently devoid of a farming vocation but also detrimental to the regional water yield traditional practices are proscribed to a handful of campesinos forced to live off the higher lands nonetheless a scenario where these practices become once again widespread is always likely some of the reasons behind the ostensible imminence of this regression reside in the land-holding patterns of the colombian rurality in particular the competition between large states haciendas and peasant communities -a common and often violent feature of rural colombian societycan be recognised in the way paramunos lead their lives guzmn et al 2019  although bellicose manifestations of violence are not apparent in the guantiva-la rusia complex institutionalised forms of violence have had a similar effect the result being the historical concentration of land ownership the uneven distribution of population densities and land-use pressures and the absorp-tion of displaced landless labourers and peasants into semi-feudal or proto-capitalist systems of agricultural production guzmn et al 2019  this legacy of inequality and the more recent changes in the pramo sociality are now being incorporated into a rationale of the sustainable use of nature and the preservation of traditional forms of living typically associated with the campesino identity rivera-ospina and rodrguez-murcia 2011 previous farming practices are eschewed in favour of modes of production and livelihoods compatible with the rhetoric of conservation haciendas are now seen as private conservation areas schemes of payments for ecosystem services are slowly becoming part of the locals imagery as a means to avoid resuming outdated practices while collective initiatives are being touted as profit-making enterprises in niche markets for environmentally friendly or ethical commodities the communities of the pramo the cloud forest and adjacent lower areas -which altogether we denote pramo -are undergoing two major changes on the one hand they are committed to transitioning from traditional agropastoral economies towards entreprenurial activities centered around agroeco-tourism and on the other they strive to reinterpret preserve campesinos as local subjects of the world market these tendencies are not being forcefully imposed upon the people of the pramo rojas et al 2017  they constitute a conscious determination on how the social relations of the pramo are to be shaped notwithstanding the repercussions of neoliberal policies in colombia it is the narrative of developmental sustainability that serves as the backdrop for their enactment rivera-ospina and rodrguez-murcia 2011 markets for campesino products and services are seen as a medium for channeling revenues while incentivising the conservation of nature and the preservation of a way of life these notions however are not subject to critical consideration during our time with the paramunos we noticed that the invocation of markets is grounded on the belief that value -allegedly inherent in all their activities productive or otherwise -can be adequately represented in a monetary form several concerns were voiced regarding the necessity to monetise traditional knowledge and receiving a fair compensation for the conscious conservation of the pramo we recognised a view that essentialises value and sees in its valorisation through the participation in new world markets a medium for the fulfilment of material needs and aspirations the situation of the paramunos is an instance of the reproduction of the capitalist social praxis presented in section 2 value is considered an existential -not even anthropological -constant a fundamental property of all that exists which can be understood without reference to capitalism and its historical specificity as a mode of life this ontologisation of value enables value fetishism and its aporetic effects manifested as the subjetification of the paramunos in terms of the more global campesino identity the re-signification of nature as a portfolio of goods and services and the re-coding of the collective as fundamentally entrepreneurial value in this sense becomes a transhistorical invariant waiting to be realised through market mechanisms ie prices kurz 2019  not much thought goes into the nuances of the implicit recognition that value is in principle intrinsic and how labour can augmentcreate it or how values elicitation may have a tinge of subjective consideration jappe 2017  regardless nature harbours value and that is simply a self-evident fact however imperfect prices are but neutral means of expressing natures value of expressing the value that paramunos -re-imagined as campesinos -create and of unifying the overwhelming subjectivity of these various values the paramunos approach to value coincides with ves prescription on value elicitation see eg gmez-baggethun et al 2016 gmez-baggethun and martn-lpez 2015 bela et al 2015  and badura et al 2016  the esf typology would then seem apropos when discussed in the context of the pramo the growing of coffee fruits andean legumes and tubers embodies provisioning services the stewardship of espeletia and oak forests incarnate hydrological and carbon sequestration regulating services and agro-touristic activities alongside the efforts to preserve the campesino identity typify cultural services every form of appropriating the pramo constitutes a commodity whose nascent market requires but the assistance of ves practitioners to adequately estimate their corresponding prices once set prices will harness the paramunos predisposition to rational behaviour eventually attaining efficiency in the use of nature for the allocation of property rights is more or less irrelevant to market efficiency coase 1960 farley and costanza 2010  the paramunos reasoning abides by the type of instrumental rationality described in section 2 their reflective considerations on value are rational because they coincide with the eminently transactional ideal of ves where individual preferences are equalised through pricing in a self-fulfilling vision of unity rationality is consequently established as the confirmation of a preordained social praxis that encourages circulation over production unlike our labour-based definition ves notion of value is rooted in the sublimation of the sphere of circulation of commodities accordingly value is posited a fundamental property of all things liable to being reproduced and augmented but realisable only through exchange and circulationvalue is subjective that is solely dependent on individual preferences whence multiple values arise and an arbitrary social convention of arbitrage ie prices surge as an equaliser of this impractical overabundance but for prices to substantiate circulation must be countenanced therefore it makes complete sense to promote the creation of markets even for unlikely commodities which in principle cannot be produced as in the hydrological regulating services provided by the pramo vegetation in contrast a labour-based explication of value treats it as an objective property born of the material appropriation and transformation of the world justified by the experiential primacy of production over circulation kurz 2019 hemmens 2019 marx 2019  labour-based value is also manifested through exchange but with reference to the amount of time expended in the manufacture of reality ie abstract labour that a commodity contains marx 2019  here pricing does not occur as arbitrarily and the reproduction of value the valorisation of value takes a hold of its material substratum value fetishism also becomes more readily apparent for the recognition of the material and historical basis of value delineates the ambit where exchange takes place this labour-based exegesis makes clear that ves ontologising approach to value uses esf to extrapolate value fetishism to the paramunos relation with nature by way of extending the ambit of exchange and of the valorisation of value in analysing this process we reiterate first that paramunos do not conform to this approach by diktat nor by effect of false consciousness and second that said conformity is not objectionable in itself but rather undesirable based on its detrimental effects on the pramo the former observation can also be read as evidence of rational behaviour on the part of the paramunos while the latter refers to the practical consequences of reproducing the contradictions of the capitalist social praxis transmitted through the furthering of value fetishism more to the point we are referring to the advancement of alienation implicated by the adoption of the campesino identity at the expense of the paramuno lore and other unintended environmental impacts that the tertiarisation of already precarious economies may have on the pramo in the next section we use an example to illustrate the relevance of a new formalism -presented in section 5 -for addressing the issues raised here this example is based on a classical logical framework which allows for instrumental rationality in the use of the pramo as per the esf the shortcomings of this approach -eg the impossibility of handling its inherent contradictions 9 -uphold the need for a more comprehensive logical framework and a distinct perspective on conducting ves which we demonstrate is enabled by our proposal before looking at our example let us give a brief indication of what we mean by computational environment by computational environment we understand a collection of computational techniques that reproduce dialogical settings where multiple actions on the pramo are intentionally or otherwise conflated with the notion of value these techniques delineate an environ for all interested stakeholders to put forward their views on how the pramo can be construed and pit these arguments against one another as a means to prioritise over multiple and often conflicting management practices the core of our approach resides in its paraconsistent logical model in the sense of section 2 wrapped up in an argumentation framework argumentation frameworks are abstract devices that formalise dialogues walton 2009  they are composed by a body of arguments a relation of attack stating which arguments can pose a challenge to some other arguments and a set of motivational states underpinning the frameworks arguments prakken 2018  the argumentation framework we use is special for at least two reasons 1 it incorporates information on which and under what conditions the outcome of an argument is preferred over distinct alternatives and 2 it determines the validity of a given argument through a logical model of entailment definition 41 provides a formal account of a value-based argumentation framework vaf a value-based abstract argumentation framework is a tuple vaf  a r v val p  a is a set of arguments r  a  a is a binary relation of attack v is a non-empty set of values p is the set of total orders on v  and val  a  v  the logical model of our approach establishes the low-level conditions to infer whether an argument is defensible within a particular dialogical setting besnard and hunter 2009  a task that is accomplished while allowing for inconsistent arguments ie arguments involving both a premise and its negation but do not entail trivial outcomes as outilned in section 2 it is in this sense that our logical model is said to be paraconsistent berto 2007  the information on which the logical model and the argumentation framework operate is generated by a natural language processing nlp model the main function of the nlp model is to facilitate the use of raw text data in the form of natural language and numerical data alike our nlp model is made up of two parts an embeddings from language model elmo which learns a numerical vector representation of each word per the words sensecontext peters et al 2018  and an argument generation mechanism that arranges these word embeddings into a format amenable to vaf although from a conceptual perspective these two processes may be considered separately from a functional point of view they are integrated into a single nlp model manning et al 1999  the previous description is more succinctly illustrated in figure 3  it shows how the nlp model synthesises unfiltered raw data -the transcripts from interviews and other synthetic or observed events of numerical nature-into proto-arguments and their underlying motivational states which are then fed to the argumentation framework the argumentation framework and the logical models proof theory would then generate a list of defensible arguments which will be contrasted in the field and if not discarded would then returned enriched to the argumentation framework and an order of prioritised practice is generated the following example presents our computational environment at work it illustrates the functioning of a vaf and the need for a paraconsistent model to reason about interactions revolving around the use of the pramo and related value-based categories our computational environment is based on the logical formalisation of dialogical interactions as originally envisioned its logical formalism should be non-classical that is our logical model should contain non-trivial theses of the form a  a where a is a premise belonging to the support of a generic argument a  a and a is as in definition 41 current research into logics amenable to structural contradictions -within the computational argumentation domain -is still incipient amgoud and besnard 2010 arioua et al 2017 prakken 2018  for this reason this section is limited to elucidating what is meant by model of logical entailment in the context of our proposal and how it is articulated into the a vaf by way of an example the justification of a non-classical model of entailment is given in section 2 whereas its integration into a working counter-valuation framework will be investigated in section 5 let us then introduce a classical logic-based instance of our computational environment through example 41 example 41 our example represents the predicament between using pramo sites for agricultural purposes and performing restoration activities involving the same areas our variables of interest are designated as follows a  increased agricultural land-use h  improved hydrological regulating services r  greater number of peatland restoration activities s  increased water supply y  greater agricultural yield w  improved living conditions to construct our logic-based vaf we make use of sentential logic with a conventional linguistic structure the resulting construct is considered a classical logic bning and lettmann 1999  this classical logic consists of well-formed formulae built up from sentential variables -such as h or y -using the sentential connectives  implies  and  or and  not every argument in our vaf is formed by combining these sentential elements we start off by defining a knowledge base which summarises all relevant information regarding our variables the main or root argument will be that of prioritising agricultural land-use as it leads to a greater yield and higher income ie in contrast restoration activities could be directly advocated -agricultural land-use is eschewed in favour of peatland restoration activities to improve water quality ie which in turn could be refuted by the primacy of the income from agricultural activities over non-monetary considerations ie a 3  y y  r r  r  y  yet another argument may affirm that restoration is desirable as it guarantees the regulating services hampered by agricultural activities ie in consequence the abstract argumentation framework of our example takes the form and its corresponding argumentation tree appears as in figure 4  to extend our current af to a value-based framework we recognise v  y w as our set of values in view that a  y and r  h  h  w so there are two possible audiences p  y w w y with respect to the binary relation on v  which we designate as audiencey associated with order y w and audience-w associated with order w y their respective variables are tagged with the subscript  i for i  y w whenever the latters omission may seem a a  y y r r  a a  a  y y y  r r  r  y the hasse diagrams in figure 5 offer an alternative representation of the preferred extensions of vaf kb0 3  it indicates that the preferences contained in our vaf are uninformative as we end up with two independent sets of preferred arguments for each audience put another way the values associated with these arguments are trivial audience-y favours agricultural activities over restoration as opposed to audience-w precluding finding a common ground however if the knowledge base is extended to include premises stating that increased water supply generates greater agricultural yields and that improved regulating services uphold an increased water supply ie kb 1  kb 0  s  y h  s then a new preferred extension arises the changes kb 1 introduces are reflected in a new argumentation tree that of figure 6 a lighter notation has been adopted in figure 6  by making  y  aa  y and  w  r r  a for the sake of brevity instead of deriving every element in vaf kb1  let us simply note that while the sets of values and audiences from vaf kb1 are preserved there are two new counterarguments to the root altering the value mappings between v and p  one affirming that the dedication of land to agricultural activities negatively impacts hydrological regulating services reducing the water supply the agricultural yield and eventually eroding the livelihoods of the locals ie and another stating that by impacting the water supply through regulating services agricultural activities could eventually reduce the agricultural yields ie an argument which will not be factored into the derivation of the preferred extension of vaf kb1 -hence the dashed contours -but one that will serve to motivate our discussion about the nonclassical counterpart of the approach embodied in this example like before hasse diagrams are used to represent preferred extensions the hasse diagrams of vaf kb1 appear in figure 7  for audience-y the preferred extension is a 1  a 5  for audience-w the preferred extension is a 2  a 5  the observation that restoration has a beneficial but indirect effect on agricultural yields reconciles the two audiences through argument a 5  the final result being that restoration activities should be prioritised over agricultural ones this example comes to an end with a passing remark on argument a 6  argument a 6 affirms that an insistence on promoting agricultural activities may be self-defeating in view of the interdependency of the circumscribing ecological processes put another way a 6 introduces the non-trivial thesis ic  a  a given the notions of defeat acceptability and connected ideas contained in the definition of a preferred extension see afanador 2019 it would not be possible to find an admissible argument for either audience-y or audience-w if theses like ic were allowed into vaf kb1  the reason behind this is that theses like ic involve determining the truth value of contradictions and the acceptance of paradoxes as proofs tasks for which the numerous classical semantics are not equipped bning and lettmann 1999  since inconsistency arises even in the commonplace observation that ecosystem services are interlinked recasting vafs to allow for non-trivial inconsistencies intends to explicate logically a non-negligible part of the complexity of ves associated with the furthering of value fetishism example 41 shows the advantages of logically modelling the formation of arguments and their probing in the context of our computational environment the example however does not present a complete application of our approach in that it cannot cater for the inconsistencies arising from the internal contradictions of esf and the value-based relations contained in the corresponding knowledge base the tentative quality of our example is not a matter of incremental development or a case of missing analytical pieces in the making our approach is incomplete for its non-classical logical rooting is its explanatory power even though vafs furnish the environment where high-level representations of values and preferences take hold the logical and concrete antinomies of conflicting forms of appropriating the pramo -induced by value-based relations -can only be fully appreciated through a logical account of their inconsistency or rather their paraconsistency thus example 41 is an effort to thematise this conjecture and by doing so it also illuminates some of the constitutive elements of our approach for the set of defensible arguments it entails and their connected actions operate on and prefigure their underlying contradictions the next section introduces the paraconsistent and dialetheic see section 2 model of logical entailment at the heart of our approach it substantiates our critical stance on ves and esf we examine a viable analytical extension to vafs leading rather to a different class of mathematical objects -semantics games -and proceed to illustrate their capacity to deal with contradictions arising from esf by way of two examples the section comes to an end with a brief discussion on the rationality of our critique and its methodological manifestation in section 2 we showed that the ontologisation of value is sustained by the assumption that freedom of contradiction is a crucial determinant of reality understood as the reproduction of the capitalist social praxis however our practical experience suggests otherwise thus impelling the abandonment of this thesis this section aims to corroborate that such observation and the critique of the valuebased categories from which it stems are not irrational we do this by constructing a game-theoretic object upon a logical model of entailment endowed with a dialectical fact which makes up for the shortcomings of the classical model in example 41 two main ideas were drawn from our discussion in section 2 and our analysis of example 41 first we concluded that freedom from contradiction does not provide an acceptable necessary condition for rationality rational belief or rational inquiry second we established that by allowing for an analytical framework amenable to inconsistencies there might be a way out of the fetishist constitution of value in ves or equivalently that by advancing the main points of our critical approach to valuation a viable form of methodological counter-praxis may arise what we want to do now is to incorporate the above conclusions into our computational environment in order to conduct a paraconsistent discursive analysis in line with our observations in section 4 we accomplish this by analysing dialogues in the form of an strategic interaction infused by the notion logical significance embedded in a d-model of entailment -a logical description of logical relations based on meaning as presented in anderson et al 2017  we use a game-theoretic formalism to tie up all these ideas together definition 51 dialectical dialogical game ddg a dialectical dialogical game is a tuple g  d n     where d is a d-model n indicates the number of players    g   l  is a well-defined set of rules where  g correspond to the structural characteristics of the strategic interactions while  l denotes their dialogical conditions we refer to the former as global rules and to the other as local rules  is a set of integers indicating the number of moves available to each agent which we term ranks before detailing the set of rules  we present the notational peculiarities of ddg the ddg formalism evokes dialogical logics beirlaen and fontaine 2016 and game-theoretic semantics rahman and carnielli 2000 to gain expressiveness in order to facilitate its presentation and secure a more succinct application we first introduce the corresponding formalism for a dialogue between two persons 2-ddg definition 52 2-ddg formalism let us suppose that players p the proponent and o the opponent play a ddg having  0       n1  as its initial thesis ie beginning with the claim that the conclusion  follows from the premises  0       n1  the players moves are assertions or requests which may serve to attack a defend d or inquire about a particular premise moves are represented as expressions of the form x-e where x is either p or o and e stands for either an assertion ie either a or d or a request ie a query the symbols  and  signal the agents assertions and requests respectively agents ranks r i  n i  1 2 with o 1 and p 2 indicate the number of attacks and defences they can play within the ddg agents assert their ranks as so o-n  r 1 and p-m  r 2  the counters of moves in ddg are denoted by p d  and are also referred to as the games position 4  definition 53 strategy a strategy of player x in d is a function s x that assigns a legal x-move to every non-terminal play the last member of which is a y-move definition 54 local 2-ddg rules  l  the local rules of a 2-ddg are as follows while noting that the winning criterion is semantically equivalent to a relation of entailment let us also observe that 2-ddg describes a process of semantic inference itself -that is it is a type of semantics game hintikka and sandu 1997  distinct from classical games 2-ddg gives a more robust grounding to the strategic interaction occurring between the two players to the point that the game can be approached as a dialogue this interpretation extends vafs in the sense that argumentation frameworks originally conceived as a backdrop for comparing arguments become structured environments of dialogue 5  to see this more clearly let us consider two minimal examples the following examples showcase two situations where a paramuno engages in a dialogue with an external researcher taking on the roles of the proponent and opponent respectively the dialogue in example 51 is centered on argument a 6 of example 41 posing the contradiction generated by reasoning about agriculture merely as an esf-mediated economic activity the dialogue in example 52 revolves around a new argument which makes explicit the contradiction ensuing from the interrelation between the use of ecosystem services conveyed in propositions a and h both examples are represented in a modified normal form the numbers in parenthesis indicate the index of the corresponding move while the numbers on the opposite side specify the index of the competing argument in square brackets appear alternative moves ie the branches of the game in extended form example 51 arguing the inconsistent thesis a 6 with 2-ddg given the contradiction in example 41 a 6  a  a a 2-ddg between a researcher and a paramuno respectively opposing and proposing this argument has the following form 2 the paramuno wins example 52 arguing the inconsistent thesis a 7 with 2-ddg given the contradiction in example 41 a 7  a a  h h  s  s  y a  a  a  a a 2-ddg between a researcher and a paramuno respectively opposing and proposing this argument has the following form o-a 1 p-r 4 5 p-a 6 the paramuno wins in example 51 as the researcher may only use an atomic statement already used by the paramuno responding to the agents inability to generate new assertions without producing a repetitive strategy modifies 2-ddgs winning criterion this situation results in the contradiction implicated by argument a 6 becoming a viable statement about which the researcher and the paramuno can reason it indicates that the paramuno predicament of both giving up the cultivation of some pramo sites while withdrawing from others does not occur as a consequence of irrational or uninformed behaviour but rather as a logical consequence of their objective conditions example 52 further tells us that not only is the contradiction valid but that refraining from growing crops is also a valid and non-trivial consequence of the contradiction the recognition of the fact that the pramo plays an indirect role in the provision of water used in agriculture while inscribed in the contradiction expounded on a 6  opens up the possibility of opting out of agriculture as a dialectic logical consequence with objective grounding rather than a mediated determination or ad-hoc imposition example 51 indicates that our approach is paraconsistent for 2-ddg can operate on inconsistencies example 52 shows that our approach is also dialetheic meaning that inconsistencies are not only valid but that they can be operated upon as to generate new conclusions eg on distinct ways of using the pramo we now proceed to show that ddg and by implication our approach is not irrational in the sense that arisotles principle of non-contradiction is correct under its subjacent logic let us note that ddgs d-model is endowed with the reversal operator   and an order  which behaves like cyclic relation the reversal operator takes a single situation to its dual eg takes b  a  a to b   a  a given a well-formed formula a  s the new order relation for its part establishes a terniary order among world situations ie the order b  a c of situations a b c  w indicates that situation b precedes c from the perspective of a or equivalently that after a b has to be reached before c under these definitions statements in s take on four possible values  t a holds in b but a does not  i a and a hold in b  n neither a nor a hold in b these conditions guarantee that most standard results on truth are forthcoming and that there are contradictory statements which are simultaneously true and in consequence valid say we have a ddgs d-model m such that for every argument c ic r  t iff c for some r  w  where w is the set of possible worlds of m then an argument a is classically false in ddgs d-model iff ia r  f  and truth is the property of all and only those arguments which are true in ddgs d-model m it is never the case that ia r  f and ia t   t ie no argument is both true and false but every argument is either true or false and false statements are unprovable it follows that since aa  a is a provable theorem it is valid in our d-model hence true ie ddgs d-model is not an irrational model of entailment the importance of abiding by aristotles principle while allowing for contradictions as objective constituents of sociality consists in the possibility of obviating the kantian idea -underpinning value fetishism -that consistency imposes a bound on rationality wedin 2004  just like hilberts idea that consistency ensures mathematical correctness sieg 2012  the identification of logical investigations with a preordained notion of the world does not hold to an extent ddg vindicates the position that dialectical investigations are viable for aristotle correctly formulated the principle of contradiction but erroneously inferred that the real could not be contradictory and that there are no contradictions in things routley and meyer 1976  since capitalist social praxis -as the substrate of our reality principle -is contradictory at its core a paraconsistent and dialetheic analysis is more adequate if the consequences of these contradictions are to be fully grasped in the next section we implement our computational environment with ddg interactions our approach operates on the dialogues and interactions captured in colombia between paramunos and researchers as well as those occurring within the paramuno community we reproduce said dialogues to discern distinct forms of appropriating the pramo emanating from our paraconsitent and dialetheic analysis of discourse this section presents the results of running our now fully fledged computational environment the data on which our computational environment operates comes from our interactions with the paramunos so we begin by recounting our conversations with them we then move on to interpreting our results through various graph-theoretic techniques and advancing some conclusions on how our dialogues with the paramunos may reshape the paramo itself and how they differ from typical ves prescriptions before looking into the practical upshot of our conceptual and analytical ruminations let us recall that our approach was conceived as in section 4 that is it consists of an elmo model for processing text data in natural language integrated into our ddg model in the manner of a continuous flow of the arguments and motivational states expressed by the people involved in the dialogues see figure 3  although the nlp model enhances our capacity to work with relatively unmediated dialogical inputs its role is merely instrumental -it is the ddg model that is central to our analysis the text corpus of our computational environment consists of clauses processed as arguments and motivational states composed of factual information in the form of premises -such as a standing for increased agricultural land-use or h standing for improved hydrological regulating services in section 4 and section 5 clauses are either facts or rules to derive new information in the spirit of prolog flach 1994  rules have a head an a body composed of facts while facts only consist of the head rules can be read as the head being true if the body of the rule is found true rules can be recursive ie they can be processed by solving smaller instances of the statements they declare after solving their basic case flach 1994  clauses indicating motivational states are distinguished from arguments if they imply a relation of order this distinction is achieved by calibrating the elmo model with the contextual information obtained from the transcriptions of informal dialogues with the paramunos multiple encounters were arranged with the locals we ran one workshop and engaged in less structured interactions with several paramunos individually and as members of a communitybased organisation in separate instances additional meetings were held with the authorities of the guanent-alto ro fonce wildlife sanctuary within the glr complex although a research protocol was drafted and observed some of these encounters occurred fortuitously enabling an immersive involvement rather than an observational experience the workshop was centered on various notions commonly associated with the idea of value it was divided into two parts beginning with a discussion on forest management practices as a means to motivating the construction of a time line depicting the various ways in which the pramo has been appropriated for the past three decades the second part was devoted to deconstructing value it comprised a series of didactic activities revisiting and introducing distinct notions that are sometimes unknowingly connected to that of value our objective was to prompt a debate on the apparent multiplicity of values and the existence of a common basis -if any for if a type of value is recognised as such there must be a fundamental quality that it shares with other types of values upholding said recognition the exploration of these ideas would either corroborate or not the extent to which the paramuno sociality could be considered of a value-based nature we use networks and graph-theoretic techniques to represent our dialogues and interactions with the paramunos and among themselves these devices are apt for presenting relational informational like the corpus at our disposal newman and ziff 2001  informally a network is a graph with contextual information ie a collection of vertices and weighted edges indicating certain relational properties figure 8 shows the links among several social actors in the pramo in accord with the baseline information reported by rojas et al 2017  the edges express a common actor typology and the size of the nodes reflect their degree of betweenness with respect to the information on water and agropastoral practices available to each actor unsurprisingly grassroots and community led organisations display larger values of betweennes for they are well-connected and in a better position to facilitate the transmission of information let us recall that betweenness is a centrality measure informing the number of shortest paths in a network that pass through a particular node opsahl et al 2010  as an indication of how much information is likely to flow through said node ie how much first-hand information a pramo actor is capable of communicating nine recurrent premises were identified by elmo while processing our corpus cattle raising in elevated areas natural parks cannot incorporate nature reserves natural parks have willingness to buy nature reserve in natural park oak coffee revert to burning tourism tradition to claim informal rights unclear legal property rights they are distributed within the pramo as shown in figure 10  figure 10 gives further evidence of the issues raised in section 3 as the more elevated areas are located within duitama the handful of paramunos who employ traditional practices involving cattle raising and burning can be found in this municipality the premises making up the arguments put forward reflect not only this situation but the ostensibly informal pattern of land occupation unlike duitama paramunos those based in encino and charal ie within the cloud forest belt or lower areas express a different bond with the pramo for they experience the pramo at one remove drawn by the pull of the economic drive of santander the pramo is seen as a secondary crossing point into boyac a source of productivity and a referent for the construction of social identity the particularity being that the semiotic burdens of these two latter meanings are conflated into premises upholding touristic activities entrepenurial initiatives -such as the production of oak coffee from quercus acorns see section 3 -and the creation of private natural reserves the graph in figure 9 displays the same network but with its nodes geolocated and adjusted by the occurrence of dialogues only those nodes corresponding to the persons or institutions taking part in the dialogues appear labelled and their connecting edges coloured that is the dialogues registered in our corpus took place in charal gmbita duitama beln and encino the majority of which occurred on the eastern side of the complex where the bulk of the regional economic activity is concentrated each plot in figure 11 shows how often the premise of an argument denoting an action on the pramo appears at a particular position in the final prioritisation orders these orders denote various arrangements of arguments satisfying the dialogical interactions expressed in 2-ddgs however the relative position of each argument does not necessarily represent a preference relation since the ciclicity of our d-models orders -ie the formal relations of order within ddgs logical model entailment -may prevent the construction of a choice function satisfying the basic axioms of economically rational preference formation sen 1993 hausman 2011  put differently the orders generated through ddg can be more adequately interpreted as concrete objective choices within inconsistent domains rather than preferences describing mental states complying with classically logical rational behaviour gul and pesendorfer 2008  the semantics of acceptance applied to ddg are based on the argumentation-theoretic concept of extension the results correspond to preferred complete grounded and resolution-based grounded extensions see section 4 a set of arguments in a ddg is complete if its members are conflict-free in the sense that they do not attack one another and if they have all survived dialogues similar to example 52 besnard and hunter 2009  a minimal with respect to settheoretic inclusion complete set of arguments constitutes a grounded extension in ddg cerutti et al 2014  its maximal with respect to set-theoretic inclusion counterpart is termed preferred extension walton 2009  a preferred extension that is topologically closed is further qualified as a resolution-based extension baroni et al 2011  complete preferred and resolution-based extensions are thus comprised of relatively less stable arguments grounded extensions on the contrary impose stringent conditions on the arguments surviving ddgs see the plot at the lower left of figure 11  which makes them robust to dialogical attacks after reproducing existing -and simulating new -dialogues while observing the topology of our network in figure 9 and ddgs semantic properties we conclude that 1 the highest ranked actions -ienatural parks cannot incorporate nature reserves natural parks have willingness to buy nature reserve in natural park unclear legal property rights and convites -involve multiple inconsistencies residing in the legal and formal obstacles to extend protected areas within the pramo through the incorporation of private nature reserves 2 reverting to burning and cattle grazing at elevated locations is a likely outcome -ie these actions occur at the first position of the prioritisation order in one out of every two dialogues -whenever eg inconsistencies are probed for a resolution as demonstrated by the non-grounded extensions in figure 11  3 the application of ddgs with grounded semantics see the plot at the lower left of figure  11  reveals that tourism and entrepreneurial activities aligned with conservation objectives induce an order where inconsistencies are appeased in the sense that the fact that natural parks cannot incorporate nature reserves on account of unclear legal property rights has to be dealt with before addressing those arguments advocating the creation of nature reserves within the natural park 4 convites -ie traditional forms of cooperative and reciprocal labour associated with the paramuno identity as much as burning and grazing rivera-ospina and rodrguez-murcia 2011 -appear in the grounded extension as one of the most robust arguments only second to the oak acorn drink initiative suggesting that alternative forms of social praxis offer a way of coping with the contradictions engendered by value-based relations rather than conducting a hypothesis test on the prioritisation data we situate the statistical evaluation of our findings directly in the analysis of the glr network the evaluation of our results involves estimating the stable state of the argument-based glr networks topology as described by the dialogical outcomes of grounded ddgs we do this to foretell the likelihood of long-term changes in the configuration of the existing social relations in the pramo attributable to the actions suggested by our approach the graphs in figure 12 and figure 13 represent stable configurations of the networks in figure 8 and figure 9  respectively the new graphs were obtained by minimizing the microcanonical entropy of the different network realisations see bianconi 2009  enabled by grounded ddg interactions through an agglomerative mcmc heuristic peixoto 2013  this means that the entropy induced figure 13  stable block configuration of the glr network under grounded ddg by our grounded dialogues is used to estimate the probability of nodes and edges -ie pramo actors and their relations -of falling within a particular block partition of the glr network by way of an algorithmically greedy mcmc sampling of the blocks -ie an agglomerative heuristic peixoto 2014  figure 8 indicates that the municipalities of duitama paipa paz del ro and soata originally make up the four blocks explaining the socio-economic dynamics of the glr complex duitama and paz del ro concentrate most of the actors belonging to the productive and institutional typologies described in rojas et al 2017 see table 3 a and table 4 a these actors were relatively unconcerned with the grassroots processes occurring on the eastern parts of the complex in a scenario prior to the official delimitation of the pramo rivera-ospina and rodrguez-murcia 2011 rojas et al 2017  figure 13  shows how that the original network shifts into a six block configuration once our results are accounted for under these new circumstances some of the actors in duitama and paipa loose their importance judged in terms of block-connectivity whereas the social actors of municipalities like encino and charal -namely community-based associations and the natural parks authority -gain notoriety it is also worth noting that the municipalities of charal and gmbita establish new bonds across the geographical boundaries of the glr complex from south to north duitama is now connected to charal by way of the integrative efforts of grassroots associations mobilising geographically disconnected paramunos towards collective projects revolving around tourism from west to east gmbita appears as pivotal to consolidate the conservation initiatives put forward by the authorities based in encino as the gmbita paramunos have devoted large areas to the conservation of quercus forests and still rely on convites and similar practices table 4 details the blocks by municipalities and actor typology further to the changes in the spatial connectivity of the paramunos evidenced through figures  12 -13 and tables 3 -4 we examined the qualitative connections highlighted by our ddg analysis to this effect we estimated the correlation between the blocks in each configuration using the information on agropastoral and water management practices reported in rojas et al 2017  and our previous results let us note in passing that the ensuing analysis does not necessarily conform to a spatial interpretation for the various configurations of our networks of agents were obtained by looking at criteria which are not directly dependent on geographical considerations -eg block 4 of the grounded network is composed of pramo actors from the beln charal and encino municipalities see table 3 b figures 14 a -b show the degree of correlation among the blocks of our baseline and grounded networks measured as the number of edges links generated among the corresponding blocks throughout their mcmc sampling the former figure indicates that all municipalities -as the blocks of the baseline network can be mapped to municipalities -are correlated to duitama although the dependence is not reciprocal the unilateral connection between paz del ro and duitama -signalled by the yellow box in figure 14 a -can be explained by the functioning of one of the largest steelworks in the former municipality which created a considerable demand for agricultural produce satisfied via duitama also serving as a link for the transportation of steel into bogot rojas et al 2017  to this day duitama is still considered one of the main commercial and manufacturing centres of the boyac province while confirming the preponderance of duitama -a strong bond with paz del ro is evidenced by the light green square connecting blocks 3 and 0 -a series of new relations with the beln charal and encino paramunos -all belonging to block 4 -become apparent in figure 14 b at the same time the close ties between the national parks authorities and the community-based associations based in charal are now clearly discernible by the formation of an average of 100 links between pramo actors in blocks 2 and 4 this statistical evidence indicates that the network of relational connections among the paramunos is resilient from an information-theoretic point of view in this paper we discern a methodological praxis to cater for the appropriation of the colombian pramo by way of negating the notion of value and related categories contra the valuation of ecosystem services ves and the ecosystem services framework esf we argue that a historically and materially situated -hence objective -approach to value is the better means to grapple with the sociality of the pramo see section 3 by observing the historical specificity of value we recognise the contradictions it fosters and their effects on the ecology of the pramo and by operating on these contradictions rather than treating or attempting to resolve them we elucidate more sensible decisions as to how the pramo can be used and re-signified ves is built upon the idea that value is either a subjective notion reflecting a fundamental property of all things in nature or an ontological category itself in this way the social mediating quality of value is lost to subjectifying or essentialising exegeses of our relation with nature ves and esf by implication are thus touted necessary for the incorporation of natures value into the general process of valorisation underpinning economic growth so that nature can be better appreciated and conserved it is as though ves practitioners would set out to solve the problems created by value-based social relations precisely by furthering the relations themselves the people of the pramo ie paramunos are receptive to the ves ethos our time with the paramunos of guantiva-la rusia revealed that they are committed to transitioning from traditional agropastoral practices towards entreprenurial activities centered on agroeco-tourism while striving to reinterpret preserve campesinos as local subjects of the world market this conscious effort to participate in the global dynamics of value reproduction may provoke the cessation of burning and grazing in the pramo grasslands but also the adoption of value-based relations which seem to occur by fiat since the pramo sociality is in this sense fraught with contradictions and also far from trivial our approach should be amenable to inconsistencies while being capable of generating meaningful conclusions therefrom ie our approach should be paraconsistent and dialetheic in consequence we propose a collection of computational techniques that reproduce dialogical settings where actions on the pramo are intentionally or otherwise conflated with the notion of value these techniques delineate an environ for all interested stakeholders to put forward their views on how the pramo can be construed and pit these arguments against one another as a means to prioritise over multiple and often conflicting management practices at the heart of our computational environment lies a paraconsistent and dialetheic model of logical entailment our main contribution is posed in terms of the formalisation and implementation of this model as a new type game-theoretic object -a dialectical dialogical game ddg for ddg emanates directly from our critique of value it is considered apt for understanding valuerelated categories and inferring actions from them instrumental to the application of ddgs is the natural language processing algorithm -an elmo model -generating the arguments and motivational states expressed by those involved in the dialogues thus implemented ddgs were used to recreate our interactions with the locals augmenting the baseline information on the guantiva-la rusia pramo reported in rojas et al 2017  these latter information also served to delineate a baseline network of pramo actors upon which to run our dialogues the analysis of the resulting networks indicate that and convites -involve multiple inconsistencies residing in the legal and formal obstacles to extend protected areas within the pramo through the incorporation of private nature reserves 2 reverting to burning and cattle grazing at elevated locations is a likely outcome -ie these actions occur at the first position of the prioritisation order in one out of every two dialogueswhenever eg inconsistencies are probed for a resolution as demonstrated by non-grounded solutions of ddg 3 the application of ddgs with grounded semantics reveals that tourism and entrepreneurial activities of the like induce an order where inconsistencies are appeased in the sense that the fact that natural parks cannot incorporate nature reserves on account of unclear legal property rights has to be dealt with before addressing any argument advocating the creation of nature reserves within the natural park 4 convites -ie traditional forms of cooperative and reciprocal labour associated with the paramuno identity as much as burning and grazing-appear in the grounded extensions of ddgs as one of the most robust arguments only second to the oak acorn drink initiative suggesting that alternative forms of social praxis offer a way of coping with the contradictions engendered by value-based relations 5 from south to north duitama and charal municipalities are connected by way of the integrative efforts of grassroots associations mobilising geographically disconnected paramunos towards collective projects revolving around tourism from west to east the gmbita municipality appears as pivotal to consolidate the conservation initiatives put forward by the authorities based in encino as the gmbita paramunos have devoted large areas to the conservation of quercus forests and still rely on convites and similar practices 6 while confirming the preponderance of duitama a series of new relations among the beln charal and encino paramunos become apparent furthermore the close ties between the national parks authorities and the community-based associations based in charal are clearly discernible the statistical evidence supporting these findings suggest that the network of relational connections among the paramunos is resilient from an information-theoretic point of view we leave the formal proofs of ddgs properties and the development of the theory of the greater class of dialetheic semantics games to which it belongs for future work extensions of the simple sentential version of the 4-valued paraconsistent logic underpinning ddg is also left for future research the fruition of this forthcoming work will be decisive to the analysis of an augmenting corpus of dialogues and the prospect of including more intricate interactions finally it is equally relevant to determine the feasibility of tertiarising the economy of the paramo -along the lines of the entrepreneurial initiatives identified through 2-ddgs -in the face of the covid-19 crisis we believe that ddgs and their accompanying conceptual and methodological frameworks are apt to conduct this latter task  use of ribavirin in viruses other than hepatitis c a review of the evidence  german ramrez-olivencia miriam estbanez francisco membrillo javier maria del carmen ybarra  ribavirin is a molecule with antiviral activity against different viruses in clinical practice it has made its niche almost exclusively for the treatment of the hepatitis c virus however there are other diseases in which it could be of benefit and it has the advantage of being suitable for oral intravenous and inhaled administration we conducted a review of the indications of the main drug agencies spanish european and american and other possible indications mainly haemorrhagic fevers and coronavirus palabras clave ribavirina virazole 1-f8-d-ribofuranosil-124-triazol-3carboxamida r e s u m e n la ribavirina es una molcula con actividad antiviral sobre diferentes virus ha encontrado su hueco en la

oral por va intravenosa e inhalada es una caracterstica beneficiosa en este trabajo se realiza una revisin de las indicaciones en las principales agencias del medicamento espaola europea y americana as como de otras posibles indicaciones principalmente sobre fiebres hemorrgicas y coronavirus  ribavirin is a molecule which was synthesised for the first time in 1972 it is also known by the name of virazole or 1-f8d-ribofuranosyl-124-triazole-3-carboxamide it is a pyrimidine nucleoside which was designed as an in vitro broad-spectrum agent and the first description was published in the journal science 1 the action on both dna herpes virus 1 and 2 murine cytomegalovirus vaccine virus adenovirus type 3 and rna viruses rabies-related viruses virus responsible for myxoma parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3 influenza a and b rhinovirus 1a 13 and 56 coxsackie b poliovirus type 2 vesicular stomatitis virus and semliki forest virus were detailed in this work subsequently its activity on other viral diseases was determined and it found its place in clinical practice almost exclusively for the treatment of hepatitis c virus hcv in this paper a review of the references in the pubmed database up to 31 december 2017 was carried out crossing in english the keyword ribavirin with those corresponding to the following viruses or diseases adenovirus hantavirus syncytial respiratory virus lassa fever crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever argentinian haemorrhagic fever and coronavirus articles written in english and in spanish were reviewed preferentially selecting the metaanalyses for each disease in the event that they did not exist phase i ii iii and iv clinical trials were reviewed finally if they were not found in the previous searches a review of the cases or case series 2529-993x 2018 elsevier espaa slu and sociedad espaola de enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologa clnica all rights reserved published was performed in some cases references to other works were obtained from the articles reviewed different mechanisms of action have been proposed for this molecule and the most likely scenario is that it works in different ways in different viruses 2 the first mechanism that has been suggested is the interference in the de novo synthesis of the guanosine derivatives in particular guanosine triphosphate gtp  inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase catalyses the formation of xanthine monophosphate from inosine monophosphate to subsequently continue the synthesis pathway of the guanosine derivatives ribavirin monophosphate is capable of competitively and potently inhibiting this enzyme reducing the reserves of these nucleotides or nucleosides to half in the treated cells antiviral activity parallel to the depletion of gtp reserves has been demonstrated in studies with the yellow fever virus and paramyxovirus such as the respiratory syncytial virus rsv secondly an immunomodulatory activity has been suggested indicating that ribavirin may increase the activity of t lymphocytes and in particular th lymphocytes this hypothesis was based on the observation that during the treatment with ribavirin in patients infected with hcv it could reduce cytolysis without modifying the circulating viral load therefore it would not have an exclusively antiviral effect the observation that the l-enantiomer of ribavirin levovirin does not present direct antiviral activity being capable of also producing an induction of the th1 response in the murine model supported this hypothesis however it has not been possible to recognise the immunomodulatory effect in vivo and even in mathematical models designed for this it is concluded that the effect is based on direct antiviral activity another mechanism that has been proposed is that of direct inhibition of the polymerase the main intracellular metabolite of ribavirin is ribavirin triphosphate rtp in this way it could be a competitive inhibitor of other similar nitrogenous bases such as adenosine triphosphate atp or gtp this effect has been observed in studies conducted with the influenza virus reovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus some rna viruses contain a structure with 7-methylguanosine which is essential for the stability of rna and which is synthesised in three different catalytic processes in other viruses the translation process is measured by a molecule known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e eif4e the ribavirin molecule could interact with the enzymes responsible for capping rna cap synthesis or bind to eif4e preventing the start of translation this mechanism could be responsible for the antiviral activity observed in some viruses lassa fever sars lastly a mechanism of mutagenesis has been proposed given the structural similarity the incorporation of ribavirin in the rna chain would be possible and would produce mutant viruses during replication however this would not only alter the original chain replacing gtp with rtp but also the binding to the complementary bases cytidine and thymidine or uracil has the same efficacy this is due to the spatial arrangement and the flexibility in the rotation of a carboxamide group the mutagenic effect of ribavirin has been demonstrated in studies with poliovirus hand-foot-and-mouth disease west nile virus and hantavirus as we have mentioned previously the clinical use of ribavirin is almost exclusively limited to the treatment of hcv infection however when a review is performed of the indications in the main medicines agencies spanish agency of medicines and medical devices european medicines agency and us food and drug administration fda other less well-known approved indications can be found  the drug virazole in the form of vials for respiratory inhalation can be found on the website of the spanish agency of medicines and medical devices 3 there is no mention of the specific indication stating that the drug is not currently marketed in spain and that there are supply problems it was used in aerosols in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection caused by rsv treatment consisted of nebulisation for 12-18 h for a period of three to seven days  on the european medicines agencys website 4 two applications of ribavirin which have been investigated apart from the indication for hcv are also found these are for adenovirus infections and hantavirus infections in both cases it was decided to withdraw its consideration in these indications  finally the approval of virazole for nebulisation is indicated on the fdas website 5 although the conditions are not specified we will now review the clinical evidence of the effectiveness of ribavirin for treating infections caused by rsv adenovirus and hantavirus there is a meta-analysis carried out by the cochrane database of systematic reviews 6 in relation to the use of ribavirin in lower respiratory tract infections in children and adolescents with two subsequent updates and one withdrawn in 2010 the latest review is therefore the one published in 2007 in this review after analysing 12 clinical trials the conclusion is reached that ribavirin is not effective at reducing mortality or in the development of respiratory deterioration however a reduction in the hospital stay and in the number of days of mechanical ventilation approximately two days in both cases is observed another different aspect of the use of ribavirin in transplant recipients was the treatment of respiratory infections caused by rsv shah and chemaly 7 carried out a review of the literature regarding the works performed on adult transplant recipients with rsv infection and published between 1980 and 2010 they evaluated 26 studies both prospective and retrospective randomised and observational clinical trials in which the main variable was mortality attributed to rsv or disease progression the use of ribavirin in any form aerosolised oral or intravenous appeared in these works the overall conclusion is that the use of ribavirin whether or not it was associated with immunoglobulins reduced progression to disease of the lower respiratory tracts and reduced mortality inhaled ribavirin was useful but it was especially more effective when associated with immunoglobulin although its diffusion in the consolidated parenchyma could be reduced the cost was the main drawback of this therapy approximately 50000 per patient firstly it must be pointed out that when the published literature was reviewed 109 articles in pubmed there were no meta-analyses or clinical trials the scientific evidence is available from case series and isolated cases there are seven published case series 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and 21 isolated cases which accounts in total for published experience on less than 150 cases tables 1 and 2  as can be observed there is heterogeneity both regarding the virus treated serotypes and in the characteristics of the patients age gender risk factors and in the syndromes produced pneumonia cystitis digestive disease focaldisseminated disease disease progression time combination with other drugs etc therefore a conclusion cannot be obtained and for this reason its use has not been approved to date regarding the use of ribavirin in diseases caused by hantavirus there is a meta-analysis published in 2014 by moreli et al 36 which is worthy of an in-depth review it is a systematic review in which 518 studies are identified after applying the exclusion criteria only seven studies can be analysed which accounts for a total of 506 patients two groups haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in addition to two subgroups studies conducted in animals 4 or in humans 3  are distinguished overall mortality was 35 in the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome group a randomised study and three prospective cohorts were identified in the animal studies a reduction in mortality was observed in the treatment group versus placebo but not in the studies in humans with a mortality rate in both groups of 40 in the haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome group three studies were included a reduction in mortality was observed when ribavirin was used compared to placebo 25 versus 85 mortality with a relative risk rr of 056 042-076 in both the animal and human subgroups with the existing data in this meta-analysis it could be suggested that old world hantavirus infections haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome could benefit from the use of ribavirin whereas it would not be useful in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome the authors state that they have not been able to consider the time from diagnosis to the administration of ribavirin hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has a mortality rate of 50 and may indicate a more rapid progression of the disease than in haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome which has a mortality rate of 15 this would be a key factor indicating the greater need to start therapy at an early stage another bias may have been the restriction of works selected according to language only works published in english spanish or portuguese were selected given that china has the most cases of hantavirus with haemorrhagic fever in the period from 1950 to 2007 a total of 1557622 cases of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were reported with a clear tendency to reduce the incidence it is possible that a priori information published in chinese has been eliminated which would modify the results obtained lastly it must be taken into account that the list of hantaviruses is extensive 23 including the hantaan seoul puumala and dobrava viruses for haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and the sin nombre and andes viruses in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome the heterogeneity between viruses not only between syndromes may determine the results this is what may be indicated by a recent study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ribavirin in the treatment of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by the puumala virus which does not benefit from the use of ribavirin 37 it was an open randomised study on 73 patients of whom 36 received standard support therapy and 37 the same therapy in addition to intravenous ribavirin the study was not able to demonstrate efficacy in clinical aspects or in viral kinetics in the treatment with important side effects mainly anaemia hyperbilirubinaemia sinus bradycardia and skin rash when a review is performed of the treatment of lassa fever with ribavirin 108 publications are obtained however when the clinical trials and meta-analyses are evaluated only one reference in relation to the effectiveness of the treatment is found 38 it is a study conducted in sierra leone in 1986 by the ministry of health in collaboration with the centers for disease control and prevention he also had other comorbidities such as splenectomy and pancreatectomy and mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection c death due to colon adenocarcinoma cases of disease due to mers-cov treated with interferon and ribavirin regimen a 2000 mg as loading dose 600 mg8 h 3 days and 400 mg8 h for 4 days regimen b loading dose 400 mg 0-600 mg and subsequently 1200 mg12 h the doses of lopinavirritonavir were 400100 mg12 h administered orally regimen c loading dose 2000 mg and then 1200 mg8 h orally cdc which started in 1977 and in which the administration of convalescent plasma oral ribavirin and intravenous ribavirin was evaluated the study is rather complex however despite this fact it can be concluded that treatment with intravenous or oral ribavirin is recommended at any time of the disease with it being more effective in the first six days of the disease initially a phase i casecontrol study of the clinical and diagnostic aspects of lassa fever in untreated patients was designed 30 clinical and laboratory variables were collected which were analysed subsequently and once these variables were collected a randomised trial was conducted with 70 patients 39 with oral ribavirin and 31 with plasma pregnant women were included without being randomised in the latter group without knowing at this time the results of the analysis of the variables collected in all cases treatment was started in the first 24 h subsequently elevation of transaminases and viraemia greater than 1000 copiesml were identified as poor prognosis variables at a later stage after the variables indicating poor prognosis had been determined a phase ii study was developed selecting the patients with one of the poor prognosis variables elevation of transaminases upon diagnosis viraemia was not available two groups of patients 29 patients in the intravenous ribavirin group and 33 in the intravenous ribavirin plus plasma group were randomised pregnant women received only two plasma units overall treatment with ribavirin reduced mortality this included the analysis of the patients included both in the phase i study and in the phase ii study in patients with viraemia 1000 copiesml and treated with ribavirin mortality was lower than in those who were not receiving treatment mortality with intravenous ribavirin of 32 versus 76 without therapy p  000015 mortality with oral ribavirin of 30 versus 76 without therapy p  0008 the same occurred if the viraemia was 1000 copiesml mortality with intravenous ribavirin of 9 versus 28 without therapy p  002 mortality with oral ribavirin of 7 versus 28 without therapy p  001 there is a second study conducted by fisher-hoch et al 39 which appears in pubmed as a clinical trial regarding the use of ribavirin in lassa fever although it is true that it refers to its use in a clinical trial what it describes is the onset of an adverse effect which is associated with recovery shiveringchills and what seems to be related to the speed of administration of the drug 1 min these side effects disappeared after correcting the speed of infusion some studies have been conducted to evaluate ribavirin as post-exposure prophylaxis but they have not provided conclusive results 40 41 crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever there is only one randomised clinical trial which evaluates the use of ribavirin for crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever conducted between 2004 and 2007 with 136 patients 42 in a baseline form there were no differences in gender age incubation period around five days clinical or analytical characteristics the administration of ribavirin was done before confirming the diagnosis meaning that the time to administration of it was around four days no differences were found in terms of mortality analytical recovery or length of hospital stay subsequently two meta-analyses evaluated the usefulness of ribavirin for crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever the first is from 2010 43 and reviews 21 works the conclusion that the authors draw is that ribavirin in the clinical trial was not superior to not using ribavirin but in the joint evaluation of all the results mortality was reduced rr 056 95 ci 035-090 955 participants what was not found was a difference in duration of the hospital admission the second meta-analysis is from 2011 44 and also includes the only randomised clinical trial but only seven more works which are observational with control group are introduced no benefit of ribavirin with the aggregated data is found either both meta-analyses underline the risk of bias in all the works whether it be selection external validity or attrition bias ribavirin has not managed to demonstrate its usefulness in the reduction of mortality due to the junin virus argentine haemorrhagic fever in two very small clinical trials 45 46 nevertheless in the first study blocked viral replication and a delay in the time to death was observed compared with historical controls clearance of viraemia was even obtained in patients who died in this phase of the disease the virus is detected in up to 80 of cases given that there is a treatment which has proven to be effective if administered in the first seven days of the disease convalescent serum studies which used ribavirin were conducted in advanced stages of the disease which would justify the poor outcomes it is probably not possible to conduct new studies in this regard since there is also a vaccine which has proven to be effective at reducing the incidence of the disease 47 there are practically no reported cases of the machupo virus treated with ribavirin bolivian haemorrhagic fever only two isolated cases in which intravenous ribavirin was administered and they recovered 48 the same applies to cases of sabia virus in 1995 one case of sabia virus was treated with intravenous ribavirin managing to cure the patient 49  one retrospective study was conducted in 44 patients with coronavirus 50 to compare the combination of interferon and ribavirin versus placebo observing an improvement in survival at 14 70 vs 29 and 28 days 30 vs 17 in favour of the combination table 4 case series of disease due to mers-cov treated with ribavirin  ifn of drugs although the difference at 28 days was not statistically significant probably due to the small sample size the mean treatment initiation time with ribavirin was three days in addition isolated cases 51-55 and case series 56-60 which reflect variable degrees of therapeutic success tables 3 and 4  have been reported new applications of ribavirin are currently being investigated four studies to investigate its usefulness in influenza three on arbovirus three on hepatitis b three on hantavirus two on paramyxovirus two on coxsackie virus and one on coronavirus are registered ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral that is currently looking for a new role in the treatment of various infections its availability for administration via the oral intravenous or inhaled route is a beneficial characteristic there is evidence of benefit in rsv infection and lassa fever with its use being proposed in certain situations of disease due to hantavirus crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever and coronavirus such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the availability of ribavirin in oral formulation currently exists in spain while the inhaled and intravenous forms must be requested through the spanish agency of medicines and medical devices  integrating landscape hierarchies in the discovery and modeling of ecological drivers of zoonotically transmitted disease from wildlife christon hurst j douglas goodin g colleen jonsson b linda allen j robert owen d   zoonotic diseases or zoonoses are infectious diseases transmitted to humans from animals and may be bacterial viral or parasitic in origin approximately 58 of the pathogens associated with infectious diseases in humans have originated through spillover from wildlifeeg ebolaviruses hantaviruses coronaviruses henipaviruses jones et al 2008 lloyd-smith et al 2009 smith et al 2014 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 since 1980 zoonotic pathogens represent the bulk of the outbreaks in human populations in both number 87 versus 13 by vector-borne pathogens and diversity smith et al 2014 the recently reported increase in zoonoses has been attributed to a variety of reasons although a major driver is changes in land use resulting from the increased demands of human populations on the natural environment through agriculture intensification and deforestation jones et al 2013 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 land alteration for food production broadly defined to include both agriculture and pastoral activities has produced profound changes in the type and structure of the earths vegetation cover it has also altered the way humans interact with their environment for example in some geographical areas suppressing wildlife-human interaction eg contact with large predators common among hunter-gathers and instead favoring contact between humans and peridomestic species such as rodents which are common reservoirs for many zoonotic pathogens numerous examples of emergent zoonoses have often accompanied land clearance and hence there has been great interest in understanding how land cover change and the cascade of ecological effects associated with it are ecologically associated with emerging infectious diseases mcfarlane et al 2013 woolhouse and gowtage-sequeria 2005 a persistent question in modeling of pathogen emergence is what is the spatial scale at which these processes occur how do we measure and integrate the impact of processes that occur at varying and nested spatial scales that result in the observed disease distribution watts et al 2005 for example climate which can vary in scale from local to continental and landscape are each associated with disease patterns and have been cited as factors in zoonotic disease outbreaks land cover change and land-use intensification often occurs at finer scales than climate and can thus be thought of as nested within the climate system at still finer scales population dynamics and habitat interactions of the pathogen and its reservoir communities and indeed with the human populations vulnerable to disease transmissions from these communities occur within the climate and landscape scales and are influenced but not necessarily determined by them this hierarchical nesting fig 91 of these processes complicates the overall study and modeling of the spillover and transmission dynamics of wildlife pathogens to human populations however there are existing bodies of theory which can help shed light on these processes hence we review some of these conceptual ideas focusing especially on landscape epidemiology a body of theory first developed in the 1930s and more recently updated to include modern tools and techniques for studying both disease and environmental process ostfeld et al 2005 and hierarchy theory a framework which incorporates the idea of multiple nested spatial scales allen and starr 1982
 in the following we will review how a spatially hierarchical approach can be used to guide research into the links between landscape properties and zoonotic diseases this will show how landscape concepts have been used to analyze the occurrence and spatial patterning of zoonotic diseases and how many of these studies are being conducted at particular spatial scales this review will be followed by an illustration of how an integrated cross-scale analysis might be employed to gain a deeper understanding of the ecology of zoonotic diseases using an example from our own research as earlier noted methodological advances have played a role in the revival of landscape epidemiology we will therefore discuss the role of methodologies such as geospatial analysis and mathematical modelingagain using examples drawn from our current research we will show how cross-scale analysis might be employed to gain a deeper understanding of the ecology of zoonotic diseases finally we will provide an overview of how hierarchical research strategies and modeling might be generally used in analyses of infectious zoonoses originating in wildlife hierarchy in ecology is a multifaceted theory incorporating elements of nonlinear dynamics and complexity for a comprehensive treatment of hierarchy theory see allen and starr 1982 the fundamental concept of hierarchy theory is that processes occurring at finer scales ie lower in the spatial hierarchy are constrained by processes at higher levels hierarchical levels can also be distinguished by the rates at which ecological processes occurfaster at finer scales slower at coarser ones hierarchy theory in ecology arose as a response to the need for a rigorous method of handling middle-number systems that is systems whose components are too few to treat statistically but too many to address with classical newtonian mathematics hierarchy provides a framework by which these middle number systems can be decomposed into a series of manageable units whose environmental drivers can be characterized by the scale and thus the rate at which they occur such a framework is amenable to the study of landscape epidemiology since the linkages between environmental factors and disease are often multivariate nonlinear and not confined to a specific spatial scale spatial scale is a crucial aspect of hierarchy theory any discussion of the relationship between ecological process and scale therefore must first define how the term is used and to what characteristic dimensions these terms apply these definitions are complicated by the number of ways that the term scale is used scale is frequently referred to by descriptive adjectives such as large or small which meentemeyer 1989 noted can have opposing meaning depending on whether one is referring to cartographic scale where small scale refers to less spatial detail or ecological scale where smaller scale equates to smaller spatial area and greater detail ecologists generally distinguish between the grain and extent of a process where extent refers to the area over which a process occurs and grain denotes the smallest resolvable component of the process typically grain can be described as either fine indicating small resolvable elements or coarse indicating larger elements thus we might characterize the scale process like tropical deforestation as occurring at relatively large extent because a large area is affected but at relatively fine grain because the individual deforested units can be quite small csillag et al 2000 argue that for ecological uses of scale it is preferable to adopt specific terminology to distinguish between extent and grain in hierarchy theory spatial extent is probably the more commonly used sense of scale jenerette and wu 2000 in describing spatial hierarchies it is often useful to apply descriptive names to realms of scale terms such as global continental regional and local are often used although the precise areas referred to often vary for our review of hierarchy in infectious disease analysis we will operationally define continental scale as areas exceeding 106 km2 regional scales as ranging from 103 km2106 km2 local scale from 101103 km2 and microscale 101 km2 the lower end of the microscale represents the general size range of a small rodents world landscape analyses across spatial scale frequently use remote sensing data kitron et al 2006 wu 1999 currently imagery is available from an array of orbital sensors with widely varying spatial temporal and spectral resolutions table 91 grain size or resolution as it is more commonly termed in remote sensing is an engineered property of these sensors dependent on the optical characteristics of the sensor and orbital characteristics of the platform theoretically there are no limitations to the extent of any of these systems although practical limitations particularly cost of data acquisition dictate a rough correspondence between extent and resolution thus the extents listed in table 91 are based on these practical limitations the variety of remote sensor data available has certainly facilitated hierarchical landscape analysis but in some sense it has also imposed limitations each remote sensor represents a window through which ecological process at some combination of grain size and extent can be observed these limitations also extend to the range of spectral wavelengths each sensor can detect and the number and width of bands in which these wavelengths are detected combining these discrete views into an integrated picture is a central challenge for hierarchical analysis of infectious disease processes
 landscape structure refers to the pattern and arrangement of habitats on the earths surface like all landscape variables structure is complex it varies with scale and per organism the same landscape might be structurally very different for birds small mammals such as rodents and larger animals and since zoonotic disease reservoirs vary in their body size and habitat structural effects on disease also vary structure can arise naturally due to topographic edaphic meaning related to the soil or climatic conditions as well as through human landscape alteration both types of structural changes can be relevant to disease processes landscape structure has been related to zoonotic disease at a variety of spatial scales at regional scale russell et al 2006 show how natural landscape barriers such as rivers and preferred habitat can limit rabies spread by raccoons and be used to manage wildlife through vaccination efforts smith et al 2002 used landscape heterogeneity as a predictor of the spread of rabies langlois et al 2001 showed that the distribution of hantavirus-bearing rodents in north america was influenced by landscape fragmentation their analysis was unusual in that the extent of the study was continental but the grain size was local 1 km estrada-pea and oteo 1991 showed that landscape structure particularly landscape connectivity showed a strong influence on the abundance of lyme disease vectors in spain land cover changes are known to affect zoonotic diseases through controls on the population dynamics of reservoir species especially wild mammals as well as disease vectors patz et al 2008 giraudoux et al 2003 used regional-scale land cover changes in france and china to show how host mammal communities affect transmission dynamics of the endoparasite echinococcus multilocularis using the rompa ratio of optimal to marginal patch area hypothesis of lidicker and others it has been shown that regional-scale landscape dynamics of intermediate host species can in turn affect parasite egg survival and transmission lidicker 1995 the giraudoux et al 2003 study also considered the role of landscape change on establishing minimum thresholds which they termed filters or screens of suitability for disease transfer agriculture practices led to the nipah virus outbreak in malaysia epstein et al 2006 pulliam et al 2012 using a combination of field laboratory and modeling approaches these efforts have supported the hypothesis that emergences of viruses such as nipah are due to ecological and not evolutionary drivers these findings underscore the importance of having multidisciplinary teams work together to build predictive models for discovery of the relationships between anthropogenic environmental change and the transmission or spillover of infectious agents climate-driven landscape change in this context refers to the effect of atmospheric processes most notably precipitation on the habitat of zoonotic host organisms variations in rainfall magnitude and frequency have notable effects on vegetation phenology causing variations in surface greenness that can be tracked using remote-sensing instruments de beurs and henebry 2004 reed et al 2009 the emergence of several zoonotic diseases including hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps yates et al 2002 argentine hemorrhagic fever simone et al 2010 and bolivian hemorrhagic fever kilgore et al 1995 can be clearly linked to landscape several studies have linked climate-driven changes to patterns of disease occurrence at different spatial scales two groups have evaluated the relationship between temporal patterns of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and occurrence of ebola virus in west africa pinzon et al 2004 tucker et al 2002 they found that ndvi trajectories showed distinctive trigger events prior to occurrences of the disease in humans and apes which they hypothesized might be used to forecast conditions conducive to outbreaks of ebola hemorrhagic fever the remotely sensed data for this analysis came from the noaa-avhrr sensor with continental spatial extent and observation grain size pixel resolution of 1 km2 the observed ndvi trajectories were related to precipitation patterns reinforcing the link between climate and disease occurrence estrada-pea and oteo 1991 and estrada-pea et al 2006 used coarse resolution vegetation index data to model and predict the continental-scale relationship between climate-driven landscape change and lyme disease again the resolution and extent of this study were consistent with the idea that climate constrains disease processes at higher levels in the spatial hierarchy at finer spatial scales glass et al 2000 used patterns of reflectance in landsat thematic mapper tm data to statistically model the presence of hps in the southwestern united states at this spatial scale the spectral response of the surface incorporates climatic factors especially antecedent precipitation but also integrates structural and compositional factors of the vegetation canopy itself models based on these techniques have shown some utility for predicting hantavirus cases glass et al 2002 hierarchy theory suggests that processes at coarser grain also occur over longer time frames and can often be assumed to be static with respect to finer-scale processes the phylogeographical patterns of south american hantaviruses within the southern cone el cono sur a subcontinental region roughly defined as consisting of the country argentina often including chile plus sometimes considered to include uruguay and paraguay mapped with environment at the coarsest spatial scales chu et al 2006 in other words the phylogenetic clades of hantaviruses from the southern cone of south america appear tied to coherent spatial patterns consistent with subcontinental-scale biogeographic features such as the major biomes chu et al 2006 in fig 92 the locations of strains from three major subclades of south american hantaviruses are shown in the context of the major biomes based on the world wildlife fund terrestrial ecoregions data olson et al 2001 for example we find members from one subclade ie laguna negra rio mamor and alto paran viruses carried by rodent reservoirs that span the tropical grass and shrubland and dry broadleaf forest areas along the western central regions of south america chu et al 2006 johnson et al 1997 richter et al 2010 yahnke et al 2001 in contrast a second subclade of rodents that harbor jabora maporal and necocli hantaviruses inhabit mainly the moist broadleaf forest biome stretching from venezuela and colombia into paraguay chu et al 2009 de oliveira et al 2011 fulhorst et al 2004 londoo et al 2011 knowing the extent of prevalence of these closely related viruses over this vast region would certainly be fascinating from a phylogeographical point of view it is interesting that these viruses are not yet associated with cases of hps there are numerous strains of hantaviruses that have been identified in the atlantic forest extends along the eastern coast of brazil and into eastern paraguay and in the temperate grass and shrubland of argentina the third clade of rodents those that harbor the juquitiba oran and lechiguanas viruses resides in the more humid lower chaco a region that encompasses the flooded savannas of southern paraguay and forms a transitional environment between the arid gran chaco and temperate coniferous forests in argentina brazil and uruguay de araujo et al 2015 delfraro et al 2008 andes maciel and pergamino viruses reside in rodents in the temperate grass and shrubland biome in argentina bohlman et al 2002 gonzlez-ittig et al 2014 andes virus is also found in chile in mediterranean woodland and shrub biome torres-perez et al 2004 araraquara viruses are associated with rodents that largely reside within agriculturally transformed areas of brazil ie sugarcane production fields that were formerly areas of moist broadleaf forest biome de araujo et al 2015 de sousa et al 2008 suzuki et al 2004
 coarse-scale analysis has shown a relationship between hantavirus genetics and broad ecological pattern narrowing this view to a more regional scale begins to reveal how land cover and land cover disturbance affects the spatial variability of hantaviruses like all zoonotic disease the ecology of each species of hantavirus is closely related to that of its host organism thus generalization of virus-landscape relationships cannot be made without considering the habitat characteristics of the reservoir host we do not have abundant data on the microhabitat characteristics of many host species lozada and guthmann 1998 however general habitat types defined at grains sizes of 1 km might be useful to study preferences among various host species and be relevant to the landscape epidemiology of hantaviruses regardless of whether certain land cover types are more closely associated with the presence of the virus a regional-scale analysis of rodent reservoirs of hantaviruses in paraguay goodin et al 2006 showed that the host species do indeed show patterns of land cover preference even when land cover is mapped into very general categories the most common hantavirus host rodents in paraguay akodon montensis and oligoryzomys spp both showed disproportionately high probabilities of occurring in areas subjected to large-scale agricultural disturbance goodin et al 2006 even more significant however was the fact that rodents found to be antibody positive for hantavirus indicating exposure to the virus at some point were more likely to be associated with the human-disturbed land cover types this relationship held even when the underlying differences in habitat preference were controlled this finding suggests that some aspect of land cover disturbance or change increases the likelihood that a member of a host species will be infected with the virus while analysis at the regional scale shows that human land cover alteration is associated with hantavirus presence discovering the specific nature and causes for this observation cannot be addressed at this scale questions of causation must be addressed at finer spatial scales in large part because that is the scale to which most host populations and individuals are interacting with their environment lozada and guthmann 1998 owen et al 2010 simply presumed because rodents species have specific requirements with respect to habitat and because each hantavirus species seemingly persists only in certain rodents species one might assume that a predictive map can be made for of the prevalence of a particular hantavirus based on knowledge of the associated rodent species unfortunately for most rodents we know very little about their general life cycles and other important biological information that is critical for modeling eg age at sexual maturity birth rates litter sizes further we have only a minimal amount of information on their habitat preferences although some recent studies have indicated that fine-grained evaluations are necessary to understand rodent species distributions and community composition goodin et al 2009 lozada and guthmann 1998 poindexter et al 2012 schnell et al 2010 at the microscale level pathogen survival and reproduction depend on the dynamics within the reservoir host which in turn depend on the habitat or the reservoir a rodent may live within an approximate 1 km range for most of its life barring fire flooding and other natural disasters in the case of a viral pathogen the virus must overcome physical barriers of the host and be compatible with cell receptors to gain entry into a target cell allen et al 2012 viral replication depends on host and viral genetics and other host factors such as prior pathogen or other immunogenic exposure nutritional status coinfection age sex reproductive status and the host immune response allen et al 2012 these and other factors determine outcome when a pathogen enters a host with the possibilities including severity of any associated disease and whether the pathogen either is to be cleared by the host immune system or the pathogen will persists in the host for example the survival of hantaviruses in nature depends on maintenance of persistent infections within their specific rodent reservoir hantaviruses infect and persist only in the rodent reservoir with which the virus has coevolved and the infection is believed to last the life of the animal meyer and schmaljohn 2000 notably persistent infection of rodent reservoirs by hantaviruses shows continuous virus replication without complete clearance by the immune system and no pathological changes jonsson et al 2010 vaheri et al 2013 humans are not a natural reservoir for these viruses and as such humans typically become infected only upon contact with aerosolized excreta from the rodent reservoir in humans hantavirus infection can result in severe disease although outcomes vary with different hantaviral species the molecular basis for different disease outcomes in humans has been attributed to difference in receptor preferences of nonpathogenic and pathogenic hantaviruses models that connect data on the outcomes associated with immune response in reservoir versus human hosts are just beginning to be developed mathematical models are valuable tools for synthesizing information and testing hypotheses to provide insight into how and why disease outbreaks or spatial patterns of infections might arise in wildlife populations several books and review articles summarize some of the modeling efforts on zoonotic infectious diseases alexander et al 2012 allen et al 2012 grenfell and dobson 1995 heesterbeek et al 2015 hudson et al 2002 lloyd-smith et al 2009 a variety of modeling formats deterministic and stochastic have been applied to the study of zoonotic diseases these models include compartmental agent-based individual-based metapopulation network and ecological niche but these classifications overlap agent-based individual-based and metapopulation models may be classified under network models where the nodes are infectious agents individuals or populations connected via an underlying network riley et al 2015 simple compartment models seirsusceptible exposed infectious and recovered are connected via a dispersal network in what is often called a patch model or metapopulation model allen et al 2009 arino et al 2005 mccormack and allen 2007b ecological niche models contain less detail about individual dynamics and instead they are closely related to landscape presenceabsence data and gis-based climatic and environmental data alexander et al 2012 peterson 2014 mathematical tractability and the complexity of interactions among pathogens reservoirs and human hosts and the environment have often restricted the model formulation to the reservoir host and to a single spatial scalelandscape population or within-host coupling temporal scales hours to years or longer biological complexity levels genes to cells to ecosystems and spatial scales local to global have been a continuous challenge to modelers heesterbeek et al 2015 recent theoretical investigations on coupling within-host and between-host models are advancing feng et al 2013 gilchrist and coombs 2006 mideo et al 2008 hantaviruses and rabies are two examples where spatial patterns of infection involving multiple species have been observed chu et al 2009 2006 haydon et al 2002 rhodes et al 1998 smith et al 2002 spatially explicit computer simulations that incorporate landscape heterogeneity and spatial genetic structure are being applied to study control of rabies and other zoonotic diseases alexander et al 2012 parratt et al 2016 real and biek 2007 rees et al 2013 models with multi-host species and multi-pathogens are being investigated for example mathematical models for hantavirus infection in rodents have been studied in the context of multiple host species spatial spread and environmental variability abramson and kenkre 2002 abramson et al 2003 allen et al 2006a b 2009 mccormack and allen 2007a b these models have shown that those random or seasonal variations which impact an ecosystems carrying capacity for a particular rodent species can trigger outbreaks when rodent densities and contacts rates are high allen et al 2006b in addition theoretical analyses have shown that when multiple species as opposed to a single species are involved in the transmission process there may be a dilution or amplification effect that impacts disease persistence dobson 2004 mccormack and allen 2007a models for spatial spread among discrete patches have shown the importance of there being at least one patch where the disease persists arino et al 2005 allen et al 2009 mccormack and allen 2007b wu and loucks 1995 have suggested that the most significant contribution of hierarchy theory is as a framework for explicitly incorporating heterogeneity and scale into ecological analysis in this chapter we have tried to show some ways in which hierarchical consideration of spatial and to some extent temporal scale can be incorporated into ecological analyses of zoonotic diseases our review of the literature also suggests some of the opportunities in infectious disease research resulting from the hierarchical consideration of scale but also some of the challenges spatial patterns of zoonotic hosts the pathogens they harbor and the host-zoonosis relationships may appear quite different depending on the scale at which we view them although patterns derived from different size scales are often referred to as emergent patterns it is unclear whether the newly recognized large-scale or the small-scale patterns might not be emergent from scale levels either above or below them although we could view these scales to be nested subsets of one another it may be more useful both conceptually and in practice to view the patterns derived from different scales as complementary information requiring integration rather than as contradictory results requiring amelioration one area of opportunity for the application of hierarchical concepts in zoonotic disease ecology corresponds to scale-related questions facing the global change research community in general how does global environmental change especially global warming manifest itself spatially it has long been recognized that the spatial distribution of both individuals and communities of species is linked to climate and that these are two-way linkages however much uncertainty remains about where when and how species will respond to climate change potter et al 2013 fundamentally the issue reduces to one of scale the potential impacts of climate change are most often conceptualized at the macroscale ie regional or global but operate across a range of scales including those more proximate to the host or reservoir organisms ashcroft et al 2009 diffenbaugh et al 2005 suggitt et al 2011 adoption of the complementary hierarchical view of scale provides a framework to address these and similar questions in disease ecology model selection among the wide array of potential formats depends on the virus-host ecological system being investigated data availability and the questions to be addressed many challenges remain in model formulation analysis and simulation of zoonotic disease dynamics that relate to landscape and climate and the wide range of temporal and spatial scales allen et al 2012 buhnerkempe et al 2015 heesterbeek et al 2015 lloyd-smith et al 2009 pellis et al 2015 addressing the challenges of scale can be met through mathematical and computational approaches and methods being developed in a variety of fields including computer science ecology geography immunology genetics mathematics statistics and virology this will require the continued close collaboration across numerous disciplines to converge toward models that reflect the immense biological diversity of pathogen-host ecology  assessing the epidemic potential of rna and dna viruses mark woolhouse ej liam brierley chris mccaffery sam lycett   we updated our previous systematic literature review 10 of the capacity of virus species to transmit between humans ie level 3 and level 4 viruses technical appendix such viruses are found in 25 of 29 families containing viruses that infect mammals or birds discounting 2 reports of family nodaviridae species in mammalsbirds the 4 exceptions comprise 2 families that have no known human-infective viruses arteriviridae and birnaviridae and 2 with species that have been reported in humans but only at level 2 asfarviridae and bornaviridae a total of 22 of these families contain level 4 viruses with epidemic potential in humans sometimes described as human-adapted viruses 11 this finding indicates that this capability is widely distributed among virus taxa the 3 families with level 3 viruses but no level 4 viruses are the arenaviridae bunyaviridae and rhabdoviridae a list of 37 presumptive level 3 virus species is provided in table 2 these species cover a wide taxonomic range and a variety of transmission routes including vectorborne several level 3 viruses have historically been associated with sizeable outbreaks 100 cases in human populations bwamba oropouche lake victoria marburg sudan ebola and onyong-nyong viruses for some other viruses including guanarito junin lymphocytic choriomeningitis and sabia all arenaviruses simian virus 40 titi monkey virus and influenza ah5n1 virus human-to-human transmission is rare or merely suspected in addition several viruses are only known or believed to transmit between humans by iatrogenic routes or vertical transmission this group table 2 might be regarded as unlikely epidemic threats when a virus is transmitted by a vector it can be particularly difficult to confirm or exclude the infectiousness of human cases as with semliki forest barmah forest and rift valley fever viruses similarly even when humanvectorhuman transmission is believed to occur it is often difficult to quantify its contribution to a given outbreak as with venezuelan equine encephalitis virus level 2 viruses are those that can infect humans 100 species but have never been reported to be transmitted by humans 10 in at least some instances such as influenza ah5n1 virus 12 this finding is attributable to tissue tropisms during human infection that are incompatible with onward transmission shifts in pyramid level equate to shifts in the public health threat posed by a virus we consider possible shifts in the following sections virus species of mammalian and more rarely avian origin are sometimes observed to be transmissible between humans when first found in humans which constitutes a jump from level 1 straight to level 3 or 4 figure 1 and events of this kind have been reported regularly recent examples that appear on the basis of available evidence to fit this model include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus first reported in humans in 2003 bundibugyo ebolavirus 2008 lujo virus 2009 severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus 2011 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 2012 we still have incomplete knowledge of the diversity of viruses that infect mammals and birds the few hundred recognized species 4 surely represent only a small fraction of the total 3 moreover we have few predictors of potential human-to-human transmissibility one possible indicator is emergence from nonhuman primates with suggestions that primate viruses are more likely to be able to or to acquire the ability to spread in human populations 1314 however emergence of human transmissible viruses from bat eg severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or bird eg influenza reservoirs indicates that this trait is associated with a wide range of reservoirs the possibility that level 2 viruses might acquire the capacity to be transmitted between humans ie move into level 3 or 4 is a major concern especially in the context of influenza ah5n1 virus and other avian influenza virus subtypes however there are few examples of this transition throughout the entire recorded history of human viruses going back to 1901 one possible example involves the simian immunodeficiency virus siv and hiv a sivsmm-derived laboratory strain of siv has been reported to infect humans but without onward transmission 15 sivsmm is related to hiv-2 sivcpz which is related to hiv-1 has not been directly observed in humans however different hiv-1 lineages independently derived from sivcpz are variably transmissible in humans and the pandemic hiv-1 m lineage was the only virus to overcome a key host restriction factor human tetherin 16 the only other examples of viruses newly transmitted between humans relate to rare instances of iatrogenic transmission eg colorado tick fever or rabies viruses epidemiologic and phylogenetic considerations routinely inform our assessment of the likelihood of human-to-human transmission being observed in the future for example there is markedly less concern about rabies virus than about avian influenza virus and we suggest 2 reasons for this observation first rabies virus has a much longer history of and a much higher incidence of human infection but human-to-human transmission is extremely rare second there is no evidence that other rhabdoviruses viruses with the possible exception of bas-congo virus which represents a novel genus are transmissible in humans or primates more generally level 3 viruses can also become level 4 viruses we note that virus evolution is not necessarily required for r0 to become 1 in human populations differences in host or vector behavior ecology or demography might be sufficient 8 instances of shifts from level 3 to level 4 in recent times have been infrequent three candidates are ebolavirus zika virus and chikungunya virus however although these viruses have caused epidemics of unprecedented size in humans populations in the past decade the condition r01 in human populations might had been previously met for all 3 viruses 1719 for ebola virus the epidemic in west africa in 2014 constituted the first appearance of this virus in high-density urban populations which is expected to correspond to a higher value of r0 the chikungunya virus epidemic in the indian ocean region in 2005 was associated with a vector species jump from aedes aegypti to ae albopictus mosquitoes that has been linked to a mutation in the virus envelope 1 protein gene 18 the chikungunya virus epidemic in the caribbean region in 2013 followed the first appearance of chikungunya in the americas and infected populations that had no history of exposure to the virus the current zika virus epidemic in south america appears to be another example of a transition from a level 3 to a level 4 arbovirus associated with geographic spread into areas with high densities of vectors 19 occasional zika virus transmission directly from infected humans to other humans are of considerable interest but probably contribute little to r0 chikungunya zika and the other level 4 arboviruses yellow fever and dengue viruses illustrate that for arboviruses a high potential for spread in human populations is linked to carriage by anthropophilic vector species particularly mosquitoes of the genus aedes in contrast no tick species are regarded as anthropophilic and there are no level 4 and few level 3 tickborne arboviruses the preceding sections illustrate that identifying transitions of viruses between level 2 and level 3 or between level 3 and level 4 is not always straightforward standard epidemiologic theory can help clarify our expectations as we discussed pyramid level is related to the basic reproduction number r0 in human populations in turn the value of r0 is indicative of expected outbreak dynamics some key results figure 2 are the probability that a single primary case will generate 1 secondary cases for any value of r0 the expected average size of an outbreak generated over the range 0r01 and the probability that an epidemic will spread in the human population for r01 these results strictly apply to homogeneous infections in a homogeneous host population although more general frameworks can accommodate host or pathogen heterogeneity 2022 nonetheless the key predictions that secondary cases do not always occur even if r00 and that major epidemics do not always occur even if r01 are robust from an epidemiologic perspective our confidence that a putatively level 2 virus is truly incapable of human-to-human transmission is thus a function of the number of index cases observed the transition between level 3 and level 4 can be studied in terms of the expected distribution of outbreak sizes 23 in the range 0r01 an overdispersed distribution of outbreak sizes is expected most outbreaks are small often just single cases with a long tail of larger outbreaks this pattern has been reported for a range of emerging viral diseases figure 3 as the critical threshold r0  1 is approached this value is signaled in the outbreak size distribution figure 3 this framework has been used successfully to monitor the epidemiology of measles virus in the united kingdom after a decrease in childhood vaccination rates in the late 1990s and indicated the approach to the critical threshold that corresponded to loss of herd immunity 23 outbreak size distribution analysis has been applied to human case data for andes virus 24 monkeypox virus 20 and mers-cov 25 figure 3 for evd up to 2013 data are clearly inconsistent with theoretical expectation for r0 1 figure 3 which suggests that large numbers of small outbreaks have remained undetected or that r0 was already 1 in at least some settings either way r0 1 for evd in humans implies that small differences in the biology or epidemiology of the virus would lead to large changes in scale of outbreaks 8 which could make events such as the evd epidemic in 2014 if not predictable then much less unexpected changes in pyramid level might be mediated by virus evolution or changes in virus ecology 28 a major issue is whether the capacity of a virus to spread in human populations arises as a result of adaptation evolution of transmissibility that occurs during human infection or preadaptation genetic variation within nonhuman reservoirs that predisposes a virus not only to infect humans but also transmit between humans noting that rna viruses often show high levels of genetic variation such that they are sometimes described as quasi-species 29 these alternatives have been characterized as tailor-made and off-the-shelf respectively 28 the first alternative implies a progression from no or low transmissibility between humans to moderate or high transmissibility the second alternative implies moderate or high transmissibility at first infection of humans we consider that our survey of documented changes of pyramid level is most consistent with the off-the-shelf model of virus emergence in particular we can find no convincing examples of level 2 viruses becoming level 3 or 4 viruses which suggests that if this happens at all it typically happens sufficiently rapidly ie requires a sufficiently small number of introductions that we fail to observe the level 2 phase in contrast we regularly observe viruses at levels 3 or 4 the first time they are detected in human populations nonetheless the possibility of virus evolution of transmissibility in a new host has been demonstrated experimentally for influenza ah5n1 virus in ferrets 30 a theoretical study 31 suggested that the fact that this virus subtype has been circulating widely in poultry populations with frequent human exposure and sporadic human infection for almost 20 years provides little or no reassurance about its future evolutionary trajectory hiv lineages show clear evidence of adaptation to humans 16 but as discussed earlier it is not clear whether the siv lineages that gave rise to hiv-1 or hiv-2 were capable of transmission between human hosts we speculate that extended infection times make tailor-made emergence more likely for retroviruses demonstrating that an infected human has the potential to transmit the infection to another human is not always straightforward high virus titers in body secretions and excretions blood or skin are considered indicative case clusters are suggestive but if persons occupy the same environment eg household then it might be difficult to rule out common exposure case clusters must be epidemiologically plausible ie delimited in space and time in a manner consistent with the known or assumed epidemiology of the virus genotyping techniques are useful tools for confirming a cluster but do not resolve the source of infection for several of the viruses we studied eg bas-congo lujo nelson bay and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome viruses table 2 the evidence for human-to-human transmission is best regarded as tentative particularly where putative clusters were small such assessments can be even more difficult for vectorborne viruses in many situations the best evidence for the human-to-human transmission will come from analysis of virus genome sequences one approach to resolving the question of human-to-human transmission is analysis of nucleotide sequence data sometimes referred to as forensic phylogenetics nucleotide substitution rates in fast-evolving rna viruses such as mers-cov and ebola virus are 15  103siteyear 3233 making it possible to use sequences isolated from different hosts at different times to estimate time-resolved phylogenetic trees estimates of the transmission chain from temporal sequence data can be improved by incorporating additional information on the date of onset of individual cases duration of latent and infectious periods and overall prevalence 34 we provide some example phylogenetic trees generated from simulated epidemics figure 4 in an epidemic in an animal reservoir with occasional transmission to humans figure 4 panel a for each human sequence the most closely related next sequence is of animal origin clusters of closely related human sequences are shown and the distribution of the expected cluster sizes is a function of r0 figure 4 panels b c 35 in an outbreak it might be difficult to find and sample the putative source animal cases however estimating the time to most recent common ancestor tmrca of the human cases will indicate how long the infection has been spreading for sporadic zoonoses figure 4 panel a most transmission has occurred unobserved in the animal reservoir and the tmrca of pairs of human cases will be long because these sequences are not closely related for outbreaks involving human-to-human transmission figure 4 panels b c the tmrca of the cluster of human cases will be closer to the date of the first human infection whether sampled or not and provides the estimated date of the zoonotic event use of sequence data to distinguish between multiple instances of human infection from a common animal source and human-to-human transmission in the early stages of an outbreak is extremely challenging because of short timescales and involvement of few mutations however genetic differences and phylogenetic evidence show that at least 2 of the first 3 reported cases of influenza a h7n9 virus infection in humans were believed to originate from distinct domestic avian sources 36 further sequencing of avian samples implied that a low-pathogenicity influenza ah7n9 virus strain had been spreading in domestic birds for 1 year before sporadic cases were detected in humans 37 similarly detection of genetically distant lineages of mers-cov which persisted for only a few months each suggest multiple introductions from an animal reservoir and only limited human-to-human transmission to date 32 in contrast the influenza ah1n1 pandemic in 2009 and the evd epidemic in west africa in 2014 were believed to be the results of single zoonotic events followed by sustained human-to-human transmission 33 as shown by a single rapidly expanding lineage our survey of the capacity of rna and dna virus infections to be transmitted directly or indirectly between humans leads to several conclusions and practical suggestions for improving surveillance of emerging infectious diseases and targeting efforts to identify future public health threats in support of these conclusions the world health organization recently published list of priority emerging infectious diseases and corresponding viruses 38 included 6 of the viruses in table 2 a major observation is that the taxonomic diversity of viruses that are possible threats to public health is wide but bounded most human infective viruses are closely related to viruses of other mammals and some to viruses of birds there are no indications that humans acquire new viruses from any other source however diversification within human populations occurs and is a prominent feature of some dna virus taxa eg family papillomaviridae 4 in general however our knowledge of origins of human viruses is still incomplete although the origins of hiv-1 have been extensively investigated 16 for most other viruses even level 4 viruses little or no research has occurred an origins initiative 9 would help establish the routes into human populations that have been used by other viruses transmissibility within human populations is a key determinant of epidemic potential many viruses that can infect humans are not capable of being transmitted by humans most human transmissible viruses that emerge already have that capability at first human infection or acquire it relatively rapidly if transmission from humans would require a change in a phylogenetically conserved trait such as tissue tropism or transmission route 4 then such viral paradigm shifts will probably be extremely rare 39 even when a virus is capable of transmission between humans the critical threshold r01 is not always achieved however because changes in virus traits or host population characteristics can influence r0 level 3 viruses table 2 are of special interest from a public health perspective and of special concern when like mers-cov they also cause severe illness demonstrating human transmissibility is often difficult but essential the best evidence is likely to come from virus genome sequencing studies these studies should be a public health priority 40 we currently have few clues to help us predict which mammalian or avian viruses might pose a threat to humans and especially which might be transmissible between humans one argument in favor of experimental studies of these traits including controversial gain of function experiments 30 is that they could help guide molecular surveillance for high-risk virus lineages in nonhuman reservoirs the first line of defense against emerging viruses is effective surveillance 40 a better understanding of which kinds of viruses in which circumstances pose the greatest risk to human health would enable evidence-based targeting of surveillance efforts which would reduce costs and increase probable effectiveness of this endeavor  scientometric trends for coronaviruses and other emerging viral infections dima kagan jacob moran-gilad michael fire  covid-19 is the most rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades to provide a swift response to a novel outbreak prior knowledge from similar outbreaks is essential here we study the volume of research conducted on previous coronavirus outbreaks specifically sars and mers relative to other infectious diseases by analyzing over 35 million papers from the last 20 years our results demonstrate that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared to other viruses we also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and drops drastically upon the containment of the disease this can yield inadequate research and limited investment in gaining a full understanding of novel coronavirus management and prevention independent of the outcome of the current covid-19 outbreak we believe that measures should be taken to encourage sustained research in the field  infectious diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in developed countries and particularly in the developing world 1  according to the world health organization out of the top-10 causes of death globally three are infectious diseases 1  in light of the continuous emergence of infections the burden of infectious diseases is expected to become even greater in the near future 2 3 currently the world is struggling with a novel strain of coronavirus that emerged in china during late 2019 and by the time of this writing has infected more than 156000 people and killed more than 5800 4 5  covid-19 is the latest and third serious human coronavirus outbreak in the past 20 years additionally of course there are several more typical circulating seasonal human coronaviruses causing respiratory infections it is still too early to predict the epidemic course of covid-19 but it is already a pandemic which currently appears more difficult to contain than its close relative sars-cov 6 7  much can be learned from past infectious disease outbreaks to improve preparedness and response to future public health threats three key questions arise in light of the covid-19 outbreak to what extent were the previous human coronaviruses studied is research on emerging viruses being sustained aiming to understand and prevent future epidemics are there lessons from academic publications on previous emerging viruses that could be applied to the current covid-19 epidemic in this study we answer these vital questions by utilizing state-of-the-art data science tools to perform a large-scale analysis of 35 million papers of which 1908211 concern the field of virology we explore nearly two decades of infectious disease research published from 2002 up to today we particularly focus on public health crises such as sars influenza including seasonal pandemic h1n1 and avian influenza mers and ebola virus disease and compare them to hivaids and viral hepatitis b and c three bloodborne viruses that are associated with a significant global health burden for more than two decades our results highlight that the earlier human coronaviruses sars and mers are understudied compared to bloodborne viruses about 047 of virology studies and 7  10 5  of all studies from the past 20 years involved human coronaviruses while hivaids accounts for 81 of all virology studies we observed that unlike the research in the domain of hivaids and avian influenza that has been published at a high and steady pace over the last 20 years sars was studied at an overwhelming rate after the 2002-2003 outbreak and then sharply dropped after 2005  figure 4  additionally we noticed that the sars research community had a smaller percentage of relatively prolific researchers than other diseases moreover researchers with multiple papers related to sars published on average 38 papers while hepatitis c researchers published on average 52 papers during the same period when it comes to global collaboration and research efforts most of the research stemmed from china and the us figure 1  with only about 17 of sars papers first authors being located in europe overall researchers from 57 and 67 countries have studied mers and sars respectively however the vast majority of sars papers 73 were written by researchers in only 6 countries  figure 9  a crucial aspect of being prepared for future epidemics is sustained ongo- ing research of emerging infectious diseases even at times of peace when such viruses do not pose an active threat our results demonstrate that research on previous coronaviruses such as sars and mers was conducted by a relatively small number of researchers centered in a small number of countries suggesting that such research could be better encouraged we propose that regardless of the fate of covid-19 in the near future sustained research efforts should be encouraged to be better prepared for the next outbreak 2 related work health in particular see section 22 there is great promise in utilizing big data to study epidemiology 8  one approach is to gather data using different surveillance systems for example one such system is promed promed was launched 25 years ago as an email service to identify unusual worldwide health events related to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases 9  it is used daily around the globe by public health policy makers physicians veterinarians and other healthcare workers researchers private companies journalists and the general public reports are produced and commentary is provided by a global team of subject-matter experts in a variety of fields promed has over 80000 subscribers and over 60000 cumulative event reports from almost every country in the world additionally there are many different systems used by different countries and health organizations worldwide in 2006 cowen et al 10 evaluated the promed dataset from the years 1996 to 2004 they discovered that there are diseases that received more extensive coverage than others 86 disease subjects had thread lengths of at least 10 reports and 24 had 20 or more they note that the pattern of occurrence is hard to explain even by an expert in epidemiology also with the level of granularity of promed data it is very challenging to predict the frequency that diseases are going to accrue in 2008 jones et al 2 analyzed the global temporal and spatial patterns of emerging infectious diseases eids they analyzed 305 eids between 1940 and 2004 and demonstrated that the threat of eids to global health is increasing the same year freifeld et al 11 developed healthmap an interactive surveillance system that integrates disease outbreak reports from various sources using their system they created a classifier that was able to classify diseases with an accuracy of 84 data about infectious diseases can also come from web-and social-based sources for instance in 2009 ginsberg et al 12 used google search queries to monitor the spread of the influenza epidemics they used the fact that many people search online before going to doctors and they found that during a pandemic the volume of searches differs from normal they then created a mathematical model to forecast the spread of flu this research was later converted into a tool called google flu trends and at its peak google flu trends was deployed in 29 countries worldwide however not everything worked well for google flu trends in 2009 it underestimated the flu volume and in 2013 it predicted more than double the number of cases than the true volume 13  as a result of such discrepancies google shut down the google flu trends website in 2015 and transferred its data to academic researchers 14  also in 2009 carneiro and mylonakis 15 used large amounts of data to predict flu outbreaks a week earlier than prevention surveillance systems similar to ginsberg et al 12  they used google trends as a data source but instead of only monitoring seasonal flu they monitored avian influenza and west nile virus since there was a constant growth in the number of google searches they normalized the data to get meaningful results they found a correlation between web searches about influenza and the cdc data in 2010 lampos and cristianini 16 extended the idea of carneiro and mylonakis 15 to use temporal data to monitor outbreaks instead of using google trends they used twitter as their data source they collected 160000 tweets from the uk and as ground truth they used hpa weekly reports about the h1n1 epidemic using textual markers to measure flu on twitter they demonstrated that twitter can be used to study disease outbreaks similar to google trends the same year seifter et al 17 found google trends to be a good approximation for lyme disease outbreaks in 2011 althouse et al 18 also used google trends but unlike seifter et al 17 and carneiro and mylonakis 15  they demonstrated that this kind of method was effective for dengue also the same year salath and khandelwal 19 analyzed twitter and demonstrated that it is possible to use social networks to study not only the spread of infectious disease but also vaccinations they found a correlation between the sentiment in tweets toward an influenza vaccine and the vaccination rate in 2013 yuan et al 20 showed that in addition to twitter and google baidu can be used to monitor influenza spread in 2015 santillana et al 21 took the influenza surveillance one step further by fusing multiple data sources they used five datasets twitter google trends near real-time hospital visit records flunearyou and google flu trends they used all these data sources with a machine-learning algorithm to predict influenza outbreaks in 2017 mcgough et al 22 dealt with the problem of significant delays in the publication of official government reports about zika cases to solve this problem they used the combined data of google trends twitter and the healthmap surveillance system to predict estimates of zika cases in latin america there is substantial controversy surrounding the use of web-based data to predict the volume of outbreaks the limitations of google flu trends mentioned above raised the question of reliability of social data for assessing disease spread lazer 23 noted that these types of methods are problematic since companies like google facebook and twitter are constantly changing their products studies based on such data sources may be valid today but not be valid tomorrow and may even be unreproducible in 2005 vergidis et al 24 used pubmed and jcr to study trends in microbiology publications they discovered that microbiology research in the us had the highest average impact factor but in terms of research production western europe was first in 2008 uthman 25 analyzed trends in paper publications about hiv in nigeria he found growth from 1 to 33 of the number of publications about hiv in nigeria and that papers with international collaborations were published in journals with a higher impact factor in 2009 ramos et al 26 used web of science to study publications about infectious diseases in european countries they found that more papers in total were published about infectious diseases in europe than in the us in 2012 takahashi-omoe and omoe 27 surveyed publications of 100 journals about infectious diseases they discovered that the us and the uk had the highest number of publications and relative to the countrys socioeconomic status the netherlands india and china had relatively high productivity in 2014 similar to wislar et al 28  kennedy et al 29 studied ghost authorship in nursing journals instead of biomedical journals they found that there were 276 and 42 of ghost and honorary authorships respectively in 2015 wiethoelter et al 30 explored worldwide infectious disease trends at the wildlife-livestock interface they found that 7 out of the top 10 most popular diseases were zoonoses in 2017 dong et al 31 studied the evolution of scientific publications by analyzing 89 million papers from the microsoft academic dataset similar to the increase found by aboukhalil 32  they also found a drastic increase in the number of authors per paper in 2019 fire and guestrin 33 studied the over-optimization in academic publications they found that the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric for academic success as a result of longer author lists shorter papers and surging publication numbers citation-based metrics such as citation number and h-index are likewise affected by the flood of papers self-citations and lengthy reference lists in this study we fused four data sources to extract insights about research on emerging viruses in the rest of this subsection we describe these data sources 1 mag -microsoft academic graph is a dataset containing scientific publication records citation relationships between those publications as well as authors institutions journals conferences and fields of study 34  the mag dataset we used was from 22 march 2019 and contains data on over 210 million papers 35  this dataset was used as the main dataset of the study similar to fire and guestrin 33  we only used papers that had at least 5 references in order to filter non peer-reviewed publications such as news columns which are published in journals pubmed -pubmed is a dataset based on the pubmed search engine of academic publications on the topics of medicine nursing dentistry veterinary medicine health care systems and preclinical sciences 36 one of the major advantages of using the pubmed dataset is that it contains only medical-related publications the data on each pubmed paper contains information about its venue authors and affiliations but it does not contain citation data in this study we used the 2018 annual baseline pubmed dataset containing 29138919 records 1 we mainly utilized the pubmed dataset to analyze journal publications see section 321 3 sjr -sjr is a dataset containing the information and ranking of over 34100 journals from 1999 to 2018 37  including their sjr indicator 2 the best quartile of the journal 3 and more we utilized the sjr dataset to compare the rankings of different journals to assess the level of their prestige wikidata -wikidata is a dataset holding a vast knowledge about the world containing data on over 78252808 items 40  wikidata stores metadata about items and each item has an identifier and can be associated with other items we utilized the wikidata dataset to extract geographic information for academic institutions in order to match a paper with its authors geographic locations to study the research of emerging viruses over time we analyzed the datasets described in section 31 in pursuing this goal we used the code framework recently published by fire and guestrin 33  which enables the easy extraction of the structured data of papers from the mag dataset the mag and pubmed datasets were filtered according to a predefined list of keywords the keyword search was performed in the following way given a set of diseases d and a set of papers p  from each paper title p t  where p  p  we created a set of word-grams word-grams are defined as n-grams of words ie all the combinations of a set of words in a phrase without disrupting the order of the words for example the word-grams of the string information on swine flu word-gramsinformation on swine flu will return the following set information on swine flu information on on swine swine flu information on swine on swine flu information on swine flu next for each p we calculated word-gramp t   d which was considered as the diseases with which the paper was associated in the current study we focused on the past emerging coronaviruses sars and mers additionally we also analyzed ebola virus disease influenza seasonal avian influenza swine flu hivaids hepatitis b and hepatitis c as comparators that represent other important emerging infectious diseases from the past two decades for these nine diseases we collected all their aliases which were added to the set of diseases d and were used as keywords to filter the datasets to reduce the false-positive rate we analyzed only papers that according to the mag dataset were in the categories of medicine or biology and had at least five references additionally to explore the trend in the core categories of infectious disease research we performed the same analysis on the 2 the sjr indicator is a measure used to assess the prestige of a journal the measure takes into account the number of citations and the prestige of the source of the citing paper 38 3 the journal impact factor quartile is the quotient of a journals rank in category x and the total number of journals in the category y so that x  y  percentile rank z 39 virology category in the rest of this section we describe the specific calculations and analyses we performed to explore the volume of studies on emerging viruses we examined the publication of papers about infectious diseases first we defined several notions that we used to define publication and citation rates let d be a set of disease names and p a set of papers namely for a paper p  p  p disease is defined as the disease that matches the papers keywords p year as the papers publication year and p citations as the set of papers citing p using these notions we defined the following features  number of citations -the total number of citations for a specific infectious disease  number of papers -the total number of published papers for a specific infectious disease n p r y d  i  p i y ear  y and i disease  d i  p i y ear  y using these metrics we inspected how the coronavirus publication and citations rates differed from other examined eids we analyzed how trends of citations and publications have changed over time to investigate the relationship between journals and their publication of papers about emerging viruses we combined the semantic scholar and pubmed datasets with the sjr dataset using issn and selected all the journals from sjr categories related to infectious diseases immunology epidemiology infectious diseases virology and microbiology first we inspected whether coronavirus papers are published in the top journals we selected the top-10 journals by sjr and calculated the number of papers published for each disease over time next we inspected how published papers about coronavirus are regarded relative to other eids in terms of ranking to this end we defined a new metric jscore t  jscore t is defined as the average sjr score of all published papers on a specific topic t we used jscore t to observe how the prominence of each disease in the publication world has changed over time lastly we explored publications by looking at the quartile ranking of the journal over time to study how scientific authorship has changed in the field of infectious diseases we explored what characterizes the authors of papers on different diseases we inspected the number of new authors over time to check how attractive emerging viruses are to new researchers additionally we analyzed the number of experienced authors where author experience is defined as the time that has passed from his or her first publication we also analyzed the number of authors who wrote multiple papers about each disease to inspect the state of international collaborations in emerging virus research we mapped academic institutions to geolocation however it is not a trivial task to match institution names institution names are sometimes written differently for example aalborg university hospital and aalborg university are affiliated however there are cases where two similar names refer to different institutions for example the university of washington and washington university are entirely different institutions to deal with this problem we used the affiliation table in the mag dataset to determine the country and city of each author we applied a five-step process 1 for each institution we looked for the institutions page on wikidata from each wikidata page we extracted all geography-related fields 5 to first merge all the wikidata location fields we used the coordinate location with reverse geocoding to determine the city and country of the institution 3 for all the institutions that did not have a coordinate location field we extracted the location data from the other available fields we crossed the data against city and country lists to determine whether the data in the field described a city or a country 4 to acquire country data for an institution that had only city data on wikidata we used city-to-country mapping lists 5 to get city and country data for institutions that did not have the relevant fields on wikidata we extracted geographic coordinates from wikipediacom even though wikidata and wikipediacom are both parts of the wikimedia foundation they are independent projects which have different data similar to wikidata coordinates we used reverse geocoding to determine the city and country of the institution using the extracted geodata we explored how international collaborations change over time in coronavirus research finally we explored which countries have the highest number of papers about coronavirus and which countries have the highest number of international collaborations over time in the following subsections we present all the results of the experiments which were described in section 3  in recent years there has been a surge in publications about infectious diseases yielding almost 2 million new papers related to medicine and biology each year see figure 2a  in contrast to the overall growth in the number of infectious disease papers there has been a relative decline in the number of papers about the coronaviruses sars and mers see figure 2b  generally new eids such as mers sars and ebola has low number of papers while hiv influenza hepatitis b and c are extremely popular research topic  figure 3  also we found that in the past 16 years only 07 of infectious disease studies were about sars and mers it can be observed that hiv alone is responsible for 20 of all studies and hepatitis b and c together are holding 82 of all infectious disease studies in terms of normalized paper rate see figure 4  after the first sars outbreak there was a peak in publishing sars-related papers with npr twice as high as ebolas however the trend dropped very quickly and a similar phenomenon can be observed for the swine flu pandemic the mers outbreak achieved a much lower npr than sars specifically more than 16 times lower when comparing the peaks in sars and mers trends in terms of normalized citation rate  figure 5  we observed the same phenomenon as we did with npr from analyzing the trends in journal publications we discovered the numbers of papers published by journal quartile are very similar to normalized paper rate and normalized citation rate see figure 6  we observed that for most of the diseases the trends are quite similar a growth in the study rate is coupled by a growth in the number of published papers in q1 journals we discovered that for sars mers the swine flu and ebola q1 publication trends were almost parallel to their npr trends see figures 4 and 6  also we noticed that hiv avian influenza influenza and hepatitis b and c have steady publication numbers in q1 journals looking at papers in highly ranked journals  figure  7  we observed that the diseases which are being continuously published in top-10 ranked journals are mainly persisting diseases such as hiv and influenza additionally we inspected how the average journal ranking of publications by disease has changed over time figure 8  we found that only mers had a decline of jscore we also noticed that current papers about sars had the highest jscore by studying the authorship trends in the research of emerging viruses we discovered that there is a difference in the average experience of authors among diseases sars researchers had the lowest experience in years and hepatitis c had the most experienced researchers see table 1  additionally from analyzing authors who published multiple papers on a specific disease we found that  by inspecting global collaboration and research efforts we found that the geolocation of researchers correlated with publication trends for instance most sars mers and avian influenza research was done by investigators based in the us and china figure 9  while the us was dominant in the research of all inspected diseases china showed an increased output in only these three diseases also mers and sars were studied in the least number of countries and hiv was studied in the highest number of countries  figure 9  moreover sars and mers were the diseases least studied in europe with only 17 and 19 of sars and mers studies respectively as opposed to ebola studies 29 of which were conducted in europe in this study we analyzed trends in the research of emerging viruses over the past two decades with emphasis on emerging coronavirus sars and mers we compared the research of these two coronavirus epidemics to seven other emerging viral infectious diseases as comparators to this end we used multiple bibliometric datasets fusing them to get additional insights using this data we explored the research of epidemiology from the perspectives of papers journals authors and international collaborations by analyzing the results presented in section 4 the following can be noted first the surge in infectious disease publications figure 2  supports the results of fire and guestrin 33 that found there has been a general escalation of scientific publications we found that the growth in the number of infectious disease publications is very similar to other fields hence goodharts law 6 did not skip the world of virology research however alongside the general growth in the number of papers we observed that there was a decline in the relative number of papers on the specific infectious diseases we inspected the most evident drastic drop in the publication rate happened after an epidemic ended it appears that for a short while many researchers study an outbreak but later their efforts are reduced this is strengthened by considering the average number of multiple papers per author for each disease see table 2  second when looking at journal publications we noted very similar patterns occurred for citations and publications this result emphasizes that fewer publications and hence fewer citations translate into fewer papers in q1 journals  figure 6  also we observed the same patterns as fire and guestrin 33  with most of the papers being published in q1 journals and the minority published in q2-q4 journals this trend started to change when zooming in and analyz- ing publications in top-10 ranked journals figure 7  while we can see some correlation to outbreaks in ebola swine flu and sars it is harder to interpret the curve of hiv since there were no focused epidemics in the past 20 years but a global burden and we did not observe similar patterns in publications and citations observing the jscore section 322 results figure 8  most diseases showed a steady increase but two diseases behaved rather anomalously mers had a decline since 2013 which is reasonable to expect after the initial outbreak but we did not see the same trends in the other diseases and there is a general trend of increasing average sjr 33  the second anomaly is that sars had an increase in jscore alongside a decrease in citations and publication numbers inspecting the data we discovered that in 2017 there were three published papers in lancet infectious diseases and in 2015 two papers in journal of experimental medicine about sars and both journals have a very high sjr these publications increased the jscore drastically third we observed that on average authors write a fewer number of multiple papers on diseases that are characterized by large epidemics such as the swine flu and sars on the other side of the scale are hepatitis c and hiv which are persistent viral diseases with high global burdens these diseases involve more prolific authors regarding ebola and mers it is too early to predict if they will behave similarly to sars since they are relatively new and require further follow up fourth looking at international collaboration we observed the us to be very dominant in all the disease studies  figure 9  looking at china we found it to be mainly dominant in diseases that were epidemiologically relevant to public health in china such as sars avian influenza and hepatitis b when looking at ebola which has not been a threat to china for the last two decades we observed a relatively low investment in its research in china many of the trends we observed are related to the pattern of the diseases we observed two main types of infectious diseases with distinct trends the first type were emerging viral infections like sars and ebola their academic outputs tend to peak after an epidemic and then subside the second type were viral infections with high burdens such hepatitis b and hiv for which there is a more or less constant trend these trends were most evident in publication and citation numbers as well as journal metrics the collaboration and author distributions were more affected by where the outbreak occurred or where there was a high burden this study may have several limitations to analyze the data we relied on titles to associate papers with diseases while a title is very important in classifying the topic of a paper some papers may discuss a disease without mentioning its name in the title additionally there may be false positives for instance an acronym might not be recognized as an infectious disease term an additional limitation is our focus on a limited number of distinct diseases there are other emerging infections not evaluated herein which could have followed other trends to deal with some of these limitations we only analyzed papers that were categorized as medicine and biology papers as a means to reduce false positives furthermore we show that the same trends appeared even when we filtered all the papers by the category of virology see figures 9 and 10  finally we compared papers that were tagged with a mesh term on pubmed to the papers we retrieved using our keyword search of the title we found that we matched mesh terms with 73 recall the covid-19 outbreak has emphasized the insufficient knowledge available on emerging coronaviruses here we explored how previous coronavirus outbreaks and other emerging viral epidemics have been studied over the last two decades from inspecting the research outputs in this field from several different angles we demonstrate that the interest of the research community in an emerging infection is temporarily associated with the dynamics of the incident and that a drastic drop of interest is evident after the initial epidemic subsides this translates into limited collaborations and a non-sustained investment in the research of the coronavirus such a short-lived investment may also involve reduced funding not evaluated herein and may slow down important developments such as new drugs vaccines or preventive strategies there has been an unprecedented explosion of publications on covid-19 since january 2020 and also a significant allocation of research funding we believe the lessons learned from scientometrics of previous epidemics argue that regardless of the outcome of covid-19 efforts to sustain research in this field should be made this study is reproducible research the data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author   transcription and replication mechanisms of bunyaviridae and arenaviridae l proteins franois ferron friedemann weber juan de la torre carlos juan reguera   decades of research efforts aimed at the identification of new viral species have led to the isolation and characterization of a large number of viral strains belonging to bunyaviridae and arenaviridae families these data have provided virologists with a detailed knowledge on their genome organization as well as a large body of data on their proteins and rna sequences 
bunyaviridae take their name from bunyamwera virus bunv which was originally isolated in 1943 from aedes spp mosquitoes during an investigation of yellow fever in the semliki forest uganda during the following 25 years several antigenically related viruses were identified in laboratories in south america africa and india mostly owing to work that was funded by the rockefeller foundation richard elliott 19542015 brennan et al 2015 elliott 2014 since the first reported bunyaviral disease in 1917 montgomery 1917 the nairobi sheep disease more than 350 strains of bunyaviridae have been isolated around the globe and classified into five genera orthobunyavirus hantavirus nairovirus phlebovirus and tospovirus the first arenavirus identified was lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv discovered in 1933 during the characterization of samples from an outbreak of st louis encephalitis lcmv was found to cause aseptic meningitis and to be similar to an agent that cause chronic infections in mouse colonies the name arenaviridae was given after the sandy latin arenosus appearance of thin sections of virions when examined by electron microscopy which is thought to reflect the packaging of ribosomes into mature virions by 1960 the arenaviridae family was recognized to include a group of viruses that shared with lcmv common morphology serology biochemical features and a natural history of establishing long-term chronic infections in their natural rodent hosts in the absence of noticeable clinical symptoms recently the detection and characterization of a divergent group of arenaviruses in captive alethinophidian snakes has changed the view of arenaviruses exclusively infecting small mammals to accommodate these findings the arenaviridae family includes now two genera reptarenavirus and mammarenavirus radoshitzky et al 2015 because the still limited knowledge about the biology and protein structure and function of reptarenaviruses this review would be restricted mammarenaviruses we anticipate however that many of the structural and functional principles established for mammarenavirus proteins will be found to operate also within reptarenaviruses members of the bunyaviridae and arenaviridae families are enveloped viruses with a segmented negative strand rna genome consisting of three or two respectively segments and that share many essential aspects of their molecular and cell biology a common feature of these two viral families is the use of a large multifunctional protein l which includes a central polymerase domain l proteins direct both rna replication and gene transcription of the bunya- and arenavirus genomes using similar mechanisms hence the reason why this review covers both viral families to frame the biological context in which these l proteins work we have included information relevant to the central processes associated with the bunya- and arenavirus life cycles in infected cells this review does not attempt to present a comprehensive and detailed discussion of the molecular and cell biology of these two viral families which can be found in other recent reviews cited in this review but rather our goal is to present an updated description of the transcription and replication mechanisms used by these two viral families on the light of recently reported high resolution structures for the bunyavirus la crosse lacv l protein and related influenza trimeric polymerases bunyavirus natural hosts are arthropods animals and humans only the bunyavirus from genus tospovirus infect plants certain bunyaviruses appear to infect only arthropods indeed with the notable exception of hantaviruses which are generally spread by rodents bunyaviruses have arthropods as natural reservoirs and phylogenetic studies suggest an arthropod origin for this family of viruses marklewitz et al 2015 bunyavirus cause persistent infections in their arthropod or rodent reservoirs in arthropods can be transmitted vertically by transovarian transmission or horizontally by venereal transmission and the transmission to humans and animals occurs by insect bites ticks mosquitoes or sandflies hantavirus are transmitted to humans mainly through aerosolized urine faeces and saliva from infected rodents human to human transmission have been reported in very few cases for andes virus genus hantavirus padula et al 1998 and is generally associated like reported for crimean congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv genus nairovirus and rift valley fever virus rvfv genus phlebovirus kim et al 2015 martinez-valdebenito et al 2014 vaheri and vapalahti 2011 van eeden et al 1985 to nosocomial infections of healthcare workers exposed to infected patients or slaughterhouse workers exposed to infected animals like sheep goats and cattle that can reach very high titers of virus in blood human infections by bunyavirus can be severe and eventually fatal new world hantaviruses andes virus and sin nombre virus cause pulmonary syndrome while the old word hantaviruses hantaan virus cause hemorrhagic fever hf with renal syndrome reaching fatality rates of 50 and 115 respectively another relevant example is cchfv one of the most virulent and enigmatic bunyaviruses in humans cchfv infection causes severe hf with mortality rates typically between 20 and 30 bente et al 2013 this is particularly tragic taking into account that each year more than 1000 human cases are reported from countries of south-eastern europe and turkey in contrast naturally infected animals do not appear to develop noticeable clinical symptoms despite in viral endemic areas seropositivity can be detected in many mammalian species including bats hoogstraal 1979 phlebovirus infections eg rvfv or severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus sftsv cause fevers that can be mild but can also result in severe hf ocular disease thrombocytopenia or encephalitis reaching fatality rates of 1230 elliott and brennan 2014 zhao et al 2012 human bunyavirus infections are zoonotic and thereby their geographic incidence correlates with the distribution of the viral natural reservoirs the continuous and increasing human impact on the environment is affecting the distribution and density of insects and animals through climate change clegg 2009 elliott 2009 and other factors including changes in land use and human activities like extensive farming which can favour the spread and the outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases cleaveland et al 2007 as a consequence the geographical distribution of bunyavirus caused diseases is expanding as illustrated by the recent first lethal outbreak of cchv in spain garca rada 2016 indicating that cchfv is expanding from eastern to western europe other new pathogenic bunyavirus strains have emerged including sftsv that emerged in china in 2009 yu et al 2011 and expanded to korea and japan schmallenberg virus emerged in 2011 infecting cattle and quickly spread in western europe elliott and brennan 2014 hoffmann et al 2012 and toscana phlebovirus that was first isolated in 1971 in italy and has expanded to surrounding countries spain greece portugal and turkey causing from asymptomatic infections to meningitis and meningoencephalitis charrel et al 2005 arenaviruses cause chronic infections of rodents across the world and human infections occur through mucosal exposure to aerosols or by direct contact of abraded skin with infectious materials buchmeier 2007 both viral and host factors contribute to a variable outcome of arenavirus infection ranging from rapid virus clearance by the host defenses to chronic infection in the absence of clinical symptoms to severe acute disease buchmeier 2007 several arenaviruses cause hf disease in humans and pose important public health problems in their endemic regions bray 2005 geisbert and jahrling 2004 thus lassa virus lasv infects several hundred thousand individuals yearly in west africa resulting in a high number of lassa fever lf cases associated with high morbidity and mortality richmond and baglole 2003 notably increased traveling has led to the importation of lf cases into non-endemic metropolitan areas freedman and woodall 1999 isaacson 2001 in addition hf arenaviruses represent a credible bioterrorism threat borio et al 2002 moreover evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed lcmv is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance fischer et al 2006 mets et al 2000 palacios et al 2008 peters 2006 there are no fda-licensed arenavirus vaccines and current anti-arenaviral therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin which is only partially effective and associated with significant side effects bausch et al 2010 therefore there is a pressing need to develop effective strategies to combat human pathogenic arenaviruses a task that will be facilitated by a better understanding of the arenavirus molecular and cell biology the prototypic arenavirus lcmv provides investigators with a highly tractable experimental system to investigate virus-host interactions and associated disease including zoonotic events at the root of many emerging viral infections of humans studies using lcmv have led to major concepts in virology and immunology that apply universally to other viral infections including virus-induced immunopathology and mhc restriction oldstone 2002 zinkernagel 2002 and the contribution to viral persistence of negative immune regulators like pdl-1 barber et al 2006 age immune status and genetic background of the mouse as well as route of infection strain and viral dose influence the outcome of lcmv infection of the mouse buchmeier 2007 oldstone 2002 zinkernagel 2002 which facilitates the identification and characterization of both host and viral determinants of the outcome of infection bunyaviruses have a genome consisting of three strands of negative-sense single-strand rna designated according to their size as l large m medium and s small elliott 2014 the basic set of genes encoded by all bunyaviruses encompasses the multifunctional rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrpol named l protein in the l segment the two glycoproteins gn and gc in the m segment and the nucleocapsid protein np in the s segment additional non-structural proteins can be coded within the m and s segments named nsm and nss respectively following different coding strategies fig 1
 except for hantavirus bunyaviruses code in the m segment the nsm protein as an insertion between the two glycoproteins which are cleaved by cellular proteases during the polyprotein maturation orthobunya- nairo- and phlebovirus or by having the coding orf with the inverse polarity tospoviruses at the 5 of the genomic fragment bunyavirus transcription is carried out using the negative sense viral genome as template the mrnas of nsv proteins coded in the inverse polarity positive need to be transcribed using the positive sense viral crna as template this implicates that the viral transcription promoters need to be functional in both vrna and crna the strategy of inverse polarity is used in the s segment for the nss by tospovirus phlebovirus and arenaviruses see below with the exception of anopheles a anopheles b and tete serogroups the orthobuyaviruses code for an nss protein by overlapping the orf with the np mohamed et al 2009 bunyavirus nss play an eminent role in inhibiting the interferon response ly and ikegami 2016 schoen and weber 2015 and in plants for tospovirus interferes the plant antiviral rna silencing hedil and kormelink 2016 nsm proteins instead are integral membrane proteins with an unclear general role among bunyavirus nsm has been associated to viral assembly in bunv shi et al 2006 and been shown to be nonessential for virus replication in oropuche virus tilston-lunel et al 2016 and reported to inhibit apoptosis in rvfv won et al 2007 each of the viral rnas vrnas contains non-coding sequences ncrs at their 5-and 3-termini ends also known as untranslated regions utrs which play an essential role as promoters of genome transcription and replication see below these regions include sequences involved in genome packaging and transcription termination signals the most characteristic feature of the 5 and 3 utrs is the high conservation and complementarity of their nucleotides at the genome boundaries in fig 1 we can see the standard sequences found in each genus these regions have been studied for orthobunyavirus in two independent studies determining that the essential features to be functional are the specific sequence for most of the first eleven nucleotides and the 3-5 complementarity for the next four nucleotides barr and wertz 2004 kohl et al 2004 looking at the conserved sequences of each genus we realize that have in common at least eight nucleotides with near to perfect watson-crick complementary fig 1 based on cross linking experiments these complementary regions were proposed to base pair in the rnps forming panhandled genomes this idea was reinforced by the circular nature of bunyaviral rnps and have been extensively repeated in the bibliography raju and kolakofsky 1989 strikingly structural and functional studies on the lacv l protein and its interaction with the viral promoter clashed with this hypothesis by showing a specific l protein  promoter interaction but only if both 5 and 3 genomic ends are single stranded see below and not as dsrna consequently the hypothesis of dsrna ended genomes have been updated kolakofsky 2016 the ncrs extend beyond the promoter being very variable in length between bunyavirus ranging from 14 and 44 nucleotides for hantavirus oropouche virus 5 and 3 respectively and 169 and 226 nucleotides for orthobunyavirus bunyamwera serogroup elliott and blakqori 2011 the termination signals as well as packaging signals are presumably associated to rna secondary structures as stem loops albario et al 2007 ikegami et al 2007 osborne and elliott 2000 this needs to be compatible with the mechanism of vrna coating by the nps which tends to maintain the rna as single stranded reguera et al 2014 some of these loops may emerge from the rnps and should be free of nps in order to be accessible to the polymerase or other putative factors controlling transcription termination rnp packing or virus budding arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bi-segmented negative-stranded rna genome each genome segment l large 73 kb and s small 35 kb uses an ambisense coding strategy to direct the synthesis of two polypeptides in opposite orientation separated by a non-coding intergenic region igr the s rna encodes the viral np and the glycoprotein precursor gpc that is co-translationally cleaved by the signal peptidase to generate a 58-amino acid stable signal peptide ssp and post-translationally processed by the site 1 protease s1p to generate the mature virion surface glycoproteins gp1 and gp2 that together with ssp form the gp complex that mediates virus receptor recognition and cell entry beyer et al 2003 pinschewer et al 2003 the ssp has been implicated in different aspects of the trafficking and function of the viral envelope glycoproteins saunders et al 2007 york et al 2004 york and nunberg 2009 york and nunberg 2007 york and nunberg 2006 gp-1 mediates virus interaction with host cell surface receptors and is located at the top of the spike away from the membrane and is held in place by ionic interactions with the n-terminus of the transmembrane gp-2 the arenavirus ring finger protein z is a structural component of the virion that has been shown to be the arenavirus counterpart of the m protein found in many other ns enveloped rna viruses that plays a critical role in assembly and cell release of mature infectious virions perez and de la torre 2003 strecker et al 2003 urata et al 2006 the l rna encodes the viral rna dependent rna polymerase l protein and the small ring finger protein z that has functions of a bona fide matrix protein see below perez et al 2003 strecker et al 2003 arenavirus genomes exhibit high degree of sequence conservation at their 3-termini and similarly to other viruses with segmented negative strand sns rna genomes they exhibit 5- and 3- complementary at their l and s genome segments that are predicted to form panhandle structures there are significant differences in sequence and predicted folded structure between the s and l igr but among isolates and strains of the same arenavirus species the s as well as l igr sequences are highly conserved np the most abundant viral polypeptide both in infected cells and virions is the main structural component of the viral rnp responsible for directing the biosynthetic processes of rna replication and gene transcription of the viral genome np exhibits also a type i interferon ifn-i counteracting activity that initial mutation-function studies mapped to the c-terminus of np martinez-sobrido et al 2009 martinez-sobrido et al 2007 martinez-sobrido et al 2006 crystallographic studies identified distinct n- and c-terminal domains within np of the old world arenaviruses lasv brunotte et al 2011a brunotte et al 2011b hastie et al 2011 qi et al 2010 and lcmv west et al 2014 and similar findings were subsequently documented for the new world arenaviruses junin zhang et al 2013 and tacaribe jiang et al 2013 the n-terminal domain was proposed to have potential cap-binding activity that could provide the host-derived primers to initiate transcription by the virus polymerase qi et al 2010 however subsequent studies showed that this putative np cap-binding domain corresponded to the np rna binding site and thereby the cap-binding activity of np remains to be proven hastie et al 2011 in contrast the c-terminal domain has a folding that mimics that of the deddh family of 3- 5 exoribonucleases like the one associated with sars coronavirus nsp14 protein eckerle et al 2010 functional studies confirmed the 3  5 exoribonuclease activity of lasv np which was proposed to be critical for the anti-ifn activity of np but dispensable for the role of np on replication and transcription of the viral genome this assertion however needs to be carefully evaluated as lcmv with a mutant np lacking the 3- 5 exoribonuclease had a large decrease in fitness during its replication in ifn-deficient vero cells huang et al 2015 martinez-sobrido et al 2009 the arenavirus l protein has a central region that conserved motifs characteristically found in the rdrpols fig 5 see below of negative strand rna viruses nsvs whereas the n-and c-terminal parts did not exhibit clear protein signatures including rna helicases or methyltransferases involved in rna capping vieth et al 2004 mutation-function studies of the lasv l protein showed that residues critical for function were located both within and outside the predicted polymerase domain and identified specific amino acid residues that were required for rna transcription but not replication mediated by the lasv polymerase in cell-based minigenome mg assays hass et al 2008 lehmann et al 2014 lelke et al 2010 interestingly mutations of evolutionary conserved acidic asp and glu and basic lys and arg residues within the lasv l protein identified residues that played a critical role in mrna synthesis without significantly affecting rna replication lelke et al 2010 acidic and basic residues can contribute to catalytic and binding sites for endoribonucleases and capping enzymes and bioinformatics analysis revealed that the n-terminus of lasv l protein had a distant similarity to type ii endonucleases ens lelke et al 2010 moreover the crystal structure of the n-terminal region of lcmv uncovered an en domain of similar structure to the en domains of the influenza pa and la crosse l proteins morin et al 2010 likewise a high-resolution crystal structure of the n-terminal region of lasv l protein revealed high structural homology with the one determined for the en domain present in the n-terminal region of lcmv l wallat et al 2014 biochemical and functional studies have shown that lasv l protein is organized into three distinct structural domains and that at specific amino acid positions lasv l can be split into an n-and c-parts that are able to functionally trans-complement each other brunotte et al 2011a brunotte et al 2011b in addition electron microscopy characterization of a functional machupo macv l protein has revealed a core ring-domain decorated by appendages which likely reflects a modular organization of the arenavirus polymerase kranzusch et al 2010 kranzusch and whelan 2012 arenavirus the l protein function is regulated by the z protein a small 11 kda ring finger protein that mediates several distinct virusvirus and virus-host proteinprotein interactions that contribute to its role as a bona fide matrix protein matrix that regulates viral assembly and budding as well as a key actor in regulating viral rna synthesis and counteracting some components of the host innate immune response to infection the z protein is encoded by an orf with genome polarity and transcription of its mrna starts at the 5 end of the l rna anti-genomic segment fig 1 thus the transcription of z mrna occurs once the l anti-genomic rnp species have been produced and not during the first transcriptional rounds of the infection z expression levels are regulated and differences in its expression between early and late phases of the virus life cycle likely reflect different roles played by z at different stages of infection low expression levels of z early during the virus life cycle can facilitate its role as regulator of viral rna replication and gene transcription garcin et al 1993 through direct interaction with the l protein kranzusch and whelan 2011 whereas increased z expression levels a later times during the arenavirus life cycle will promote virus assembly and budding perez et al 2003 strecker et al 2003 urata et al 2006 bunyaviruses can use different receptors for cell entry including dc-sign also used by other viruses such hiv or hcv l-sign or glycosaminoglycans such heparan sulphate albornoz et al 2016 the interaction between the cellular receptor and the bunyavirus surface glycoprotein triggers endocytosis and membrane fusion in a clathrine dependent manner which leads to the release of the bunyavirus rnp into the cellular cytoplasm where transcription and replication take place the arrangement of the glycoproteins in their surface is variable showing from pleomorphic arrangement eg bunyamwera and lacv orthobunyavirus to icosahedral symmetry eg rvfv and uukuniemi phlebovirus with t  12 triangulation bowden et al 2013 verby et al 2008 the glycoproteins interact with the rnps nps and the rna probably giving stability to the particles an important aspect for virus transmission that could be studied in bunyaviruses as has been done for non-enveloped spherical viruses reguera et al 2004 the specific interactions between the viral glycoproteins and the rnps are also determinant for the packing of rnps into viral particles during virus maturation which takes place generally in viral factories at the golgi apparatus pettersson and melin 1996 salanueva et al 2003 consistent with a broad host range and cell type tropism a highly conserved and widely expressed cell surface protein alpha-dystroglycan adg has been identified as a main receptor for lcmv lasv and several other arenaviruses cao et al 1998 kunz et al 2002 however many arenaviruses appear to be able to use alternative receptors kunz et al 2004 and human transferrin receptor 1 was identified as a cellular receptor used for entry of the new world hf arenaviruses junin junv and macv radoshitzky et al 2007 arenavirus cell entry is via receptor-mediated endocytosis the acidic environment of the late endosome facilitates a ph-dependent conformational change in the gpc complex that induces a gp-2 mediated fusion step between viral and cell membranes eschli et al 2006 which releases the viral rnp into the cytoplasm and subsequent onset of viral rna synthesis the tripartite and bipartite segmented genomes of bunya- and arenaviruses are never found as free rna species but rather always assembled into rnps containing genome rna species tightly interacting with the viral nps and at least one molecule of the l protein per rnp complex the rnps are carried from cell to cell in enveloped virions of an average diameter of between 80 and 160 nm to be infectious bunya- and arenaviruses need to include at least one copy of each genome segment into the mature virion progeny fluorescence in situ hybridization fish experiments performed using rvfv infected cells and virions showed heterogeneity in segment composition of mature bunyavirus virions suggesting that packaging is less selective that the one observed for the related orthomyxoviruses with eight genome rna segments schreur and kortekaas 2016 because of the negative polarity of the bunya- and arenavirus vrna once in the cytoplasm the rnps need first to transcribe their mrnas as a necessary step to produce the viral proteins for next replicative rounds this is the essential reason why they as all nsvs need to carry all the viral transcriptional machinery rnps in the viral particles transcription initiation is carried out through a unique mechanism shared by all snsv called cap-snatching by which a short fragment of 5-capped primers are stolen by the l protein machinery from the host cell mrnas to prime the synthesis of viral mrnas bunya- and arenavirus polymerases differ on the length of the 5-capped primers they use to prime transcription which are 1218 and 45 long for bunyaviruses and arenaviruses respectively bunyavirus transcription is coupled to translation barr 2007 suggesting that a coordination perhaps including specific interactions may occur between the rnps and the cellular translational machinery in contrast in cells infected with the arenavirus tacaribe transcription of the np mrna could be detected early on in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis franze-fernndez et al 1987 transcription termination occurs at specific conserved sequences termination signals without the addition of a poly-a tails bunyavirus and arenaviruses carry out replication in two steps first the de novo primer independent synthesis of an intermediate rna with positive polarity crna and second using this as template the synthesis of the new generation of genomic vrna with negative polarity both processes are deeply coupled to the rnp assembly and np and l protein availability therefore the np concentration in the infected cells could influence the replication versus transcription activity of the l protein the rnps of many bunya- and arenaviruses have been characterised by negative staining electron microscopy in viruses infected cells and isolated rnps a common aspect is their assembly in flexible pearl necklace like circular assemblies talmon et al 1987 young and howard 1983 some bunyavirus as hantavirus could have rigid rnps at least at some steps of the infection goldsmith et al 1995 for orthobunya- and phleboviruses the flexibility is achieved by the np  np interactions that mediated by flexibly hanging c- and n-terminal extensions can adopt several proteinprotein geometries reguera et al 2014 this would allow to adopt different degrees of rnp compaction at different steps of the viral cycle reguera et al 2013 eg a relaxed form for the vrna and crna reading during replication and transcription and a compacted form for virus budding arenavirus polymerases need np and l as minimal viral trans-acting factor required for efficient rna synthesis hass et al 2004 lee et al 2000 lee and de la torre 2002 lopez et al 2001 genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that oligomerization of l is required for the activity of the arenavirus polymerase sanchez and de la torre 2005 consistent with this finding biochemical and mg-based functional studies have shown that lasv l protein contains both n- and c-termini sites that mediate l-l interaction brunotte et al 2011a brunotte et al 2011b lcmv mrnas have 4 or 5 non-templated nucleotides and a cap structure at their 5-ends which are obtained from cellular mrnas via a cap-snatching mechanism whose details remain to be determined but a functional en domain within the n-terminal region of the arenavirus l polymerase plays a critical role in this process transcription termination of subgenomic non-polyadenylated viral mrnas were mapped to multiple sites within the distal side of the igr meyer et al 2002 and the igr was shown to act as a bona fide transcription termination signal for the virus polymerase pinschewer et al 2005 the np and l coding regions are transcribed into a genomic complementary mrna whereas the gpc and z coding regions are not translated directly from genomic rna but rather from genomic sense mrnas that are transcribed using as templates the corresponding antigenome rna species which also function as replicative intermediates the 5-end of arenavirus genome and antigenome rna species contain a non-templated g residue that has been proposed to reflect a prime-and-realign mechanism for rna replication mediated by the virus polymerase garcin and kolakofsky 1992 garcin and kolakofsky 1990 raju et al 1990 mutation-function analysis of the genome 5-and 3-termini using the lcmv and lasv mg-based assays indicated that the activity of the arenavirus genomic promoter requires both sequence specificity within the highly conserved 3-terminal 19 nucleotides of arenavirus genomes and the integrity of the predicted panhandle structure formed via sequence complementarity between the 5- and 3-termini of viral genome rnas hass et al 2006 perez and de la torre 2002 these studies revealed that arenavirus rna replication and transcription are regulated in a coordinated manner likewise mg-based assays provided direct experimental confirmation that intracellular levels of np do not determine the balance between virus rna replication and transcription pinschewer et al 2003 a finding conceptually similar to that reported for the paramyxovirus rsv fearns et al 1997 cell-based mg systems for different arenaviruses including lcmv lasv and tcrv have shown that z protein is not required for rna replication and gene transcription mediated by the virus l polymerase but rather z exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both rna biosynthetic processes mediated by the arenavirus polymerase complex cornu and de la torre 2001 hass et al 2004 lee et al 2000 lopez et al 2001 consistent with these findings studies using in vitro reconstitution of rna synthesis directed by the l polymerase of macv have provided evidence that z via direct interaction with l is able to lock the l polymerase in a promoter-bound catalytically inactive state kranzusch and whelan 2011 however the mechanisms by which z exerts this action to downregulate viral rna synthesis and promote virus assembly remain little understood the determination of high resolution structures of the arenavirus l proteins in complex with their z proteins will facilitate the elucidation of this question the development of arenavirus reverse genetics systems has provided investigators with a novel and powerful approach to investigate the viral cis-acting sequences and proteins both viral and cellular that control cell entry rna replication gene expression assembly and budding of arenaviruses cheng et al 2013 emonet et al 2011 ortiz-riano et al 2013 likewise the ability to rescue infectious arenaviruses with predetermined mutations in their genomes and examine their phenotypes both in cultured cells and in vivo this approach should facilitate to identify and functionally characterize novel arenavirus l-host cell protein interactions that may contribute to different outcomes of arenavirus infection the structure of the lacv bunyavirus polymerase reported by gerlach et al 2015 provides the first high resolution structural insight for a snsv l protein and its astonishing similarity with the influenza heterotrimeric polymerase strongly suggests that l proteins for bunya- and arenavirus share a common structural architecture implicating similar mechanisms of action with possibly genus or species specific variations in the central region of the polypeptide chain the l proteins have the rdrpol subdomains palm fingers and thumb where the a b c d e and f also named pre-a motifs reside fig 2
 the rdrpol n-terminus is extended by a 490 aa long domain named pa-c like domain due to the extraordinary similarity that has with the influenza c-terminal domain of the pa polymerase subunit this domain is further extended by a linker region and together conform one side of the protein core the c-terminus of the rdrpol is extended by several protein domains bridge thumb ring and lid c- and n- extensions close the rdrpol like a cage a globular core where the access is very restricted and controlled fig 3
 this kind of caged polymerases product of n- and c-terminal extensions of the rdrpol domain whether by elongating the polypeptide chain eg bunyavirus or by adding protein subunits in complex eg influenza are found in non segmented nsv and dsrna virus polymerases reguera et al 2016a despite the fact that bunyaviridae and arenaviridae exhibit broad genetic divergence their l proteins as well as those from other related snsv like tenuivirus or emaravirus share common essential aspects the large l proteins are variable in size ranging from 2000 to 3950 aa in length reptarenavirus and nairovirus genus respectively despite these differences all maintain the active site conserved motifs in the central part of the polypeptide chain fig 2 the determination of the structures of the lacv and influenza polymerases allowed by structural alignments the identification of two new conserved motifs for snsv named motif g and h that are located near to the rdrpol catalytic motifs in the structure and whose contributions to polymerase function remain to be experimentally determined fig 2 the motif g is the only not belonging to the conserved rdrpol subdomains it is deployed in the active site from the n-terminal extension of the cage the pa-c like domain see lacv l protein scheme in fig 4
and gerlach et al 2015 the conserved arginine of motif g is positioned close to the priming ntp position in the active site the conservation of this arginine residue within motif g was noticed early based on sequence alignments but only the recent structural data have revealed its association to the polymerase active site gerlach et al 2015 mller et al 1994 the polymerase motifs are surrounded by large protein regions with no sequence similarity and genus-wise very variable in size from which no structural or functional information could be inferred by aminoacid sequence alignments the landmark represented by the determination of the atomic structure of the lacv polymerase by x-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy uncovered large protein stretches flanking the conserved polymerase domain building a cage structure wherein the rdrpol reaction occurs gerlach et al 2015 fig 3 four independent channels give access to a central chamber inside the cage with space to harbour a small stretch of dsrna based on homology with other viral polymerases these channels could be assigned to ntp entry template entry template exit and product exit channels this channels distribution indicates that the vrna crna and mrnas are synthetized and sorted from the nascent dsrna in two independent strands before exiting the cage explaining how snsvs are able to produce their genomes as single stranded the close proximity of the template entry and exit channels also explains how the template can be read within rnp assemblies with a minimal disruption and possibly without the need of any rnp disassembly the crystal structure of the related influenza heterotrimeric polymerase has the same overall architecture and cavity distribution confirming that it is a common feature for all snsv including bunyaviridae and arenaviridae l proteins this feature is not unique for snsv as the polymerases of dsrna viruses adopt a similar cage architecture with the four channels a finding that supports the evolutionary relationship between these two groups of viruses and the relevance of these cage shaped polymerases in rna virus evolution reguera et al 2016a another conserved feature between the l proteins from bunyaviridae and orthomyxoviridae families is the allosteric regulation of rna synthesis by the 5-end of the vrna that folds as a hairpin and allosterically binds to the polymerase surface inducing the active conformation of the rdrpol active site this interaction is rather folding specific and allows for certain degree of sequence variability as long as the folding and key interacting bases in the loop are preserved the structure of the lacv polymerase also supports the specific recognition of the viral rna showing the extended 3-end vrna binding with high affinity and in a sequence specific manner to a rna binding site on the surface of the polymerase this binding site is different to the one observed in influenza suggesting differences among snsv in the 3 rna binding site within their polymerases which may provide also a main mechanism for the genome-specific recognition by the different polymerases the need for the polymerase to recognize the same specific sequence in the vrna and crna can explain the strict complementarity of 5 and 3 genomic ends since it ensures that the same sequences are maintained at the 3-end of vrna and crna species the results derived from structural studies on bunyavirus l polymerase are consistent with those obtained from the structure of the vrna  l protein complex for the arenavirus machupo macv where the 3 vrna end was shown to bind the l protein as single stranded and in a sequence specific manner kranzusch et al 2010 in the case of arenaviruses the z protein plays a central role on the regulation of the polymerase activity by allowing the interaction of l protein  vrna but inhibiting rna synthesis likely by stabilising the l protein  rna complex in a pre-initiation state kranzusch and whelan 2011 crystallographic and cryoem structures show that the n-terminus of the lacv l protein corresponding to the en responsible for cap-snatching is flexibly hanging from the central core this peripheral extension of the l proteins has also been observed for the macv l protein and described in detail by high resolution structures for the polymerases of influenza and vsv and were associated in all the structures to the transcriptional processes of cap-snatching for snsv and capping for nsnsv chou et al 2016 kranzusch et al 2010 pflug et al 2014 reguera et al 2016a these peripheral extensions are in all these polymerases located at the opposite side of the template rna entry and exit channels showing a protein compartmentalization where the rna reading occurs in one side and the product rna in the other this has interesting implications eg the cap snatching en would not have access to the vrna template which enters the l protein at the opposite side when is detached from the nps for entering the l protein 
bunyaviridae and arenaviridae cap-snatching ens were first identified within the amino terminus of the bunyavirus lacv and the arenavirus lcmv l proteins morin et al 2010 reguera et al 2010 their crystallographic structures have a common basic bilobular fold consisting in a central beta sheet lobe surrounded by alpha helixes connected to an alpha bundle lobe fig 4 the active site is located between the lobes where two catalytic manganese ions are highly coordinated by the catalytic residues that constitute the conserved motif pd edxk this motif defines this family of ens and can be found in the amino terminus of near all snsv l proteins with the notable exception of nairovirus including crimean congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv which after the en motif have an additional extension of 600 aa at n-terminus harbouring the otu domain see below additional structures of cap-snatching ens were reported for hantaviruses and lassa virus fernndez-garca et al 2016 reguera et al 2016b wallat et al 2014 which together with orthomyxoviridae family ens dias et al 2009 guilligay et al 2014 yuan et al 2009 have generated a broad perspective of their structure and function the pd edxk motif has been also shown to be essential for transcription for phlebovirus rvfv and nairovirus cchfv by mutagenesis in mg systems devignot et al 2015 klemm et al 2013 a recent comparative study has proposed the classification of the cap-snatching ens in two groups attending to the presence or absence of a catalytic histidine the ens having the catalytic histidine his   with hpd edxk motif predominant in bunyaviridae and orthomyxoviridae families show a high in vitro en activity when isolated a second group lacking or substituting the his by a glutamic acid his- predominant in arenaviridae has barely detectable en activity these huge differences in activity can be explained by structural differences that for arenavirus ens would favour the non-canonical binding of the catalytic metal ions since in the infection context both kind of ens are actively performing cap-snatching these differences in in vitro activity can reflect a highly controlled process of cap-snatching with different regulatory mechanisms in arena- and bunyaviridae l proteins the firsts needing the activation of the en for transcription in the context of the full length l protein this classification of ens on his active his- barely active have important implications for the development of antiviral drugs targeting cap-snatching ens reguera et al 2016b in addition to the cap-snatching these ens could play other roles in the infection we can find an example in the andes virus l protein where the highly active en is able to supress the mrna levels and protein expression in mammalian cells heinemann et al 2013 another crucial aspect of the cap-snatching process is the recognition of the mrna 5 capped structures this is achieved in orthomyxoviridae by a cap-binding domain located in the pb2 polymerase subunit guilligay et al 2008 pflug et al 2014 and predicted to reside at the c-terminus of arena- and bunyaviridae l proteins gerlach et al 2015 reguera et al 2010 the available lacv polymerase structure lacks this region and thereby further structural and functional studies are needed to confirm the presence of cap-binding domains to gain a better understanding of cap-snatching mechanism in arena- and bunyaviridae l proteins as have been achieved for influenza polymerases reich et al 2014 thierry et al 2016 see the review in this special issue pflug et al 2017 the l proteins of the nairovirus genus of the bunyaviridae family including crimean congo hemorrhagic virus cchfv have additional extensions or insertions inside the basic architecture shared between snsv l proteins based on the common architecture between nsv and the conserved en and rdrpol motifs it appears that nairovirus l proteins extend their n-terminus beyond the cap-snatching en by  600 aa fig 5
 this extension similarly to the ens of influenza and lacv is probably hanging from the central polymerase core and includes at its very n-terminus a conserved ovarian tumour otu domain the otu domain protease activity counteracts the host innate immune response by deconjugating isg15 and poly-ubiquitin conjugates targeting a specific motif conserved in both conjugates rlrlgg frias-staheli et al 2007 the structures of the cchfv otu domain in complex with isg15 and ubiquitin show at the atomic level the specific recognition of the rlrlgg motif in the protease active site cavity james et al 2011 the function and structure of the 400 aa residues between the otu domain and the en still need to be elucidated between the en and the rdrpol subdomains is found the pa-c like domain connected to the en domain by a linker that buttresses the polymerase core and positions the en at the edge of the product exit channel where the cap-snatching takes place compared to other bunya- and arenaviruses nairovirus and tospovirus l proteins have a larger pa-c like domain using as reference motif g we can extrapolate that tospovirus have an insertion about 190 aa long in the viral rna binding lobe area and cchfv have an even bigger insertion about 650 aa long occurring between the pa-c like and the polymerase fingers subdomain the structural consequences could range from an enlargement of the polymerase core to the insertion of extra domains with possibly new functions since in lacv l protein the pa-c like domain include the viral rna binding lobe engaged on 3 promoter recognition and allosteric regulation of the 5 rna through specific insertions the clamp and the arch see fig 3 the rna binding is one of the polymerase functions susceptible to be affected by this enlargement in tospovirus at the c-terminus where the cap-binding domain is predicted to be nairovirus and tospovirus l proteins have additional extensions of 325 and 390 aa respectively again this could cause the enlargement of the polymerase core or could reflect the addition of new functional domains the extra functions associated with the complexity of the nairovirus l proteins represent novel targets for therapeutic drugs which represent an unmet need to combat the devastating effects of cchfv infections of humans comparison of mammarenavirus z proteins aa sequences shows in overall a modest degree of conservation below the 20 this similarity is even lower when the z sequences of the recently identified reptarenaviruses are included in the alignments there are however three regions within z that exhibit a higher degree of conservation fig 6
 i a myristoylation site marked by a g motif conserved at the n-terminus critical for membrane anchoring strecker et al 2006 strecker et al 2003 and interaction of with other viral proteins capul et al 2011 ii a central ring domain borden and freemont 1996 binding two zinc ions through 3 conserved motifs ring 13 iii a c-terminal part harbours one or more proline rich regions forming the late motif late motifs have been identified in the matrix proteins of various enveloped rna viruses and in the gag proteins of a number of retroviruses they mediate proteinprotein interactions between viral proteins and components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport escrt which mainly constitute the vacuolar protein sorting vps pathway freed 2002 both old world ow and new world nw mammarenavirus contain a highly conserved yxxl motif located in central ring domain ring 2 which is not present in reptarenavirus furthermore all mammarenavirus z proteins carry ptsap- and pppy-type late domains in their c-terminal parts while reptarenavirus z proteins carry a shorter pep or are depleted of late domain ie cas and hans kompis viruses the structure of z lassa virus was solved in complex with eif4e by nmr fig 6 volpon et al 2008 the structure of the complex shows that the n- residue 129 and the c- terminal residue 7799 arms flanking the ring domain are disordered and only the central ring domain is structured it is postulated that the disordered regions enable z protein to recruit a variety of partners ranging from pml promyelocytic leukemia protein eif4e eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e prh proline-rich homeodomain protein and ribosomal p proteins rig-i and caspases but the how still needs to be characterised the structure also shows the important residues of the ring 1 motif for the interaction with eif4e f60 k62 s63 w65 plus n68 k69 in lassa virus numbering 30 32 33 35 38 39 respectively volpon et al 2010 interestingly these residues are not strictly conserved among arenavirus not even within mammarenavirus where conservation is only around f 32 k 93 s 64 w 100 and n38 k54 moreover analytical ultracentrifugation size exclusion chromatography and em studies of lcmv z protein indicate that eif4e can interact with both oligomeric and monomeric forms of z and that oligomeric forms regulate better eif4e kentsis et al 2002 kentsis et al 2001 altogether these data suggested that the structure probably represents only one particular binding mode indeed a recent crystallographic study by hastie and co-workers hastie et al 2016 presents an alternative mode of association of the lassa virus z protein under crystallographic conditions z assembles in a dodecameric manner through a head to tail dimerization of the ring domain this assembly introduces conformational changes thought to be required for a stable oligomerization leading to the viral matrix formation interestingly the late part of ring 3 motif fig 6 residues l102-p108 in lassa virus numbering 7177 seems to contribute to the assembly by connecting vertically the z oligomers which could explain how the matrix expend in the third dimension of space finally that study shows that the disordered regions in n- and c-terminus play no role on the assembly of the oligomeric z structure which is consistent with the n-terminus being responsible for anchoring z to the membrane and the c-terminus mediating z interaction with endosomal components required for moving the maturing virion toward the cell surface these findings are consistent with z playing a key role in virion assembly which is further supported by em studies indicating that z bridges the vrnp with the viral envelope neuman et al 2005 in addition the z protein is also involved in the control of innate immunity all pathogenic mammarenaviruses share an innate immune suppression mechanism that is based on the z n-terminal binding to rig-i-like receptors rlrs xing et al 2015 moreover in the case of nw mammarenavirus and not the ow z protein also contributes in the suppression of type i ifn production by direct interaction with rig-i fan et al 2010 the interactions and mechanisms by which z protein contributes to the arenaviruss ability to counteract the host defence mechanisms are still little understood reviewed in fehling et al 2012 the determination of high resolution structures of the arenavirus z protein in complex with relevant z- host cell interacting partners will help to understand the mechanisms underlying z-mediated regulation of host cell factor functions to promote virus multiplication and how this may relate with the regulation of the l protein function bunya-and arenavirus l proteins specifically replicate and transcribe their viral genomes vrna in the cellular cytoplasm these biosynthetic processes require the negative sense rna genome species to be coated by multiple copies of viral np which together with l protein assembled into a functional vrnp this in turn requires that the vrna np and l polymerase would undergo the appropriate coordinated interactions the structure of lacv l protein has provided key information about how the polymerase interacts and is regulated by its genome this together with the channel distribution described above and the promoter sequence and base pairing requirements for transcription and replication led to propose a model that describes all the necessary steps for vrna replication see fig 7
in gerlach et al 2015 this model has also raised many questions yet to be answered that we summarize in fig 7 the reported lacv l protein structure corresponds to a pre-initiation state where the vrna still did not enter the polymerase fig 7 at this stage the rnp could start transcription or replication the main difference between both processes lies on the use of respectively cap-snatched cellular mrna for priming the initiation or de novo initiation transcription in the related influenza virus polymerase is orchestrated by the cap-binding domain and the en domain the cap-binding domain in influenza virus polymerase is needed for the specific recognition of the capped rna and also for orienting the snatched rna towards the polymerase active site for transcription initiation reich et al 2014 similar requirements are expected for the l proteins but the existence of a cap-binding activity for the l proteins still needs to be proven transcription initiation has been proposed to occur by prime and realign for hanta- and orthobunyavirus based on the non-templated sequences consistently detected in viral mrnas consisting in extra repeated triplets conserved at the genome ends auc auc auc for hantavirus uca uca uca for orthobunyavirus see fig 1 garcin et al 1995 jin and elliott 1993 the prime and realign model proposed for the initiation of rna replication by the arenavirus polymerase differs from the one proposed for bunyavirus transcription and assumes that arenavirus polymerases initiate like many other viral rdrpols rna synthesis de novo only with gtp accordingly arenavirus rna initiation would take place from an internal templated cytidilate once the first phosphodiester bond has been formed the pppgpc will slip backwards on the template and realign creating a nascent chain whose 5 end is at position 1 with respect to the template before the polymerase resumes downstream synthesis to maintain constant the length of the genome rna despite addition of a non-templated nucleotide at the 5-end the polymerase terminates rna synthesis by removing the last base at the 3 end of the nascent chain arenavirus genome and antigenome sequence terminal complementarity combined with the prime and realign mechanism for replication initiation generates double-stranded rna species with an overhanging 5ppp nucleotide a structure that has been shown to escape rig-i recognition marq et al 2010 as well as to act as an rig-i decoy marq et al 2011 and thereby prevent or diminish the subsequent rig-i mediated interferon induction habjan et al 2008 wang et al 2011 therefore the initiation mechanism of arenavirus rna synthesis and likely also hantavirus seem to have evolved for evading the innate immune response triggered by rig-i in addition to the differences between the mechanisms of initiation of gene transcription and rna replication used by the l proteins the mechanisms associated with transcription and replication termination events also exhibit differences transcription termination signals stops the rna synthesis without the polyadenylation of the mrna the closed cage structure of the polymerase does not allow the detachment of the l protein from the template rna therefore the polymerase would be forced to slide until the 5 end of the genome in order to start the next replicative or transcriptional round fig 7 in contrast during replication the transcription termination signal is replicated to produce the full crna species this differential behaviour of the l protein when reading the transcription termination suggest that the transcription or replication modes of the l protein are maintained all along the rna synthesis and not only during initiation future studies should be aimed at solving the important question of identifying and functionally characterizing factors that promote the transcriptase versus replicase modes of the l protein in both cases allosteric regulation of 5 rna binding seems to be an essential requirement for the activation of the active site since the replication is coupled to the rnp assembly and the transcription is coupled to translation in bunyaviruses is reasonable to deduce that the protein environment associated to both processes could be playing a regulatory role from the structural point of view the replication or transcriptional modes of the polymerase could translate in two different conformational states for replication the need of recruiting a new l protein and nucleoproteins candidates these two proteins as necessary replication enhancers and whether this happens through direct interactions with the l protein replicative mode or need the implication of other cellular factors still have to be addressed for the switching to the l protein to the transcriptional mode factors associated to the cellular translational machinery might be playing a role and could also be mediated through direct interactions therefore a trustable characterization of host factors interacting with functional l proteins will provide some clues about which cellular factors could be playing a role in the l protein mode switch knowledge derived from structural and functional analysis of the tri-partite l-np-rna interaction can uncover novel possibilities for the development of antiviral drugs to combat human pathogenic bunya- and arenaviruses in the case of arenaviruses lasv is the one with the highest impact in human health and evidence indicates that morbidity and mortality associated with lasv infection and likely other hf arenavirus infections is associated with at least partly the failure of the hosts innate immune response to restrict virus replication and to facilitate the initiation of an effective adaptive immune response mccormick and fisher-hoch 2002 accordingly the extent of viremia is a highly predictive factor for the outcome of lf patients this scenario suggests that therapeutic interventions resulting in reduced virus load without achieving viral clearance might suffice to promote the recovery of appropriate host defence responses to control virus multiplication and associated disease the nucleoside analogue ribavirin rib 1-b-d-ribofuranosyl-124-triazole-3-carboxamide has been shown to have prophylactic and therapeutic effects against several arenaviruses and bunyaviruses both in cultured cells and in vivo as well as to reduce significantly both morbidity and mortality in humans associated with lasv infection andrei and de clercq 1993 damonte and coto 2002 and experimentally in machupo kilgore et al 1997 junin infections mckee et al 1988 and bunyavirus as hantavirus causing hfrs mckee et al 1988 if given early in the course of clinical disease rib is also an interesting scaffold to develop new therapeutic compounds as etar 1--d-ribofuranosyl-3-ethynyl-124triazole shown to be effective particularly against hantavirus infections probably by having different mechanism of action chung et al 2008 for some bunyavirus infections as the caused by cchfv or rvfv rib treatment have not a significant therapeutic effect bodur et al 2011 recently favipiravir t-705 a broad-spectrum rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor has shown very promising results in guinea pig models of fatal argentine hf disease caused by junv gowen et al 2013 and lf caused by lasv safronetz et al 2015 rib has been shown also to act synergistically with other treatments as illustrated by its use together with t-705 to protect against rvfv phlebovirus scharton et al 2014 and arenaviral westover et al 2016 infections rib also enhanced the antiviral effect of silencing rnas sirna targeting the hazara bunyavirus np mrnas in culture cells flusin et al 2011 but the efficacy of rib to treat bunyavirus human infections remains questionable the anti-arenaviral activity of rib likely involves targeting different steps of arenavirus rna replication and gene expression machinery in addition rib can be used as substrate by the rdrpol of some riboviruses including arenaviruses leading to c to u and g to a transitions cameron and castro 2001 crotty et al 2000 parker 2005 and this mutagenic activity of rib has been linked to its antiviral activity via lethal mutagenesis the anti-arenavirus activity of rib has been recreated in the lcmv ruiz-jarabo et al 2003 and lasv hass et al 2004 mg systems which provide investigators with excellent platforms to identify inhibitors of arenavirus replication and gene expression and to dissect their mechanisms of action as predicted the myristoylation inhibitor 2- hydroxymyristic acid 2-ohm that was shown to inhibit z-mediated arenavirus budding perez et al 2004 did not affect mg driven rna replication and expression which further supports the feasibility of using cell-based mg rescue systems to identify drugs that interfere with specific steps of the arenavirus rna replication and gene transcription processes directed by the arenavirus polymerase the above mentioned sequence and structural constraints of the arenavirus and bunyavirus genome promoters provide new potential targets for drugs capable of disrupting the interaction between the promoter and virus polymerase complexes which would interfere with the essential biosynthetic processes of viral transcription and replication the potential of rna as target for therapeutic intervention is gaining great interest ellenbecker et al 2012 hermann 2000 sucheck and shue 2001 sucheck and wong 2000 the function of many rna molecules depends on defined three-dimensional structure small molecules may interfere with rna functions by a number of mechanisms including inhibition of the formation of competent rna-protein complexes at the level of the polymerase and the nucleoprotein the study of small molecule rna effectors has primarily focused on the aminoglycosides hermann 2000 sucheck and shue 2001 illustrated by the antibiotic activity associated with aminoglycoside targeting of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna during the last years there have been great progresses in developing aminoglycoside-based analogues mimetics to circumvent problems related to oral inactivity toxicity and weak binding of aminoglycosides sears and wong 2001 ye and zhang 2002 moreover recent progress has allowed for the generation of complex combinatorial libraries of aminoglycosides that can be subjected to robust novel screening procedures hermann 2000 sears and wong 2001 sucheck and shue 2001 ye and zhang 2002 these developments are facilitating the identification of drugs that bind specifically to a variety of rna folds thus opening new ways to expand the existing repertoire of protein-targeted therapeutics the potential of aminoglycosides as antiviral molecules has been illustrated by their ability to disrupt selectively the hiv-1 rev-rre zapp et al 1993 and tat-tar wang et al 1998 interactions similar approaches could be used to select aminoglycosides that interact with the arenavirus and bunyavirus promoters and disrupt its activity particularly for the reported secondary structure of the 5 genome ends a conserved feature between snsvs responsible for the allosteric regulation of the l proteins see above the sequence conservation of the promoter of these two families of viruses predicts that aminoglycoside-based small molecules selected based on their activity against the promoter of a prototypic virus of each bunyavirus genus or arenavirus would be also extensive to other members of the genus or family the interference of viral protein  rna interactions have been addressed also by small rna molecules aptamers or compounds suramin that can block rna binding sites of the nucleoproteins with potential antiviral effect this have been explored for rvfv np and similar approaches could be undertaken now towards the l protein  vrna specific binding sites based on the available structures for the in silico design of interfering compounds and aptamers and using the high-throughput fluorescence-based methods available for the study of l protein vrna interactions ellenbecker et al 2015 ellenbecker et al 2014 gerlach et al 2015 mutation-function studies uncovered that many of the mutant l proteins exhibited a strong dominant negative phenotype under assay conditions where the wt and mutant l proteins did not compete for template rna or other trans-acting proteins viral or cellular required for polymerase activity sanchez and de la torre 2005 these results were highly suggestive of l-l interaction being required for lcmv polymerase activity consistent with these genetic data results from co-immunoprecipitation studies using l proteins containing two different tags ha and flag provided biochemical evidence for l-l interaction sanchez and de la torre 2005 intragenic complementation has been documented for the l genes of several nsv viruses and direct l-l physical interaction required for polymerase activity has been demonstrated for the paramyxoviruses sendai and parainfluenza virus 3 piv3 smallwood et al 2002 smallwood and moyer 2004 these results would suggest that disruption of this l-l interaction could have a potent inhibitory effect on the virus polymerase activity self-association of arenavirus np is required for the formation of a functional vrnp therefore disruption of np-np interaction represents another attractive anti-bunya-arenaviral strategy cell-based mg rescue assays are attractive for identifying small molecules capable of disrupting l-l and np-np interactions which would result in inhibition of the rna biosynthetic processes of viral rna replication and gene transcription directed by the functional vrnp protein-protein interactions have been generally regarded as difficult or refractory drug targets for small molecules due to a widely shared assumption that large protein interfaces are unlikely to be disturbed by small molecules however recent evidence suggests that the affinity between interacting proteins may be governed only by a minor part of the interface region targeting these highly localized surfaces may be sufficient for inhibiting proteinprotein interactions notably combinatorial libraries of small molecules generated via solution phase methodology have been uniquely successful in the identification of small molecules that inhibit proteinprotein interactions on a series of significant biological targets boger 2003 boger et al 1998 similar approaches should be applicable to screens to identify small molecule inhibitors of arenavirus and bunyavirus replication machinery the reached milestone of having the first high resolution structure of a bunyaviral l protein opens a new exciting panorama for the coming years certainly the structure of the c-terminus of the l proteins remains to be determined to confirm or not the presence of a cap binding domain there is also the need to achieve different functional conformational states of the protein to better understand the replication and transcription processes as has been described for influenza polymerases thierry et al 2016 and references therein and to confirm or amend the different steps of replication proposed in gerlach et al 2015 nevertheless the prove of concept that l proteins structures can be achieved by obtaining crystallisable stable l protein-rna complexes will boost the structural characterization of other l proteins of highly pathogenic bunyavirus and arenavirus this will provide a detailed description of the structural basis of common essential aspects for their replication and transcription as well as the specific features of each viral strain consequence of host adaption or related to differences of the rnp architecture the consequences will range from allowing structure based site directed mutagenesis in transcription and replication in vitro or mgbased studies or the structure based drug design of inhibitors against crucial interactions with the vrna or the many catalytic activities of the l proteins from highly pathogenic virus finally another interesting aspect for future drug development and based on structural similarities found between l protein cap-snatching en structures will be to test the cross reactivity of drugs targeting influenza polymerase cap-snatching machinery in arenavirus and bunyavirus polymerases indeed a broad spectra antiviral would be the optimal solution to render available drugs for the treatment of such geographically dispersed outbreaks caused by bunya- and arenaviruses zoonotic diseases  the lectin ergic-53 goes viral antonella pasquato stefan kunz   over the past decades several enveloped viruses of the arenavirus filovirus hantavirus and coronavirus families have emerged as causative agents of severe human disease with high mortality considering the current lack of licensed vaccines and the limited therapeutic options at hand the development of novel antiviral drugs against these pathogens is urgently needed a major challenge for the development of efficacious drugs against emerging viruses is frequently the limited molecular information available however as for all viruses these emerging enveloped viruses critically depend on the molecular machinery of the host cell for their multiplication therefore targeting cellular factors represents a promising approach for therapeutic intervention a crucial step in the multiplication of enveloped viruses is the biosynthesis of the fusion-competent envelope glycoprotein gp that decorates the virion surface and mediates host cell attachment and entry enveloped viruses hijack the host cells secretory pathway for gp biosynthesis en route through the secretory pathway viral gps are subject to posttranslational modifications including n- and o-glycosylation and in many cases proteolytic processing by cellular proteases while much has been learned in the past years about the nature of these modifications and their role in gp stability and biological function the specific nature of the cellular factors implicated in gp synthesis transport and maturation is only partially understood in this issue of cell host  microbe klaus et al 2013 sought to close this gap by performing a broad proteomic screen to identify cellular proteins that interact with viral envelope gps using the gps of the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv and the new world hantavirus andes andv as baits an unbiased screen was carried out employing a pull-down approach combined with mass spectrometry analysis the screening results revealed complex interaction patterns for both viral gps including numerous candidate cellular proteins despite remarkable differences in their interactomes both lcmv and andv gps were found to associate with a set of common cellular proteins among the candidate proteins present in both sets a mannose-specific membrane lectin associated with the endoplasmic reticulum er-golgi intermediate compartment ergic ergic-53 was of particular interest itin et al 1996 schweizer et al 1988 in mammalian cells the ergic is a system of tubulovesicular membrane clusters located between the rough er and the golgi er-derived cargo traffics to ergic-53-positive compartments followed by a second vesicular transport step toward the golgi appenzeller-herzog and hauri 2006 ergic-53

this suggests some specificity for class i viral gps a notion that is supported by the recently reported interaction of ergic-53 with the envelope gp of hiv jger et al 2012 remarkably ergic-53 preferentially associated with the immature gp precursors pinpointing early compartments of the secretory pathway as sites of interaction figure 1
 employing a comprehensive set of functional assays a strong case is made for a role of ergic-53 in productive viral infection using a combination of gene silencing by rnai overexpression and dominant-negative dn mutants evidence is provided that ergic-53 is crucial for cell-to-cell propagation of arenaviruses these data are complemented by impaired productive infection in cells derived from patients bearing an ergic-53 null mutation as anticipated from the interaction data the effect of ergic-53 mapped to the viral gp notably cellular ergic-53 was dispensable for viral entry suggesting a role in a later step of the viral life cycle formation and release budding of arenavirus infectious progeny from infected cells requires that assembled viral ribonucleoprotein cores associate at the cell surface with membranes enriched in viral gps considering the function of ergic-53 as a cargo receptor implicated in traffic from the er to the golgi a possible role in gp transport and maturation was assessed rather unexpectedly the absence of ergic-53 had no effect on the transport and posttranslational processing of the viral gp characterization of virus-like particles and authentic virions produced in ergic-53-deficient cells revealed efficient incorporation of gp into particles that showed normal composition but had markedly reduced infectivity under normal conditions ergic-53 does not traffic beyond the cis-golgi appenzeller-herzog and hauri 2006 however viral infection resulted in the appearance of ergic-53 at the cell surface where virion budding occurs indicating virus-induced changes in trafficking of the cargo receptor figure 1 ergic-53 was found to be incorporated into budding virions and its presence was crucial for infectivity initial characterization of the interaction between arenavirus gp and ergic-53 revealed that the carbohydrate recognition domain was critical however in contrast to ergic-53s lectin-type binding to cellular cargo recognition of viral gp was independent of its capacity to oligomerize or bind mannose and did not require ca2 ions the discovery of a role for the cellular cargo receptor ergic-53 in infectious virus production is an exciting finding that further illuminates the process of enveloped virion maturation the ability of ergic-53 to recognize the precursors of a wide variety of class i viral fusion proteins derived from phylogenetically distant viral families suggests an evolutionarily conserved function it will be of interest to extend the screen to enveloped rna viruses with class ii fusion proteins and enveloped dna viruses the present study provides compelling evidence for virus-induced changes in ergic-53 trafficking indicating that viruses can reshape the subcellular distributions of components of the secretory pathway to optimize production of infectious progeny previous studies revealed that the cells unfolded protein response upr can induce ergic-53 trafficking to the cell surface nyfeler et al 2003 and activation of the cellular upr by arenaviruses has recently been reported pasqual et al 2011 since an ergic-53 deficiency does not perturb the overall structure and function of the secretory pathway mitrovic et al 2008 the virus-induced changes in ergic-53 trafficking appear as rather subtle alternations in the host cell the data at hand indicate a crucial role of ergic-53 present in the virion membrane for viral cell entry whereas cellular ergic-53 seems dispensable a hallmark of arenaviruses is the selective incorporation of processed mature gp into nascent virions lenz et al 2001 since ergic-53 associates specifically with gp precursors a direct interaction of ergic-53 and mature gp at the level of the virion membrane appears rather unlikely it will therefore be of great interest to dissect the exact role of ergic-53 during the viral entry process as proposed by klaus et al 2013 ergic-53 may function as a structural component of the virion perhaps by acting as a coreceptor required for virion attachment the requirement of ergic-53 for infectivity of arenaviruses coronaviruses and filoviruses would suggest a coreceptor function in the context of a wide range of cellular receptors and target cells since receptor-mediated viral entry is a complex process the identification of the specific entry steps that depend on ergic-53 will be crucial suitable quantitative assays to discern effects on virus-cell binding from endocytosis andor viral fusion have been developed for many viral systems of interest alternatively ergic-53 may affect virus-cell attachment indirectly by altering the oligomerization andor geometry of gp at the virion surface defining the specific steps requiring ergic-53 may then facilitate a search for viral and cellular binding partners involved in the process this will provide deeper insight into the mechanistic basis of the role of ergic-53 in productive virus infection and shed light on evolutionary conservation across virus families apart from its obvious interest from a basic science point of view ergic-53 also appears as an attractive cellular target for therapeutic intervention humans bearing null mutations in ergic-53 manifest with f5f8d a relatively mild disease neerman-arbez et al 1999 suggesting that targeting this cellular factor in a therapeutic approach may have limited side effects additionally the characterization of the viral gp-ergic-53 interaction performed by klaus et al 2013 indicates differential recognition of cellular cargo and viral gps it is conceivable that small-molecule screens for inhibitors of ergic-53-gp binding may yield candidate compounds that can perturb gp binding with lesser effects on cellular cargo considering the conservation of ergic-53 binding to a wide range of viral gps such candidate inhibitors may show broad antiviral activity  clinical characteristics of critically ill patients co-infected with sars-cov-2 and the influenza virus in wuhan china simin ma xiaoquan lai zhe chen shenghao tu kai qin   the world health organization who named the coronavirus disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 as 2019 novel coronavirus disease covid-19 and declared it as a pandemic similar to the influenza virus sars-cov-2 is commonly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact the worlds population is generally susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection most covid-19 patients show mild influenza-like symptoms such as fever cough and fatigue however approximately 5 of patients rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock and multiple organ failure and are admitted to intensive care units the covid-19-associated mortality rate in china is approximately 23 guan et al 2020 novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 to date no studies have reported on critically ill covid-19 patients who also present with influenza human cases of influenza in wuhan occur in winter most often he and tao 2018 wang et al 2018 which overlaps the peak of covid-19 in wuhan we speculated whether co-infection with sars-cov-2 and the influenza virus existed and if so the influence of this co-infection on clinical features needs to be investigated the southern hemisphere is yet to enter its flu season for the year and in many of these countries the incidence of covid-19 is still increasing meanwhile many western hemisphere countries are still experiencing covid-19 outbreaks and a great many countries around the world will be looking to start planning for flu season 202021 with many public health experts warning of the need to avoid second peaks of covid-19 during flu season therefore answering the above questions is crucial for the formulation of treatment strategies to manage co-infection with sars-cov-2 and the influenza virus in the present study we extracted the clinical data for 95 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from tongji hospital wuhan and discussed the clinical characteristics of critically ill covid-19 patients co-infected with influenza our results may provide new insights into the treatment and control of co-infection with sars-cov-2 and the influenza virus the study was conducted among 95 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 including 50 discharged cases and 45 non-survivors dischargeddied in tongji hospital wuhan china from january 28 2020 to february 29 2020 the discharge criteria were based on the fifth version of diagnosis and treatment guidance for covid-19 published by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china national health commission of peoples republic of china 2020 patients met the discharge criteria if they had normal body temperature for three consecutive days greatly improved respiratory symptoms and pulmonary imaging manifestations and were negative for the presence of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid twice in succession owing to limited medical resources the nucleic acid test for the presence of influenza virus in respiratory specimens was not widely carried out influenza virus diagnosis in this study was based on serology none of the 95 patients had a history of influenza vaccination in the recent flu season this study was approved by the ethics committee of tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science and technology the need for written informed consent was waived by the ethics committee of the hospital for the rapid emergence of this infectious disease the data were extracted from electronic medical records and included age gender history of recent exposure history of chronic diseases hypertension diabetes coronary disease chronic lung disease chronic kidney disease malignant tumors etc symptoms from illness onset to admission fever cough dyspnea fatigue myalgia diarrhea chest pain headache etc laboratory assessments including

medication and tests for sars-cov-2 from respiratory tract specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sputum or bronchial aspiration fluid specimen collection and lung ct scanning were completed for all patients within 24 hours of admission a confirmed covid-19 case was defined as a positive result in a rt-pcr assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens according to who guidelines on receipt of the samples viral rna extraction was performed using a magnetic viral rnadna extraction kit tianlong xian china following the manufacturers instructions this was followed by pcr screening for the specific detection of sars-cov-2 using a commercial kit tianlong a cycle threshold value ct-value 37 was defined as a positive test based on the recommendation of the national

were infected with influenza virus a 2 with influenza virus b 1 with adenovirus 1 with parainfluenza 47 were uninfected a total of 93 patients were finally included 46 495 of whom were infected with influenza virus a or b classified as the flu group while the rest 47 505 were uninfected classified as the non-flu group of these 93 patients 44 were non-survivors and 49 were discharged twenty-two 500 non-survivors and 24 490 survivors were infected with the influenza virus there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients co-infected with sars-cov-2 and the influenza virus between survivors and non-survivors the median age of the 93 patients was 670 years iqr 540720 and females accounted for 452 of the total number of patients table 1
 the median time from illness onset to admission was 120 days iqr 70160 table 1 chronic diseases were found in 538 of the patients with hypertension being the most common followed by diabetes and coronary disease table 1 the most common symptoms on admission were fever cough and dyspnea followed by chest distresschest pain and fatigue table 1 the most common complication was ards followed by acute cardiac injury acute kidney injury and liver dysfunction among the non-survivors the incidence of acute cardiac injury was significantly higher in the flu group 864 than in the non-flu group 545 p   005 table 2
 among the 93 patients there was a significant difference in the proportion of patients with d-dimer levels 5 gml ten times the normal d-dimer value between the flu group 386 and the non-flu group 114 p   001 but no difference in white blood cell counts neutrophil counts lymphocyte counts or levels of crp alt ast ldh creatinine ctni nt-probnp tnf-and il-6 p   005 data not shown among the non-survivors the white blood cell count neutrophil count tnf- d-dimer value proportion of patients with d-dimer levels 5 gml and proportion of patients with elevated creatinine levels were higher in the flu group than in the non-flu group p   005 table 3
 among the survivors there were no significant differences in the laboratory indicators between the flu group and the non-flu group p   005 data not shown the covid-19 pandemic has reached most countries throughout the world making the global situation serious due to the insufficient diagnostic sensitivity of the tests used to detect sars-cov-2 in upper respiratory tract specimens and the similarity between the covid-19 and the influenza early diagnosis of sars-cov-2 and influenza virus co-infection may be more problematic wu et al 2020b among the covid-19 patients included in this study approximately 50 of patients were co-infected with influenza virus and most were co-infected with influenza virus a moreover the similarity between the early clinical symptoms of the two diseases likely increased the false-negative rate of covid-19 detection thereby exacerbating the spread of sars-cov-2 the covid-19 outbreak resulted in a large number of people gathering in the hospitals which intensified the spread of the influenza virus and increased the likelihood of co-infection with sars-cov-2 recent studies have reported that females accounted for approximately 33 of the critically illnon-surviving covid-19 patients in wuhan guan et al 2020 yang et al 2020 in our study females comprised 364 of the non-surviving covid-19 patients including 50 of those with influenza and 227 of those without influenza p  006 due to insignificant statistical difference whether the co-infection may reduce sex difference in the non-surviving covid-19 patients requires a larger sample of research covid-19 patients co-infected with the influenza virus did not demonstrate different clinical symptoms which further compounded the diagnostic difficulties most patients with severe covid-19 exhibit substantially elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines characterized as cytokine storm cao 2020 mehta et al 2020 elevated cytokines also mediate extensive pulmonary pathology leading to massive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages cao 2020 neutrophil counts are increased in both the peripheral blood wang et al 2004 and lung nicholls et al 2003 among critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome extensive pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils in patients with influenza induces lung tissue injury and worsens the disease kulkarni et al 2019 in our study neutrophil and cytokine levels were generally elevated among the non-survivors and the increment was more apparent among the non-survivors with influenza co-infection with the influenza virus may further enhance neutrophil activation thereby contributing not only to an excessive immune response against the virus but also contributing to the development of a cytokine storm studies have reported that elevated d-dimer levels are a risk factor for death in covid-19 patients wu et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 we also found that the d-dimer levels of non-survivors were substantially higher than those of survivors among the non-survivors the d-dimer value was higher among patients with influenza than in those without influenza which may have been due to local vascular injury ischemia and thrombosis caused by a viral infection-associated cytokine storm davidson and warren-gash 2019 our results further confirmed that co-infection with the influenza virus may induce an earlier and more severe cytokine storm in critically ill covid-19 patients leading to serious complications such as shock ards fulminant myocarditis acute kidney injure or multiple organ failure cao 2020 ruan et al 2020 wu et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 the current research had some limitations first the results of serological tests may be false-negative especially within one week of infection or reinfection or they may be false-positive due to long-term infections or carrier states second we were unable to determine the strains of influenza and the infecting strain might affect the clinical characteristics third the included cases originated from wuhan but differences in races and influenza strains among different countries may make covid-19 patients with influenza present different clinical characteristics in addition the number of included cases was small and other factors such as gender age chronic disease and time from illness onset to admission may have affected the results of this study under the background of covid-19 global pandemic the number of patients co-infected with sars-cov-2 and the influenza virus in some countries may increase as the flu season approaches the clinical research of this co-infection especially in the critically ill patients will benefit global control efforts for 2020-2021 researches on different regions races age brackets and influenza strains can reveal the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of co-infected patients more accurately which requires larger sample sizes from multiple countries furthermore research from larger sample could contribute to unveiling whether this co-infection is the higher risk for severe disease or death associated with covid-19 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study of co-infection with sars-cov-2 and the influenza virus among critically ill covid-19 patients the results showed that a high proportion of covid-19 patients were co-infected with influenza in tongji hospital co-infection with sars-cov-2 and the influenza virus may lead to a much earlier occurrence of the cytokine storm and organ damage in critically ill covid-19 patients our results suggest that detection of the influenza virus should be considered in patients with covid-19 and that treatment strategies of anti-influenza virus and dampening inflammatory responses may be helpful for critically ill patients co-infected with sars-cov-2 and the influenza virus kq and smm contributed to the conception and design of the study had full access to all data in the study and take responsibility for

mental health survey consortium 2004 gonzalez et al 2010 kessler et al 2010a the global burden of diseases injuries and risk factors study 2010 gbd 2010 found that mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of years lived with disability ylds and depressive disorders accounted for 405 of disability-adjusted life years dalys caused by mental and substance use disorders whiteford et al 2013 traditionally depression in china has been considered to be a less common disorder than that in many western countries partly because a number of chinese epidemiological surveys collaborative group of epidemiological study of mental illness 1986 guo et al 1994 zhang et al 1998 adopted a rather narrowly-defined set of criteria the second edition of the chinese classification of mental disorders ccmd-2 the most-cited national survey was undertaken in twelve regions of china in 1982 n38136 twelve region psychiatric epidemiological study work group 1986 and repeated with almost identical case ascertainment strategies in seven regions in 1993 n19223 in the 1982 survey the point and lifetime prevalence of affective disorder was 0037 and 0076 zhao et al 1986 in the 1993 survey the point and lifetime prevalence of affective disorder was 0052 and 0083 and no evidence of an increase was found in the prevalence of affective disorders wang et al 1998 to address the lack of data especially after the turn of the century a few large-scale epidemiological studies were conducted these were well-designed population-based surveys that used structured psychiatric interviews they have indeed found higher rates of depression in china though the comparability to older studies is limited for example shen et al 2006 reported a psychiatric epidemiological survey in beijing and shanghai the two largest metropolitan cities in china they interviewed 5201 subjects 2633 in beijing and 2568 in shanghai respectively using a multistage household probability sampling method and all subjects were also assessed with a chinese version of the world health organization world mental health who composite international diagnostic interview who mh-cidi they found that the 12-month prevalence of any dsm-iv mental disorder in metropolitan china was 70 with major depressive disorder 20 being the most common these studies suggest that although it is not as common as that in western populations depression in the chinese population is still a relatively common mental disorder which deserves more attention 
phillips et al 2009 used a chinese version of the structured clinical interview for diagnostic and statistical manual dsm-iv axis i disorders scid-ip and a two-stage screening process to define the prevalence and characteristics of mental disorders in 4 provinces shandong zhejiang qinghai and gansu provinces from 2001 to 2005 they reported the adjusted one-month prevalence of a major depressive episode mde was 155 and 260 for men and women respectively another study conducted in beijing in 2003 involved a much larger sample n5926 adults and also used the who mh-cidi version 10 they reported the time-point prevalence rate of depressive disorder was 331 while the life-time prevalence rate was 687 unfortunately the study was interrupted and forced to end prematurely due to the unexpected outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in beijing in 2003 1569 of the target respondents did not complete the interview ma et al 2007 the impact of the outbreak on the results is unknown and given the large number of incomplete interviews the data may not generalize to the greater beijing population after more than two decades of the economic reform and opening-up policies china has become the most rapidly growing economy in the world and has been experiencing the challenge of rapid social and economic developments and an increase in social problems phillips et al 1999 the gross domestic product gdp in beijing has increased from 34892 rmbs per capita in 2003 beijing municipal bureau of statistics 2003 to 75943 rmbs per capita the dollar-rmb exchange rate is 612 in 2010 beijing municipal bureau of statistics and nbs survey office in beijing 2010 the process of urbanization has gone faster and 862 of beijings current population are urban dwellers beijing municipal bureau of statistics 2014 given that socioeconomic development and mental health status of the population are inter-related some even speculate that modern environments may cause an epidemic of mental illness lee et al 2007 hidaka 2012 to address the mental health issues related to this new socioeconomic reality the ministry of health moh of china now part of the newly established national health and family planning commission the ministry of civil affairs the ministry of public security and the china disabled persons federation have worked closely to formulate chinas mental health work plan 20022010 this has started to have a positive impact in the field of mental health care in china and more targeted efforts are expected pending the data regarding prevalence public attitude and mental health resources obtained from well-designed studies given this background it was particularly important to conduct an updated epidemiologic study and compare the data with that in 2003this study was part of a large-scale cross-sectional epidemiologic study on mental disorders among urban and rural residents in 2010 in beijing china the objectives of this survey included 1 to investigate the prevalence of mdd in a population-based sample in both urban and rural areas of beijing and 2 to determine the socio-demographic correlates of mdd beijing is the capital city of the peoples republic of china and the political cultural economic and educational center of the country it has a population of 196 million permanent residents and consists of 8 central districts and 10 peripheral districts the leading group office of the sixth nationwide census in beijing 2011 this study was part of a large-scale cross-sectional epidemiologic study on mental disorders and the calculation of sample size was based on the relative low prevalence of schizophrenia according to the survey data of mental disorders in 1991 in beijing the lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia was 0721 guo et al 1994 the sample size of this survey was determined to be 16562 using the sample size formula 001 u1645 015p taking into account the possibility that some would refuse or be unable to participate we increased the sample size by 20 resulting in a total of 19874 residents to be identified the household was the basic sampling unit in this survey the average number of residents in each urban household was 24 and in each rural household was 26 therefore 9185 households were to be selected in order to reach 19874 potential respondents neighborhood committees urban and village committees rural are basic community organizations residents were divided into urban dwellers or rural dwellers according to the classification of household-registration requirements of chinas ministry of public security the urban population lives in the urban districts or urban areas of the suburban districts while the rural population lives in the rural areas according to the beijing statistical yearbook 2009 the beijing statistics yearbook 2009 there were 18 districts or counties 2609 neighborhoods and 3951 village communities the sampling method in this survey followed a stratified multistage household systematic selection design with an equal probability of each eligible person being selected from the target population 12 neighborhood or village committees were randomly identified as the investigation sites in each district or county 19 neighborhood committees in urban areas were randomly selected while 14 village committees were selected in rural areas the sample size selected within the specific neighborhood committees or village committees was determined according to the urban and rural population ratios respectively in each district or county random sampling methods were used to identify target households from the household registry at the local government the sampled population covered 12299000 residents which accounted for 162 of the registered population in beijing the detail is shown in
fig 1 the inclusion criteria for respondents were 1 adults aged 18 years or above and consented to participate in the study 2 permanent residents in beijing 3 residents who co-habitated with at least one family member in order to verify the information 4 residents who understood the interview questions the exclusion criteria were 1 residents who refused to sign the informed consent 2 residents who could not be reached after three attempts of house visits 3 residents with any family members in the household who were unable to or refused to consent in other words for a single household to be included in the study all of its members were required to participate the assessment of this study includes two parts the social-demographic information and other relevant information of the respondents were recorded using a questionnaire which included the respondents demographic data age sex education marital status location of residence rural vs urban employment status personal monthly income family monthly income family environment goodaveragepoor and relationships with others goodaveragepoor to ensure the accuracy of the information collected all demographic data were verified using the information in the household registry cards other information was based on self-report the assessment and diagnostic instrument used in this survey was the scid-ip first et al 2002 zhang et al 2007 the scid-ip is a semi-structured diagnostic screening interview that covers thirty-three psychiatric disorders described in the fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual dsm-iv of the american psychiatric association 1994 the scid was first introduced to china in 1994 and translated into chinese mandarin li 1994 zhou et al 1995 it was revised to include sections on mental retardation and dementia and psychiatric family history based on the 2002 english version first et al 2002 zhang et al 2007 currently it is widely used in diagnostic evaluation clinical research and in the training of mental health professionals in china and has been shown to be reliable and valid phillips and liu 2011 the diagnosis of mdd was established using scid through a one-stage screening process the household interviews were conducted by 148 mental health professionals who were selected from beijing anding hospital and from the mental health centers in each district or county in beijing all investigators were required to have at least three years of clinical experience in psychiatry and all of them received seven days of training which included 58 h of lectures and 12 h of practice training the training included three major components 1 general skills including how to approach a household how to build rapport and how to overcome common obstacles skills involving advertising the importance of the survey and educating potential respondents were also taught and discussed 2 use of interview instruments this included the field interview procedure the proper usage of the assessment instruments and possible issues 3 clinical interview training at a psychiatric hospital this was conducted at a psychiatric hospital involving actual patients before the official start of the survey all interviewers were required to watch videos of interviews of psychiatric disorders including mdd and dysthymic disorder to improve inter-rater reliability the interviewers scid diagnoses were then compared with the expert-consensus diagnoses the kappa value for the 148 interviewers was 085 as a measure of quality control a subset of respondents were re-assessed 5 of positive respondents and 1 of negative respondents underwent secondary assessment in order to minimize the false positive and false negative results a total of 1284 respondents completed secondary scid assessments and the diagnostic consistency of mdd between the two sets of assessments was 95 in addition the expert panel consisting of five senior psychiatrists discussed all difficult cases involving diagnostic inconsistency to reach diagnostic consensus in this study the recruitment consent and field sample procedure were all approved by the ethics committee irb of beijing anding hospital capital medical university all participants signed the informed consent before the interview began interviews were administered face to face by trained mental health professionals at the homes of the respondents from november 1 2010 to december 31 2010 the studys data were double-entered and validated with epidata 30 and then analyzed with the statistical package for the social sciences windows version 170 descriptive statistical methods data were processed using descriptive analysis and factor analysis prevalence estimates related to age sex and location of residence were calculated and described for the total sample and for subgroups univariate regression analysis and multivariate factor regression analysis with the stepwise method were used to explore the association between mdd and socio-demographic variables respectively statistical significance was based on two-tailed tests and level of significance was set at 005 this study was conducted during november 1 2010 to december 31 2010 in total 19874 subjects were identified and 16032 subjects successfully completed interviews generating a response rate of 807 the reasons for failing to participate included 1775 subjects refused to participate 1037 subjects current addresses were different from the ones on the household registry 447 subjects had been relocated 332 subjects were traveling 154 subjects could not be reached and 97 subjects were due to other reasons household register information discrepancy death hospitalization etc there were no statistically significant differences in sex age or location of resident between the participants and non-participants the socio-demographic distributions of the samples are presented in
table 1 7917 4938 were man and 12282 7661 lived in rural communities the point and the lifetime prevalence of mdd by sex location of residence and age group are presented in
table 2 table 3 the overall point and lifetime prevalence estimates for mdd were 110 95 ci 094126 and 356 95 ci 327385 respectively 
table 4 shows the crude odds ratios for mdd time point prevalence and each socio-demographic variables reference group in each category listed in table 4 univariate regression analysis showed that sex age location of residence marital status education employment status personal and family monthly income relationships with family and relationships with others were all significantly associated with mdd multivariate factor regression analysis showed that sex age family monthly income and the family relationship were all associated with mdd mdd was more common in female than in male respondents older age for respondents was associated with greater risks for mdd as compared to younger age the group with the lowest family monthly income had the highest risk for mdd and the group reporting an average or poor relationship with family or others was associated with an increased risk of depressive disorder as an important assessment tool the scid has been widely used in clinical research since its publication however few large-scale epidemiological studies have utilized the scid as a diagnostic tool on a global scale different from the who mh-cidi the scid was designed to be administered by a clinician or trained mental health professional which can be very costly in fact so far only large-scale epidemiological studies conducted in china phillips et al 2009 have used the scid as an assessment tool two major differences between those by phillips et al 2009 and the current one are worth pointing out first the studies by phillips et al 2009 involved a two-stage screening process in the first stage all subjects were screened with the 12-item general health questionnaire ghq and classified into three risk strata for mental disorder and in the second-stage all high-risk respondents and a random selection of moderate or low risk respondents were assigned to complete the diagnostic assessment using the scid second only less than one third 28 of the study subjects completed the assessment with the scid to the best of our knowledge our study is the first large-scale representative community epidemiological survey in which all respondents were screened using a one-stage investigation method with the scid performed by mental health professionals these are the most notable strengths of this study another strength of this study was the sampling design we adopted the cluster stratified random sampling method the basic sampling unit was the household with all eligible members being included rather than specific individuals from every household this method avoided the random selection of others in the absence of the initially selected resident within each household and decreased possible selection bias our study estimated that the point and lifetime prevalence of dsm-iv mdd was 110 95 ci 094126 and 356 95 ci 327385 respectively the ratio of point lifetime prevalence was approximately 13 consistent with prior surveys range 1323 conducted in other countries andrade et al 2003 our results are also similar to that from earlier studies conducted in beijing and shanghai shen et al 2006 lee et al 2009 and that of the survey of four provinces phillips et al 2009 on the other hand our rates are lower than the survey conducted in the zhejiang province a relatively developed province in east china 43 point prevalence shi et al 2005 the results of the current study are lower than those reported by ma et al 2007 in which they estimated the point and life-time prevalence of icd-10 depressive disorder to be 331 and 687 respectively ma et al 2007 as mentioned in the introduction the study by ma et al 2007 used a different assessment tool who mh-cidi and diagnostic criteria in addition the 2003 study was different from the current one in the following ways 1 the 2003 study included mdd and other depressive disorders such as dysthymia disorder and the depressive episodes of bipolar disorder while the current study focused on mdd only 2 the 2003 study focused specifically on depressive disorders while this study was a part of a comprehensive study that focused on all types of mental disorders 3 the sampling design of the survey in 2003 was to select the respondents whose date of birth was the closet to the investigation time in every selected household ma et al 2007 while the sampling unit of the current study was the household unit with assessments performed on all of the family members who met the criteria in each selected household the prevalence rates of mdd from the current and previous surveys in china are still substantially lower than those from western surveys completed during similar time periods although the epidemiological data on mdd vary significantly among previous studies patten 2003 chang et al 2008 marneros 2009 a meta-analysis of the data from the who world mental health wmh survey suggested that the 12-month mdd prevalence rate in the mainland chinese population was 23 was lower than those in developed countries 40104 and was similar to that in japan 22 kessler et al 2010b caution is needed in interpreting these differences in prevalence as there were variations in sites of survey sampling methods screening instruments diagnostic criteria types of interviewer culture social and economic status between the various studies guo et al 2011 however a number of speculations about the low rates of depression in chinese have been proposed 1 biological factors several previous studies indicated that the prevalence of depression among the chinese living on mainland china is not only lower as compared to western populations but the prevalence of depression among chinese people living in america is also significantly lower than other ethnic groups gonzalez et al 2010 2 cultural factors some believe that the traditional chinese social and cultural factors and values may play protective roles for example tan 2014 reported the life-time prevalence of mdd in immigrant chinese women was 85 vs 331 in us-born chinese american women suggesting the collectivist culture might play a protective role 3 the instrument used in this study was translated from the english language and some descriptions of emotions may be difficult to understand it has been suggested in a previous study that the scid could be less sensitive to the means of expressing emotion in the chinese population as a result the prevalence of depression nos is relative higher and the prevalence of mdd is relative low shi et al 2005 4 the stigmatization of the mentally ill in chinese society is relatively prevalent some tend to somatize psychological problems and those with a mental disorder may be reluctant to endorse symptoms longitudinal studies have demonstrated that some people with lifetime mdd fail to report their history of depression in cross-sectional studies patten et al 2011 this can lead to an underestimation of mdd in a population-based epidemiological study kessler et al 2010b socio-demographic factors are found to be associated with the prevalence of mdd worldwide gonzalez et al 2010 our survey indicated that females suffered from mdd twice as often as males which is consistent with most of the previous studies across different cultures and populations kuehner 2003 waraich et al 2004 some hypotheses have been proposed regarding this sex difference including that females may be more prone to depression due to biological and psychosocial factors desai and jann 2000 location of residence urban vs rural was significantly associated with mdd in single logistic regression analysis however multivariate analysis failed to show location of residence as an independent risk factor for mdd this result was discrepant with the previous survey in china ma et al 2009 phillips et al 2009 we also found significant differences among age groups in point prevalence of mdd and demonstrated that the risk of mdd increases with age these results are consistent with a few earlier chinese studies wang et al 1998 ma et al 2009 and different from the wmh survey in china in 2001 lee et al 2009 kessler et al 2010a suggested that this age phenomenon is seen more frequently in developed countries but not in developing countries respondents with the lowest family income had the highest risk of mdd compared to respondents with higher income levels this is in accordance with previous studies wilhelm et al 2003 park et al 2012 similarly perceived family function also played a role subjects who perceived the family environment as average or poor had a higher rate of mdd than that in those who perceived the family environment as good this study also replicated the findings that unemployment was a strong predictor of a mde lee et al 2007 the respondents who were unemployed or retired were at greater risk of mdd than those employed however these results did not hold up in multivariable analysis in summary most of our findings regarding socio-demographic correlates are consistent with previous studies especially those from the west an older age female sex low family income and poor family relationship were independent risk factors for mdd despite several strengths a few limitations should also be acknowledged when interpreting the findings first this survey was only based on a sampling of beijing residents using the household registry and the so-called floating population in beijing was not included it is estimated that the floating population in beijing accounted for 359 of the total population in 2010 the leading group office of the sixth nationwide census in beijing 2011 and due to their unstable living situation and other disadvantageous factors that they face eg local policies unfavorable to their childrens education housing salary etc they may be at a higher risk of having a depressive disorder compared with local residents zhang et al 2013 unfortunately our study could not address this very important question this is certainly an area where more research is urgently needed second since the response rate of this survey was 807 193 of eligible respondents were not represented in the sample although there were no statistical significances in sex age and location of residence between respondents and individuals who failed to participate it is unclear how this missing segment of the population may have impacted the results it is possible that those people with depression might have been more reluctant to participate than non-depressed residents leading to an under-estimation of the actual prevalence third the data on socio-demographic factors were cross-sectional and we only collected current data or data from the past 12 months since the onset of depression for some people might have been more than 12 months ago the sociodemographic factors recorded for those individuals might have been different than those occurring at their onset of mdd as in most cross-sectional studies our findings show an association and not a causal relationship between mdd and those risk factors within the context of these limitations the results of this survey likely reflect the epidemiological profile of mdd in beijing and can provide a reference point for policy makers regarding budget and resource planning to improve mental healthcare the study was part of the health reform project of the beijing municipal bureau of health now rename beijing municipal commission of population and family planning project number pxm2010-026335-098230 and also associated with the beijings 10 big chronic diseases and long-term science and technology development planning which was funded by the beijing science and technology commission project number d098050703650903 the authors have no conflict of interest  chinese social media reaction to the mers-cov and avian influenza ah7n9 outbreaks isaac fung chun-hai king-wa fu yuchen ying braydon schaible yi hao chung-hong chan zion tse tsz-ho   please see additional file 1 for translations of the abstract into the six official working languages of the united nations digital epidemiology is a quickly growing field that uses digital eg internet information to study the distribution of diseases and other health conditions over time and in different geographical areas 12 various online data have been harnessed for public health surveillance purposes 3 for example search engine query data from google have been used to estimate weekly influenza activity in a number of countries google flu trends 4 and google query data in french were correlated with french surveillance data for influenza acute diarrhea and chickenpox 5 search engine query data from other search engines namely yahoo and baidu also correlated well with influenza surveillance data in the us and china respectively 67 online news data from healthmap 8 were used to track the 2010 haitian cholera outbreak along with social media data twitter 9 social media data could be harnessed to analyze the publics concern about an infectious disease outbreak scientists studied twitter data to monitor influenza activity 10 public concern about h1n1 influenza 1112 and sentiments about h1n1 influenza vaccination 13 algorithms were developed to distinguish tweets that mentioned someones experiences with influenza from those that expressed worries about it 14 the 2013 h7n9 influenza outbreak in china also drew the attention of epidemiologists toward the potential ability to monitor disease outbreaks using digital data 15 weibo translated microblog is the chinese social media equivalent to twitter like twitter weibo allows users to post and share messages carrying at most 140 chinese characters users may optionally attach links images or videos to their messages weibo also allows users to follow others weibo accounts friends or to repost or retweet in twitter parlance another users posts to ones own readership followers despite the governments control on the internet content 16 weibo still enables chinese people to publish messages about public incidents or disseminate information during natural disasters 17 it was described by western media as a new free speech platform 18 one major weibo service provider in china sina weibo claimed to have over 500 million registered users at the end of 2012 19 our study is the first to use chinese social media weibo data to study the chinese online communitys reaction to the release of official outbreak data from health authorities namely the outbreaks of mers-cov in 2012 20 and of human infections of avian influenza ah7n9 in 2013 2122 our hypothesis was that chinas online community would have a stronger reaction to an outbreak in china than one outside china our analysis allows health authorities and the media to better understand the online dynamics of health communications in outbreak scenarios weibo data were collected by the university of hong kongs weiboscope project the projects primary aim is to develop a data collection and visualization system for better understanding of weibo in china details of the methodology have been reported elsewhere 16 in summary the project generated a list of about 350000 indexed microbloggers by searching the sina weibo user database systematically using the application programming interface api functions provided by sina weibo the inclusion criterion was those users who have at least 1000 followers we used high-follower-count samples for two reasons first in social media high-follower-count users are relatively more influential and can often draw disproportionally larger public attention 23 second this sampling strategy can minimize the influence of spam accounts which were found widespread in chinas social media 24 because of the heightened restriction on sina weibo api access the microbloggers included in the data acquisition since january 2013 were restricted to a selective group of around 50000 opinion leaders with at least 10000 followers this group of microbloggers was selected for analysis in the current study in order to have fair comparison between the keyword frequencies in 2012 and 2013 for each indexed microblogger on the list all new weibo messages posted were fetched periodically by using sina weibos user timeline api function newly collected messages were cached in the database for future data analysis the frequency of revisiting the user timeline of the indexed microbloggers varied from every three minutes to once monthly which depended on multiple factors that were chosen to maximize detection of each users posts 16 while making efficient use of the per-hour api rate limit imposed by sina weibo as well as our limited computing resources see additional file 2  appendix for more details the weibo raw data was acquired over the period of january 1 2012 to june 30 2013 in comma-separated values csv format and sorted by week 16 the csv files contain useful metadata available for analysis including the weibo posts the created date and user id data the user ids were hashed before storing them meaning they were converted into a different string of characters so that the user id is not directly displayed in the database the first line of each file describes the properties of the file followed by the weibo post record keyword detection started with a simple string-searching algorithm given a keyword of a particular disease for example h7n9 the algorithm searched every weibo post and recorded if and how many times the particular keyword appeared in the data file table 1 shows the list of keywords that were used in the searching process and were included in the final analysis figure 1 shows the workflow for keyword selection and analysis figure s1 in additional file 2  appendix shows the flowchart of the keyword detection scheme please refer to additional file 2  appendix for more details we used official press releases of outbreak data by who and the chinese government as signals or the assumed sources of outbreak news to which the chinese online community reacted the global alert and response press release by who on september 23 2012 was used as a signal for news on mers-cov then known as a novel coronavirus 20 and the march 31 2013 press release by the chinese national health and family planning commission was used as a signal for news on human infections of avian influenza ah7n9 22 statistical analysis was performed using microsoft excel sas 93 base and r 2153 we first established the baseline for each keyword and then measured the online response both magnitude and time to peak compared to the baseline we normalized the number of posts with a particular keyword on a given day by dividing it by the total number of posts in our sample for that day and then multiplying it by 1000000 to obtain the number of tweets with a particular keyword per 1 million tweets the 2012 data january 3 - december 30 was used to establish the baseline data for weibo posts with keywords avian flu and h7n9 likewise part of the 2012 data prior to september 23 2012 was used to establish the baseline for the keywords that were related to mers-cov we chose 2012 as the baseline year assuming that the underlying weibo conversations about health-related information were not significantly different between 2012 and 2013 one-sample t-test two-sided was used to measure the statistical significance of the difference between the peaks and their corresponding baseline values a new website dedicated to this project named weibohealth 25 was created to share our updated results with public health researchers and practitioners the reaction to the news of human infection of avian influenza ah7n9 was very profound in the chinese online community among the users with 10000 followers a peak of 33904 per million weibo posts t  20836 p  0001 that contain the keywords  qinliugan in pinyin a mandarin chinese phonetic script avian flu or h7n9 or both was observed on april 5 2013 five days after the chinese government press release on march 31 2013 this was 10936 times the standard deviation sd away from the mean of the baseline value in 2012 mean 2419 sd 3098 table 2 after the peak there was a quick decline in weibo discussion on this topic the number of weibo posts that contain h7n9 andor  avian flu declined to 7469 per million on april 12 a decline of 36387 posts per day from april 5 to 12 assuming a linear trend r2  09433 on april 13 the chinese national health and family planning commission announced that there was a h7n9-positive case in beijing the h7n9 avian flu-related posts doubled 15864 per million t  9741 p  0001 after this second peak the attention waned and the number of posts on h7n9 avian flu declined at a rate of 18736 per million per day to 1883 per million on april 20 2013 figure 2 if only the keyword h7n9 was used the signal was even more sensitive given its very low baseline in 2012 mean 0027 per million posts sd 0265 its peak of 8803 per million posts t  632933 p  0001 was 33220 sd away from the baseline mean baseline and peak values are presented as number per million weibo posts that contain keywords for avian flu and h7n9 in our samples of about 50000 users with 10000 followers in 2012 and 2013 in our pilot studies we had also tried the keywords  lixngxng gnmo influenza and  lign short form for lixngxng gnmo flu english equivalent flu for the former few posts per day contained this formal technical term and so we decided to drop it in further analysis data not shown for the latter since the keyword  avian flu is more specific and it actually contained the term  flu we decided to use  avian flu in our analysis instead of  flu data not shown the chinese online community also reacted to the news of a novel coronavirus now known as mers-cov identified in a patient in the uk but in a less pronounced way figure 3 table 3 nine different keywords that were related to sars were tested and three of them were found both sensitive and specific enough to reflect the chinese online communitys reaction to this novel coronavirus table 1 on september 23 2012 when who released its press release on the novel coronavirus the number of weibo posts about  sars posted by the 50000 users with 10000 followers increased to 208 per million 44 sd away from the baseline mean t  49 p  0001 and two days later it rose to 874 per million 218 sd away t  242 p  0001 figure 3b for weibo posts mentioning the english acronym sars they reached a peak of 2107 per million 308 sd away t  295 p  0001 on september 25 2012 figure 3a for weibo posts carrying the virological term  gun zhung bng d coronavirus it rose from 0 to 516 per million posts 225 sd away t  35 p  0001 on september 25 2012 and continued to rise to a peak of 3063 per million posts 135 sd away t  21 p  0001 on september 29 2012 figure 3a the official translation of severe acute respiratory syndrome was never found in our sample in 2012 three other phonetic translations of sars as well as two renditions of atypical pneumonia were either not sensitive or non-specific to the who press release on mers-cov on september 23 2012 table 4 we also studied how the traffic of weibo posts carrying sars-related keywords reacted to the h7n9 outbreak beginning on march 31 2013 weibo posts with keywords  feidian shortened for atypical pneumonia or the english acronym sars rocketed and reached a peak on april 3 2013 likewise weibo posts with keywords  sars or  coronavirus increased and reached a peak on april 5 2013 figure 4 we observed that the strength of the reaction to the h7n9 outbreak peak 33904 posts per million posts on april 5 2013 keywords  avian flu and h7n9 was two orders of magnitude stronger than the reaction to the mers-cov outbreak peak 349 posts per million posts on september 25 2013 keywords  sars sars and  coronavirus figures 2 and 3 the chinese online community reacted rapidly to news about infectious disease outbreaks both within and beyond china as shown in our study this paper is the first to document this online response using weibo and to compare the reaction to the mers-cov outbreak in 2012 with the reaction to the human infections of avian influenza ah7n9 in 2013 we found that the reaction to the h7n9 outbreak in 2013 was about two orders of magnitude stronger than the one to the mers-cov outbreak in 2012 the results confirmed our hypothesis that the chinese online community reacted more strongly to an outbreak that was in china than one outside china the reaction in the chinese online community exploded within the first five days of the first case report of three human cases two in shanghai and one in anhui of avian influenza ah7n9 22 within these five days more cases were identified in shanghai and in two neighboring provinces of jiangsu and zhejiang however attention soon declined rapidly it declined until april 13 2013 when the chinese government announced that a child was found h7n9-positive in beijing the capital of china this piece of news triggered a second explosion of online discussion via weibo on that day attention then declined rapidly again figure 2 keywords that were sensitive and specific to the signals were identified keywords like h7n9 and  coronavirus were highly sensitive and specific keywords like  avian flu and sars while less specific remained sensitive enough to detect the signals while the keyword  feidian shortened for atypical pneumonia was not sensitive to the news of mers-cov on september 23 2012 figure 3b we would like to highlight its significance in the lexicon of the current chinese online community as one of its most frequently used term for sars in online discussion as a keyword  feidian was sensitive to rumors of sars in the city of baoding china on february 19 2012 the rumors were later rejected by the chinese authorities on february 26 2012 when the possibility of sars infection among feverish hospitalized patients in a hospital in baoding was excluded figure 3b 27 this keyword however also led to a false positive on july 21 2012 there was a severe flood in beijing resulting in dozens of deaths the chinese online community complained about the beijing municipal governments disaster management the government reacted by holding a press conference on july 24 saying that they had learned the lessons of sars in 2003 and did not conceal the true death toll 28 this incident also led to a peak in posts with the keyword  feidian figure 3b on january 30 2013 in a telephone interview with the china central television prof zhong nan-shan a well-respected medical researcher with a reputation as a leader in fighting against sars in 2003 in china mentioned that air pollution in china was more dreadful than  feidian because no one could escape from it 29 his quote from the interview also led to a peak of weibo posts with the keyword  feidian figure 4 the observation that weibo posts with the keywords  feidian and sars rose to 31319 and 14854 per million on april 3 2013 figure 4 was consistent with a similar observation in web search query data from google trends 30 search terms sars  time range 2013 location china accessed on october 5 2013 in which a peak was observed during the week of march 31 2013 given chinas sars experience in 2003 the chinese online communitys reaction is not surprising our observations show that the chinese online community discussed sars in the first week after the first report of the h7n9 outbreak with an order of magnitude higher frequency than that in the first week after the first report of the mers-cov outbreak these results again confirmed our hypothesis that the chinese online community reacted more strongly to an outbreak that happened in china than one outside china drawing on the social amplification of risk model 31 public risk perception is shaped by a process of interplays between psychological cultural social and institutional factors that may result in amplifying or attenuating the public attention to risk mass communication is among the list of factors public health officials have long recognised the role of the mass media in disseminating risk and emergency information before during and after a catastrophe 32 the world health organization establishes guidelines for effective media communication through which the authorities are able to disseminate information to the public 33 communication during crisis was traditionally understood to be a one-way and top-down process in which the public are assumed to be deficient in knowledge while the scientists public health experts and emergency managers are sufficient 34 but this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media for instance leung and nicoll argued that the 2009 h1n1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media challenged conventional public health communication 35 in china online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 sichuan earthquake 36 social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks 34 our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities whether in beijing or geneva received strong reactions in the chinese online community with such knowledge social media should be incorporated in the best practices for risk and crisis communication 37 social media data can also provide health authorities researchers and the media a quantifiable measure of public attention towards a particular disease outbreak 11 social media in addition to being a tool to release and track official outbreak information 38 offers a new opportunity for public health practitioners to understand social and behavioral barriers to infection control to identify misinformation and emerging rumors 39 and to better understand the sentiments and risk perception associated with outbreaks and preventive and control measures 13 in turn these will help facilitate better health communication between public health agencies and the society at large as well as among citizens themselves with our weibo data there are at least two potential directions for future research first we can study how information about a given disease spread across the social network as represented by weibo kwak et al 40 identified a non-power-law follower distribution a short effective diameter and low reciprocity in twitter follower-following topology which was different from most human social networks over 85 of the top trending topics on twitter are headline news or persistent news once retweeted a tweet would reach an average of 1000 users regardless of original tweets number of followers 40 however a previous study has found that chinese weibo exhibits a distinct pattern of information dissemination 41 for example the network connections between chinese microbloggers are markedly hierarchical than those between twitter users ie chinese users tend to follow those at a higher or similar social level 42 majority of weibo posts are indeed re-posts that are originated from a small percentage of original messages 24 it will be very interesting if further research can shed light upon how information sharing over weibo can affect human response to the diseases off-line second content analysis of weibo posts will enable us to analyze human attitudes or reactions toward health hazard 43 the research can be extended to investigate anxiety or fear towards the infectious diseases themselves and towards the outbreak information transmitted via the weibo social network similar research on influenza has been conducted using twitter data 1214 data mining methods like topic models 44 may be attempted there are a few limitations to our study the sampled microbloggers in our study were limited to those who have more than 10000 followers despite the fact that these microbloggers are more likely to be authentic users rather than spam accounts the samples constitute less than 01 of the overall microblogger population 23 however a random sampling study finds that weibo content contribution is unevenly distributed among users 23 over half of sina weibo subscribers have never posted whereas about 5 of weibo users contributed more than 80 of the original posts 23 hence the sampled microbloggers in our study were the most influential microbloggers who contributed a majority of weibo posts and drew the most attention in terms of the number of reposts and comments 23 therefore for the purpose of this study this group of high-follower-count microbloggers should be deemed fairly representative of the public attention towards the mers-cov and h7n9 outbreaks but the reader should note that the findings of our study might not be generalizable to the samples collected by other sampling strategies the operational parameters of sampling were not determined to optimize collection of data specific to a given disease future research is warranted to reconfirm the research findings by using a research design that is customized for specific epidemiologic research purposes anotes on peaks in figure 3 1 the peak on january 12 2012 was a false positive none of the posts were genuinely related to sars 2 on february 19 2012 rumors began to circulate that hospitalized patients in a hospital in the city of baoding china were diagnosed with sars a week later february 26 the chinese authorities excluded the possibility of sars among feverish hospitalized patients in that hospital the volume of weibo posts peaked on february 27 3 on july 21 2012 extremely heavy rain led to flooding in beijing resulting in many deaths and injuries responding to allegations that the government concealed the true death toll the beijing municipal government replied on july 24 that they had learned their lesson from the 2003 sars outbreak and they would not conceal the truth the volume of weibo posts peaked on july 25 4 after who 1st press release on mers-cov on september 23 2013 weibo posts with the keyword sars reached its peak on september 25 2013 while weibo posts with the keyword  coronavirus reached its peak on september 29 2013 5 on october 8 2013 there was news about a probable case of mers-cov infection in hong kong the probable case patient was a child from saudi arabia the child was later confirmed of having influenza infection instead of mers-cov a peak of weibo posts with the keyword  coronavirus was found on that day as the chinese newscast of that day used the term  novel coronavirus 45 api application programming interface csv comma-separated values mers-cov middle east

kong  spread of sars-cov-2 coronavirus likely constrained by climate miguel arajo b babak naimi  as new cases of covid-19 are being confirmed pressure is mounting to increase understanding of the factors underlying the spread the disease using data on local transmissions until the 23rd of march 2020 we develop an ensemble of 200 ecological niche models to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of sars-cov-2 throughout a typical climatological year although cases of covid-19 are reported all over the world most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cool and dry areas the predecessor sars-cov-1 was linked to similar climate conditions should the spread of sars cov-2 continue to follow current trends asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks could be expected according to the models temperate warm and cold climates are more favorable to spread of the virus whereas arid and tropical climates are less favorable however model uncertainties are still high across much of sub-saharan africa latin america and south east asia while models of epidemic spread utilize human demography and mobility as predictors climate can also help constrain the virus this is because the environment can mediate human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 and unsuitable climates can cause the virus to destabilize quickly hence reducing its capacity to become epidemic  biogeography studies the patterns and processes underlying the distribution of life on earth one generalization emerging from more than two hundreds of years of natural history observations is that all organisms have a degree of environmental specialization that is while biomes in the planet have a range of different types of organisms1 individual types of organisms cannot occur in every biome even when distant apart as they might be they converge into playing the same ecological roles within ecosystems 2  biogeographers and ecologists alike resort to the concept of ecological niche 3 4 5 to examine the relationship between the distributions of organisms and other biotic or abiotic factors controlling them an organism is said to be within its ecological niche if death rates of the organism are lower that birth rates 6 7  that is an organism cannot persist beyond its ecological niche in a sink unless there is a regular influx of individuals from source populations even if the organisms are regularly reaching a sink area as one might expect with an easily dispersed pathogen the spread and establishment of the organism will be limited by ecological constraints although biogeographic concepts such as species ecological niches are commonly used and applied to multicellular organisms eukaryotes there is an increased number of studies utilizing the ecological concepts and associated analytical tools to investigate relationships between the distributions of unicellular organisms prokaryotic or viruses and a range of biotic and abiotic environmental factors 8 9 10  building on the concept of ecological niche we develop projections of monthly changes in the climate suitability for sars-cov-2 outbreaks projections are obtained from an ensemble of 10 familiar machine learning ecological niche models 11  each with 20 replications generated by repeating four times a 5-fold cross validation that accounts for and enables the quantification of variability across initial conditions 12  models were trained using the distribution of all recorded local transmissions of sars-cov-2 coronavirus excluding imported cases with data compiled from john hopkins

aggregated across the classic kppen-geiger climate zones 16 of the world to summarize patterns of climate suitability for the virus figure 4  the analysis reveals that climate suitability for sars-cov-2 is greater across warm temperate climates from october to april from april to september cold temperate regions are exposed highly suitable climate conditions for spread of the coronavirus with a peak of suitability in polar climates between june and august arid environments have moderate suitability for the virus with slight increases from march to april while the tropics are also moderately suitable with increased climate suitability between june and august metrics of model performance on the test data were generally high meansd auc076003 see supplementary figure s4  however models with high performance in the test data can still generate projections that are uncertain when used for forecasting 17  while improvements in the data and the models can reduce uncertainties an issue we are now exploring at light of the recently published standards for applied enms 18  characterizing the uncertainty of existing models is a first step towards understanding the limitations of projections and highlighting areas of concern we generated 200 models by varying the initial conditions and model classes as such we were able to quantify and map some of the methodological uncertainties associated with projections  figure 5  using this approach we show that variation associated with changing initial conditions is negligible which is unsurprising given that splits are randomly performed in contrast consistently with previous studies addressing climate change forecasts 19  uncertainty associated with use of different modeling techniques is high 20 21  models are considerably variable in areas projected to have low seasonal variability in climate suitability across much of latin america sub-saharan africa and south east asia specific areas in india china western and central europe coastal australia and central usa also 6 have high levels of model variability such variability is probably a consequence of the sparse nature of the positive cases of covid-19 in those areas causing different models to adjust differently to the data in contrast inter-model variability across northern higher latitudes is lower and this is likely because most records between january and march are found there such areas of low inter-model variability coincide with areas where seasonal variation is also greater seasonal variation in climate is ubiquitous and it can exert strong pressures on spatial and temporal dynamics of virus-transmitted diseases 8  of course not all viruses are climate determined hivaids for example is not affected by external climatic factors the virus is transmitted by sexual intercourse blood transfusions or from mother to child during pregnancy delivery or breastfeeding so it never leaves the hosts internal environmental

outbreaks generally being favored by cool and dry weather while being slowed down by extreme conditions of both cold and heat as well as moist prevalence of respiratory disease outbreaks such as influenza during wintering conditions is common 23 24  but the similarity of climate determination of sars-cov-2 with its predecessor sars-cov-1 and even mers-cov is noteworthy raising reasonable expectations that fundamental traits shared by at least these three coronavirus might be conserved previous analyses of sars-cov-1 outbreaks in relation to meteorology revealed significant correlations between the incidence of positive cases and aspects of the weather for example an initial investigation linking sars outbreaks and temperature in hong kong guangzhou beijing and taiyuan 25 revealed significant correlations between sars-cov-1 incidences and temperature seven days the known period of incubation of sars-cov-1 before the outbreak with environmental temperatures associated with positive cases of sars-cov-1 ranging between 16c to 28c they also found that incidence of the coronavirus was inversely related to humidity another study conducted between 11 march and 22 may 2003 in hong kong 26 showed that sars-cov-1 incidences sharply decreased as temperature increased from 15c to 29c after which it practically disappeared in this study incidences under the cooler end of the gradient were 18-fold higher than under the opposite warmer end of the gradient the mechanism underlying these patterns of climate determination is likely linked with the ability of the virus to survive external environmental conditions prior to reaching a host for example a recent study examined survival of dried sars-cov-1 coronavirus on smooth surfaces and found that it would be viable for over 5 days at temperatures ranging between 11-25c and relative humidity of 40-50 drastically loosing viability as temperatures and humidity increased 27  likewise an experiment examining the stability of mers-cov on plastic and steel surfaces under three environmental treatments 20c -40 relative humidity 30c-30 rh 30c -80 rh revealed that the virus was more stable in 20c and 40 rh treatment decaying gradually in the second and third treatments 28   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

that outbreaks will happen everywhere with the same intensity not just because of seasonality in climate but also because of the interactions with initial date of outbreak which varies from country to country and the varying responses to it our results will hopefully contribute to anticipating the timing and magnitude of public interventions needed to mitigate the adverse consequences of the

captured by longer climatological time series the time series data were then averaged so to provide values for a typical climatological month in the recent past sars-cov2-spread across geographic and climate space this analysis refers to figure 2b  we used daily data on reported covid-19 positive cases to calculate a daily convex hull polygon around the coordinates of the positive cases recorded in both geographic and climate space based on mean temperature and evapotranspiration to make coordinates comparable in geographic and climate space coordinate values were re-scaled to a range of 0 to 1 then we calculated the area of the polygon in the two spaces each day between the 22 nd of january until the 23 rd of march the greater the area of the polygon the greater the spread of the virus across available geographic and climate space ecological niche models the spatial distribution of sar-cov-2 coronavirus records were linked to the corresponding monthly climate data we used sdm-r platform11 for ensemble ecological niche modeling12 or species distributions modeling42 to characterize climate conditions associated with outbreaks of sars-cov-2 between january and march 2020 we used 10 commonly used machine learning methods including generalized linear models glm 43 we used a 5-fold cross-validation53 repeated 4 times resulting in 20 replications per method we then fitted ecological niche models for each replication using the four random cross-validation splits as training set and evaluated them against the fifth withheld data split we used the area under curve auc of

auc values under 05 indicate discrimination worse than expected by chance a score of 05 implies random predictive discrimination and a score of 1 indicates perfect discrimination tss is calculated as sensitivity  specificity -1 and ranges from -1 to 1 where 1 indicates perfect agreement a value of 0 implies agreement expected by chance and a value of less than 0 indicates agreement lower than expected by chance we then used the ensemble of 200 models to calculate and project a consensus distribution of climate suitability for the spread of sars-cov-2 for each month across the globe

importance variable importance 55 and response curves 56 were estimated to infer the explanatory power and shape of the relationship for each one of the predictor variables used and the distribution of positive cases of sars-cov-2 response curves are generated with the evaluation strip procedure 56  implemented in sdm-r 11  for each climate variable the method generates the predicted probability of occurrence over all values in the gradient of the climate variable while the other climate variables are kept at their mean values then visualizing the predicted values against the climate gradient represents the response of the species to the climate variable additional model-independent techniques were also implemented to evaluate the relative variable importance we assessed the relative contribution of variables to explain the distributions of positive cases of sars-cov-2 in models using the variable importance vi analysis in sdm-r 11  this method is a randomization procedure that measures the correlation between the predicted values of a model given the original predictors and predictions of the same model but given the perturbed dataset in which the variable under investigation is randomly permutated if the contribution of a variable to the model is high then it is expected that the permutation would affect the prediction and consequently the correlation is low using this approach 1 -correlation is considered as a measure of variable importance 57  we assessed the relative contribution of variables to explain the distributions of positive cases of sars-cov-2

importance decomposition of sources of variation we used a 3-way anova to decompose variation in model projections from the 10 different modeling techniques used and 20 replications of the initial conditions data on sars-cov-2 cases we compared variation arising from data and models with variation associated with projected seasonal changes in climate suitability the latter is the desired projection rather than a methodological uncertainty however comparison of seasonal projected variation in climate suitability with variation arising from different partitions of data and model classes provides a benchmark against which to compare model variability if data and model variability was greater than projected seasonal variability then reliance on the models could be questioned the analysis involved running a three-way analysis of variance anova without replication58 59 for each cell using climate suitability for sars-cov-2 as response variable and ecological niche models enm bootstrapped samples bs and months m as factors we then obtained the sum of squares to each of these sources and their interaction enm x bs enm x m bs x m enm x bs x m we estimated the variance components as the proportions of the sums of squares for the three sources of variation and their interaction with regards to the total sum of squares 20  analyses were performed for each cell in the world grid and we mapped each variance component separately interaction term was not significant hence not reported monthly variation in climate suitability is the expected outcome of the models variability associated with enm and bs is expected to represent the variability associated with changing initial conditions bs and model classes enm they are interpreted as uncertainty estimates and should ideally be much proportionally smaller than monthly variation  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display

dingmei zhang zhenjian he lin xu xun zhu jueheng wu weitao wen yun zheng yu deng jieling chen yiwen hu mengfeng li kaiyuan cao   respiratory tract infections rti are a significant health burden for children the world health organization who estimates that 19 million children die each year as a result of the complications of acute rtis mainly pneumonia1 and 70 of rti deaths occur in africa and southeast asia2 the major viral agents of rti include influenza a b and c viruses flu respiratory syncytial virus rsv parainfluenza virus piv adenovirus adv human metapneumovirus hmpv human coronavirus hcov and the newly discovered human bocavirus hbov flu rsv and piv are often associated with pneumonia especially in children under 5 years of age and those living in developing countries3 4 5 6 7 8 in one study of hospitalized children rsv was identified in 1540 of cases piv in 687 and flu in 39 adv hcov and hbov are associated with a substantial proportion of rti in infants and young children7 10 11 12 hmpv has been detected in up to 10 of respiratory specimens13 rsv and piv may also contribute substantially to mortality among the elderly and the annual outbreaks and recurrent infections suggest that rsv and piv may contribute to the burden of disease throughout life14 15
 the acquisition and spread of rtis is known to vary among different study populations in different countries these variations may be due to cultural and socioeconomic factors geographical or climatic differences or variations in health care systems a clear understanding of the local epidemiology of rti and the identification of risk factors is critical to the successful implementation of a prevention and control program southern china is believed to be the origin of some important respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov16 and influenza virus17 southern china has large populations of humans and domestic and wild animals as well as a large transient population that includes laborers and business people from different provinces of china and from other countries the mixing of these large regional populations may favor the transmission of respiratory viruses the prevalence and clinical presentation of human viral infections in china have been reported previously8 10 18 19 20 however there are no previously published reports describing the etiology of the seven common respiratory tract viruses of inpatient and outpatient rti across the seasons among the various age and gender categories information on rti from southern china is also sparse to directly address this situation nasopharyngeal swabs were collected continuously from children and adults seeking medical attention for rti from a total of 25 hospitals in southern china between july 2009 and june 2012 seven respiratory viruses were detected by pcrrt-pcr and their

 the one quadruple infection was in a 1-year-old girl born april 25 2010 residing in the liwan region of guangzhou city she was admitted to the hospital on april 26 2011 the symptoms included fever 395 c cough runny nose and expectoration with a diagnosis of bronchopneumonia mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae were also detected co-infection viruses included flu rsv hcov and hbov at rates of 5217 252483 5052 244483 3903 137351 and 3667 66180 respectively flu and rsv were frequently detected as co-infection viruses among the 483 co-infection specimens accounting for 5217 252483 and 5052 244483 respectively however hcov and hbov were the pathogens preferring to co-infect with other respiratory viruses 3903 137351 of hcov-positive samples and 3667 66180 of hbov-positive samples were found to contain other respiratory viruses most co-infected patients were male 6605 319483 inpatients 6915 334483 children 4 years old 6707 324483 and younger adults aged 2035 years 1284 62483 co-infection was more common in children 14 years old 602 than in adults 14 years old 142 chi-square  225195 p  00001 the rate of co-infection detection was 376 3198490 in male patients and 285 1645747 in female patients chi-square  8540 p  0003 and 203 1497323 in outpatients and 483 3346914 in inpatients chi-square  84833 p  00001 there were 175 121 113 and 74 cases of co-infection in spring summer autumn and winter respectively the co-infection rates were 466 463 283 and 191 respectively chi-square  60209 p  00001 the co-infection rates in spring and summer were higher than in autumn and winter and the rate of co-infection in winter was the lowest the who ranks rti as the second leading cause of death worldwide for children younger than 5 years of age26 however the influenza viruses are the only viral respiratory pathogens for which vaccines are currently available27 ongoing vaccine research and development are focusing on many other leading viral pathogens27 28 29 the detection of the specific viral causes of infection provides a useful starting point for an understanding of illness attributable to respiratory infection it also provides data relevant to the development of prevention strategies the objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of respiratory viruses in people who presented with acute respiratory tract infections in southern china over a 3-year study period human piv is a major cause of respiratory tract illness in infants and young children worldwide30 all children experience at least one piv infection by the age of 5 years and re-infection may occur throughout life because of incomplete immunity31 the virus is associated with a wide variety of rtis but most frequently with croup and pneumonia annual epidemics of hpiv-3 infection are responsible for considerable economic losses as a result of hospitalization medication costs work and school absence and mortality however piv infections have been less well studied compared to rsv and influenza viral infections in the present study piv was associated with 1000 of all the rti hospitalizations and 1500 of the rti in outpatient children a study in the usa found piv infections to be associated with 1150 of all pediatric rti hospitalizations32
 human bocavirus hbov was first reported by allander et al in 200533 subsequently hbov was reported in respiratory specimens collected from different countries and regions worldwide34 35 36 and detected in 150 to 830 of respiratory specimens from individuals with acute rti especially young children and infants in the present study hbov was detected in 385 of all children 2 years old who provided 7833 of all the hbov-positive specimens hbov infection has recently attracted attention worldwide however the incidence and clinical presentation of this infection varies widely often involving co-infection with other potential pathogens37 such characteristics have led to debate over the role of hbov as a true pathogen in the present study among the 180 hbov-positive specimens there were 66 3667 co-infections with at least one other respiratory virus elderly people have also been reported to be susceptible to hbov a single lineage of hbov was detected among a wide age distribution of patients with acute rti in this study a total of 18 adult specimens were positive for hbov the virus has also been found in stool specimens from patients with gastrointestinal illness38 39 therefore additional evidence and studies are needed throughout the world to gain a better understanding of this virus this study adds to the knowledge of seasonal variations of respiratory viral infections in southern china the epidemiology of respiratory viral infection was found to vary tremendously by geographical region in temperate climates the prevalence of these viruses is well documented as a cause of yearly winter epidemics of acute lower rtis40 this study clearly showed evidence of seven viruses throughout the 3-year study period the highest rate of infection was in spring with a peak in february 4803 and the lowest rates of infection were in winter with a nadir in october 2314 which may be attributed to the fact that february is the coldest month in southern china the detection rates for summer and autumn were similar and this is likely due to high humidity and a lack of significant delimitation between summer and autumn with recent advances in the detection of respiratory agents numerous studies have shown that some pediatric patients with acute lower rtis become infected simultaneously with multiple respiratory viruses41 42 multiple viral infections have been linked in some reports to higher fever a longer hospital stay more frequent use of antibiotics and an increased risk of admission to the icu43 however there is no consensus regarding the effect of co-infection on the severity of disease the effect may depend upon which viruses co-infect44 in the present study 339 of specimens had multiple or dual infections with a predominance of flu compared to the other co-viruses however in the positive specimens the co-infection rates for hcov and hbov were higher than those of other respiratory viruses the co-infection rates were higher in male patients inpatients and patients aged 14 years the rates of co-infection were higher during spring and summer than during autumn and winter the rates of co-infection were lowest during winter which corresponded with the overall low detection rates in winter  animal models of human viral diseases sara ruiz i elizabeth zumbrun e aysegul nalca p conn michael   well-developed animal models are necessary to understand disease progression pathogenesis and immunologic responses to viral infections in humans furthermore to test vaccines and medical countermeasures animal models are essential for preclinical studies ideally an animal model of human viral infection should mimic the hostpathogen interactions and the disease progression that is seen in the natural disease course a good animal model of viral infection should allow assay of many parameters of infection including clinical signs growth of virus clinicopathological parameters cellular and humoral immune responses and virushost interactions furthermore viral replication should be accompanied by measurable clinical manifestations and pathology should resemble that of human cases such that a better understanding of the disease process in humans is attained there is often more than one animal model that closely represents human disease for a given pathogen small animal models are typically used for first-line screening and for testing the efficacy of vaccines or therapeutics in contrast nonhuman primate nhp models are often used for pivotal preclinical studies this approach is also used for basic pathogenesis studies with most studies in small animal models when possible and studies in nhps to fill in the remaining gaps in knowledge the advantages of using mice to develop animal models are low cost low genetic variability in inbred strains and abundant molecular biological and immunological reagents specific pathogen free spf transgenic and knockout mice are also available a major pitfall of mouse models is that the pathogenesis and protection afforded by vaccines and therapeutics cannot always be extrapolated to humans additionally blood volumes for sampling are limited in small animals and viruses often need to be adapted through serial passage in the species to induce a productive infection the ferrets airways are anatomically and histologically similar to that of humans and their size enables collection of larger or more frequent blood samples making them an ideal model for certain respiratory pathogens ferrets are outbred with no standardized breeds or strains thus greater numbers are required in studies to achieve statistical significance and overcome the resulting variable responses additionally spf and transgenic ferrets are not available and molecular biological reagents are lacking other caveats making ferret models more difficult to work with are their requirement for more space than mice rabbit-style cages and the development of aggressive behavior with repeated procedures nhps are genetically the closest species to humans thus disease progression and hostpathogen responses to viral infections are often the most similar to that of humans however ethical concerns pertaining to experimentation on nhps along with the high cost and lack of spf nhps raise barriers for such studies nhp studies should be carefully designed to ensure the fewest number of animals are used and the studies should address the most critical questions regarding disease pathogenesis hostpathogen responses and protective efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics well-designed experiments should carefully evaluate the choice of animal including the strain sex and age furthermore depending on the pathogen the route of exposure and the dose should mimic the route of exposure and dose of human disease the endpoint for these studies is also an important criterion depending on the desired outcome the model system should emulate the host responses in humans when infected with the same pathogen in summary small animal models are helpful for the initial screening of vaccines and therapeutics and are often beneficial in obtaining a basic understanding of the disease nhp models should be used for a more detailed characterization of pathogenesis and for pivotal preclinical testing studies ultimately an ideal animal model may not be available in this case a combination of different well-characterized animal models should be considered to understand the disease progression and to test medical countermeasures against the disease in this chapter we will be reviewing the animal models for representative members of numerous virus families causing human diseases we will focus on viruses for each family that are of the greatest concern for public health worldwide 
norovirus the genus of which norwalk is the prototypic member is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the united states hall et al 2013 there are five distinct genogroups gigv and numerous strains of norwalk virus including the particularly significant human pathogens gi1 norwalk virus gii2 snow mountain virus and gii1 hawaii virus in developing countries norwalk virus also known as winter vomiting virus is responsible for approximately 200000 deaths annually patel et al 2008 a typical disease course is self-limiting but there have been incidences of necrotizing enterocolitis and seizures in infants chen et al 2009 lutgehetmann et al 2012 turcios-ruiz et al 2008 symptoms of infection include diarrhea vomiting nausea abdominal cramping dehydration and fever incubation is normally 13 days with symptoms persisting for 23 days koopmans and duizer 2004 viral shedding can range from 6 to 55 days in healthy individuals atmar et al 2014 however longer illness duration can be indicative of immunocompromised status with the elderly and young having a prolonged state of shedding harris et al 2008 rockx et al 2002 interestingly individuals vary greatly in susceptibility to norovirus infection depending on their fucosyl transferase 2 fut2 allele functionality and histoblood group antigen status with type a and o individuals susceptible and types ab and b resistant hutson et al 2005
 transmission occurs predominately through the oralfecal route with contaminated food and water being a major vector atmar and estes 2001 becker et al 2000 koopmans and duizer 2004 vomiting results in airborne dissemination of the virus with areas of 78 m2 being contaminated and subsequent transmission from oral deposition of airborne particles or contact with contaminated fomites which can remain contaminated for up to 42 days makison booth 2014 tung-thompson et al 2015 each vomiting event in a classroom setting elevates the risk of norovirus illness among elementary students with proximity correlating with attack rates evans et al 2002 marks et al 2003 viral titers in emesis and fecal suspensions are as high as 12  107 and 16  1011 ges genomic equivalent copies per milliliter respectively and the 50 infectious dose is 1320 ges atmar et al 2014 therefore outbreaks can be extremely difficult to contain therapeutic intervention consists of rehydration therapy and antiemetic medication bucardo et al 2008 moe et al 2001 no approved vaccine or therapeutic is available and development has been challenging given that immunity is short-lived after infection new strains rapidly evolve and the correlates of protection are not completely understood chen et al 2013 however one promising strategy utilized a virus-like particle vlp-based vaccine that protected or reduced infection by almost 50 in human volunteers aliabadi et al 2015 atmar et al 2011 given the relatively benign disease in adults experimental challenge has been carried out on human volunteers ball et al 1999 tacket et al 2000 viral titers are determined by shedding in feces and sera with histopathology changes monitored by biopsies particularly of the duodenum the ph of emesis samples collected containing virus is consistent with viral replication in the small intestine with reflux to the stomach kirby et al 2016 additionally norwalk virus has been shown to bind to duodenal tissue chan et al 2011 however this type of research is technically difficult and expensive and thus other models have been developed a major hindrance to basic research into this pathogen is the lack of permissive cell culture systems or animal models for norwalk virus nhps including marmosets cotton-top tamarins and rhesus macaques infected with norwalk virus are monitored for the extent of viral shedding however no clinical disease is observed in these models disease progression and severity is measured exclusively by assay of viral shedding rockx et al 2005 incidentally more viruses were needed to create an infection when challenging by the oral route than by the intravenous iv route purcell et al 2002 chimpanzees were exposed to a clinical isolate of norwalk virus by the iv route bok et al 2011 although none of the animals developed disease symptoms viral shedding within the feces was observed within 25 days postinfection and lasted anywhere from 17 days to 6 weeks viremia never occurred and no histopathological changes were detected the amount and duration of viral shedding was in-line with what is observed upon human infection as such chimeric chimpanzeehuman antinorovirus neutralizing antibodies have been explored as a possible therapeutic strategy chen et al 2013 a recently identified calicivirus of rhesus origin named tulane virus has been used as a surrogate model of infection unlike norwalk virus tulane virus can be cultured in cells rhesus macaques exposed to tulane virus intragastrically developed diarrhea and fever 2 days postinfection viral shedding was detected for 8 days the immune system produced antibodies that dropped in concentration within 38 days postinfection mirroring the short-lived immunity documented in humans the intestine developed moderate blunting of the villi as seen in human disease sestak et al 2012 a murine norovirus has been identified and is closely related to human norwalk virus karst et al 2003 however clinically the virus presents a different disease the murine norovirus model does not include observable gastrointestinal clinical signs possibly in part because rodents lack a vomiting reflex additionally mice infected with norovirus develop a persistent infection in contrast to human disease hsu et al 2006 hsu et al 2007 khan et al 2009 porcine enteric caliciviruses can induce diarrheal disease in young pigs and an asymptomatic infection in adults wang et al 2006 wang et al 2007 gnotobiotic pigs can successfully be infected with a passaged clinical norovirus isolate by the oral route diarrheal disease developed in 74 of the animals and virus was detected in the stool of 44 of the animals no major histopathological changes or viral persistence was noted cheetham et al 2006 calves are naturally infected with bovine noroviruses scipioni et al 2008 experimental challenge of calves by oral inoculation with a bovine isolate resulted in diarrheal disease 1416 h postinfection recovery of virus was achieved after 535 and 67 h postinfection otto et al 2011 eastern equine encephalitis virus eeev western equine encephalitis virus weev and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev present with near synonymous symptoms the majorities of human cases are asymptomatic but can present as a flu-like illness progressing to central nervous system cns involvement to include seizures and paralysis mortality rates vary among the virus with the highest reported for eev at 3675 followed by weev and lastly veev at less than 1 ayers et al 1994 griffin 2007 steele and twenhafel 2010 there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapies but a recent phase 1 clinical trial of a veev dna vaccine resulted in veev-neutralizing antibody responses in 100 of the subjects hannaman et al 2016 mouse models have been developed for numerous routes of infection including cutaneous intranasal in intracranial ic and aerosol eeev susceptibility in mouse models is correlated with age with younger mice being more susceptible than adults importantly eeev pathogenesis is dependent on route of infection with delayed progression upon subcutaneous subq exposure honnold et al 2015 newborn mice display neuronal damage with rapid disease progression resulting in death murphy and whitfield 1970 similarly eeev produces fatal encephalitis in older mice when administered via the intracerebral route while inoculation via the subq route causes a pantropic infection eventually resulting in encephalitis liu et al 1970 morgan 1941 a general drawback to the usage of the mouse model is the lack of vascular involvement during the disease course liu et al 1970 after subq inoculation with weev suckling mice started to show signs of disease by 24 h and died within 48 h aguilar 1970 the heart was the only organ in which pathologic changes were observed conversely adult mice exhibited signs of lethargy and ruffled fur on day 45 postinfection mice were severely ill by day 8 and appeared hunched and dehydrated death occurred between days 7 and 14 with brain and mesodermal tissues such as heart lungs liver and kidney involvement aguilar 1970 monath et al 1978 intracerebral and in routes of infection resulted in a fatal disease that was highly dependent on dose while intradermal id and subq inoculations caused only 50 fatality in mice regardless of the amount of virus liu et al 1970 comparing susceptibility of inbred and outbred strains revealed that cd-1 balbc aj and c57bl6 mice were all highly susceptible to experimental infection via subq inoculation when challenged prior to 10 weeks old with cns involvement and lethality blakely et al 2015 subqdermal infection in the mouse model results in encephalitic disease very similar to that seen in horses and humans macdonald and johnston 2000 virus begins to replicate in the draining lymph nodes at 4 h postinoculation eventually virus enters the brain primarily via the olfactory system furthermore aerosol exposure of mice to veev can result in massive infection of the olfactory neuroepithelium olfactory nerves and olfactory bulbs and viral spread to brain resulting in necrotizing panencephalitis charles et al 1995 steele et al 1998 aerosol and dermal inoculation routes cause neurological pathology in mice much faster than other routes of exposure the clinical signs of disease in mice infected by aerosol are ruffled fur lethargy and hunching progressing to death charles et al 1995 steele and twenhafel 2010 steele et al 1998 in challenge of c3hhen mice with high dose veev caused high morbidity and mortality julander et al 2008b viral titers in brain peaked on day 4 postchallenge and remained elevated until animals succumbed on day 910 postchallenge protein cytokine array performed on brains of infected mice showed elevated il-1a il-1b il-6 il-12 mcp-1 ifn mip-1a and rantes levels this model was used successfully to test antivirals against veev julander et al 2008a additionally a veev vaccine inactivated with 15-iodonaphthyl azide v3526 protects against both footpad and aerosol challenge with virulent veev in a mouse model gupta et al 2016 guinea pigs and hamsters have also been developed as animal models for eeev studies paessler et al 2004 roy et al 2009 guinea pigs developed neurological involvement with decreased activity tremors circling behavior and coma neuronal necrosis was observed in brain lesions in the experimentally challenged animals roy et al 2009 subq inoculation of eeev produced lethal biphasic disease in hamsters with severe lesions of nerve cells the early visceral phase with viremia was followed by neuroinvasion encephalitis and death in addition parenchyma necrosis were observed in the liver and lymphoid organs paessler et al 2004 harlan spraguedawley hamsters develop viremia and progress to respiratory gastrointestinal and nervous system involvement when inoculated via subq route vasculitis and encephalitis were both evident in this model which mirrors the human disease clinical spectrum paessler et al 2004 weev is highly infectious to guinea pigs and has been utilized for prophylactic screening sidwell and smee 2003 studies demonstrated that although the length of the incubation period and the disease duration varied weev infection resulted in mortality in hamsters by all routes of inoculation progressive lack of coordination shivering rapid and noisy breathing corneal opacity and conjunctival discharge resulting in closing of the eyelids were indicative of disease in all cases zlotnik et al 1972 cns involvement was evident with intracerebral intraperitoneal ip and id inoculations zlotnik et al 1972 ip inoculation of weev is fatal in guinea pigs regardless of amount of virus inoculum with the animals exhibiting signs of illness on day 34 followed by death on day 59 nalca unpublished results id im or iv inoculations of eeev in nhps cause disease but does not reliably result in neurological symptomsdupuy and reed 2012 intracerebral infection of eeev produces nervous system disease and fatality in monkeys nathanson et al 1969 the differences in these models indicate that the initial viremia and the secondary nervous system infection do not overlap in nhps when they are inoculated by the peripheral route wyckoff 1939 in and intralingual inoculations of eeev also cause nervous system symptoms in monkeys but are less drastic than intracerebral injections wyckoff 1939 the aerosol route of delivery will result in uniformly lethal disease in cynomolgus macaques reed et al 2007 in this model fever was followed by elevated white blood cells and liver enzymes neurological signs subsequently developed and nhps became moribund and were euthanized between 59 days postexposure meningoencephalomyelitis was the main pathology observed in the brains of these animals steele and twenhafel 2010 similar clinical signs and pathology were observed when common marmosets were infected with eeev by the in route adams et al 2008 both aerosol and in nhp models had similar disease progression and pathology as seen in human disease very limited studies have been performed with nhps reed et al exposed cynomolgus macaques to low and high doses of aerosolized weev the animals subsequently developed fever increased white blood counts and cns involvement demonstrating that the cynomolgus macaque model could be useful for testing of vaccines and therapeutics against weev reed et al 2005 veev infection causes a typical biphasic febrile response in nhps initial fever was observed at 1272 h after infection and lasted less than 12 h secondary fever generally began on day 5 and lasted 34 days gleiser et al 1961 veev-infected nhps exhibited mild symptoms such as anorexia irritability diarrhea and tremors leukopenia was common in animals exhibiting fever monath et al 1974 supporting the leukopenia microscopic changes in lymphatic tissues such as early destruction of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and spleen a mild lymphocytic infiltrate in the hepatic triads and focal myocardial necrosis with lymphocytic infiltration have been observed in monkeys infected with veev surprisingly characteristic lesions of the cns were observed histopathologically in monkeys in spite of the lack of any clinical signs of infection gleiser et al 1961 the primary lesions were lymphocytic perivascular cuffing and glial proliferation and generally observed at day 6 postinfection during the secondary febrile episode similar to these observations when cynomolgus macaques were exposed to aerosolized veev fever viremia lymphopenia and clinical signs of encephalitis were observed but the nhps did not succumb to disease reed et al 2004 a common marmoset model was utilized for comparison studies of south america sa and north america na strains of eeev adams et al 2008 previous studies indicated that the sa strain is less virulent than na strain for humans common marmosets were infected in with either the na or sa strain of eeev na strain-infected animals showed signs of anorexia and neurological involvement and were euthanized 45 days after the challenge although sa strain-infected animals developed viremia they remained asymptomatic and survived until the end of study chikungunya virus chikv is a member of the genus alphaviruses specifically the semliki forest complex and has been responsible for a multitude of epidemics centered within africa and southeast asia griffin 2007 the virus is transmitted by aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes given the widespread endemicity of aedes mosquitoes chikv has the potential to spread to previously unaffected areas this is typified by the emergence of disease reported for the first time in 2005 in the islands of south-west indian ocean including the french la reunion island and the appearance in central italy in 2007 charrel et al 2007 rezza et al 2007 the incubation period following a mosquito bite is 25 days leading to a self-limiting acute phase that lasts 34 days symptoms during this period include fever arthralgia myalgia and rash headache weakness nausea vomiting and polyarthralgia have all been reported powers and logue 2007 individuals typically develop a stooped posture due to the pain for approximately 12 of infected individuals joint pain can last months after resolution of primary disease and has the possibility to relapse underlying health conditions including diabetes alcoholism or renal disease increase the risk of developing a severe form of disease that includes hepatitis or encephalopathy children between the ages of 3 and 18 years old have an increased risk of developing neurological manifestations arpino et al 2009 there is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral wild-type c57bl6 adult mice are not permissive to chikv infection by id inoculation however it was demonstrated that neonatal mice were susceptible and severity was dependent upon age at infection six-day-old mice developed paralysis by day 6 and all succumbed by day 12 whereas 50 of 9-day-old mice were able to recover from infection by 12 days mice were no longer permissive to disease symptomatic mice developed loss of balance hind limb dragging and skin lesions neonatal mice were also used as a model for neurological complications couderc et al 2008 ziegler et al 2008 an adult mouse model has been developed by injection of the ventral side of the footpad of c57bl6j mice viremia lasted 45 days accompanied with foot swelling and noted inflammation of the musculoskeletal tissue gardner et al 2010 morrison et al 2011 adult ifnr knockout mice also developed mild disease with symptoms including muscle weakness and lethargy symptoms that mirrored human infection all adult mice died within 3 days this model was useful in identifying the viral cellular tropism for fibroblasts couderc et al 2008 icr and cd-1 mice can also be utilized as a disease model neonatal mice inoculated subq with a passaged clinical isolate of chikv developed lethargy loss of balance and difficulty walking mortality was low 17 and 8 for newborn cd-1 and icr mice respectively the remaining mice fully recovered within 6 weeks after infection ziegler et al 2008 a drawback of both the ifnr and cd-1 mice is that the disease is not a result of immunopathogenesis as occurs in human cases given that the mice are immunocompromised teo et al 2012 a chronic infection model was developed using recombinant activating gene 1 rag1 knockout mice in this study mice inoculated via the footpad lost weight in comparison to the control group both footpad and subq injected mice developed viremia 56 days postinfection which was detectable up to 28 days postinfection inflammation was evident in the brain liver and lung of the subq inoculated animals at 2856 days postinfection despite minimal footpad swelling on day 2 postinfection on day 14 there was severe muscle damage noted at necropsy which resolved by day 28 seymour et al 2015 golden hamsters serve as another option for small animal modeling although hamsters do not appear to develop overt clinical symptoms following subq inoculation viremia developed in the majority of animals within 1 day postinfection with clearance following from day 3 to 4 histologically inflammation was noted at the skeletal muscle fascia and tendon sheaths of numerous limbs this study was limited in the number of animals utilized and more work is needed to further develop the hamster model bosco-lauth et al 2015 nhp models of disease include adult aged and pregnant rhesus macaques in addition to cynomolgus macaques broeckel et al 2015 differing routes of infection subq iv and im have been successfully administered although there is not a clear understanding of the role that route of transmission plays in subsequent pathogenesis and clinical symptoms typically viremia is observed 45 days postinfection with a correlation between infectious titer and time to viremia observed in cynomolgus but not rhesus labadie et al 2010 messaoudi et al 2013 fever began at 12 days postinfection and persisted for 27 days and 37 days in cynomolgus and rhesus respectively and coincided with rash chen et al 2010 labadie et al 2010 messaoudi et al 2013 overall blood chemistries changed in conjunction with initiation of viremia and returned to baseline 1015 days postexposure chen et al 2010 cns involvement has been difficult to reproduce in nhp models although it was reported that high inoculum in cynomolgus did result in meningoencephalitis labadie et al 2010 the nhp models have been utilized to conduct efficacy testing on novel vaccines and therapeutics broeckel et al 2015 dengue virus denv is transmitted via the mosquito vectors a aegypti and a albopictus moore and mitchell 1997 given the endemicity of the vectors it is estimated that half of the worlds population is at risk for exposure to denv this results in approximately 50 million cases of dengue each year with the burden of disease in the tropical and subtropical regions of latin america south asia and southeast asia gubler 2002 it is estimated that there are 20000 deaths each year due to dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf guzman and kouri 2002 there are four distinct serotypes of denv numbered 14 which are capable of causing a wide clinical spectrum that ranges from asymptomatic to severe with the development of dhf world health organization 1997 incubation can range from 3 to 14 days with the average being 47 days the virus targets dendritic cells and macrophages following a mosquito bite balsitis et al 2009 typical infection results in classic dengue fever df which is self-limiting and has flu-like symptoms in conjunction with retroorbital pain headache skin rash and bone and muscle pain dhf can follow with vascular leak syndrome and low platelet count resulting in hemorrhage in the most extreme cases dengue shock syndrome dss develops characterized by hypotension shock and circulatory failure world health organization 1997 thrombocytopenia is a hallmark clinical sign of infection and aids in differential diagnosis gregory et al 2010 severe disease has a higher propensity to occur upon secondary infection with a different denv serotype thein et al 1997 this is hypothesized to occur due to antibody dependent enhancement ade there is no approved vaccine or drug and hospitalized patients receive supportive care including fluid replacement in order to further progress toward an effective drug or vaccine small human cohort studies have taken place however to provide statistically relevant results testing must progress in an animal model in developing an animal model it is important to note that mosquitoes typically deposit 104106 pfu and is considered the optimal range during experimental challenge chan et al 2015
 denv does not naturally replicate effectively in rodent cells creating the need for mouse-adapted strains engineered mouse lines and a variety of inoculation routes to overcome the initial barrier several laboratory mouse strains including aj balbc and c57bl6 are permissive to dengue infection however the resulting disease has little resemblance to human clinical signs and death results from paralysis huang et al 2000 paes et al 2005 shresta et al 2004 a higher dose of an adapted denv strain induced dhf symptoms in both balbc and c57bl6 chen et al 2007 souza et al 2009 this model can also yield asymptomatic infections a mouse-adapted strain of denv 2 introduced into ag129 mice developed vascular leak syndrome similar to the severe disease seen in humans shresta et al 2006 passive transfer of monoclonal dengue antibodies within mice leads to ade during the course of infection viremia was increased and animals died due to vascular leak syndrome balsitis et al 2010 another mouse-adapted strain injected into balbc caused liver damage hemorrhagic manifestations and vascular permeability souza et al 2009 ic injection of suckling mice with denv leads to death by paralysis and encephalitis which is rare in human infection lee et al 2015 parida et al 2002 zhao et al 2014a immunocompromised mice have also been used to gain an understanding of the pathogenesis of denv the most well-defined model is ag129 which is deficient in ifn and  receptors and can recapitulate dhfdss if a mouse-adapted strain is utilized watanabe et al 2012 yauch et al 2009 scid mice engrafted with human tumor cells develop paralysis upon infection and thus are not useful for pathogenesis studies blaney et al 2002 lin et al 1998 df symptoms developed after infection in nodscidil2rko mice engrafted with cd34 human progenitor cells mota and rico-hesse 2011 rag-hu mice developed fever but no other symptoms upon infection with a passaged clinical isolate and lab-adapted strain of denv 2 kuruvilla et al 2007 a passaged clinical isolate of denv 3 was used to create a model in immunocompetent adult mice ip injection in c57bl6j and balbc caused lethality by day 67 postinfection in a dose dependent manner the first indication of infection was weight loss beginning on day 4 followed by thrombocytopenia a drop in systolic blood pressure along with noted increases in the liver enzymes ast and alt were also observed viremia was established by day 5 this model mimicked the characteristic symptoms observed in human dhfdss cases costa et al 2012 vascular leakage was also observed when c57bl6 were inoculated with denv 2 st john et al 2013 a murine model was developed that utilized infected mosquitoes as the route of transmission to hu-nsg mice female mosquitoes were intrathoracically inoculated with a clinical isolate of denv 2 infected mosquitoes then fed upon the mouse footpad to allow for transmission of the virus via the natural route the amount of virus detected within the mouse was directly proportional to the number of mosquitoes it was exposed to with 45 being optimal detectable viral rna was in line with historical human infection data severe thrombocytopenia developed on day 14 this model is notable in that disease was enhanced with mosquito delivery of the virus in comparison to injection of the virus cox et al 2012 nhp models have used a subq inoculation in an attempt to induce disease although the animals are permissive to viral replication it is to a lower degree than that observed in human infection marchette et al 1973 the immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide enhances infection in rhesus macaques by allowing the virus to invade monocytes marchette et al 1980 throughout these preliminary studies no clinical disease was detected in order to circumvent this a higher dose of denv was used in an iv challenge of rhesus macaques hemorrhagic manifestations appeared by day 3 and resulted in petechiae hematomas and coagulopathy however no other symptoms developed onlamoon et al 2010 a robust antibody response was observed in multiple studies marchette et al 1973 onlamoon et al 2010 marmosets also mirror human dengue infection developing fever leukopenia and thrombocytopenia following subq inoculation omatsu et al 2011 omatsu et al 2012 nhps are able to produce antibodies similar to those observed during the course of human infection making them advantageous in studying ade sequential infection led to a cross-reactive antibody response which has been demonstrated in both humans and mice midgley et al 2011 this phenotype can also be seen upon passive transfer of a monoclonal antibody to dengue and subsequent infection with the virus rhesus macaques exposed in this manner developed viremia that was 3- to 100-fold higher than previously reported however no clinical signs were apparent goncalvez et al 2007 the lack of inducible dhf or dss symptoms hinders further examination of pathogenesis within this model west nile virus wnv was first isolated from the blood of a woman in the west nile district of uganda in 1937 smithburn et al 1940 after the initial isolation of wnv the virus was subsequently isolated from patients birds and mosquitoes in egypt in the early 1950s melnick et al 1951 taylor et al 1953 and was shown to cause encephalitis in humans and horses wnv is recognized as the most widespread of the flaviviruses with a geographical distribution that includes africa the middle east western asia europe and australia hayes 1989 the virus first reached the western hemisphere in the summer of 1999 during an outbreak involving humans horses and birds in the new york city metropolitan area centers for disease control and prevention 1999 lanciotti et al 1999 since 1999 the range of areas affected by wnv quickly extended older people and children are most susceptible to wnv disease wnv generally causes asymptomatic disease or a mild undifferentiated fever west nile fever which can last from 3 to 6 days monath and tsai 2002 the mortality rate following neuroinvasive disease ranges from 4 to 11 asnis et al 2000 hayes 1989 hubalek and halouzka 1999 komar 2000 the most severe complications are commonly seen in the elderly with reported case fatality rates from 4 to 11 hepatitis myocarditis and pancreatitis are unusual severe nonneurologic manifestations of wnv infection inoculation of wnv into nhps intracerebrally resulted in the development of either encephalitis febrile disease or an asymptomatic infection depending on the virus strain and dose viral persistence is observed in these animals regardless of the outcome of infection ie asymptomatic fever encephalitis pogodina et al 1983 thus viral persistence is regarded as a typical result of nhp infection with various wnv strains after both intracerebral and subq inoculation the virus localizes predominantly in the brain and may also be found in the kidneys spleen and lymph nodes wnv does not result in clinical disease in nhps although the animals show a low level of viremia lieberman et al 2009 pletnev et al 2003 this is mirrored in new zealand white rabbits in that they only develop fever and low levels of viremia following inoculation via footpad suen et al 2015 id inoculation of both marmosets and rhesus macaques did not yield any clinical signs of disease including fever viremia was detected in both nhp species but marmosets developed a higher titer for a greater duration than rhesus verstrepen et al 2014 wnv has also been extensively studied in small animals all classical laboratory mouse strains are susceptible to lethal infections by the intracerebral and ip routes resulting in encephalitis and 100 mortality id route pathogenesis studies indicated that langerhans dendritic cells are the initial viral replication sites in the skin brown et al 2007 johnston et al 1996 the infected langerhans cells then migrate to lymph nodes and the virus enters the blood through lymphatic and thoracic ducts and disseminates to peripheral tissues for secondary viral replication virus eventually travels to the cns and causes pathology that is similar to human cases byrne et al 2001 cunha et al 2000 diamond et al 2003 fratkin et al 2004 the swiss mouse strain was inoculated ip in order to screen a variety of viral lineages to assess differences in pathogenesis bingham et al 2014 tesh et al developed a model for wn encephalitis using the golden hamster mesocricetus auratus hamsters appeared asymptomatic during the first 5 days became lethargic at approximately day 6 and developed neurologic symptoms between days 7 and 10 tesh et al 2005 many of the severely affected animals died 714 days after infection viremia was detected in the hamsters within 24 h after infection and persisted for 56 days although there were no substantial changes in internal organs progressive pathologic differences were seen in the brain and spinal cord of infected animals furthermore similar to the previously mentioned monkey experiments by pogodina et al 1983 persistent wnv infection was found in the brains of hamsters zika virus recently came to the forefront of public health concerns with the outbreak in brazil at the end of 2015 the clinical disease spectrum is highly variable with reports of a flu-like illness accompanied by rash guillanbarre syndrome and microcephaly in newborns ramos da silva and gao 2016 to date a correlation between gestational age at which exposure to the virus occurs and severity of microcephaly is not fully understood brasil et al 2016 however a recent study of pregnant women in columbia found that infection with zika virus during the third trimester was not associated with any obvious structural abnormalities of the fetus pacheco et al 2016 transmission of the virus occurs via the bite from an infected a aegypti or a albopictus ramos da silva and gao 2016 other reported routes of exposure include sexual transmission and blood transfusion cunha et al 2016 dortenzio et al 2016 hills et al 2016 mccarthy 2016 the emergence of this virus with no approved vaccine or therapy and few diagnostic options demonstrates the utility of well-characterized animal model development it was first demonstrated in 1956 that experimentally infected mosquitoes could be used to transmit the virus to mice and nhps boorman and porterfield 1956 a129 mice were susceptible to nonadapted zika virus infection following subq inoculation of the limbs mice began to lose weight 3 days postinfection and met euthanasia criteria by day 6 microscopic lesions within the brain were noted upon necropsy in conjunction viral rna was detected in the blood brain ovary spleen and liver of the infected mice wild-type 129svev mice were also challenged with no observable clinical disease however viral rna was detected at day 3 postinfection in the blood ovary and spleen and then remained at detectable levels in the ovaries and spleen on day 7 dowall et al 2016 footpad inoculation of the virus leads to a fatal disease in ag129 mice by day 7 postinoculation with significant histopathological changes in the brain noted at necropsy aliota et al 2016 ag129 mice were also observed to develop neurologic disease by day 6 postexposure rossi et al 2016 immunocompetent mice are resistant to infection via the subq route rossi et al 2016 recently a mouse model was identified to verify vertical transmission of the virus pregnant c57 mice were injected either ip or in utero into the lateral ventricle of the fetal brain ip inoculation induced transient viremia in the pregnant mice on day 1 viral rna was detected in five out of nine placentas on day 3 postinfection the virus was able to infect the radial glia cells in the fetal brain and leads to a reduction in the cortical neural progenitors wu et al 2016 viral exposure via cerebroventricular spacelateral ventricle of the fetal brain exhibited small brain size at day 5 postexposure in addition to cortical thinning cugola et al 2016 li et al 2016a ifnar1 pregnant mice exposed to the virus had nonviable fetuses in the same study wild-type mice were given an anti-ifnar antibody prior to and during infection resulting in detectable virus in the fetal head with mild intrauterine growth restriction miner et al 2016 all of these murine studies will further study of the pathogenesis of vertical transmission and the resulting neurological disorders in conjunction with screening novel countermeasures nhp studies are currently ongoing for animal model development the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars sars-cov emerged in 2002 as it spread throughout 32 countries in a period of 6 months with 8437 confirmed infections and 813 deaths roberts and subbarao 2006 world health organization 2003 no additional cases of community acquired sars-cov infection have been reported since 2004 the natural reservoir of sars-cov is the horseshoe bat and the palm civet is an intermediate host lau et al 2005 the main mechanism of transmission of sars-cov is through droplet spread but it is also viable in dry form on surfaces for up to 6 days and can be detected in stool suggesting other modes of transmission are also possible pearson et al 2003 rabenau et al 2005 rota et al 2003 sars-cov infection has a 10 case fatality with the majority of cases in people over the age of 15 peiris et al 2003 wang et al 2004 after an incubation period of 210 days clinical signs of sars include general malaise fever chills diarrhea dyspnea and cough drosten et al 2003 in some sars cases pneumonia may develop and progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards fever usually dissipates within 2 weeks and coincides with the induction of high levels of neutralizing antibodies tan et al 2004 in humans sars-cov replication destroys respiratory epithelium and a great deal of the pathogenesis is due to the subsequent immune responses chen and subbarao 2007 perlman and dandekar 2005 infiltrates persisting within the lung and diffuse alveolar damage dad are common sequelae of sars-cov infection perlman and dandekar 2005 virus can be isolated from secretions of the upper airways during early but not later stages of infection as well as from other tissues cheng et al 2004 sars-cov can replicate in many species including dogs cats pigs mice rats ferrets foxes and monkeys roper and rehm 2009 no model captures all aspects of human clinical disease pyrexia and respiratory signs mortality 10 viral replication and pathology roberts et al 2008 in general the sars-cov disease course in the model species is much milder and of shorter duration than in humans viral replication in the various animal models may occur without clinical illness andor histopathologic changes the best-characterized models utilize mice hamsters ferrets and nhps mouse models of sars-cov typically are inoculated by the in route under light anesthesia roberts et al 2005 young 6- to 8-week-old balbc mice exposed to sars-cov have viral replication detected in the lungs and nasal turbinate with a peak on day 2 and clearance by day 5 postexposure mcauliffe et al 2004 there is also viral replication within the small intestines of young balbc mice however young mice have no clinical signs aside from reduced weight gain and have little to no inflammation within the lungs pneumonitis gillim-ross et al 2004 in sars-cov infection of c57bl6 b6 also yields reduced weight gain and viral replication in the lungs with a peak on day 3 and clearance by day 9 glass et al 2004 in contrast balbc mice 1314 months of age show weight loss hunched posture dehydration and ruffled fur on day 36 postexposure bisht et al 2004 interstitial pneumonitis alveolar damage and death also occur in old mice resembling the age-dependent virulence observed in humans 129s mice and b6 mice show outcomes to sars-cov infection similar to those observed for balbc mice but have lower titers and less prolonged disease while the aged mouse model is more frequently used then young mice it is more difficult to obtain large numbers of mice older than 1 year table 331
 a number of immunocompromised knockout mouse models of in sars-cov infection have also been developed 129svev mice infected with sars-cov by the in route develop bronchiolitis with peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation in adjacent alveolar septae hogan et al 2004 viral replication and disease in these mice resolves by day 14 postexposure beige cd1 and rag1 mice infected with sars-cov have similar outcomes to infected balbc mice with regard to viral replication timing of viral clearance and a lack of clinical signs glass et al 2004 stat1 ko mice infected in with sars-cov have severe disease with weight loss pneumonitis interstitial pneumonia and some deaths hogan et al 2004 the stat1 ko mouse model is therefore useful for studies of pathogenicity pathology and evaluation of vaccines angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and cd209l were identified as cellular receptors for sars-cov with affinity for the spike s protein of the virus jeffers et al 2004 the variations in the ace2 sequence across animal species could partially explain the differences in infection severity li et al 2016b sutton and subbarao 2015 since mice in particular have a greater number of sequence differences in ace2 transgenic mice were created that express human ace2 mccray et al 2007 netland et al 2008 yang et al 2007 unlike other murine models of sars-cov mice expressing hace2 had up to 100 mortality with severity correlating to the level of hace2 expression tseng et al 2007 with high levels of hace2 expression mice developed a severe lung and brain infection however cns infection is only rarely observed in humans infected with sars-cov syrian golden hamsters strain lvg are also susceptible to in exposure of sars-cov after the administration of 103 tcid50 along with a period of transient viremia sars-cov replicates in nasal turbinates and lungs resulting in pneumonitis roberts et al 2005 there are no obvious signs of disease but exercise wheels can be used to monitor decrease in nighttime activity limited mortality has been observed but it was not dose dependent and could have more to do with genetic differences between animals because the strain is not inbred roberts et al 2008 damage is not observed in the liver or spleen despite detection of virus within these tissues several studies have shown that intratracheal it inoculation of sars-cov in anesthetized ferrets mustela furo results in lethargy fever sneezing and nasal discharge skowronski et al 2005 clinical disease has been observed in several studies excluding one perhaps due to characteristics of the inoculating virus kobinger et al 2007 sars-cov is detected in pharyngeal swabs trachea tracheobronchial lymph nodes and high titers within the lungs mortality has been observed around day 4 postexposure as well as mild alveolar damage in 510 of the lungs occasionally accompanied by severe pathology within the lungs martina et al 2003 ter meulen et al 2004 with fever overt respiratory signs lung damage and some mortality the ferret intratracheal model of sars-cov infection is perhaps most similar to human sars albeit with a shorter time course sars-cov infection of nhps by intransal or it routes generally results in a very mild infection that resolves quickly sars-cov infection of old world monkeys such as rhesus macaques cynomolgus macaques cynos and african green monkeys agms have been studied with variable results possibly due to the outbred nature of the groups studied or previous exposure to related pathogens clinical illness and viral loads have not been consistent however replication within the lungs and dad are features of the infections for each of the primate species some cynos have no illness but others have rash lethargy and respiratory signs and pathology haagmans et al 2004 martina et al 2003 mcauliffe et al 2004 rowe et al 2004 rhesus have little to no disease and only have mild findings upon histopathological analysis rowe et al 2004 agms infected with sars-cov have no overt clinical signs but dad and pneumonitis has been documented mcauliffe et al 2004 viral replication has been detected for up to 10 days in the lungs of agms however the infection resolves and does not progress to fatal ards farmed chinese masked palm civets sold in open markets in china were involved in the sars-cov outbreak it and in inoculation of civets with sars-cov results in lethargy decreased aggressiveness fever diarrhea and conjunctivitis wu et al 2005 leucopenia pneumonitis and alveolar septal enlargement with lesions similar to those observed in ferrets and nhps have also been observed in laboratory-infected civets squirrel monkeys mustached tamarinds and common marmosets have not been susceptible to sars-cov infection greenough et al 2005 roberts et al 2008 vaccines have been developed for related animal covs in chickens cattle dogs cats and swine and have included live-attenuated killed dna and viral-vectored vaccine strategies cavanagh 2003 an important issue to highlight from work on these vaccines is that cov vaccines such as those developed for cats may induce a more severe disease perlman and dandekar 2005 weiss and scott 1981 as such immune mice had th2-type immunopathology upon sars-cov challenge tseng et al 2012 severe hepatitis in vaccinated ferrets with antibody enhancement in liver has been reported weingartl et al 2004 additionally rechallenge of agms showed limited viral replication but significant lung inflammation including alveolitis and interstitial pneumonia which persisted for long periods of time after viral clearance clay et al 2012 mouse and nhp models with increased virulence may be developed by adapting the virus by repeated passage within the species of interest mouse-adapted sars with uniform lethality was developed from 15 serial passages in the lungs of young balbc mice mccray et al 2007 roberts et al 2007 rockx et al 2007 middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov emerged in saudi arabia and is associated with fever severe lower respiratory tract infection and oftentimes renal failure al-tawfiq et al 2016 omrani et al 2015 mers patients can also occasionally manifest with neurological symptoms mers-cov infection has a high fatality rate infections in humans can also be asymptomatic as of october 2015 there were 1589 confirmed cases and 567 deaths li et al 2016b bats serve as the likely natural reservoir since virus with 100 nucleotide identity to the index case was isolated from egyptian tomb bats memish et al 2013 spread to humans likely comes from infected dromedary camels adney et al 2014 azhar et al 2014 the host range for mers-cov is dependent on the binding of the viral s protein to the host receptor which is human dipeptidyl peptidase four hdpp4 also known as cd26 raj et al 2013 the expression and distribution of dpp4 in the human respiratory tract has recently been well characterized meyerholz et al 2016 interestingly dpp4 expression is preferentially localized to alveolar regions perhaps explaining why mers predominantly manifests as an infection of the lower respiratory tract humans with preexisting pulmonary disease have increased dpp4 expression in alveolar epithelia small animals typically used for viral disease research such as mice hamsters guinea pigs and ferrets are naturally nonpermissive to mers-cov infection due to a low binding efficiency of the viral s protein to the host dpp4 sutton and subbarao 2015 in contrast the rhesus macaque and common marmoset have complete homology to human dpp4 allowing productive mers-cov infection to occur de wit et al 2013 falzarano et al 2014 munster et al 2013 yao et al 2014 new zealand white rabbits can be infected with mers-cov and virus was isolated from the upper respiratory tract but there were no clinical symptoms or significant histopathological changes haagmans et al 2015 due to the lack of strong binding affinity of the mers-cov s protein to the murine dpp4 receptor wild-type mice are not susceptible to mers-cov infection as such several approaches have been used to create susceptible murine animal models of mers-cov infection by inducing the expression of hdpp4 one approach utilized an adenovirus vector expressing hdpp4 to transduce mice zhao et al 2014b these mice developed pneumonia but survived mers-cov infection in mers-cov infection of mice with global expression of hdpp4 resulted in id50 and ld50 values of 1 and 10 tcid50 respectively tao et al 2016 thus mers-cov infection of these transgenic mice can be either sublethal or uniformly lethal depending on the dose inflammatory infiltrates were found in the lungs and brain stems of mice with some focal infiltrates in the liver as well another strategy uses transgenic mice expressing hdpp4 under either a surfactant protein c or cytokeratin 10 promoter li et al 2016b in mers-cov infection in these mice resulted in a uniformly lethal disease characterized by alveolar edema and microvascular thrombosis and mononuclear clear cell infiltration in the lungs the brain stem was also impacted by the infection dpp4 expression with an ubiquitously expressing promoter from cytomegalovirus also had a uniformly lethal infection with predominant lung and brain involvement but numerous other tissues were also impacted and contained virus agrawal et al 2015 common marmosets infected with 52  106 tcid50 emc-2012 mers-cov by the combined in oral ocular and it routes capitulate the severe disease in human infections falzarano et al 2014 the animals manifested moderate to severe clinical disease with interstitial infiltration of both lower lung lobes two of nine animals became moribund between days 4 and 6 viral rna was detected in nasal and throat swabs various organs and in the blood of some animals indicating a systemic infection histologically animals showed evidence of acute bronchial interstitial pneumonia as well as other pathological defects infection of rhesus macaques with mers-cov results in a mild clinical disease characterized by a transient lung infection with pneumonia rhesus macaques were inoculated with at least 107 tcid50 emc-2012 mers-cov either by the it route or a combined in it oral and ocular inoculation de wit et al 2013 the result was a mild respiratory illness including nasal swelling and a short fever with all animals surviving viral rna was recovered from nasal swab samples and replicating virus was found in lung tissue munster et al 2013 mild pathological lesions were found only in the lungs radiographic imaging of the lungs revealed interstitial infiltrates which are signs of pneumonia yao et al 2014 interestingly mer-cov infection is more severe in marmosets compared to rhesus macaques falzarano et al 2014 this is despite the finding that both species have complete homology with humans within the dpp4 domain that interacts with the viral s protein other host factors influencing disease severity have not yet been identified transgenic mouse models expressing hdpp4 are ideal for initial development and screening of mers-cov countermeasures and marmosets can be used for final selection and characterization filoviridae consists of three genera ebolavirus and marburgvirus and a newly discovered group cuevavirus kuhn 2008 it is thought that various species of bats are the natural host reservoir for these viruses that have lethality rates from 40 to 82 in humans there is evidence that the egyptian rousette bat rousettus aegyptiacus is the natural reservoir for marburgviruses but may not be for ebolaviruses jones et al 2015 marburg virus marv first emerged in 1967 in germany when laboratory workers contracted the virus from agms chlorocebus aerthiops that were shipped from uganda ebolaviruses sudan and zaire sudv and ebov caused nearly simultaneous outbreaks in 1976 in what is now the democratic republic of congo drc the most recent outbreak of ebov in west africa was by far the largest with over 28000 suspected probable and confirmed cases and over 11000 deaths bundibugyo virus bdbv first emerged in 2007 in bundibugyo uganda with 56 confirmed cases macneil et al 2010 two other ebolaviruses are known ta forest tafv previously named cote divoire ciebov and reston restv which have not caused major outbreaks or lethal disease in humans filovirus disease in humans is a characterized by aberrant innate immunity and a number of clinical symptoms fever nausea vomiting arthralgiamyalgia headaches sore throat diarrhea abdominal pain and anorexia as well as numerous others mehedi et al 2011 wauquier et al 2010 approximately 10 of patients develop petechia and a greater percentage depending on the specific strain may develop bleeding from various sites gums puncture sites stools etc table 332
 natural transmission in an epidemic is through direct contact or needle sticks in hospital settings however much of the research interest in filoviruses primarily stems from biodefense needs particularly from aerosol biothreats as such im ip and aerosol models have been developed in mice hamsters guinea pigs and nhps for the study of pathogenesis correlates of immunity and for testing countermeasures bradfute and bavari 2011 bradfute et al 2011 since filoviruses have such high lethality rates in humans scientists have looked for models that are uniformly lethal to stringently test efficacy of candidate vaccines and therapeutics one issue to take note of in animal model development of filovirus infection is the impact of particle to plaque-forming unit pfu ratios on lethality wherein it is possible that increasing the dose could actually decrease infectivity due to an immunogenic effect produced by inactive virions in the stock additionally the plaque assay used to measure live virions in a stock may greatly underestimate the true quantity of infectious virions in a preparation alfson et al 2015 smither et al 2013a immunocompetent mice have not been successfully infected with wild-type filoviruses due to the control of the infection by the murine type 1 interferon response bray 2001 however wild-type inbred mice are susceptible to filovirus that has been mouse adapted ma by serial passage in mice bray et al 1999 marv angola was particularly resistant to adaptation but after 24 serial passages in scid mice infection caused severe disease in balbc and c57bl6 mice when administered in or ip qiu et al 2014 these mice had pathology with some similarities to infection in humans including lymphopenia thrombocytopenia liver damage and viremia balbc mice which are the strain of choice for ip inoculation of ma-ebov are not susceptible by the aerosol route bray et al 1999 zumbrun et al 2012a for aerosol infection of immunocompetent mice a panel of bxd balbc x dba recombinant inbred strains were screened and one strain bxd34 was particularly susceptible to airborne ma-ebov with 100 lethality to low or high doses approximately 100 or 1000 pfu zumbrun et al 2012a these mice developed weight loss of greater than 15 and succumbed to infection between days 7 and 8 postexposure the aerosol infection model utilizes a whole-body exposure chamber to expose mice aged 68 weeks to ma-ebov aerosols with a mass median aerodynamic diameter mmad of approximately 16 m and a geometric standard deviation gsd of approximately 20 for 10 min another approach uses immunodeficient mouse strains such as scid stat1 ko ifn receptor ko or perforin ko with a wild-type ebov inoculum by ip or aerosol routes bray 2001 lever et al 2012 zumbrun et al 2012a mice are typically monitored for clinical disease scores based on activity and appearance weight loss and moribund condition survival coagulopathy a hallmark of filovirus infection in humans has been observed with bleeding in a subset of animals and failure of blood samples to coagulate late in infection bray et al 1999 liver kidney spleen and lung tissue taken from moribund mice have pathology characteristic of filovirus disease in nhps zumbrun et al 2012a while most mouse studies have used ma-ebov or ebov an ip mouse-adapted marv model is also available warfield et al 2007 warfield et al 2009 ma-marv and ma-ebov models are particularly useful for screening novel antiviral compounds panchal et al 2012 recently a model was created using immunodeficient nsg nonobese diabetic nodscidil-2 receptor chain knockout mice with transplanted human hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord blood these mice were susceptible to lethal wt nonadapted ebov by ip and in exposure ludtke et al 2015 the transplanted mice had all of the cellular components of a fully functional adaptive human immune system and upon ebov infection had several features typical of ebov disease these included viremia cellular damage liver steatosis and signs of hemorrhage infabr mice infected with wt sudv or ebov have a partially lethal disease with weight loss and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation dic in the liver brannan et al 2015 lever et al 2012 interestingly inoculation of infabr mice with tafv and restv does not result in clinical signs yet another strategy uses knockout mice lacking possible receptors for filovirus entry such as niemann-pick c1 and c2 npc1 and npc2 npc2 mice were fully susceptible to infection with ebov but npc1 mice were completely resistant herbert et al 2015 hamsters are frequently used to study cardiovascular disease coagulation disorders and thus serve as the basis for numerous viral hemorrhagic fever models gowen and holbrook 2008 herbert et al 2015 an ip ma-ebov infection model has been developed in syrian hamsters ebihara et al 2013 gowen and holbrook 2008 herbert et al 2015 tsuda et al 2011 this model which has been used to test a vesicular stomatitis virus vectored vaccine approach utilizes male 5- to 6-week-old syrian hamsters which are infected with 100 ld50 of ma-ebov virus is present in tissues and blood collected on day 4 and all animals succumbed to the disease by day 6 infected hamsters had severe coagulopathy and uncontrolled host immune responses similar to what is observed in primates ebihara et al 2010 guinea pig models of filovirus infection have been developed for ip and aerosol routes using guinea pig-adapted ebov gp-ebov and marv gp-marv choi et al 2012 connolly et al 1999 twenhafel et al 2015 zumbrun et al 2012c guinea pig models of filovirus infection are quite useful in that they develop fever which can be monitored at frequent intervals by telemetry additionally the animals are large enough for regular blood sampling in which measurable coagulation defects are observed as the infection progresses a comparison of ip infection of outbred guinea pigs with guinea pig-adapted marv angola and marv ravn revealed similar pathogenesis cross et al 2015 infection with either strain resulted in features of the disease that are similar to what is seen in human and nhp infection such as viremia fever coagulopathy lymphopenia elevated liver enzymes alt and ast thrombocytopenia and splenic gastrointestinal and hepatic lesions gp-marv-ravn had a delayed disease progression relative to gp-marv-ang hartley guinea pigs exposed to aerosolized gp-ebov develop lethal interstitial pneumonia this is in contrast to subq infection of guinea pigs aerosol ebov challenge of nhps and natural human infection twenhafel et al 2015 both subq and aerosol exposure of guinea pigs to gp-ebov resulted in only mild lesions in the liver and spleen by aerosol exposure gp-ebov is uniformly lethal at both high and low doses 100 or 1000 pfu target doses but lethality drops with low less than 1000 pfu presented doses of airborne gp-marv and more protracted disease is seen in some animals our unpublished observations zumbrun et al 2012c weight loss of between 15 and 25 is a common finding in guinea pigs exposed to gp-ebov or gp-marv fever which becomes apparent by day 5 occurs more rapidly in gp-ebov exposed guinea pigs than with gp-marv exposure lymphocytes and neutrophils increase during the earlier part of the disease and platelet levels steadily drop as the disease progresses increases in coagulation time can be seen as early as day 6 postexposure blood chemistries ie alt ast alkp and bun indicating problems with liver and kidney function are also altered late in the disease course transmission of ebov has been documented from swine to nhps via the respiratory tract kobinger et al 2011 as such guinea pigs have been used to establish transmission models wong et al 2015a wong et al 2015b nonexposed guinea pigs were placed in the cages with infected guinea pigs 1 day postexposure to gp-ebov guinea pigs challenged intanasally were more likely to transmit virus to naive cagemates than those that were exposed by the ip route nhp models of filovirus infection are the preferred models for more advanced disease characterization and testing of countermeasures because they most closely mimic the disease and immune correlates seen in humans dye et al 2012 old world primates have been primarily used for development of ip im and aerosol models of filovirus infection twenhafel et al 2013 uniformly lethal filovirus models have been developed for most of the virus strains in cynomolgus macaques rhesus macaques and to a lesser degree agms alves et al 2010 carrion et al 2011 davis et al 1997 hensley et al 2011a reed et al 2007 zumbrun et al 2012b low-passage human isolates that have not been passaged in animals have been sought for development of nhp models to satisfy the food and drug administration fda animal rule ebov-makona the strain responsible for the recent large outbreak in west africa was compared to the prototype 1976 ebov strain marzi et al 2015 the disease in cynos was similar for both viruses but disease progression was delayed for ebov-makona this delay as well as the lower fatality rate in the 2014 epidemic compared to the 1976 outbreak suggest that ebov-makona is less virulent the large number of cases in the 201415 ebov outbreak brought to light previously underappreciated eye pathology and ocular viral persistence in survivors while survivors of nhp filovirus infection are infrequent necrotizing scleritis conjunctivitis and other ocular pathology has been observed in ebov-infected animals alves et al 2016
 prominent features of the filovirus infections in nhps are onset of fever by day 5 postexposure viremia lymphopenia tachycardia azotemia alteration in liver function enzymes alt ast and alkp decrease in platelets and increased coagulation times petechial rash is a common sign of filovirus disease and may be more frequently observed in cynomolgus macaques than in other nhp species zumbrun et al 2012b immunological parameters have been evaluated and t b and natural killer cells are greatly diminished as the infection progresses fernando et al 2015 a cytokine storm occurs with rises in ifn tnf il-6 and ccl2 fernando et al 2015 however there is also evidence from transcriptional profiling of circulating immune cells that the early immune response is skewed toward a th2 response connor et al 2015 strikingly animals surviving challenge may have a delay in the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines martins et al 2015 clinical disease parameters may have a slightly delayed onset in aerosol models dyspnea late in infection is a prominent feature of disease after aerosol exposure zumbrun et al 2012b aerosol filovirus infection of nhps results in early infection of respiratory lymphoid tissues dendritic cells alveolar macrophages blood monocytes and fibroblastic reticular cells followed by spread to regional lymph nodes then multiple organs ewers et al 2016 twenhafel et al 2013 a number of pronounced pathology findings include multifocal hepatic necrosis and fibrin accumulation particularly within the liver and the spleen for aerosolized marv infection of rhesus the most significant pathology included destruction of the tracheobronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes ewers et al 2016 lymphocytolysis and lymphoid depletion are also observed alves et al 2010 multilead surgically implanted telemetry devices are useful in continuous collection of temperature blood pressure heart rate and activity levels as such blood pressure drops as animals become moribund and heart rate variability standard deviation of the heart rate is altered late in infection zumbrun et al 2012b the most recently developed telemetry devices can also aid in plethysmography to measure respiratory minute volume for accurate delivery of presented doses for aerosol exposure standardized filovirus-infected nhp euthanasia criteria have also been developed to enhance reproducibility for studies that evaluate therapeutic and vaccine countermeasures warren et al 2014 filovirus infection of common marmosets callithrix jacchus is also a viable model to study the disease course respiratory infection of marmosets with marv results in a lethal infection with fever hemorrhaging transient rash disseminated viral infection increases in liver function enzymes coagulopathy hepatitis and histological lesions particularly in the kidney and liver smither et al 2013b marmosets are similarly susceptible to infection with ebov-kikwit smither et al 2015 thus ebov or marv infection of marmosets produces features of the disease that are very similar to that of other nhps and humans hendra and nipah virus are unusual within the paramyxoviridae family given that they can infect a large range of mammalian hosts both viruses are grouped under the genus henipavirus the natural reservoirs of the viruses are the fruit bats from the genus pteropus hendra and nipah have the ability to cause severe disease in humans with the potential for a high case fatality rate rockx et al 2012 outbreaks due to nipah virus have been recognized in malaysia singapore bangladesh and india while hendra virus outbreaks have yet to be reported outside of australia luby et al 2009a luby et al 2009b hendra was the first member of the genus identified and was initially associated with an acute respiratory disease in horses all human cases have been linked to transmission through close contact with an infected horse there have been no confirmed cases of direct transmission from bat to human nipah has the distinction of transmission among although the exact route is unknown homaira et al 2010 the virus is susceptible to ph temperature and desiccation and thus close contact is hypothesized as needed for successful transmission fogarty et al 2008 both viruses have a tropism for the neurological and respiratory tracts the incubation period for hendra virus is 717 days and is marked by a flu-like illness symptoms at this initial stage include myalgia headache lethargy sore throat and vomiting hanna et al 2006 disease progression can continue to pneumonitis or encephalitic manifestations with the person succumbing to multiorgan failure playford et al 2010 nipah virus has an incubation period of 4 days to 2 weeks goh et al 2000 much like hendra the first signs of disease are nondescript severe neurological symptoms subsequently develop including encephalitis and seizures that can progress to coma within 2448 h lo and rota 2008 survivors of infection typically make a full recovery however 22 suffer permanent sequelae including persistent convulsions tan and chua 2008 at this time there is no approved vaccine or antiviral and treatment is purely supportive animal models are being used to not only test novel vaccines and therapeutics but also deduce the early events of disease because documentation of human cases is at terminal stages the best small animal model is the syrian golden hamster due to their high susceptibility to both henipaviruses clinical signs upon infection recapitulate the disease course in humans including acute encephalitis and respiratory distress challenged animals died within 417 days postinfection the progression of disease and timeline is highly dependent on dose and route of infection in inoculation leads to imbalance limb paralysis lethargy and breathing difficulties whereas ip resulted in tremors and paralysis within 24 h before death virus was detected in lung brain spleen kidney heart spinal cords and urine with the brain having the highest titer this model is used for vaccination and passive protection studies guillaume et al 2009 rockx et al 2011 wong et al 2003 the guinea pig model has not been widely used due to the lack of a respiratory disease upon challenge torres-velez et al 2008 williamson et al 2001 inoculation with hendra virus via the subq route leads to a generalized vascular disease with 20 mortality clinical signs were apparent 716 days postinfection with death occurring within 2 days of cns involvement higher inoculum has been associated with development of encephalitis and cns lesions id and in injection does not lead to disease although the animals are able to seroconvert upon challenge the inoculum source does not affect clinical progression nipah virus challenge only causes disease upon ip injection and results in weight loss and transient fever for 57 days virus was shed through urine and was present in the brain spleen lymph nodes ovary uterus and urinary bladder hooper et al 1997 ferrets infected with hendra or nipah virus display the same clinical disease as seen in the hamster model and human cases bossart et al 2009 pallister et al 2011 upon inoculation by the oronasal route ferrets develop severe pulmonary and neurological disease within 69 days including fever coughing and dyspnea lesions do develop in the ferrets brains but to a lesser degree than seen in humans cats have also been utilized as an animal model for henipaviruses disease symptoms are not dependent upon the route of infection the incubation period is 48 days and leads to respiratory and neurological symptoms mungall et al 2007 johnston et al 2015 westbury et al 1996 this model has proven useful for vaccine efficacy studies squirrel and agms are representative of the nhp models for squirrel monkeys nipah virus is introduced by either the in or iv route and subsequently leads to clinical signs similar to humans although in challenge results in milder disease upon challenge only 50 of animals develop disease manifestations including anorexia dyspnea and acute respiratory syndrome neurological involvement is characterized by uncoordinated motor skills loss of consciousness and coma viral rna can be detected in lung brain liver kidney spleen and lymph nodes but is only found upon iv challenge marianneau et al 2010 agms are very consistent model of both viruses it inoculation of the viruses results in 100 mortality and death within 85 and 912 days postinfection for hendra and nipah viruses respectively the animals develop severe respiratory and neurological disease with generalized vasculitis geisbert et al 2010 rockx et al 2010 the reservoir of the viruses gray-headed fruit bats has been experimentally challenged due to their status as the host organism for henipaviruses the bats do not develop clinical disease however hendra virus can be detected in kidneys heart spleen and fetal tissue and nipah virus can be located in urine middleton et al 2007 pigs develop a respiratory disease upon infection with both nipah and hendra viruses berhane et al 2008 li et al 2010 middleton et al 2002 oral inoculation does not produce a clinical disease but subq injection represents a successful route of infection live virus can be isolated from the oropharynx as early as 4 days postinfection nipah virus can also be transmitted between pigs nipah virus was able to induce neurological symptoms in 20 of the pigs even though virus was present in all neurological tissues regardless of symptoms weingartl et al 2005 within the pig model it appeared that nipah virus had a greater tropism for the respiratory tract while hendra for the neurological system horses are also able to develop a severe respiratory tract infection accompanied with fever and general weakness upon exposure to nipah and hendra viruses oronasal inoculation led to systemic disease with viral rna detected in nasal swabs within 2 days marsh et al 2011 williamson et al 1998 animals died within 4 days postexposure and have interstitial pneumonia with necrosis of alveoli murray et al 1995a murray et al 1995b virus could be detected in all major systems mice rats rabbits chickens and dogs have been tested but are nonpermissive to infection westbury et al 1995 wong et al 2003 suckling balbc mice succumb to infection if the virus is inoculated intracranially mungall et al 2006 in exposure with nipah does not induce a clinical disease however there is evidence of a subclinical infection in the lungs following euthanasia of the mice dups et al 2014 in addition a human lung xenograph model in nsg mice demonstrated that the human lung is highly susceptible to nipah viral replication and damage valbuena et al 2014 embryonated chicken eggs have been inoculated with nipah virus leading to a universally fatal disease within 45 days postinfection tanimura et al 2006 annually respiratory syncytial virus rsv is responsible for the lower respiratory tract infections of 33 million children under the age of 5 which in turn results in 3 million hospitalizations and approximately 200000 deaths nair et al 2010 within the united states hospital costs alone amount to over 600 million dollars per year paramore et al 2004 outbreaks are common in the winter yusuf et al 2007 the virus is transmitted by large respiratory droplets that replicate initially within the nasopharynx and spreads to the lower respiratory tract incubation for the virus is 28 days rsv is highly virulent leading to very few asymptomatic infections collins and graham 2008 disease manifestations are highly dependent upon the age of the individual rsv infections in neonates produce nonspecific symptoms including overall failure to thrive apnea and feeding difficulties infants present with a mild upper respiratory tract disease that could develop into bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia contracting rsv at this age results in an increased chance of developing childhood asthma wu et al 2008 young children develop recurrent wheezing while adults have exacerbation of previously existing respiratory conditions falsey et al 2005 common clinical symptoms are runny nose sneezing and coughing accompanied by fever mortality rates from rsv in hospitalized children are 13 with the greatest burden of disease seen in 34 month olds ruuskanen and ogra 1993 hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients solid organ transplant patients and copd patients are particularly vulnerable to rsv infection and have mortality rates between 73 and 133 upon infection anderson et al 2016 although there are almost 60 rsv vaccine candidates which are in preclinical and clinical phases there is no licensed vaccine available and ribavirin usage is not recommended for routine treatment american academy of pediatrics subcommittee on diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis 2006 higgins et al 2016 kim and chang 2016 animal models of rsv were developed in the hopes of formulating an effective and safe vaccine unlike the formalin-inactivated rsv fi-rsv vaccine this vaccine induced severe respiratory illness in infants whom received the vaccine and were subsequently infected with live virus kim et al 1969 mice can be used to model rsv infection although a very high in inoculation is needed to achieve clinical symptoms jafri et al 2004 stark et al 2002 strain choice is crucial to reproducing a physiological relevant response stokes et al 2011 age does not affect primary disease manifestations graham et al 1988 however it does play a role in later sequelae showing increased airway hyperreactivity cormier et al 2010 primary rsv infection produces increased breathing with airway obstruction jafri et al 2004 van schaik et al 1998 virus was detected as early as day 3 and reached maximum titer at day 6 postinfection clinical illness is defined in the mouse by weight loss and ruffled fur as opposed to runny nose sneezing and coughing as seen in humans a humanized mouse model was recently developed by in inoculation the challenged mice experienced weight loss and demonstrated a humoral and cellular immune response to the infection sharma et al 2016 cotton rats are useful given that rsv is able to replicate to high titers within the lungs and can be detected in both the upper and lower airways after in inoculation boukhvalova et al 2009 niewiesk and prince 2002 viral replication is 50- to 1000-fold greater in the cotton rat model than mouse model wyde et al 1993 the cotton rats develop mild to moderate bronchiolitis or pneumonia grieves et al 2015 prince et al 1999 although age does not appear to factor into clinical outcome it has been reported that older cotton rats tend to take longer to achieve viral clearance viral loads peak by the 5th day dropping to below the levels of detection by day 8 the histopathology of the lungs appears similar to that of humans after infection piazza et al 1993 this model has limited use in modeling the human immune response to infection as challenge with the virus induces a th2 response in cotton rats whereas humans tend to have a response skewed toward th1 culley et al 2002 dakhama et al 2005 ripple et al 2010 fi-rsv disease was recapitulated upon challenge with live virus after being vaccinated twice with fi-rsv chinchillas have been challenged experimentally with rsv via in inoculation the virus was permissive within the nasopharynx and eustachian tube the animals displayed an acute respiratory tract infection this model is therefore useful in studying mucosal immunity during infection gitiban et al 2005 ferrets infected by it were found to have detectable rsv in throat swabs up to day 7 postinfection and positive qpcr up to day 10 immunocompromised ferrets were observed to have higher viral loads accompanied with detectable viral replication in the upper respiratory tract stittelaar et al 2016 chimpanzees are permissive to replication and clinical symptoms of rsv including rhinorrhea sneezing and coughing adult squirrel monkeys newborn rhesus macaques and infant cebus monkeys were also challenged but did not exhibit any disease symptoms or high levels of viral replication belshe et al 1977 bonnet monkeys were developed an inflammatory response by day 7 with viral rna detected in both bronchial and alveolar cells simoes et al 1999 the chimpanzee model has been proven useful for vaccine studies hancock et al 2000 teng et al 2000 sheep have also been challenged experimentally since they develop respiratory disease when exposed to ovine rsv meyerholz et al 2004 lambs are also susceptible to human respiratory syncytial infection olivier et al 2009 sow et al 2011 when inoculated intratracheally the lambs developed an upper respiratory tract infection with cough after 6 days some lambs went on to develop lower respiratory disease including bronchiolitis the pneumonia resolved itself within 14 days rsv replication peaked at 6 days and rapidly declined studying respiratory disease in sheep is beneficial given the shared structural features with humans plopper et al 1983 scheerlinck et al 2008 the influenza viruses consist of three types influenza a b and c based on antigenic differences influenza a is further classified by subtypes 16 ha and 9 na subtypes are known seasonal influenza is the most common infection and usually causes a self-limited febrile illness with upper respiratory symptoms and malaise that resolves within 10 days taubenberger and morens 2008 the rate of infection is estimated at 10 in the general population and can result in billions of dollars of loss annually from medical costs and reduced work-force productivity approximately 40000 people in the united states die each year from seasonal influenza dushoff et al 2006 thus vaccines and therapeutics play a critical role in controlling infection and development using animal models is ongoing braun et al 2007b influenza virus replicates in the upper and lower airways peaking at approximately 48-h postexposure infection can be more severe in infants and children under the age of 22 people over the age of 65 or immunocompromised individuals where viral pneumonitis or pneumonia can develop or bacterial superinfection resulting in pneumonia or sepsis barnard 2009 glezen 1982 pneumonia from secondary bacterial infection such as streptococcus pneumonia streptococcus pyogenes and neisseria meningitides and more rarely staphylococcus aureus is more common than viral pneumonia from the influenza virus itself accounting for 27 of all influenza associated fatalities alonso et al 2003 ison and lee 2010 speshock et al 2007 death often due to ards can occur as early as 2 days after onset of symptoms lung histopathology in severe cases may include dad alveolar edema and damage hemorrhage fibrosis and inflammation taubenberger and morens 2008 the h5n1 avian strain of influenza has lethality rates of around 50 of known cases likely because the virus preferentially binds to the cells of the lower respiratory tract and thus the potential for global spread is a major concern matrosovich et al 2004 wang et al 2016 h7n9 is another avian influenza a strain that infected more than 130 people and was implicated in 37 deaths approximately 75 of infected people had a known exposure to birds there is no evidence of sustained spread between humans but these viruses are of great concern for their pandemic potential zhang et al 2013 the most frequently used animal models of influenza infection include mice ferrets and nhps a very thorough guide to working with mouse guinea pig ferret and cynomolgus models was published by kroeze et al 2012 swine are not frequently utilized but are also a potentially useful model for influenza research since they share many similarities to human anatomy genetics susceptibility and pathogenesis rajao and vincent 2015 lethality rates can vary with virus strain used with or without adaptation dose route of inoculation age and genetic background of the animal the various animal models can capture differing diseases caused by influenza benign severe super infection and sepsis severe with ards and neurologic manifestations barnard 2009 also models can utilize seasonal or avian strains and have been developed to study transmission important for understanding the potential for more lethal strains such as h5n1 for spreading among humans mouse models of influenza infection are very predictive for antiviral activity and tissue tropism in humans and are useful in testing and evaluating vaccines gilbert and mcleay 2008 hagenaars et al 2008 ortigoza et al 2012 inoculation is by the in route utilizing approximately 60 l of inoculum in each nare of anesthetized mice exposure may also be to small particle aerosols containing influenza with a mmad of 5 l most inbred strains are susceptible with particularly frequent use of balbc followed by c57bl6j mice males and females have equivalent disease but influenza is generally more infectious in younger 2- to 4-week-old 810 g mice mice are of somewhat limited use in characterizing the immune response to influenza most inbred laboratory mice lack the mxa gene which is an important part of human innate immune response to influenza infection the mouse homolog to mxa mx1 is defective in most inbred mouse strains staeheli and haller 1987 mice with the knocked-in mx1 gene have a 1000-fold higher ld-50 for an influenza a strain pr8 than wild-type background c57bl6 mice grimm et al 2007 weight loss or reduced weight gain decreased activity huddling ruffled fur and increased respiration are the most common clinical signs in influenza infected mice for more virulent strains mice may require euthanasia as early as 48 h postexposure but most mortality occurs from 5 to 12 days postexposure accompanied by decreases in rectal temperature sidwell and smee 2000 pulse oximeter readings and measurement of blood gases for oxygen saturation are also used to determine the impact of influenza infection on respiratory function sidwell et al 1992 virus can be isolated from bronchial lavage bal fluids throughout the infection and from tissues after euthanasia for influenza strains with mild to moderate pathogenicity disease is nonlethal and virus replication is detected within the lungs but usually not other organs increases in serum alpha-1-acidglycoprotein and lung weight also frequently occur however mice infected with influenza do not develop fever dyspnea nasal exudates sneezing or coughing mice can be experimentally infected with influenza a or b but the virus generally requires adaptation to produce clinical signs mice express the receptors for influenza attachment in the respiratory tract however the distribution varies and sa 23 predominates over sa 26 which is why h1 h2 and h3 subtypes usually need to be adapted to mice and h5n1 h2 h6 and h7 viruses do not require adaptation odonnell and subbarao 2011 to adapt mice are infected intratracheally or intranasally by virus isolated from the lungs and reinfected into mice and then the process is repeated a number of times once adapted influenza strains can produce severe disease systemic spread and neurotropism h5n1 and the 1918 pandemic influenza virus can cause lethal infection in mice without adaptation gao et al 1999 taubenberger 2006 h5n1 infection of mice results in viremia and viral replication in multiple organ systems severe lung pathology fulminant diffuse interstitial pneumonia pulmonary edema high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and marked lymphopenia dybing et al 2000 gubareva et al 1998 lu et al 1999 as in humans the virulence of h5n1 is attributable to damage caused by an overactive host immune response additionally mice infected with the 1918 h1n1 influenza virus produce severe lung pathology and oxygen saturation levels that decrease with increasing pneumonia barnard et al 2007 reassortment influenza viruses of the 2009 h1n1 virus and a low-pathogenicity avian h7n3 virus can also induce disease in mice without adaptation williams et al 2016 in superinfection models a sublethal dose of influenza is given to mice followed 7 days later by in inoculation of a sublethal dose of a bacterial strain such as s pneumoniae or s pyogenes chaussee et al 2011 morbidity characterized by inflammation in the lungs but not bacteremia begins a couple of days after superinfection and may continue for up to 2 weeks at least one transmission model has also been developed in mice with h2n2 influenza transmission rates of up to 60 among cagemates can be achieved after infection by the aerosol route and cocaging after 24 h schulman 1968 rats f344 and sd inoculated with rat-adapted h3n2 developed inflammatory infiltrates and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids but had no lethality and few histopathological changes daniels et al 2003 additionally an influenza transmission model has been developed in guinea pigs as an alternative to ferrets lowen et al 2006 cotton rats sigmodon hispidus have been used to test vaccines and therapeutics in a limited number of studies eichelberger et al 2004 cotton rats have an advantage over mice in that the immune system is similar to humans including the presence of the mx gene and influenza viruses do not have to be adapted eichelberger et al 2006 ottolini et al 2005 nasal and pulmonary tissues of cotton rats were infected with unregulated cytokines and lung viral load peaking at 24 h postexposure virus was cleared from the lung by day 3 and from the nares by day 66 but animals had bronchial and alveolar damage and pneumonia for up to 3 weeks there is also a s aureus superinfection model in cotton rats braun et al 2007a coinfection resulted in bacteremia high bacterial load in lungs peribronchiolitis pneumonitis alveolitis hypothermia and higher mortality domestic ferrets mustela putorius furo are frequently the animal species of choice for influenza animal studies because the susceptibility clinical signs peak virus shedding kinetics of transmission local expression of cytokine mrnas and pathology resemble that of humans lambkin et al 2004 maines et al 2012 mclaren and butchko 1978 like humans ferrets exclusively express neu5ac which acts as a receptor for influenza a virus a feature likely contributing to the susceptibility of ferrets to human-adapted influenza a virus strains ng et al 2014 the glycomic characterization of ferret respiratory tract tissues demonstrated some similarities and some differences to humans in terms of the potential glycan binding sites for the influenza virus jia et al 2014 ferrets also have airway morphology respiratory cell types and a distribution of influenza receptors sa 26 and sa 23 within the airways similar to that of humans van riel et al 2007 influenza was first isolated from ferrets infected in with throat washes from humans harboring the infection and ferret models have since been used to test efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic treatments huber et al 2008 lambkin et al 2004 maines et al 2012 when performing influenza studies in ferrets animals should be serologically negative for circulating influenza viruses infected animals should be placed in a separate room from uninfected animals if animals must be placed in the same room uninfected ferrets should be handled before infected ferrets anesthetized ferrets are experimentally exposed to influenza by in inoculation of 02505 ml containing approximately 104106 egg id50 dropwise to each nostril however a larger inoculum volume of 10 ml has also been explored as being more appropriate yielding more severe and consistent respiratory tract pathology likely because the larger inoculum is more widely distributed in the lower respiratory tract moore et al 2014 video tracking to assign values to activity levels in ferrets can aid ferret studies eliminating the need for collection of subjective and arbitrary clinical scores oh et al 2015 viral replication in the upper respiratory tract is typically measured by nasal washes but virus can also be measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using a noninvasive technique lee et al 2014 influenza types a and b naturally infect ferrets resulting in an acute illness which usually lasts 35 days for mild to moderately virulent strains maher and destefano 2004 ferrets are more susceptible to influenza a than influenza b strains and are also susceptible to avian influenza h5n1 strains without adaptation zitzow et al 2002 however the localized immune responses within the respiratory tract of ferrets infected with influenza a and b have been characterized and are similar carolan et al 2015 virulence and degree of pneumonitis caused by different influenza subtypes and strains vary from mild to severe and generally mirrors that seen in humans stark et al 2013 nonadapted h1n1 h2n2 and h3n2 have mild to moderate virulence in ferrets the sequencing of the ferret genome has allowed for the characterization of the ferret host response using rna-seq analysis peng et al 2014 distinct signatures were obtained depending on the particular influenza strain to inoculate the ferrets also helpful is the sequencing and characterization of the influenza ferret infectome during different stages of the infection in nave or immune ferrets leon et al 2013 since influenza infection is particularly devastating to the elderly population an aged ferret model of h1n1 influenza infection was developed paquette et al 2014 features associated with increased clinical disease are weakened hemagglutinin antibody generation and attenuated th1 responses pregnant and breastfeeding women and infants are also susceptible to more severe illness from influenza virus to study this dynamic a breastfeeding motherinfant ferret influenza infection model was created paquette et al 2015 notably the mammary gland itself harbored virus and transcript analysis showed downregulation of milk production genes in support of the development of therapies the ferret influenza model for pharmacokineticpharmacodynamics studies of antiviral drugs as also been developed reddy et al 2015 critical to this model is ensuring pronounced clinical signs and robust viral replication upon influenza infection strains of low virulence have predominant replication in the nasal turbinates of ferrets clinical signs and other disease indicators in ferrets are similar to that of humans with mild respiratory disease sneezing nasal secretions containing virus fever weight loss high viral titers and inflammatory infiltrate in the airways bronchitis and pneumonia svitek et al 2008 replication in both the upper and lower airways is associated with more severe disease and greater mortality additionally increased expression of proinflammatory mediators and reduced expression of antiinflammatory mediators in the lower respiratory tract of ferrets correlates with severe disease and lethal outcome h5n1-infected ferrets develop severe lethargy greater interferon response transient lymphopenia and replication in respiratory tract brain and other organs peng et al 2012 zitzow et al 2002 immunocompromised humans have influenza illness of greater duration and complications immunocompromised ferrets infected with influenza similarly had prolonged virus shedding van der vries et al 2013 interestingly antiviral resistance emerged in both humans and ferrets with immunocompromised status infected with influenza alveolar macrophage depleted of ferrets infected with 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza also had a more severe disease with greater viral replication in the lungs and greater induction of inflammatory chemokines kim et al 2013 a superinfection model resembling that of mice has been developed by in instillation of influenza in 6- to 8-week-old ferrets followed by in inoculation of s pneumonia 5 days later peltola et al 2006 this typically resulted in otitis media sinusitis and pneumonia transmission models in ferrets have recently met with worldwide media attention and controversy with regard to the study of h5n1 enserink 2013 fouchier et al 2012 herfst et al 2012 oh et al 2014 in general some subtypes such as the 2009 h1n1 can transmit easily through aerosol and respiratory droplets munster et al 2009 of concern h7n9 isolated from humans was more pathogenic and readily transmissible between ferrets by larger respiratory droplets and smaller particle aerosols kreijtz et al 2013 richard et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 h5n1 became transmissible by adopting just four mutations spreading between ferrets in separate cages imai et al 2012 transmission occurs more readily at the height of pyrexia but for the 2009 h1n1 in particular can occur before fever is detected roberts et al 2012 ferret-to-ferret transmission of a mouse-adapted influenza b virus has also been demonstrated kim et al 2015 since ferrets can be expensive and cumbersome influenza infection has been characterized and a transmission model developed in the guinea pig however this is a newer model with infrequent utilization thus far lowen et al 2014 old and new world primates are susceptible to influenza infection and have an advantage over ferret and mouse models which are deficient for h5n1 vaccine studies because there is a lack of correlation with hemagglutination inhibition murphy et al 1980 of old world primates cynomolgus macaque macaca fascicularis is most frequently utilized for studies of vaccines and antiviral drug therapies stittelaar et al 2008 h5n1 and h1n1 1918 infection of cynos is very similar to humans rimmelzwaan et al 2001 cynos develop fever and ards upon in inoculation of h5n1 with necrotizing bronchial interstitial pneumonia kuiken et al 2003 nhps are challenged by multiple routes ocular nasal and tracheal simultaneously 1  106 pfu per site virus antigen is primarily localized to the tonsils and pulmonary tissues infection of cynos with h5n1 results in fever lethargy nasal discharge anorexia weight loss nasal and tracheal washes pathologic and histopathologic changes and alveolar and bronchial inflammation the 1918 h1n1 caused a very high mortality rate due to an aberrant immune response and ards and had more than 50 lethality humans only had a 13 lethality kobasa et al 2007 ards and mortality also occur with the more pathogenic strains but nhps show reduced susceptibility to less virulent strains such as h3n2 odonnell and subbarao 2011 influenza-infected rhesus macaques represent a mild disease model for vaccine and therapeutic efficacy studies baas et al 2006 host microarray and qrt-pcr proved useful for analysis of infected lung tissues other nhp models include influenza infection of pigtailed macaques as a mild disease model and infection of new world primates such as squirrel and cebus monkeys baskin et al 2009 domestic pig models have been developed for vaccine studies for swine flu pigs are susceptible in nature as natural or intermediate hosts but are not readily susceptible to h5n1 isoda et al 2006 lipatov et al 2008 while pigs infected with influenza may have fever anorexia and respiratory signs such as dyspnea and cough mortality is rare van der laan et al 2008 size and space requirements make this animal difficult to work with although the development of minipig models may provide an easier to use alternative cat and dog influenza models have primarily been utilized to study their susceptibility to h5n1 with the thought that these animals could act as sentinels or could serve to transmit the virus to humans giese et al 2008 rimmelzwaan et al 2006 these models are not generally used to better understand the disease in humans or for testing vaccines or antivirals rift valley fever virus rvfv causes epizootics and human epidemics in africa rvfv mainly infects livestock such as sheep cattle goats etc after 24 days incubation period animals show signs of fever hepatitis and abortion which is a hallmark diagnostic sign known among farmers balkhy and memish 2003 mosquito vectors unpasteurized milk aerosols of infected animals body fluids or direct contact with infected animals are the important routes of transmission to humans abu-elyazeed et al 1996 mundel and gear 1951 after 2- to 6-day-incubation period rvfv causes a wide range of signs and symptoms in humans ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease with hepatitis vision loss encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever ikegami and makino 2011 laughlin et al 1979 peters and linthicum 1994 depending on the severity of the disease when the symptoms start 1020 of the hospitalized patients might die in 36 days or 1217 days after the disease onset ikegami and makino 2011 hepatic failure renal failure or dic and encephalitis are demonstrated within patients during postmortem examination live domestic animals especially sheep and goats were used to develop animal models of rvfv weingartl et al 2014 this study indicated that goats were more resistant to the disease compared to sheep the viremia in goats was lower and had a shorter duration with only some animals developing fever the susceptibility is influenced by route of infection breed of animals the rvfv strain and growth conditions as well as the passage history therefore it might be difficult to establish an animal model with domestic ruminants mice are one of the most susceptible animal species to rvfv infection several mouse models including balbc ifnar mbtpas 129 and c57bl6 were exposed to rvfv via parental or aerosol routes of infection ross et al 2012 subq or ip routes of infection cause acute hepatitis and lethal encephalitis at a late stage of the disease in mice mims 1956 smith et al 2010 mice start to show signs of decreased activity and ruffled fur by day 23 postexposure immediately following these signs they become lethargic and generally die 36 days postexposure ocular disease or the hemorrhagic form of the disease has not been observed in mouse models so far ikegami and makino 2011 increased viremia and tissue tropism were reported in mice with smith et al 2010 increased liver enzymes and lymphopenia observed in sick mice aerosolized rvfv causes faster and more severe neuropathy in mice compared to the parental route dodd et al 2014 reed et al 2014 the liver is a target organ following aerosol exposure and liver failure results in fatality rats and gerbils are also susceptible to rvfv infection the rats susceptibility is dependent on the rat strain utilized for the challenge model and route of exposure there is also noted age dependence in the susceptibility of rats while wistar-furth and brown norway strains and young rats are highly susceptible to rvfv infection fisher 344 buffalo and lewis strains and old rats demonstrated resistance to infection via subq route of infection findlay and howard 1952 peters and slone 1982 similar pathologic changes such as liver damage and encephalopathy were observed in both rats and mice the recent study by bales et al 2012 showed that aerosolized rvfv caused similar disease outcome in wistar-furth and aci rats while lewis rats developed fatal encephalitis which was much more severe than the subq route of infection there was no liver involvement in the gerbil model and animals died from severe encephalitis the mortality rate was dependent on the strain used and the dose given to gerbils anderson et al 1988 similar to the rat model the susceptibility of gerbils was also dependent on age natural history studies with syrian hamsters indicated that the liver was the target organ with highly elevated alt levels and viral titers scharton et al 2015 lethargy ruffled fur and hunched posture were observed in hamsters by day 2 post-subq inoculation and the disease was uniformly lethal by day 23 postexposure this model has been successfully used to test antivirals against rvfv scharton et al 2015 studies thus far showed that rvfv does not cause uniform lethality in a nhp model ip in iv and aerosol routes have been utilized to develop nhp model rhesus macaques cynomolgus macaques african monkeys and south american monkeys were some of the nhp species used for this effort peters et al 1988 monkeys showed a variety of signs ranging from febrile disease to hemorrhagic disease and mortality temporal viremia increased coagulation parameters pt aptt and decreased platelets were some other signs observed in nhps animals that succumbed to disease showed very similar pathogenesis to humans such as pathological changes in the liver and hemorrhagic disease there was no ocular involvement in this model smith et al compared iv in and subq routes of infection in common marmosets and rhesus macaques peng et al 2012 marmosets were more susceptible to rvfv infection than rhesus macaques with marked viremia acute hepatitis and late onset of encephalitis increased liver enzymes were observed in both species necropsy results showed enlarged livers in the marmosets exposed by iv or subq routes although there were no gross lesions in the brains of marmosets histopathology showed encephalitis in the brains of in challenged marmosets a recent study by hartman et al 2014 demonstrated that aerosolized rvfv only caused mild fever in cynomolgus macaques and rhesus macaques while agms and marmosets had encephalitis and succumbed to disease between days 9 and 11 postexposure in contrast to other lethal models the brain was the target organ in agms and marmosets although no change was observed in ast levels alp levels were increased in marmosets little or no change was observed in hepatic enzyme levels in agms lack of information regarding human disease concerning the aerosol route of exposure makes it difficult to evaluate these animal models crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv generally circulates in nature unnoticed in an enzootic tickvertebratetick cycle and similar to other zoonotic agents appears to produce little or no disease in its natural hosts but causes severe disease in humans cchfv transmits to humans by ixodid ticks direct contact with sick animalshumans or body fluids of animalshumans ergonul and whitehouse 2007 incubation prehemorrhagic hemorrhagic and convalescence are the four phases of the disease seen in humans the incubation period lasts 19 days during the prehemorragic phase patients show signs of nonspecific flu-like disease for approximately a week the hemorrhagic period results in circulatory shock and dic in some patients mardani and keshtkar-jahromi 2007 swanepoel et al 1989 over the years several attempts have been made to establish an animal model for cchf in adult mice guinea pigs hamsters rats rabbits sheep nhps etc fagbami et al 1975 nalca and whitehouse 2007 shepherd et al 1989 smirnova 1979 until recently the only animal that manifests disease is the newborn mouse infant mice ip infected with cchfv resulted in fatality around day 8 postinfection tignor and hanham 1993 pathogenesis studies showed that virus replication was first detected in the liver with subsequent spread to the blood serum virus was detected very late during the disease course in other tissues including the heart day 6 and the brain day 7 the recent studies utilizing knockout adult mice were successful to develop a lethal small animal model for cchfv infection bente et al 2010 bereczky et al 2010 bente et al infected stat1 knockout mice by the ip route in this model after the signs of fever leukopenia thrombocytopenia viremia elevated liver enzymes and proinflammatory cytokines mice were moribund and succumbed to disease in 35 days postexposure the second model was developed by using interferon alphabeta ifn receptor knockout mice ifnar bereczky et al 2010 similar observations were made in this model as in the stat1 knockout mouse model animals were moribund and died 24 days after exposure with high viremia levels in liver and spleen characterization studies with ifnarmice challenged with different routes ip in im and subq showed that cchfv causes acute disease with high viral loads pathology in liver and lymphoid tissues increased proinflammatory response severe thrombocytopenia coagulopathy and death all of which are characteristics of human disease zivcec et al 2013 proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as g-csf ifn cxccl10 ccl2 increased dramatically day 3 postchallenge and gm-csf il-1a il-1b il-2 il-6 il-12p70 il-13 il-17 cxcl1 ccl3 ccl5 and tnf- concentrations were extremely elevated at the time of deatheuthanasia this model is also utilized to test therapeutics such as ribavirin arbidol and t-705 favipiravir successfully oestereich et al 2014 experimental vaccines developed for cchf were evaluated in this model provided protection compare to unvaccinated mice buttigieg et al 2014 canakoglu et al 2015 p 725 thus the ifnar mouse model would be a good choice to test medical countermeasures against cchfv although they have an impaired ifn and immune response phenotype other laboratory animals including nhps show little or no sign of infection or disease when infected with cchfv nalca and whitehouse 2007 butenko et al utilized agms cercopithecus aethiops for experimental cchfv infections except one monkey with a fever on day 4 postinfection the animals did not show signs of disease antibodies to the virus were detected in three out of five monkeys including the one with fever fagbami et al 1975 infected two patas monkeys erythrocebus patas and one guinea baboon papio papio with cchfv whereas all three animals had low-level viremia between days 1 and 5 after inoculation only the baboon serum had neutralizing antibody activity on day 137 postinfection similar results were obtained when horses and donkeys have been used for experimental cchfv infections donkeys develop a low-level viremia rabinovich et al 1972 and horses developed little or no viremia but high levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies which remained stable for at least 3 months these studies suggest that horses may be useful in the laboratory to obtain serum for diagnostic and possible therapeutic purposes blagoveshchenskaya et al 1975 
shepherd et al 1989 infected 11 species of small african wild mammals and laboratory rabbits guinea pigs and syrian hamsters with cchfv whereas scrub hares lepus saxatilis cape ground squirrels xerus inauris red veld rats aethomys chrysophilus white-tailed rats mystromys pumilio and guinea pigs had viremia south african hedgehogs atelerix frontalis highveld gerbils gerbilliscus brantsii namaqua gerbils desmodillus auricularis two species of multimammate mouse mastomys natalensis and mastomys coucha and syrian hamsters were negative for virus all species regardless of viremia levels developed antibody responses against cchfv iv and intracranially infected animals showed onset of viremia earlier than those infected by the subq or ip routes the genus hantavirus is unique among the family bunyaviridae in that it is not transmitted by an arthropod vector but rather rodents schmaljohn and nichol 2007 rodents of the family muridae are the primary reservoir for hantaviruses infected host animals develop a persistent infection that is typically asymptomatic transmission is achieved by inhalation of infected rodent saliva feces and urine xu et al 1985 human infections can normally be traced to a rural setting with activities such as farming land development hunting and camping as possible sites of transmission rodent control is the primary route of prevention lednicky 2003 the viruses have a tropism for endothelial cells within the microvasculature of the lungs zaki et al 1995 there are two distinct clinical diseases that infection can yield hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs due to infection with old world hantaviruses or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps caused by new world hantaviruses nichol 2001 hfrs is mainly seen outside of the americas and is associated with the hantaviruses dobrava-belgrade also known as dobrava hantaan puumala and seoul lednicky 2003 incubation lasts 23 weeks and presents as flu-like in the initial stages that can further develop into hemorrhagic manifestations and ultimately renal failure thrombocytopenia subsequently develops which can further progress to shock in approximately 15 patients overall mortality rate is 7 infection with dobrava and hantaan viruses are typically linked to development of severe disease hps was first diagnosed in 1993 within southwestern united states when healthy young adults became suddenly ill progressing to severe respiratory distress and shock the etiological agent responsible for this outbreak was identified as sin nombre virus snv centers for disease control and prevention 1993 this virus is still the leading cause within north america of hps hps due to other hantaviruses has been reported in argentina bolivia brazil canada chile french guiana panama paraguay and uruguay padula et al 2000 stephen et al 1994 the first report of hps in maine was recently documented centers for disease control and prevention 1993 andes virus andv was first identified in outbreaks in chile and argentina this hantavirus is distinct in that it can be transmitted between humans wells et al 1997 the fulminant disease is more lethal than that observed of hfrs with a mortality rate of 40 there are four phases of disease including prodromal pulmonary cardiac depression and hematologic manifestation peters and khan 2002 incubation typically occurs 1417 days following exposure young et al 2000 unlike hfrs renal failure is not a major contributing factor to the disease there is a short prodromal phase that gives way to cardiopulmonary involvement accompanied by cough and gastrointestinal symptoms it is at this point that individuals are typically admitted to the hospital pulmonary function is hindered and continues to suffer within 48 h after cardiopulmonary involvement interstitial edema and air-space disease normally follow in fatal cases cardiogenic shock has been noted hallin et al 1996 syrian golden hamsters are the most widely utilized small animal model for hantavirus infection hamsters inoculated im with a passaged andes viral strain died within 11 days postinfection clinical signs did not appear until 24 h prior to death at which point the hamsters were moribund and in respiratory distress mortality was dose dependent with high inoculums leading to a shorter incubation before death during the same study hamsters were inoculated with a passaged snv isolate no hamsters developed any symptoms during the course of observation however an antibody response to the virus that was not dose dependent was determined via elisa hamsters infected with andv have significant histopathological changes to their lung liver and spleen all had an interstitial pneumonia with intraalveolar edema infectious virus could be recovered from these organs viremia began on day 8 and lasted up to 12 days postinfection infection of hamsters with andv yielded a similar clinical disease progression as is seen in human hps including rapid progression to death fluid in the pleural cavity and significant histopathological changes to the lungs and spleen a major deviation in the hamster model is the detection of infectious virus within the liver hooper et al 2001 normally snv does not cause a disease in hamsters wahl-jensen et al 2007 but a recent study showed that immunosuppression with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide in combination causes lethal disease with snv in hamsters brocato et al 2014 the disease was very similar to the disease caused by andv in hamsters lethal disease can be induced in newborn mice but does not recapitulate the clinical symptoms observed in human disease kim and mckee 1985 the disease outcome is very much dependent on the age of the mice younger mice are much more susceptible to virus than the adult mice adult mice exposed to hanta virus leads to a fatal disease dependent upon viral strain and route of infection the disease progression is marked by neurological or pulmonary manifestations that do not mirror human disease seto et al 2012 wichmann et al 2002 knockout mice lacking ifn are highly susceptible to hanta virus infection muller et al 1994 in a study of panel of laboratory strains of mice c57bl6 mice were most susceptible to a passaged hanta viral strain injected ip animals progressed to neurological manifestation including paralyses and convulsions and succumbed to infection within 2436 h postinfection clinical disease was markedly different from that observed in human cases wichmann et al 2002 in a recent study 2-week-old icr mice was exposed to htnv strain aa57 via the subq route seto et al 2012 mice started to show signs of disease by day 11 postinoculation piloerection trembling hunching loss of body weight labored breathing and severe respiratory disease were observed in mice studies to develop nhp models were not successful until recently nhps have been challenged with new world hantaviruses however no clinical signs were reported hooper et al 2006 mcelroy et al 2002 cynomolgus monkeys challenged with a clinical isolate of puumala virus developed a mild disease klingstrom et al 2002 sironen et al 2008 challenge with andv to cynomolgus macaques by both iv and aerosol exposure led to no signs of disease all animals did display a drop in total lymphocytes within 5 days postinfection four of six aerosol exposed monkeys and 8 of 11 iv injected monkeys developed viremia infectious virus could not be isolated from any of the animals in a recent study rhesus macaques were inoculated by the intramuscular route with snv passaged only in deer mice safronetz et al 2014 characteristics of hps disease including rapid onset of respiratory distress severe pulmonary edema thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis were observed in this promising model viremia was observed 410 days prior to respiratory signs of the disease that were observed on days 1416 postinoculation with all aspects this animal model would be very useful to test medical countermeasures against hanta virus the family arenaviridae is composed of two serogroups old world arenaviruses including lassa fever virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and the new world viruses of pichinde virus and junin virus all of these viruses share common clinical manifestations mccormick and fisher-hoch 2002 lassa fever virus is endemic in parts of west africa and outbreaks are typically seen in the dry season between january and april curtis 2006 this virus is responsible for 100000500000 infections per year leading to approximately 5000 deaths khan et al 2008 outbreaks have been reported in guinea sierra leone liberia nigeria and central african republic however cases have sprung up in germany netherlands united kingdom and the united states due to transmission to travelers on commercial airlines amorosa et al 2010 transmission of this virus typically occurs via rodents in particular the multimammate rat mastomys species complex curtis 2006 humans become infected by inhaling the aerosolized virus or eating contaminated food there has also been noted human-to-human transmission by direct contact with infected secretions or needle-stick injuries the majority of infections are asymptomatic however severe disease occurs in 20 of individuals the incubation period is from 5 to 21 days and initial onset is characterized by flu-like illness this is followed by diarrheal disease that can progress to hemorrhagic symptoms including encephalopathy encephalitis and meningitis a third of patients develop deafness in the early phase of disease that is permanent for a third of those affected the overall fatality is about 1 however of those admitted to the hospital it is between 15 and 25 there is no approved vaccine and besides supportive measures ribavirin is effective only if started within 7 days mccormick et al 1986a mccormick et al 1986b the primary animal model used to study lassa fever is the rhesus macaque jahrling et al 1980 aerosolized infection of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has been a useful model for lassa fever both rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys exposed to the virus developed disease but rhesus mirrored more closely the disease course and histopathology observed in human infection danes et al 1963 iv or intragastric inoculation of the virus led to severe dehydration erythematous skin submucosal edema necrotic foci in the buccal cavity and respiratory distress the liver was severely affected by the virus as depicted by measuring the liver enzymes ast and alt lukashevich et al 2003 disease was dose dependent with iv intramuscular and subq inoculation requiring the least amount of virus to induce disease aerosol infections and eating contaminated food could also be utilized and mimic a more natural route of infection peters et al 1987 within this model the nhp becomes viremic after 46 days clinical manifestations were present by day 7 and death typically occurred within 1014 days lukashevich et al 2004 rodas et al 2004 intramuscular injection of lassa virus into cynomolgus monkeys also produced a neurological disease due to lesions within the cns hensley et al 2011b this pathogenicity is seen in select cases of human lassa fever cummins et al 1992 gunther et al 2001 a marmoset model has recently been defined utilizing a subq injection of lassa fever virus virus was initially detected by day 8 and viremia achieved by day 14 liver enzymes were elevated and an enlarged liver was noted upon autopsy there was a gradual reduction in platelets and interstitial pneumonitis diagnosed in a minority of animals the physiological signs were the same as seen in fatal human cases carrion et al 2007 mice develop a fatal neurological disorder upon intracerebral inoculation with lassa although the outcome of infection is dependent on the mhc background age of the animal and inoculation route salvato et al 2005 stat1 knockout mice inoculated ip with both lethal and nonlethal lassa virus strains develop hearing loss accompanied by damage to the inner ear hair cells and auditory nerve yun et al 2015 guinea pig inbred strain 13 was highly susceptible to lassa virus infection the outbred hartley strain was less susceptible and thus strain 13 has been the preferred model given its assured lethality the clinical manifestations mirror those seen in humans and rhesus jahrling et al 1982 infection with pichinde virus passaged in guinea pigs has also been used disease signs include fever weight loss vascular collapse and eventual death lucia et al 1990 qian et al 1994 the guinea pig is an excellent model given that it not only results in similar disease pattern viral distribution histopathology and immune response to humans connolly et al 1993 katz and starr 1990 infection of hamsters with a cotton rat isolate of pirital virus is similar to what is characterized in humans and the nhp and guinea pig models the virus was injected ip resulting in lethargy and anorexia within 67 days virus was first detected at 3 days and reached maximum titers within 5 days neurological symptoms began to appear at the same time and all animals died by day 9 pneumonitis pulmonary hemorrhage and edema were also present sbrana et al 2006 these results were recapitulated with a nonadapted pichinde virus buchmeier and rawls 1977 gowen et al 2005 smee et al 1993 the lentiviruses are a subfamily of retroviridae which includes human immunodeficiency virus hiv a virus that infects 06 of the worlds population a greater proportion of infections and deaths occur in sub-saharan africa worldwide there are approximately 18 million deaths per year with over 260000 being children transmission of hiv occurs by exposure to infectious body fluids there are two species hiv-1 and hiv-2 with hiv-2 having lower infectivity and virulence confined mostly to west africa the vast majority of cases worldwide are hiv-1 de cock et al 2011 hiv targets t-helper cells cd4 macrophages dendritic cells fields et al 2007 acute infection occurs 24 weeks after exposure with flu-like symptoms and viremia followed by chronic infection symptoms in the acute phase may include fever body aches nausea vomiting headache lymphadenopathy pharyngitis rash and sores in the mouth or esophagus cd8 t-cells are activated which kill hiv-infected cells and are responsible for antibody production and seroconversion acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids develops when cd4 t-cells decline to less than 200 cellsl thus cell-mediated immunity becomes impaired and the person is more susceptible to opportunistic infections as well as certain cancers hiv has a narrow host range likely because the virus is unable to antagonize and evade effector molecules of the interferon response thippeshappa et al 2012 humanized mice created by engrafting human cells and tissues into scid mice have been critical for the development of mouse models for the study of hiv infection a number of different humanized mouse models allow for the study of hiv infection in the context of an intact and functional human innate and adaptive immune responses berges and rowan 2011 the scidhu hiv infection model has proven useful particularly in screening antivirals and therapeutics denton et al 2008 melkus et al 2006 a number of different humanized mouse models have been developed for the study of hiv including rag1c rag2c nodscidc hnog nodscidc hnsg nodscid blt and nodscidc hnsg blt karpel et al 2015 li et al 2015 shimizu et al 2015 cd34 human stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood or fetal liver are used for humanization baenziger et al 2006 watanabe et al 2007 hiv-1 infection by ip injection can be successful with as little as 5 peripheral blood engraftment berges et al 2006 vaginal and rectal transmission models have been developed in blt scid hu mice in which mice harbor human bone marrow liver and thymus tissue hiv-1 viremia occurs within approximately 7 days postinoculation zhang et al 2007 in many of these models spleen lymph nodes and thymus tissues are highly positive for virus similar to humans brainard et al 2009 importantly depletion of human t-cells can be observed in blood and lymphoid tissues of hiv-infected humanized mice and at least some mechanisms of pathogenesis that occur in hiv-infected humans also occur in the hiv-infected humanized mouse models baenziger et al 2006 neff et al 2011 the advantage of these models is that these mice are susceptible to hiv infection and thus the impact of drugs on the intended viral targets can be tested one caveat is that while mice have a common mucosal immune system humans do not due to differences in the distribution of addressins holmgren and czerkinsky 2005 thus murine mucosal immune responses to hiv do not reflect those of humans another strategy uses a human cd4- and human ccr5- expressing transgenic luciferase reporter mouse to study hiv-1 pseudovirus entry gruell et al 2013 hiv-1 transgenic tg rats are also used to study hiv related pathology immunopathogenesis and neuropathology lentz et al 2014 reid et al 2001 the clinical signs include skin lesions wasting respiratory difficulty and neurological signs brain volume decreases have been documented and the hiv-1 tg rat is thus used as a model of neuropathology in particular there are a number of important nhp models for human hiv infection hessell and haigwood 2015 an adaptation of hiv-1 was obtained by four passages in pigtailed macaques transiently depleted of cd8 cells during acute infection hatziioannou et al 2014 the resulting disease has several similarities to aids in humans such as depletion of cd4 t-cells kimata 2014 simian immunodeficiency virus siv infection of macaques has been widely used as a platform for modeling hiv infection of humans demberg and robert-guroff 2015 walker et al 2015 importantly nhps have similar pharmacokinetics metabolism mucosal t-cell homing receptors and vascular addressins to those of humans thus while the correlates of protection against hiv are still not completely known immune responses to hiv infection and vaccination are likely comparable these models mimic infection through use of contaminated needles iv sexual transmission vaginal or rectal and maternal transmission in utero or through breast milk keele et al 2009 miller et al 2005 stone et al 2009 there are also macaque models to study the emergence and clinical implications of hiv drug resistance van rompay et al 2002 these models most routinely utilize rhesus macaques macaca mulatta cynomolgus macaques m fasicularis and pigtailed macaques macaca nemestrina all ages are used depending on the needs of the study for instance use of newborn macaques may be more practical for evaluating the effect of prolonged drug therapy on disease progression however adult nhps are more frequently employed female pigtailed macaques have been used to investigate the effect of the menstrual cycle on hiv susceptibility vishwanathan et al 2015 studies are performed in bsl-2 animal laboratories and nhps must be simian type-d retrovirus free and siv seronegative siv infection of pigtailed macaques is a useful model for hiv peripheral nervous system pathology wherein an axotomy is performed and regeneration of axons is studied ebenezer et al 2012 exposure in model systems is typically through a single high-dose challenge iv infection of rhesus macaques with 100 tcid50 of the highly pathogenic sivdeltab670 induces aids in most macaques within 517 months mean of 11 months fuller et al 2012 peak viremia occurs around week 4 aids in such models is often defined as cd4 t-cells that have dropped to less than 50 of the baseline values alternatively repeated low dose challenges are often utilized depending on the requirements of the model henning et al 2014 moldt et al 2012 reynolds et al 2012 since nhps infected with hiv do not develop an infection with a clinical disease course similar to humans siv or sivhiv-1 laboratory-engineered chimeric viruses shivs are used as surrogates nhps infected with pathogenic siv may develop clinical disease which progresses to aids and are thus useful pathogenesis models a disadvantage is that siv is not identical to hiv-1 and is more closely related to hiv-2 however the polymerase region of siv is 60 homologous to that of hiv-1 and it is susceptible to many reverse transcriptase rt and protease inhibitors siv is generally not susceptible to nonnucleoside inhibitors thus hiv-1 rt is usually put into siv for such studies uberla et al 1995 sivmac239 is similar to hiv in the polymerase region and is therefore susceptible to nucleoside rt or integrase inhibition witvrouw et al 2004 nhps infected with sivmac239 have an asymptomatic period and disease progression resembling aids in humans characterized by weight losswasting cd4 t-cell depletion additionally sivmac239 utilizes the cxcr5 chemokine receptor as a coreceptor similar to hiv which is important for drugs that target entry veazey et al 2003 nhps infected with shiv strains may not develop aids but these models are useful in testing vaccine efficacy del prete et al 2014 for example rt-shivs and env-shivs are useful for testing and evaluation of drugs that may target the envelope or rt respectively uberla et al 1995 one disadvantage of the highly virulent env-shiv shiv-896 p is that it uses the cxcr4 coreceptor of note env-shivs that do use the cxcr5 coreceptor are less virulent viremia develops then resolves without further disease progression humbert et al 2008 simian-tropic st hiv-1 contains the vif gene from siv infection of pigtailed macaques with this virus results in viremia which can be detected for 3 months followed by clearance haigwood 2009 a number of routes are utilized for siv or shiv infection of nhps with iv inoculation the most common route mucosal routes include vaginal rectal and intracolonic mucosal routes require a higher one-time dose than the iv route for infection for the vaginal route female macaques are treated with depo-provera estrogen 1 month before infection to synchronize the menstrual cycle thin the epithelial lining of the vagina and increase susceptibility to infection by atraumatic vaginal instillation burton et al 2011 upon vaginal instillation of 500 tcid50 of shiv-162p3 peak viremia was seen around 12 days postexposure with greater than 107 copiesml and dropping thereafter to a constant level of 104 rna copiesml at 60 days and beyond in another example in an investigation of the effect of vaccine plus vaginal microbicide on preventing infection rhesus macaques were vaginally infected with a high dose of sivmac251 barouch et al 2012 an example of an intrarectal model utilized juvenile 2-year-old pigtailed macaques challenged intrarectally with 104 tcid50s of sivmne027 to study the pathogenesis related to the virulence factor vpx belshan et al 2012 here viremia peaked at approximately 10 days with more than 108 copiesml viral rna was expressed in the cells of the mesenteric lymph nodes the male genital tract is seen as a viral sanctuary with persistent high levels of hiv shedding even with antiretroviral therapy to better understand the effect of haart therapy on virus and t-cells in the male genital tract adult 3- to 4-year-old male cynomolgus macaques were intravenously inoculated with 50 aid50s of sivmac251 and the male genital tract tissues were tested after euthanasia by pcr ihc and in situ hybridization moreau et al 2012 pediatric models have been developed in infant rhesus macaques through the infection of siv allowing for the study of the impact of developmental and immunological differences on the disease course abel 2009 importantly mother-to-infant transmission models have also been developed jayaraman et al 2004 pregnant female pigtailed macaques were infected during the second trimester with 100 mid50 shiv-sf162p3 by the iv route four of nine infants were infected one in utero and three either intrapartum or immediately postpartum through nursing this model is useful for the study of factors involved in transmission as well as the underlying immunology nhps infected with siv or shiv are routinely evaluated for weight loss activity level stool consistency appetite virus levels in blood and t-cell populations cytokine and chemokine levels antibody responses and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte responses may also be evaluated the ultimate goal of an hiv vaccine is sterilizing immunity preventing infection however a more realistic result may be to reduce severity of infection and permanently prevent progression strategies have included live attenuated nonreplicating and subunit vaccines these have variable efficacy in nhps due to the genetics of the host mhc and trim alleles differences between challenge strains and challenge routes letvin et al 2011 nhp models have led to the development of antiviral treatments that are effective at reducing viral load and indeed transmission of hiv among humans one preferred variation on the models for testing the long-term clinical consequences of antiviral treatment is to use newborn macaques and treat from birth onward in some cases more than a decade van rompay et al 2008 unfortunately however successes in nhp studies do not always translate to success in humans as seen with the recent step study which used an adenovirus-based vaccine approach buchbinder et al 2008 vaccinated humans were not protected and may have even been more susceptible to hiv viremia was not reduced and the infections were not attenuated as hoped with regard to challenge route iv exposure is more difficult to protect than mucosal exposure and is used as a worst case scenario however efficacy at one mucosal route is usually comparable to other mucosal routes human and animal papillomaviruses cause benign epithelial proliferations warts and malignant tumors of the various tissues that they infect bosch and de sanjose 2002 there are over 100 human papillomaviruses with different strains causing warts on the skin oropharynx nasopharynx larynx and anogenital tissues approximately one third of papillomaviruses are transmitted sexually of these virulent subtypes such as hpv-16 hpv-18 hpv-31 hpv-33 and hpv-45 place individuals at high risk for cervical and other cancers up to 35 of head and neck cancers are caused by hpv-16 particularly oropharyngeal cancers major challenges in the study of these viruses are that papillomaviruses generally do not infect any other species outside of the natural hosts and can cause a very large spectrum of severity thus no wild-type animal models have been identified that are susceptible to hpv however a number of useful surrogate models exist which use animal papillomaviruses in their natural host or a very closely related species borzacchiello et al 2009 brandsma 1994 campo 2002 these models have facilitated the recent development of useful and highly effective prophylactic hpv vaccines rabenau et al 2005 wild-type inbred mice cannot be used to study disease caused by papillomaviruses unless they are engrafted with relevant tissue orthotopically transplanted or transgenic but they are often used to look at immunogenicity of vaccines jagu et al 2011 oosterhuis et al 2011 transgenic mice used for hpv animal modeling typically express the viral oncogenes e5 e6 e7 or the entire early region of hpv-16 from the keratin 14 promoter which is only active in the basal cells of the mouse epithelium chow 2015 cancers in these models develop upon extended estrogen exposure maufort et al 2010 ocadiz-delgado et al 2009 stelzer et al 2010 thomas et al 2011 transgenic mice with constitutively active wntb-catenin signaling in cervical epithelial cells expressing the hpb oncoprotein e7 develop invasive cervical squamous carcinomas bulut and uren 2015 the tumors occur within 6 months approximately 94 of the time another model uses c57bl6 mice expressing the hpv16-e7 transgene which are then treated topically with 712-dimethylbenzaanthracene dmba de azambuja et al 2014 these mice developed benign and malignant cutaneous lesions cervical cancers can also be induced in human cervical cancer xenografts transplanted onto the flanks of athymic mice and serially transplanted thereafter hiroshima et al 2015 siolas and hannon 2013 a wild-type immunocompetent rodent model uses m coucha which is naturally infected with mastomys natalensis papillomavirus mnpv vinzon et al 2014 mnpv induces papillomas keratoacanthomas and squamous cell carcinomas and provides a means to study vaccination in an immunocompetent small animal model wild cottontail rabbits sylvilagus floridanus are the natural host for cottontail rabbit papillomavirus crpv but this virus also infects domestic rabbits oryctolagus cuniculus which is a very closely related species breitburd et al 1997 in this model papillomas can range from cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas on one end of spectrum and spontaneous regression on the other lesions resulting from crpv in domestic rabbits do not typically contain infectious virus canine oral papillomavirus copv causes florid warty lesions in mucosa of the oral cavity within 48 weeks postexposure in experimental settings johnston et al 2005 the mucosatrophic nature of these viruses and the resulting oropharyngeal papillomas that are morphologically similar to human vaginal papillomas caused by hpv-6 and hpv-11 make this a useful model nicholls et al 1999 these lesions typically spontaneously regress 48 weeks after appearing this model is therefore useful in understanding the interplay between the host immune defense and viral pathogenesis male and female beagles aged 10 weeks to 2 years with no history of copv are typically used for these studies infection is achieved by application of a 10 l droplet of virus extract to multiple 05 cm2 scarified areas within the mucosa of the upper lip of anesthetized beagles nicholls et al 2001 some investigators have raised concerns that dogs are not a suitable model for high-risk hpv-induced oral cancer staff 2015 bovine papillomavirus bpv has a wider host range than most papillomaviruses infecting the fibroblasts cells of numerous ungulates campo 2002 bpv-4 infection of cattle feeding on bracken fern which is carcinogenic can result in lesions of the oral and esophageal mucosa that lack detectable viral dna bpv infections in cattle can result in a range of diseases such as skin warts cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract and urinary bladder and papillomatosis of the penis teats and udder finally rhesus papillomavirus rhpv a sexually transmitted papillomaviruses in rhesus macaques and cynomolgus macaques is very similar to hpv-16 and is associated with the development of cervical cancer ostrow et al 1990 wood et al 2007 monkeypox virus mpxv causes disease in both animals and humans human monkeypox which is clinically almost identical to ordinary smallpox occurs mostly in the rainforest of central and western africa the virus is maintained in nature in rodent reservoirs including squirrels charatan 2003 khodakevich et al 1986 mpxv was discovered during the pox-like disease outbreak among laboratory monkeys mostly cynomolgus and rhesus macaques in denmark in 1958 no human cases were observed during this outbreak the first human case was not recognized as a distinct disease until 1970 in zaire the present drc with continued occurrence of a smallpox-like illness despite eradication efforts of smallpox in this area during the global eradication campaign extensive vaccination in central africa decreased the incidence of human monkeypox but the absence of immunity in the generation born since that time and increased dependence on bush meat have resulted in renewed emergence of the disease in the summer of 2003 a well-known outbreak in the midwest was the first occurrence of monkeypox disease in the united states and western hemisphere among 72 reported cases 37 human cases were laboratory confirmed during an outbreak nalca et al 2005 sejvar et al 2004 it was determined that native prairie dogs cynomys sp housed with rodents imported from ghana in west africa were the primary source of outbreak the virus is mainly transmitted to humans while handling infected animals or by direct contact with the infected animals body fluids or lesions person-to-person spread occurs by large respiratory droplets or direct contact jezek and fenner 1988 most of the clinical features of human monkeypox are very similar to those of ordinary smallpox breman and arita 1980 after a 7- to 21-day-incubation period the disease begins with fever malaise headache sore throat and cough the main sign of the disease that distinguishes monkeypox from smallpox is swollen lymph nodes lymphadenitis which is observed in most of the patients before the development of rash di giulio and eckburg 2004 jezek and fenner 1988 a typical maculopapular rash follows the prodromal period generally lasting 13 days the average size of the skin lesions are 051 cm and the progress of lesions follows the order macules papules vesicles pustules umblication then scab and desquamation and lasts typically 24 weeks the fatality rate is 10 among the unvaccinated population and death generally occurs during the 2nd week of the disease jezek and fenner 1988 nalca et al 2005 mpxv is highly pathogenic for a variety of laboratory animals and many animal models have been developed by using different species and different routes of exposure table 333
 due to unavailability of variola virus smallpox to develop animal models and similar disease manifestations in humans that are similar mpxv is one of the pox viruses that are utilized very heavily to develop a number of small animal models via different routes of exposure wild-derived inbred mouse stat1-deficient c57bl6 mouse icr mouse prairie dogs african dormice ground squirrels and gambian pouched rats are highly susceptible to mpxv by different exposure routes americo et al 2010 falendysz et al 2015 hutson et al 2009 osorio et al 2009 sbrana et al 2007 schultz et al 2009 sergeev et al 2016 stabenow et al 2010 tesh et al 2004 xiao et al 2005 casteij mice one of the 38 inbred mouse strains tested for susceptibility to mpxv showed weight loss and dose dependent mortality after in exposure to mpxv studies with ip route of challenge indicated a 50-fold higher susceptibility to mpxv when compared to in route americo et al 2010 scid-balbc mice were also susceptible to the ip challenge route and the disease resulted in mortality on day 9 postinfection osorio et al 2009 similarly c57bl6 stat1 mice were infected in with mpxv and the infection resulted in weight loss and mortality 10 days postexposure recently sergeev et al 2016 showed that in challenge of icr mice with mpxv resulted in purulent conjunctivitis blepharitis and ruffled fur in these mice although there was no death the mouse models mentioned here are very promising for screening therapeutics against poxviruses but testing in additional models will be required for advanced development high doses of the mpxv by ip or in routes caused 100 mortality in 6 days postexposure and 8 days postexposure respectively in ground squirrels tesh et al 2004 the disease progressed very quickly and most of the animals were lethargic and moribund by day 5 postexposure without any pox lesions or respiratory changes a comparison study of usa mpxv and central african strain of mpxv strains in ground squirrels by the subq route resulted in systemic disease and mortality in 611 days postexposure the disease resembles hemorrhagic smallpox with nosebleeds impaired coagulation parameters and hemorrhage in the lungs of the animals another study by sergeev et al 2017 showed that in challenge with mpxv caused fever lymphadenitis and skin rash in ground squirrels 79 days postexposure mortality was observed in 40 of the animals 1322 days postexposure sergeev et al 2017 since mpxv was transmitted by infected prairie dogs in the us outbreak this animal model has been more thoroughly studied and utilized to test therapeutics and vaccines compared to other small animal models hutson et al 2009 keckler et al 2011 smith et al 2011 xiao et al 2005 studies using in ip and id routes of exposure showed that mpxv was highly infectious to prairie dogs ip infection with the west african mpxv strain caused a more severe disease and 100 mortality than challenge by the in route anorexia and lethargy were common signs of the disease for both exposure routes in contrast to ip route the in route of exposure caused severe pulmonary edema and necrosis of lungs in prairie dogs while splenic necrosis and hepatic lesions were observed in ip-infected animals xiao et al 2005 hutson et al 2009 utilized in and id infections with west african and congo basin strains and showed that both strains and routes caused smallpox-like disease with longer incubation periods and most importantly generalized pox lesions therefore this model has the utility for testing therapeutics and vaccines against pox viruses furthermore mpxv challenged prairie dogs were used to perform in vivo bioluminescent imaging bli studies falendysz et al 2015 bli studies showed real time spread of virus in prairie dogs as well as potential routes for shedding and transmission the african dormouse is susceptible to mpxv by a footpad injection or in routes schultz et al 2009 mice had decreased activity hunched posture dehydration conjunctivitis and weight loss viral doses of 200 and 2000 pfu provided 100 mortality with a mean time to death of 8 days upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage hepatomegaly lymphadenopathy and lung hemorrhage were observed during necropsy with the hemorrhage in several organs this model resembles hemorrhagic smallpox in a recent study comparison of the disease pathogenesis was performed by using live bioluminescence imaging in the casteij mouse and african dormouse challenged with low dose of mpxv earl et al 2015 following in challenge mpxv dissemination occurred through the blood or lymphatic system in dormice compared to dissemination that was through the nasal cavity and lungs in casteij mice the disease course was much faster in casteij mice earl et al 2015 considering the limited availability of prairie dogs ground squirrels and african dormice lack of reagents specific for these species and not having commercial sources of these species these small animal models are as attractive for further characterization and vaccine and countermeasure testing studies nhps were exposed to mpxv by several different routes to develop animal model for mpxv edghill-smith et al 2005 johnson et al 2011 nalca et al 2010 stittelaar et al 2006 zaucha et al 2001 during our studies using an aerosol route of exposure we observed that macaques had mild anorexia depression fever and lymphadenopathy on day 6 postexposure nalca et al 2010 complete blood count and clinical chemistries showed abnormalities similar to human monkeypox cases with leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia huhn et al 2005 whole blood and throat swabs had viral loads peak around day 10 and in survivors gradually decrease until day 28 postexposure since doses of 4  104 pfu 1  105 pfu or 1  106 pfu resulted in lethality for 70 of the animals whereas a dose of 4  105 pfu resulted in 85 lethality survival was not dose dependent the main pitfall of this model was the lack of pox lesions with the high dose animals succumbed to disease before developing pox lesions with the low challenge dose pox lesions were observed but they were few in comparison to the iv model a recent study also evaluated the cytokine levels in aerosol challenged animals tree et al 2015 tree et al 2015 showed that ifn il-1r and il-6 increased dramatically on day 8 postexposure the day that death was most likely to occur and viral dna was detected in most of the tissues these results support the idea of a cytokine storm causing mortality in monkeypox disease mpxv causes dose dependent disease in nhps when given by the iv route johnson et al 2011 studies showed that a 1  107 pfu iv challenge results in systemic disease with fever lymphadenopathy macula-papular rash and mortality an it infection model skips the upper respiratory system and deposits virus into the trachea delivering the virus directly to the airways without regard to particle size and the physiological deposition that occurs during the process of inhalation fibrinonecrotic bronchopneumonia was described in animals that received 107 pfu of mpxv intratracheally stittelaar et al 2006 although a similar challenge dose of it mpxv infection resulted in a similar viremia in nhps to the aerosol route of infection the timing of the first peak was delayed by 5 days in intratracheally exposed macaques compared to aerosol infection and the amount of virus detected by qpcr was approximately 100-fold lower this suggests that local replication is more prominent after aerosol delivery compared to the it route an intrabronchial route of exposure resulted in pneumonia in nhps johnson et al 2011 delayed onset of clinical signs and viremia were observed during the disease progression in this model similar to aerosol and it infection models the number of pox lesions was much less than in the iv infection model a major downside of the iv it and intrabronchial models is that the initial infection of respiratory tissue incubation and prodromal phases are circumvented with the direct inoculation of virus to the blood stream or to the lung this is an important limitation when the utility of these models is to test possible vaccines and treatments in which the efficacy may depend on protecting the respiratory mucosa and targeting the subsequent early stages of the infection which are not represented in these challenge models although the aerosol model is the natural route of transmission for human varv infections and a secondary route for human mpxv infections the lack of pox lesions is the main drawback of this model therefore when this model is used to test medical countermeasures the endpoints and the biomarkers to initiate treatment should be chosen carefully hepatitis b virus hbv is one of the most common infections worldwide with over 400 million people chronically infected and 316000 cases per year of liver cancer due to infection lee 1997 the virus can naturally infect both humans and chimpanzees guha et al 2004 hbv is transmitted parenterally or postnatally from infected mothers it can also be transmitted by sexual contact iv drug use blood transfusion and acupuncture lai et al 2003 the age at which one is infected dictates the risk of developing chronic disease hyams 1995 acute infection during adulthood is self-limiting and results in flu-like symptoms that can progress to hepatocellular involvement as observed with the development of jaundice the clinical symptoms of hbv infection last for a few weeks before resolving ganem and prince 2004 after this acute phase lifetime immunity is achieved wright and lau 1993 of those infected less than 5 will develop the chronic form of the disease chronicity is the most serious outcome of the disease as it can result in cirrhosis or liver cancer hepatocellular carcinoma is 100 times more likely to develop in a chronically infected individual than a noncarrier beasley 1988 the viral determinant for cellular transformation has yet to be determined although studies involving the woodchuck hepatitis virus suggest that x protein may be responsible spandau and lee 1988 many individuals are asymptomatic until complications emerge related to chronic hbv carriage chimpanzees have a unique strain that circulates within the population hu et al 2000 macdonald et al 2000 it was found that 36 of all wild-caught animals from africa are positive for hbv antigen lander et al 1972 natural and experimental challenge with the virus follows the same course as human disease however this is only an acute model of disease prince 1972 to date chimpanzees are the only reliable method to ensure that plasma vaccines are free from infectious particles prince and brotman 2001 this animal model has been used to study new therapeutics and vaccines chimpanzees are especially ideal for these studies given that their immune response to infection directly mirrors humans nayersina et al 1993 recent regulations by the national institute of health nih and restrictions to use great apes as animal models forced researches to find alternate models for hbv infection other nhps that have been evaluated are gibbons orangutans and rhesus monkeys although these animals can be infected with hbv none develops hepatic lesions or liver damage as noted by monitoring of liver enzymes pillot 1990
 mice are not permissible to infection and thus numerous transgenic and humanized lines that express hbv proteins have been created to facilitate their usage as an animal model these include both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts the caveat to all of these mouse lines is that they reproduce only the acute form of disease guha et al 2004 recently the entire genome of hbv was transferred to an immunocompetent mouse line via adenovirus this provides a model for persistent infection huang et al 2012 another model that has been developed is hydrodynamic injection of hbv genomes in the liver of mice liu et al 1999 yang et al 2002 although this model is very stressful to mice and has liver toxicity it is successfully used to evaluate antivirals against hbv mccaffrey et al 2003 liver chimeric mouse models are an additional set of surrogate models for hbv infection dandri and lutgehetmann 2014 in these models human hepatocytes are integrated into the murine liver parenchyma allweiss and dandri 2016 this model might be used to test antivirals as well as to study the molecular biology of hbv infection hbv can also be studied using surrogate viruses naturally occurring mammalian hepadna viruses mason et al 1982 the woodchuck hepatitis virus induces hepatocellular carcinoma summers et al 1978 within a population 6575 of all neonatal woodchucks are susceptible to chronic infection cote et al 2000 a major difference between the two hepatitis isolates is the rate at which they induce cancer almost all chronic carriers developed hepatocellular carcinoma within 3 years of the initial infection in woodchucks whereas human carcinogenesis takes much longer gerin et al 1989 the acute infection strongly resembles what occurs during the course of human disease there is a self-limiting acute phase resulting in a transient viremia that has the potential of chronic carriage tennant 2001 challenge with virus in neonates leads to a chronic infection while adults only develop the acute phase of disease buendia 1992 a closely related species to the woodchuck is the marmota himalayan this animal is also susceptible to the woodchuck hepadna virus upon iv injection the marmot himalayan develops an acute hepatitis with a productive infection lucifora et al 2010 hepatitis d virus hdv is dependent upon hbv to undergo replication and successful infection in its human host gerin 2001 there are two modes of infection possible between the viruses coinfection where a person is simultaneously infected or superinfection in which a chronic carrier of hbv is subsequently infected with hdv purcell et al 1987 coinfection leads to a similar disease as seen with hbv alone however superinfection can result in chronic hdv infection and severe liver damage guilhot et al 1994 both coinfection and superinfection can be demonstrated within the chimpanzee and woodchuck by inoculation of human hepatitis d ponzetto et al 1991 a recently published report demonstrated the use of a humanized chimeric upa mouse to study interactions between the two viruses and drug testing lutgehetmann et al 2012 new models ranging from nhps to small animals and representing the disease characteristics in humans are necessary to study viral and host factors that drive disease pathogenesis and evaluate medical countermeasures the ideal animal model for human viral disease should closely recapitulate the spectrum of clinical symptoms and pathogenesis observed during the course of human infection whenever feasible the model should use the same virus and strain that infects humans it is also preferable that the virus is a low passage clinical isolate thus animal passage or adaptation should be avoided if model species can be identified that are susceptible ideally the experimental route of infection would mirror that occurs in natural disease in order to understand the interplay and contribution of the immune system during infection an immunocompetent animal should be used the aforementioned characteristics cannot always be satisfied however and often virus must be adapted knockout mice must be used andor the disease is not perfectly mimicked in the animal model well-characterized animal models are critical for licensure to satisfy fda animal rule this rule applies to situations in which vaccine and therapeutic efficacy cannot safely or ethically be tested in humans thus licensure will come only after preclinical tests are performed in animal models many fields in virology are moving toward standardized models that can be used across institutions to test vaccines and therapeutics a current example of such an effort is within the filovirus community where animal models euthanasia criteria assays and virus strains are in the process of being standardized the hope is that these efforts will enable results of efficacy tests on medical countermeasures compared across institutions this chapter has summarized the best models available for each of the viruses described opinions interpretations conclusions and recommendations are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by the us army
  emergence of novel coronavirus and covid-19 whether to stay or die out asim biswas uttaran bhattacharjee alok chakrabarti kumar devendra tewari nath hasina banu shanta dutta   towards the end of the first decade of the 21st century during december 2019 numerous pneumonia incidences of unidentified cause appeared in wuhan hubei china with clinical presentations greatly resembling flu and viral pneumonia after virus isolation and analysis of viral genome sequence from infected patients samples a novel coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 initially designated as novel coronavirus or ncov-2019 was identified from an unknown source sars-cov-2 is the causative agent of respiratory disease which is recently named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organisation who human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 is a major concern for the health care workers and a preliminary r0 reproductive number as the number of new infection one infected person generates on average throughout its infectious period measure of 1425 was reported by the who httpswwwwhointhealth-topicscoronavirus since its appearance within a months time enormous number of new cases are piling up and the actual r0 value may be quite higher than previously calculated wu et al 2020 epidemiological data suggest that approximately as of february 29 2020 79251 people infected with this virus in mainland china and multiple cases also reported from other parts of the world httpswhosprinklrcomhttpswwwmedpagetodaycominfectiousdiseasepublichealth84698 so far 60 other countries reported sars-cov-2 infection although most of the cases are migrants of china indicating a single introduction of this virus among the other countries south korea 3150 cases italy 889 cases japan 234 cases iran 388 cases singapore 96 cases hongkong 94 cases and usa 64 cases reported significant number of cases and the situation is getting complicated with time current findings indicate that various subtypes of coronaviruses are in circulation within the bat population including other species such as birds cats dogs pigs mice horses whales before they acquire the ability to cross the species barriers to cause human infection it is still unanswered that how sars-cov-2 has caused an outbreak in wuhan the initial wave of infection found associated with the seafood market of wuhan strengthening the hypothesis that close contact between the live or dead animal with an individual may be responsible for the initiation of the outbreak in the recent past there are examples of zoonotic transmission of bird flu which directly jumped from avian species to human but no transmission between the humans were established which kept the disease under control however the ability to spread among human to human upon close contact makes sars-cov-2 as a very important contagious agent to study and monitor whose devastation has already been established in wuhan hubei china covid-19 is one of the most alarming diseases in the globe at this moment the number of patients infected with sars-cov-2 is increasing in almost steady rate although in some days less number of cases was reported total number of cases reached to 20000 in first 12 days 40000 in next 7 days and more than 80000 in just 33 days infections are causing varied clinical manifestation from mild symptoms to severe respiratory attacks although there is possibility of asymptomatic infection it has spread in many other countries beyond china therefore proper handling and management of the disease is critically important to prevent a pandemic history has taught several lessons regarding the endemic nature of emerging viral infections virus faces major challenges from pre-existing immunity to remain in the population other important factors such as case fatality rate cfr r0 and the reservoir hosts are crucial in influencing viral endemicity by analysing cfr of different rna viruses and their longevity in circulation throughout the globe it was found that viruses with higher cfr cfr 5 die out after few passages of infections sooner or later whereas viruses with low cfr remain endemic with a seasonal outbreak like common flu caused by influenza viruses figure 1 although it is very difficult to calculate actual cfr until the outbreak ends an initial estimate suggests that cfr for sars-cov-2 is 258 much closer to seasonal flu than the other coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov of the recent past ie 10 and 35 respectively httpswwwwhointemergenciesmers-coven indicating the ability of the sars-cov-2 to remain in circulation with low cfr throughout the world as per the recent data covid-19 has already claimed 2924 lives mainly in china although few deaths reported from other parts of the world however as of february 29 2020 39556 infected individuals already recovered from sars-cov2 infection who will eventually acquire immunity to the virus httpswwwmedpagetodaycominfectiousdiseasepublichealth84698 the covid-19 recovered population increases day by day with herd immunity of the population a virus may re-infect a person with pre-existing immunity either in its present form which is very unlikely or with acquired mutations to persist in the circulation sars-cov-2 recovered populations may enable the selection of mutant viruses and their spread in the community in this review we will discuss the critical factors influencing the continued viral appearance and periodical infection we will also discuss the novelty of this virus and its potential threat to cause periodic infection we have collected data from different studies and also analysed the genome sequence to define the evolutionary relationship of this virus moreover we have predicted the reason for the severity of this disease with literature support coronaviruses are enveloped and belongs to the family coronaviridae which is further subdivided into four genera alpha beta gamma and delta coronaviruses woo et al 2007 lefkowitz et al 2018 they possess a long positive-sense single-stranded rna genome ranging between 264 kb to 317 kb which is largest for any rna virus big rna genome of coronavirus provides additional flexible power in host adaptation and genome modification the genome organisation is overall same in all coronaviruses figure 2 two short untranslated regions utr are present at the 5 and 3 end of the genome and the coding genes are present in between the utr the arrangement of the coding gene is 5-replicase orf1ab spike s envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n3 however variable numbers of additional orfs are present in between spike and nucleocapsid genes in different strains of coronaviruses the transcription regulatory motif trs is present at the 3 end of the genome which plays an important role in rna replication and recombination lai et al 1985 the complete genome size of the sars-cov-2 is approximately 29 kb 29825 nt-29903ntthe orf1ab gene is the largest gene segment of the coronavirus and it constitutes two orf ie orf1a and orf1b the position of the orf1ab gene in sars-cov-2 251-21541 nt slightly changes to starting codon position as compared to sars-cov 265-21486 nt and mers-cov 279-21514 generally a slippery sequence uuuaaac followed by a putative pseudoknot structure sequence is present in between the orfs the replicase orf1ab is cleaved by papain-like protease plpro and 3 c-like protease 3clpro the orf1ab gene of the coronavirus genome encodes1516 non-structural proteins nsp at the consensus cleavage site the nsp 12 and nsp 13 encode the rna-dependent rna polymerase and helicase protein respectively the newly emerging sars-cov-2 possesses a single point mutation at a slippery sequence a haemagglutinin esterase he gene is present downstream to orf1ab and upstream to the s gene which is absent in coronaviruses infecting humans three surface glycoproteins are found in all classes of coronaviruses ie spike s envelope e and membrane m the s proteins are type i membrane glycoproteins responsible for the formation of spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses the s proteins are cleaved into the receptor binding s1 domain and cell membrane fusion s2 domains the sars-cov-2 s2 domain represents higher identity with bat derived coronavirus strains than the s1 domain therefore the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 is more similar to that of sars-cov 2002-03 and it has found that it uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as cellular receptor lu et al 2020 however some key amino acid substitution at positions 439 501 493 485 and 486 were observed in the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain those were thought to be important in sars-cov lu et al 2020 the e and m genes are conserved among all the coronaviruses these two genes encode two small transmembrane proteins associated with the envelope of all coronaviruses the coronavirus nucleocapsid n protein is a virion structural protein the n protein interacts with the viral genomic rna and helps in packaging of rna genome into virus particles by recognising a specific sequence the n protein-dependent assembly of the viral rna packaging signal is already established in sars-cov intracellular co-localization of n with replicase components is required for rna synthesis variable numbers of small orfs are present between the various conserved genes downstream to the n gene the 3a protein of sars-cov modulates virus release by forming a transmembrane homotetramer complex within channel protein other than the virus release the 3a protein helps in sars-cov-induced cell death golgi fragmentation and the accumulation of intracellular vesicles like the sars-cov and mers-cov the sars-cov-2 virus possesses several other small orfs orf9 orf13 orf14 orf10 at the downstream to n gene marra et al 2003 the function of the n gene and small orfs of sars-cov-2 is not yet known before the emergence of sars-cov in 2002 construction of phylogenetic tree for coronaviruses based on the pol or n gene was a standard practice using this method initially sars-cov was proposed as a member of gammacoronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 however further analysis of the amino-terminal domain of the spike protein of the sars-cov revealed that 19 out of the 20 cysteine residues was spatially conserved within the betacoronavirus group rota et al 2003 on the other hand only five residues were found conserved within the alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus group rota et al 2003 furthermore the subsequent whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis concluded that sars-cov is a member of the betacoronavirus lineage phylogenetic analysis based on rdrp gene of sars-cov-2 revealed that it belongs to the genus betacoronavirus eickmann 2003 we have constructed a phylogenetic tree of the sars-cov-2 based on available sequences in genbank and gisaid data bank figure 3 phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene of the sars-cov-2 represents that it belongs to the genus betacoronaviruses from the analysis of the sequences published since the emergence of sars-cov-2 it is evident that this virus is stably spreading without any noticeable mutation as they are clustered in a single group analysis from the phylogenetic tree represents that all the sars-cov-2 strains are distinctly separated from previously reported coronavirus endemic strains sars-cov and mers-cov hence the sars-cov-2 is termed as novel coronavirus analysis performed in our study also revealed that this virus is very similar to the bat derived coronavirus strain the sars-cov-2 and bat derived yunnanratg132013 coronavirus strain derived from common ancestor although they differs in in the size of the spike genes spike gene size in ratg133809 bp sars-cov-23822bp since sars-cov and mers-cov also derived from the bat bat originated human infecting coronavirus strain is not a novel event as shown in earlier studies that sars-cov and mers-cov used civets and camel respectively as an intermediate host to gain infection potentiality towards human guan et al 2003 alagaili et al 2014 it may be predicted that in case of sars-cov-2 transmission there may be one or more intermediate host present in between bats and human previous cases of human coronavirus infection commenced by sars-cov and mers-cov was accountable for severe pneumonia leading to high mortality the mechanistic explanation of their high morbidity and mortality is inadequately explained rapid virus replication reaching to high titres and associated enhanced inflammation is believed to be a cause of disease severity initial data from china shows that the sars-cov-2 produced observable symptoms primarily ards acute respiratory distress syndrome in elderly populations similar to human cases of h7n9 infection in china table 1 an earlier study with h7n9 infection also found the clinical exhibition of disease with high fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics chen et al 2013 a recent study on sars-cov-2 infection showed that all the 41 patients had pneumonia and manifestations of a critical respiratory ailment similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and was associated with icu admission and high mortality huang et al 2020 it is known that coronaviruses such as human sars-cov and bat sars-like cov sl-covzxc21 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor and recent reports suggest that sars-cov-2 also uses the identical receptor for entry into the host cell zhou et al 2020 ace2 is an essential enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system ras that plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining electrolyte and fluid homeostasis ace2 also protects an individual against severe acute lung damage that can be triggered by sepsis acid aspiration severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the lethal avian influenza a h5n1 and h7n9 virus infection kuba et al 2005 yang et al 2014 zou et al 2014 moreover recent studies have shown that ace2 negatively regulates inflammatory responses during bacterial or viral infections yang et al 2014 sodhi et al 2019 sars-cov-2 infection utilizes ace2 for viral attachment and subsequent entry into cytosol therefore rapid replication of sars-cov-2 may reduce the surface expression of ace2 in the lung tissue which may cause further intensification of the inflammation and severity of the disease pathology glowacka et al 2010 figure 4 a recent study have found that smoking is associated with higher expression of ace2 when compared with the non-smokers which may be one of the reasons of some population for the vulnerability towards novel sars-cov-2 infection liu et al 2017 cai 2020 the pathophysiology of disease outcome depends on the extent of inflammatory responses within the host in absence of any specific antiviral drugs the primary therapeutic strategy to treat sars-cov-2 infection should be managing the inflammatory responses with anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids previous studies on sars patients have found a positive outcome when treated with corticosteroids chen et al 2006 who recommendations for managing this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection discourage the application of corticosteroids the explanation for not using corticosteroids could be delayed viral clearance from the respiratory tract or blood with other corticosteroid-induced complications in the treated patients previously infected with sars and mers lee et al 2004 arabi et al 2018 russel et al 2020 during the pandemic in 2009 of influenza a infection a prospective cohort study showed reduced mortality in patients with h1n1 pdm09 viral pneumonia when treated with mild doses of corticosteroid li et al 2017 therefore these disparities in findings suggest that randomized controlled trials must be carried out to conclude the beneficial effect of corticosteroid medication in coronavirus-induced inflammation associated difficulties however doctors from the chinese thoracic society have recommended the application of corticosteroids to critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia with a low to moderate dose 051 mgkg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent for short term 7 days zhao et al 2020 viruses face potent challenges from the host pre-existing immunity before they establish periodical infection the role of pre-existing immunity broadly studied for influenza virus infection biswas et al 2020 host immunity also allows the selection of mutant viruses to cause a new round of infection within the host with pre-existing immunity towards the earlier strains if the sars-cov-2 can withstand the new mutations and remains flexible to infect its host towards disease progression it will persist in circulation the primary wave of sars-cov-2 infection is under progress at present the majority of the exposed population will acquire some immunity eventually and the real hurdles for the viruses to defeat or bypass existing immunity will reflect with the acquired mutations within the virus in future to defeat host immunity viruses must mutate without losing their infectivity so far there are no published data regarding infection ability of sars-cov-2 and their mutation potential under robust immunological selection pressure within the host previous data from sars-cov and mers-cov infected individuals indicated that antibody response tends to be short-lived but remain longer depending on the severity of the infection t cell responses often target highly conserved internal proteins and are long-lived channappanavar et al 2014 alshukairi et al 2016 sars-cov-specific memory t cells but not memory b cells or antibody could be detected six years after infection in sars survivors tang et al 2011 in conclusion these studies present some ideas regarding selection pressure from the host immunity ie milder coronavirus infection may produce a short-lived humoral immune response as of february 29 2020 sars-cov-2 infected 85406 people and the infection turns into fatality for more than 2924 cases however as per the available data 39561 individual got recovered after infection percent recovery from this population indicates that  93 of the population already recovered from sars-cov2 infection this percentage was calculated as below within infected population total no recoveredtotal no of recovered  total no of death it can be predicted that at least 93 of the total population which may likely to go higher with the end of this outbreak will develop immunity towards this novel virus so far there is no vaccine available although in future vaccinated individual will also acquire some immunity the possibility of the future outbreak by sars-cov-2 will depend on the longevity of host immunity and bypassing of existing or pre-existing immunity by the mutant virus figure 5 the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases critically depend on reservoir hosts which can sustain the pathogen with a moderate or asymptomatic infection in the population even in the presence of resistance from primary hosts coronaviruses are found widely within bat pig cow and several other species previous reports also suggest that this virus is also presents in birds molecular phylogenetic analysis performed in this study showed that neighbouring virus to sars-cov-2 was from bats with 96 similarity suggesting novelty of sars-cov-2 we dont know how this virus mutated and its time frame however recent estimates with bedfords analysis predicted that sars-cov-2 and ratg13 derived from a common ancestor sometimes between 25 and 65 years ago httpswwwsciencemagorgnews202001mining-coronavirus-genomes-clues-outbreak-s-origins these observations are indicative of the existence of intermediate host or reservoir before the sars-cov-2 gained entry into the human population figure 4 it is utmost important to find out its intermediate host to control the ongoing and future outbreak based on the gene bank data apart from the lung and oropharyngeal fluid this virus also isolated from faces and blood this observation represents that sars-cov-2 transmitted through droplet and human to human might be through the orofecal route but immune-pathogenesis of this novel virus is probably different from the previous endemic strain of coronaviruses the faecal oral route is very common in birds for transmission of avian viruses migratory birds play a very important role in the dissemination of avian influenza viruses from different parts of the globe during seasonal migrations bailey et al 2018 coronaviruses such as human sars-cov and bat sars-like cov sl-covzxc21 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor and recent reports suggest that sars-cov-2 also uses the same receptor for entry into the host cell we have compared the ace2 gene from avian species and the data suggest conservation of amino acids of ace2 protein within most of the birds data not shown we examined the interacting residues of the receptor-binding domain rbd of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 with critical residues of ace2 from different species from human poultry gallus gallus mallard anasplatyrhynchos swan goose ansercygnoidesdomesticus shelduck tadornacana and we found limited amino acids conservation in comparison to human counterpart table 2 moreover there is no experimental proof for betacoronavirus like sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in the birds although a recent study has shown the significant presence of alpha and gammacoronaviruses in ducks shorebirds and herons in australia chamings et al 2018 these observations allow us to believe that the birds are less prone to betacoronavirus infection or the least chance of bird infection from betacoronaviruses significantly the bird poses alpha and gammacoronaviruses that are incompetent to infect a human hence the risks of spread of the sars-cov-2 through bird to human are very unlikely at its present form qinghai lake in china is one of the biggest breeding sites for different migratory bird species there may be a possibility that this novel virus may acquire the ability to infect other animals including the migratory birds therefore it is extremely important to find out the reservoir of this novel coronavirus within the other animals including the migratory birds if there are any figure 6 one of the most worrying things about any outbreak is the spreading of viruses from mild or asymptomatic individuals which is probably happening in case of sars-cov-2 infection if this trend continues then the virus may establish itself in the population and quarantine will be very difficult to stop the virus spread phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene nucleotide sequence performed in this study has shown that all the sars-cov-2 sequences are forming a single cluster without any branching indicating sars-cov-2 conservation throughout this ongoing outbreak earlier studies have shown that spike protein was a target of a robust humoral immune response in case of sars or mers viral infection these findings advocate that virus that caused the initial outbreak of sars-cov-2 is still in circulation without any major changes very little or absence of pre-existing immunity in the community or selection pressure within the population probably allowed sars-cov-2 to remain in circulation in its original form moreover sars-cov-2 has very limited cfr as opposed to sars-cov and mers-cov without killing its host table 1 will able to produce new virus particles alongside some mutations till now most of the deaths have occurred in the elderly population due to novel coronavirus infection whereas children and young adults exhibit relatively milder disease therefore sars-cov-2 infection will enable the host to develop humoral and cell-mediated immunity and simultaneously the immune selected viruses may acquire mutations with higher infection potential or altered antigenicity this will likely empower them to evade pre-existing immunity towards their predecessor counterpart in the host during the subsequent waves of infection as depicted in figure 1 current estimates based on the available information suggest that more than 93 individual have recovered from this novel coronavirus infections the virus may adapt itself to produce infection within the recovered population in future to sustain its presence in the environment the ability of the virus to cause infection in the host with pre-existing immunity will be the most important criteria to establish itself in the circulation the recovered population may keep under monitor to find if any reinfection leads to the creation of any mutant strain due to the selection pressure therefore we must prepare ourselves for mutant strains of this novel virus to avoid future devastation since there is no antiviral and vaccine to fight against sars cov-2 a vaccine or therapeutics is a primary need at this moment currently several companies have started preparing vaccines for this novel virus although efficacy will depend on the selection of antigen and the viruss ability to bypass the vaccine-induced immunity we must look at the conservation among different epitopes in immune selected strains while choosing the right vaccine candidates structurally spike protein carries rbd like haemagglutinin ha of the influenza virus with a similar function we must look at the amino acid conservation in different domain of the spike protein mutation in the immune dominance region of the vaccine candidate will make them ineffective for future outbreaks recently physicians from china are urging recovered patients to donate plasma which may be useful to protect covid-19 something like a 100 years old practice during 1918 flu in case of pandemic 1918 influenza infection three waves of infection killed more than 50 million worldwide in two years where the second wave was the most devastating the first wave of the 1918 flu pandemic flu had resembled common flu epidemics people most at risk were the weak and elderly while younger healthier people recovered easily apparently resembling covid-19 in its present form most of the studies have found an analogy between covid-19 and influenza disease pathophysiology time will tell us whether sars-cov-2 and associated covid-19 will be established as the new flu of 21st century  patterns of mortality during pandemic an example of spanish flu pandemic of 1918 natalia gavrilova s leonid gavrilov a   currently the worlds attention is focused on the news of the coronavirus pandemic right now it is difficult to assess the true extent of this pandemic since the number of infected people depends on the number of tests performed and the number of deaths from coronavirus depends on the specifics of cause-of-death registration in each particular country or even region for this reason many researchers analyzing the influenza epidemics do not analyze mortality from a specific cause but rather mortality from all causes since it is almost impossible to make a mistake in the fact of death the coronavirus pandemic is not the first pandemic in human history or even the first pandemic in the last 200 years the most famous and deadly is the 1918 spanish flu pandemic viboud and lessler 2018 in the post-war years the 196970 influenza pandemic was also causing significant losses not only among the elderly which are usually observed during regular influenza epidemics but also at middle ages rizzo et al 2007 in this paper we consider the patterns of mortality during the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 using the data for italy and the usa these countries are currently leading in the number of persons infected with covid-19 an analysis of mortality in 1918 and the adjacent years may help us to better understand the course and scale of the current pandemic statistical yearbooks published shortly after 1918 in the respective countries were used as a data source for italy these are primarily ministro di agricultura industrie e commercio maic direzione generale della statistica dirstat maic 1924 1925a 1925b for the us data we used vital statistics rates in the united states 19001940 edition bureau of the census 1943 the age-specific mortality rates for the italian population are taken from the human mortality database human mortality database first consider the trends of mortality rate in 19161919 in italy and the usa figure 1 shows the values of crude death rates per 1000 population by calendar year for italy you can see that mortality rose sharply in 1918 but in subsequent years it fell quite rapidly the crude death rate in pre-war 1913 is given for comparison because of significant war losses in italy in 19161918 in 1919 mortality already returned to the pre-war values a similar pattern is observed for mortality trends in 19161920 in the united states see figure 2 as in the case of italy in the united states there was a surge of mortality in 1918 and a fairly rapid drop of mortality in 1919 however it is well known that the spanish flu epidemic passed in waves and the first cases of flu were recorded in the united states in march 1918 and the second deadly peak of the spanish flu was observed in the fall of 1918 to better understand the development of the spanish flu epidemic in 1918 and 1919 it makes sense to consider changes of mortality from all causes by month monthly mortality changes in 1918 and 1919 in italy are shown in figure 3 it follows from the figure that the acute phase of the spanish flu epidemic was observed in the fall of 1918 with a surge of mortality in october by april 1919 this elevated mortality wave totally disappeared at the same time the spring peak of the spanish flu epidemic in 1918 had practically no effect on the total mortality figure 4 shows monthly mortality changes in italy for 19161919 it follows from the figure that the spanish flu spring wave had little effect on total mortality which was almost the same in the first half of 1918 as in the previous two years however an increased number of deaths from influenza spanish flu was reported in italy in 1919 and even in 1920 see figure 5 figure 6 shows monthly mortality changes in the united states in this figure one can see a slight increase in mortality in the spring of 1918 which looks insignificant compared to the peak of mortality observed in october as in the case of italy a decrease in mortality to normal levels occurred by april 1919 figures 4 and 6 show that the acute phase of the pandemic with very high mortality lasted from one to two months but a complete mortality decline to normal levels took about eight months now consider age-specific mortality changes in 19171919 in the case of current coronavirus pandemic it is observed that older people are more likely to die from coronavirus than younger ones this observation is not surprising the analysis of mortality italy in 19692001 demonstrated that older people die more often during regular flu epidemics rizzo et al 2007 however during the 19691970 pandemic the excess mortality was observed not only at older but also at middle ages rizzo et al 2007 the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 differs from other flu epidemics by significant relative increase of mortality at middle ages figure 7 shows the age-specific mortality rates for italian women in 19171919 the figure for italian men is not given here due to significant war losses in 19171918 distorting the age-specific mortality pattern figure 7 shows a significant increase in mortality between the ages of 15 and 60 years during the spanish flu pandemic in 1918 in 1919 an increased mortality rate among middle-aged women was also observed while after the age of 65 mortality does not change at the same time we cannot say that mortality at older ages was unaffected by epidemic figure 8 shows age-specific mortality of women after age 65 in italy in 19171919 it can be seen that the spanish flu epidemic has added an additional mortality increment in 1918 to already high mortality rate at old age effect of the spanish flu epidemic on mortality can also be analyzed using time series of mortality data with the method of latent variables gavrilovet al 2017 gavrilova and gavrilov 2011 to this aim we conducted a factor analysis of mortality over the period of 19002014 we used so-called p-technique of factor analysis when the analysis occurs across different time points or observations values of hazard rates at different years for ages 25 through 85 we applied factor analysis procedure with promax rotation method using the stata release 13 statistical package we identified two factors capable of explaining almost 98 of the variance in the temporal changes of hazard rates thus mortality evolution in italy can be described by the following model
xt0x1xf1t2xf2t
where x is age t is time x 1x 2x are three sets of parameters depending on age only while f1t and f2t are two sets of parameters depending on time only sets of coefficients determined by factor analysis models by studying the variation of these factors over time we noted that the first factor  comparable to the senescent mortality gavrilov and gavrilova 1991 willmoth 1997 and chiefly concerning the old ages population  remained remarkably stable over a period of 19001950 see figure 9 the second factor  comparable to the background mortality gavrilov and gavrilova 1991 and observed in the young population  declined from the beginning of the century figure 9 shows the trends in background and age-related senescent mortality factors in italy in this figure peaks of background mortality are noticeable in 1918 the epidemic of spanish flu and in the 1940s world war ii this figure shows that in italy the effect of the spanish flu epidemic on mortality was even stronger than the effect of hostilities during the world war ii it is also seen that subsequent influenza epidemics did not have a noticeable impact on background mortality the data presented here clearly demonstrate that the spanish flu pandemic cannot be compared to the later flu epidemics and pandemics of influenza by its effect on mortality a distinctive feature of the 1918 pandemic was a high percentage of deaths among young and middle-aged people with a relatively low increase in mortality among the elderly studies have shown that this phenomenon was observed among the population of europe and the united states but in the more remote regions of latin america and the pacific islands the mortality of the elderly from the spanish flu was even higher than at younger ages it is believed that exposure to influenza viruses in childhood could have a protective effect in the elderly in europe and the usa during the 1918 pandemic simonsen et al 2018 returning to the epidemic of coronavirus it should be noted that there is a certain similarity in the damage to respiratory system produced by the coronavirus and the spanish flu virus including acute respiratory distress syndrome cilek et al 2018 right now we can do only preliminary estimates regarding the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on total mortality the italian institute of statistics instituto nazionale di statistica regularly publishes the number of deaths from all causes for some municipalities on its website wwwistatit according to these data during the period from march 1 to march 28 2020 29565 people died in the studied municipalities of italy during the same period of 2019 14603 people died in the same municipalities thus the number of deaths in the studied municipalities of italy in march 2020 doubled for comparison the death toll in italy in october 1918 the peak of the epidemic was five times higher than in october 1917 in the united states mortality in october 1918 was 36 times higher than in october 1917 these data suggest that the coronavirus epidemic must be taken seriously yet the coronavirus epidemic has significant differences from the spanish flu epidemic the main difference is that the group with the highest risk of death from coronavirus is mainly elderly people with burden of chronic diseases although deaths of healthy middle-aged adults also occur mortality at older ages is highly seasonal mainly due to seasonal influenza epidemics rosano et al 2019 therefore the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on mortality can be better assessed by studying the entire set of data on seasonal mortality including data for 2020 which are currently insufficient one can only assume that the coronavirus epidemic is likely to lead to a parallel upward shift in mortality for ages over 20 years in semi-log coordinates similar to what happened during the spanish flu epidemic for ages over 60 years fig 8 some optimism is inspired by the fact that the acute period of the spanish flu epidemic with unusually high mortality did not last long  one to two months it should be remembered that the waves of the epidemic continued after 1918 until 1920 but their impact on the total mortality was negligible therefore we can hope that in the case of coronavirus pandemic the acute phase heralded by mortality surge will not last long  utilization of the respiratory virus multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for adult patients at a korean tertiary care center mi ahn young seong-ho choi jin-won chung hye kim ryoun   in pediatric patients respiratory viruses rvs are considered important pathogens in acute respiratory tract infections resulting in hospitalization and acute care visits 123 for which diagnostic evaluations for rvs are frequently performed 4 however diagnostic evaluations for rvs are rarely performed in adult patients because such viruses cause only benign respiratory tract infections 4 recently with the advent of more sensitive molecular techniques clinical cases of pneumonia associated with variable rvs have been reported with increasing frequency in adult patients 56 the importance of rvs in adult patients has also been emphasized with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome avian influenza a h5n1 and pandemic influenza h1n1 in 2009 3 in the near future rv detection tests may be considered an essential part of the diagnostic work-up for adult patients with acute respiratory tract infections however physicians treating adult patients are not yet familiar with rv detection tests we investigated the current utilization of a multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test for rvs in adult patients in clinical practice the multiplex rt-pcr test allows the detection of a large number of rvs simultaneously with a higher sensitivity than viral culture 7 we hypothesized that utilization data and results from current multiplex rt-pcr tests would be helpful in identifying the benefits and problems associated with multiplex rt-pcr utilization in adult patients this study was performed at chung-ang university hospital an 850-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in seoul republic of korea adult patients  16 years of age who underwent multiplex rt-pcr testing between january 2012 and april 2013 were identified and their electronic medical records and chest radiographs reviewed demographic characteristics underlying diseases multiplex rt-pcr results the presence of respiratory symptoms and clinical outcomes were investigated an upper respiratory infection uri was defined as the presence of  1 of the following respiratory symptoms cough sputum production rhinorrhea sore throat and dyspnea pneumonia was defined as the presence of a new or progressive infiltrate on chest radiography plus two or more of the following symptoms or signs fever sputum production rhinorrhea sore throat dyspnea and the attending physicians diagnosis of pneumonia a nonrespiratory infection nri was defined as neither a uri nor pneumonia if a patient had an episode of acute infection within 2 days after admission and underwent multiplex rt-pcr testing for the episode he or she was considered to have received a test for a community-acquired infection the flu season was defined as between january and april in 2012 and between january and april in 2013 the flu season was determined based on the weekly surveillance reports for influenza and other respiratory viruses of the korea centers for disease control and prevention 8

performed for 5890 nasopharyngeal swab samples and bacterial cultures were performed for 38195 respiratory samples in the study hospital thus the frequency of multiplex rt-pcr testing was only 49 of rapid influenza antigen detection tests and 08 of respiratory bacterial cultures the mean turnaround time for the 81 positive multiplex rt-pcr tests was 661 hours sd 242 range 204 to 1197 a turnaround

characteristics of the 166 patients with pneumonia four duplicates excluded who underwent multiplex rt-pcr testing were compared according to pathogen type table 3 approximately one quarter of these patients had an rv infection 265 44166 and a bacterial infection 241 40166 respectively nine patients 54 9166 had bacterialviral coinfections the remaining 91 patients 548 had no identified pathogen in patients with an rv infection 20 had rvs other than influenza 2044 454 patients with a single rv infection and those without an rv infection did not differ in terms of their baseline characteristics underlying diseases symptoms and in-hospital mortality except that rhinorrhea was more frequently observed in patients with a single rv infection during the flu season in patients coinfected with an rv and a bacterium rsv and hematologic malignancy were more common features than in patients infected with a single rv the in-hospital mortality rates were higher in patients with a bacterialviral coinfection 889 than in those without an rv infection 164 and with a single rv infection 114 multiplex rt-pcr testing was performed primarily for adult patients with community-acquired respiratory infections admitted to a tertiary care center during the flu season and especially for patients with pneumonia the test was performed infrequently and the test results were often reported late the rv-positive rate 286 for community-acquired infections was not different from that for hospital-acquired infections 239 p  052 rvs were identified in more than a quarter 265 of the 166 patients with pneumonia nearly half of the patients with rv-associated pneumonia had rvs other than influenza 2044 454 in our hospital multiplex rt-pcr testing was most frequently performed for adult patients with community-acquired respiratory infections admitted during the flu season thus the test was primarily used to diagnose influenza in adult patients especially those with pneumonia for clinicians who experienced the influenza a h1n1 pandemic in 2009 the use of multiplex rt-pcr as a diagnostic test for influenza infection is understandable at other hospitals the perception of multiplex rt-pcr testing by physicians may be similar given the predominance of influenza among rvs and the presence of effective anti-influenza therapies 9 therefore the multiplex rt-pcr test should be performed to diagnose influenza during the flu season especially considering the low sensitivity of rapid influenza antigen detection tests 9 however in our hospital the multiplex rt-pcr test was performed infrequently compared to rapid influenza antigen detection tests additionally the test was rarely performed in outpatient departments at the study hospital these findings are understandable given that the test results are not available on-site unlike the rapid influenza antigen detection test moreover the test is not covered by national health insurance of south korea and is relatively expensive more than 100000 krw compared to the cost of a respiratory bacterial culture 21619 krw or the rapid influenza antigen detection test 18000 to 28000 krw consequently infrequent ordering resulted in less routine pcr testing in the clinical laboratory not every day but three times a week at our hospital this may explain why a turnaround time of  48 hours was observed in only 259 of the positive tests forty-eight hours is the most appropriate time period for the introduction of anti-influenza drugs after the onset of symptoms 9 considering these problems and the continuous threat of influenza infection our current utilization of multiplex rt-pcr testing requires improvement which may increase the diagnostic sensitivity for influenza and decrease the number of patients who receive delayed therapy in our study the rv positivity rate for community-acquired infections did not differ from that for hospital-acquired infections there were no differences in viral pathogens between community- and hospital-acquired infections in a recent study of viral infections in patients with severe pneumonia requiring intensive care unit admission patients with community-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia had similar rates of rv positivity 406 vs 343 and similar rv pathogens 6 regarding these findings experts suggest that rv infections are not directly influenced by previous healthcare interventions or exposure to antimicrobial agents but rather they mirror circulating viruses in the community 10 although hospital-acquired infections and healthcare-associated infections are different a similar explanation may be applied to our findings considering the frequent detection of rvs in our patients with a hospital-acquired infection multiplex rt-pcr testing should not be limited to patients with community-acquired respiratory infections the test may be required for patients with serious hospital-acquired respiratory infections of unknown cause based on our study findings the test may be needed for hospital rv infection control 4 although the turnaround time may not be optimal for that purpose the causal role of rvs other than influenza has not been determined in adult patients with pneumonia and effective treatment with antiviral agents is largely unavailable in clinical practice thus the detection of rvs other than influenza may be regarded as unnecessary for adult patients with pneumonia especially during the non-flu season considering the fact that the multiplex rt-pcr test represented only 08 of sputum bacterial culture tests however clinical studies of pneumonia associated with rvs other than influenza have reported increased infection rates in both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients 35611121314 additionally a few antiviral agents are recommended for severe pneumonia caused by rvs other than influenza especially in immunocompromised patients 315 in this study although most of the tests were performed for the diagnosis of influenza infection during the flu season rvs other than influenza were found in 454 2044 of the patients with rv-associated pneumonia furthermore in more than half 69 of the patients with a bacterialviral coinfection rvs other than influenza including rsv hmpv and hrv were detected this group of coinfected patients had higher rates of mortality than either the group with a single rv infection or the group without an rv infection although the association with higher mortality may be due to more serious underlying diseases such as hematologic malignancy 222 and the impact of bacterial infections in this group the significance of rvs other than influenza should not be neglected the clinical significance of rsv hmpv and hrv in adult patients with pneumonia has recently been reported 16171819 our study suggests that rvs other than influenza should be considered in adult patients with pneumonia and that the clinical impact of these rvs should be evaluated in future clinical studies in our study 203 of patients with an nri had positive multiplex rt-pcr test results the clinical presentation of an rv infection may vary according either to the pathogenic potential of the rv or the degree of host immunity against rvs and respiratory symptoms or signs in some patients with an rv infection may be minimal or absent asymptomatic carriers of rvs are another possible explanation as suggested in a previous study 11 this study has several limitations first it was not designed to compare the clinical management outcomes and medical costs of patients who underwent multiplex rt-pcr testing with patients who did not thus our study does not include direct evidence for the clinical usefulness of the multiplex rt-pcr test for rvs prior studies have shown conflicting results for the cost-effectiveness of the multiplex rt-pcr test 4 additional studies are required before the multiplex rt-pcr test for rvs can be strongly recommended in south korea second the platform for multiplex rt-pcr testing was changed during the study period which might have affected the multiplex rt-pcr results and the positivity rates however the rv7 test was performed only in 240 of 291 cases third clinical data were retrospectively collected unrecognized clinical factors may have resulted in biases in the study analysis fourth our data cannot be generalized to other centers with different characteristics in conclusion the multiplex rt-pcr test was performed most frequently for adult patients admitted for community-acquired respiratory infections during the flu season at a tertiary care center the test was performed infrequently and reporting of the test results was often delayed the utilization of multiplex rt-pcr testing should be encouraged to more effectively diagnose infections with influenza and other rvs both inside and outside the hospital  a randomized controlled trial of low-dose recombinant human interferons -2b nasal spray to prevent acute viral respiratory infections in military recruits lulu gao shouyi yu qing chen zhaojun duan jie zhou chen mao dexian yu wenchang zhu jun nie yunde hou   acute respiratory tract infections are flourishing in closed and crowded environments military recruits are prone to outbreaks of acute respiratory tract infections because of their crowded living conditions in barracks stressful work environments frequent travels and exposure to novel strains of respiratory pathogens 1 2 3 over 90 of acute respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses such as influenza virus parainfluenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rhinovirus adenovirus and coronavirus though most of viral respiratory infections usually represent mild self-limited clinical manifestations they are leading causes of morbidity in certain groups or populations eg children military population and remain a heavy burden of disease 4 5 in history the famous spanish influenza initiated from army recruits in 1916 6 in 1976 the novel anew jersey76 hsw1n1 influenza virus caused severe respiratory illness in soldiers at fort dix 1 adenoviruses have been the most important cause of febrile acute respiratory disease in us military recruit populations 7 in china a comprehensive surveillance systems for influenza in military population showed that the average incidence of influenza was 14 episode per person-year from 1995 to 2000 8 viral respiratory infections have become one of the most actual health problems in military population therefore it is necessary to seek reasonable and effective measures to prevent outbreaks and epidemics of acute viral respiratory infections among military population interferons ifns are a family of cytokine mediators that are critically involved in alerting the cellular immune system to viral infections of host cells 9 the previous studies have suggested that high dosage of intranasal interferons can prevent respiratory infections caused by viruses such as influenza virus rhinovirus coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus 10 11 12 13 14 however the major problem is higher frequency of local side effects such as mucosal irritation dry mucous membranes blood-tinged mucus and nasal mucosal erosion 15 16 17 recently yuance medicine company beijing china has developed a low-dose recombinant human interferon -2b rifn-2b nasal spray in order to reduce adverse reactions to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new nasal spray in preventing acute respiratory infections in military population we performed this randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial from november 2005 to december 2005 we did a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind multi-center trial in the military trainees from 12 recruit training units in three geographically distinct cities in china guangzhou city and foshan city in guangdong province liuzhou city in guangxi province candidate subjects were male recruits who aged 1623 years and finished army physical fitness examination they were not admitted to the study if any of the following criteria were present 1 on regular medical treatment or took other medications within two weeks 2 history of serious allergies eg asthma urticaria and eczema 3 history of autoimmune disorders 4 psychiatric disorders and 5 acute or chronic illnesses all candidates were observed two weeks before enrolling into the study in order to screen eligible subjects a total of 1500 trainees from three areas enrolled the trial initially after the screening had been completed 1449 eligible recruits remained in the subject pool all participants understood the implications of the study and provided informed consents the study was conducted during the basic training period of new military recruits at 12 recruit training units located in different districts there were 120150 new recruits in each independent training unit all the trainees lived in barracks during a three-month training eight to 10 recruits shared a quarters room about 30 m2 participants in the experimental group received the rifn-2b nasal sprays the metered spray device delivered 01 ml 3  105
 iu of rifn-2b per spray into each nostril and throat that was a total of 9  105
 iu of rifn-2b for each administration the spray delivered twice daily after breakfast and supper respectively for five consecutive days the control group was given placebo in the manner identical to the experimental group the placebo contained components which were similar to the drug except rifn-2b participants were given instructions on when and how to use the sprays each nostril and pars laryngea pharyngis should be sprayed with breathing deeply the rifn-2b nasal spray and placebo were stored at 48 c at health clinics of training units all subjects were followed up and observed for clinical signs and manifestations of respiratory infections for 10 days local symptoms eg sore throat dry pharynx cough nose running sneezing nose congestion systemic symptoms eg malaise myalgia headache nausea abdominal pain diarrhea and axillary temperature were recorded daily during the observed period severe adverse reactions such as allergy epistaxis and nasal mucosa erosion or complications should be reported immediately once the adverse reactions had occurred subjects would stop the experiment and be given suitable treatments assuming a 18 viral respiratory infections attack rate in the group that received placebo and a 8 attack rate in the group that received rifn-2b nasal spray based on the data obtained from our preliminary studies and assuming that sufficient data would be collected for 90 of the cases to be included in the according-to-protocol population we calculated that a sample of 508 recruits per group would provide more than 90 power to demonstrate the superiority of the rifn-2b nasal spray at a significant difference level of 001 two tailed a list of random numbers allocating to the each spray canister was determined via computer-generated randomization the generation of randomized numbers and labeling of the spray canisters were performed by the third party national institute for viral disease control and prevention china center for disease control and prevention of this study participants were sequentially allocated to the treatments in the order in which they were recruited ie the first person who was eligible for inclusion was given spray number 1 the second one spray number 2 and so on when allocated each participants name was added to the label details on the spray container the sequence was concealed until the data were analyzed both participants and researchers were blind to group assignment once accuracy of the data were confirmed the database would be forwarded to the statistician who only at this time was supplied with the randomized list case report forms crf consisted of subject demographics data medical history respiratory infection symptoms adverse reactions including local reactions and systemic

  005 during the observational period although positive rate of anti-rsv igm in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group no significant difference was found values of rr were less one and their 95 confidence intervals 95 ci did not cross one except for rsv that the 95 ci included one table 4
 the results indicate that the risk of developing viral respiratory infections is less in the treatment group than that in the control group the pp analysis exhibited that rrrs ie protection rates of the rifn-2b against adv rsv flu-a flu-b and piv1-3 were 594 95 ci 01835 721 95 ci 356 to 943 764 95 ci 637847 762 95 ci 612854 and 774 95 ci 632861 respectively table 4 except for rsv application of the rifn-2b decreased significantly the infection rates for adv flu-a flu-b and piv1-3 in the subjects the nnts of preventing adv rsv flu-a flu-b and piv1-3 were 2495 ci 1214462 50 95 ci 3136 to 231 7 95 ci 4986 9 95 ci 66126 and 9 95 ci 65121 which meant that 24 1214462 50 3136 to 231 7 4986 9 66126 and 9 65121 subjects should be administrated with the rifn-2b nasal spray in order to prevent one case of the viral respiratory infection respectively the itt analysis exhibited that rrrs ie protection rates of the rifn-2b against adv rsv flu-a flu-b and piv1-3 were 595 95 ci 06835 721 95 ci 356 to 943 768 95 ci 643849 770 95 ci 626859 and 775 95 ci 635861 respectively nnts were 25 95 ci 1255539 51 95 ci 3193 to 236 7 95 ci 4884 8 61113 and 9 95 ci 66121 respectively table 5
 the results showed that the pp analysis was consistent with the itt analysis to sum it up protective efficacy of the rifn-2b against four viruses arranged in descending order was flu-a piv1-3 flu-b adv however there was a 95 certainty that the rifn-2b had no effect for rsv because the 95 confidence intervals for the rr rrr and nnt extended from a negative number treatment may harm to a positive number treatment may benefit table 4 table 5 no participants withdrew from the trial due to intolerance of the spray none of the participants were found to have allergy high fever nasal mucosa erosion or hemafecia during the follow-up observational period after administration we found some flu-like symptoms including cough sneeze nose congestion and nose running were slightly higher in the drug group than those in the control group in the period of administrating the nasal sprays particularly during the second to fourth days of the experiment however the differences were not significant p
  005 the incidence rates of epistaxis in the treatment group were low with from 12 9721 to 62 45721 during the period of administration although the occurrences were significant higher in the treatment group than that in the control group on the third day 59 43721 versus 21 15728 p
  0001 and the fourth day 62 45721 versus 29 21728 p
  0003 the occurrence of dry pharynx was significantly higher in the treatment group than that in the control group during the whole drug administration period 213319 in the treatment group 121207 in the control group average incidences of dry pharynx and epistaxis were higher in the experimental group dry pharynx 2794 epistaxis 46 than those in the control group dry pharynx 1616 epistaxis 258 p
  005 during the follow-up period table 6
 the peak of these symptoms was found during the first 5 days thereafter declined both of the experimental group and the control group had high rates of myalgia 3780 3950 arthralgia 2150 2144 these symptoms happened after high intensity training and without significant difference between the two groups viral respiratory infections are caused by a variety of viruses among which there are approximately 200 known ones including a vast number of serotypes and undergo frequent changes in antigenicity 19 although several vaccines against respiratory viruses to prevent the infections have been proved useful in military populations 7 20 21 22 progress has been extremely slow furthermore not all kinds of viral etiological respiratory infections have been available for specific prevention and still have unknown pathogens in the recent decade several novel respiratory viruses which caused serious illness have been identified such as human metapneumovirus hmpv new sars-coronavirus sars-cov that associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars h5n1 flu virus and novel h1n1 virus which increase the difficulty of the immunological prevention for viral respiratory infections in the past years researchers found that ifn- showed an inhibitory effect for sars-cov in vitro and in vivo 23 24 25 therefore it suggests the potential benefits of ifn- in preventing and controlling viral respiratory infections in specific population groups and in epidemic period the common viral respiratory infections possess similar clinical signs and symptoms without special clinical manifestations explicit diagnosis only depends on pathogen examination although isolation of virus from patients is the strongest evidence for confirming viral respiratory infections the diagnostic procedures are complex and time-consuming because of the wide range of viruses especially in a large sample epidemiological study in addition respiratory viruses are frequently detected in respiratory tract secretions samples from healthy people 26 27 the determinations antibodies against respiratory viruses by comparing acute and convalescent serum specimens in infective people may sometimes be helpful to confirm a specific causative infection serum specific igm against virus is a sensitive indicator of a recent onset of viral infection thus we used specific serum igm as surrogate outcome variables to evaluate the preventive effects of the rifn- 2b for acute viral respiratory infections in this study the rr rrr and arr are common parameters used in reporting randomized clinical trials and epidemiological field trails the rr is a ratio of the probability of the event rate occurring in the exposed or experimental group eer versus a non-exposed or control group cer in interventional trials if the treatment arm is effective in preventing disease then the rr will be less than one and vice versa the rrr is the percent reduction in events in the eer compared with the cer in other word the rrr presents the percentage of the risk that has been reduced by the intervention in the control group the arr is the arithmetic difference in the event rate between treatment group and control group in interventional trials if the treatment arm is effective in preventing disease then arr will be positive quantity on the contrary if the treatment arm is harm arr will be negative rr and rrr can be used to quantify the relative magnitude of the protective treatment effects the arr can be used to measure the absolute difference in event rates between two populations therefore arr is considered as a more intuitive measure than rr and rrr these years the number needed to treat nnt has become a widely used index for interpreting the magnitude of treatment benefits or harms the nnt is the inverse of the arr it represents the expected number of persons who must be treated with an intervention in order to prevent one additional adverse outcome event or depending on the context to expect one additional beneficial outcome compared to the expected event rates under the control that is to say the smaller the nnt the more effective the treatment therefore besides rr rrr and arr we used the nnt to express the size of efficacy of the rifn-2b in the present analysis in our study serological detection exhibited that serum positive rates of igm antibodies against the five viruses were higher in the control group than those in the experimental group on the 15th day of the administration in itt analysis highly antiviral effects for flu-a flu-b and piv1-3 were seen all with the rr of 1 and the rrr ie protective rates of 70 a protective effect also was seen for adv with the rr of 1 and the rrr of 595 however there were wide range of 95 confidence intervals of the rr 01650999 and rrr 06835 which indicated the low reliability no certain effect was found for rsv although the rr was less than 1 and rrr  721 the 95 ci ranges of rr 00571356 and rrr 356 to 943 were very wide and included null values rr 95 ci included 1 rrr 95 ci included negative because of small size samples for detecting serum adv antibodies and rsv antibodies and less people of anti-adv and anti-rsv igm positive in both groups and a very wide confidence interval of protection rates in adv and rsv we considered that the sample of this study was not enough for assessing preventive effects of the rifn-2b for these two viruses in the itt analysis of the study nnt values were 7 95 ci 4884 8 95 ci 61113 and 9 95 ci 66121 for flu-a flu-b and piv1-3 infections respectively which meant 7 8 and 9 people need to administrate the rifn-2b to prevent one infection with relevant virus the nnt for adv was 25 95 ci 1255539 which indicated that the benefits of preventing adv infection with the rifn-2b may be less than above infections with any three viruses above the nnt for rsv was 50 95 ci 3136 to 231 which indicated no effect in preventing rsv infection among recruits with the rifn-2b nasal spray itt analysis is a method of analysis for randomized trials in which all subjects randomly assigned to one of the treatments are analyzed together regardless of whether they completed or received that treatment or not on the other hand pp analysis is a method based only on those patients who complete the entire treatment protocol in this study similar results were observed for subjects in the itt and pp populations which indicated no significant missingness and protocol deviation on the whole the intranasal rifn-2b with relative low dose and short term administration 18 106
 iu daily for five days was well tolerated most of the clinical features reported were comparable between the control and the experimental groups except epistaxis no other known severe adverse events such as allergy high fever nasal mucosa erosion and hemafecia of the intranasal interferon were reported during the trial the rrs of dry pharynx and epistaxis were 170 95 ci 139208 and 185 95 ci 106323 respectively which indicated that dry pharynx and epistaxis might be linked to the interferon however the incidence of epistaxis was low and the clinical signs were mild and transitory in present study the results are the same as our previous study 28 and the risk is much lower than that appraised and summarized in evidence-based medicine or  452 95 ci  378541 by jefferson and tyrrell 29 in summary this randomized controlled trial suggested that the recombinant human interferon -2b nasal spray can be used to prevent common acute viral respiratory infections caused by flu-a flu-b piv1-3 and adv and was generally well tolerated among military recruits however the limitations of this trial may be found on sampling and sample size all subjects enrolled were healthy and young male recruits so it may be difficult to extrapolate the conclusion to other populations the sample was not large enough for evaluating the effects for adv and rsv infections which had relative low incidence in the army recruits the efficacy of preventing viral respiratory infections by the rifn-2b nasal spray should be evaluated further in different population groups such as children and the elderly and more samples should be involved in the further study  minus-strand rna viruses james strauss h ellen strauss g   seven families of viruses contain minus-strand rna rna also called negative-strand rna as their genome these are listed in table 41
 included in the table are the names of the genera belonging to these families and the hosts infected by these viruses six of the families are known to contain members that cause epidemics of serious human illness diseases caused by these viruses include influenza orthomyxoviridae mumps and measles paramyxoviridae rabies rhabdoviridae encephalitis several members of the bunyaviridae upper and lower respiratory tract disease numerous viruses in the paramyxoviridae and hemorrhagic fever many viruses belonging to the bunyaviridae the arenaviridae and the filoviridae as well as other diseases bornavirus the sole representative of the bornaviridae also infects humans and may cause neurological illness but proof of causality is lacking many of the rna viruses presently infect virtually the entire human population at some point in time eg respiratory syncytial virus influenza virus whereas others did so before the introduction of vaccines against them eg measles virus and mumps virus these viruses are thus responsible for a very large number of cases of human illness the diseases caused by such widespread viruses are usually serious but have a low although not insignificant fatality rate in contrast some rna viruses such as rabies and ebola viruses cause illnesses with high fatality rates but fortunately infect only a small fraction of the human population the rna viruses are major causes of human suffering and all seven families and the viruses that belong to these families will be described here all rna viruses are enveloped and have helical nucleocapsids the different families encode either one or two glycoproteins called g in most of the families but called ha na f or hn in some after hemagglutinating neuraminidase or fusion properties these glycoproteins are present in the viral envelope in most cases cleavages are required to produce the mature glycoproteins such as cleavage to release a signal peptide cleavage to separate two glycoproteins produced as a common precursor or cleavage to activate viral infectivity the glycoproteins project from the lipid bilayer as spikes that are visible in the electron microscope see eg fig 218d all rna viruses have a single major nucleocapsid protein called n that encapsidates the virion rna to form the helical nucleocapsid also present in the nucleocapsid is a phosphorylated protein that is required for rna synthesis variously called p for phosphoprotein or ns for nonstructural protein because it was not originally known to be a component of the virion as well as a few molecules of an rna-dependent rna polymerase the polymerase is a large multifunctional protein called l in most families but is present as three proteins in the orthomyxoviridae l and p form a core polymerase that replicates the viral genome and synthesizes mrnas a matrix protein m is present in all of the viruses except the bunyaviruses and the arenaviruses m underlies the lipid bilayer where it interacts with the nucleocapsid m also inhibits host transcription and shuts down viral rna synthesis prior to packaging the rna virions are heterogeneous to a greater or lesser extent members of five families often appear roughly spherical in the electron microscope the example of influenza virus is shown in figs 21 and 222d and the paramyxovirus measles virus is shown in fig 222c the compositions of these virions are not rigorously fixed and some variability in the ratios of the different components particularly in the glycoprotein content is present the rhabdoviruses are bullet shaped or bacilliform and appear more regular fig 223 but even here variations in the composition of the glycoproteins in the envelope can occur the filoviruses are filamentous fig 223 orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses also produce filamentous forms as well as round virions see fig 225e in fact clinical isolates of influenza viruses and human respiratory syncytial virus are predominantly filamentous for all rna viruses the first event in infection is the synthesis of mrnas from the minus-strand genome by the rna polymerase present in the nucleocapsid because this polymerase is necessary for the production of the mrnas and because the proteins translated from the mrnas are required for replication of the genome the naked genomes of rna viruses are not infectious nor are complementary rna copies of the genomes it has been possible nonetheless to rescue virus from cdna clones of viral genomes by using special tricks as described in chapter 11 multiple mrnas are produced from minus-strand genomes by definition each region of the genome from which an independent mrna is synthesized is called a gene in rna viruses with segmented genomes it is obvious that multiple mrnas are produced the number of mrnas produced actually exceeds the number of segments as described later in the mononegavirales multiple mrnas arise from the use of a single polymerase entry site at the 3 end of the genome the polymerase then recognizes conserved start and stop signals at the beginning and end of each gene to generate discrete mrnas the amount of mrna produced for any given gene is controlled by the location of the gene relative to the single polymerase entry site because mrna synthesis is obligatorily sequential and attenuation occurs at each gene junction thus more mrna for the proteins encoded 3 in the genome is made and more protein is thus translated from these genes the n protein required for encapsidation of both genome and antigenome is thereby produced in the largest quantities and the rna polymerase needed in the smallest quantities is made in the smallest quantities the synthesis of mrnas is described in more detail in the sections on rhabdoviridae most of the mrnas are translated into a single protein but a few of the genes produce mrnas that are translated into more than one product multiple products can be produced from the same gene by the use of alternative translation initiation codons during translation of an mrna by the introduction of nontemplated nucleotides during mrna synthesis which results in a shift in the reading frame or by splicing of an mrna the p genes in particular of most of the rna viruses are translated into multiple products and two of the segments of influenza virus which replicates in the nucleus can be spliced to produce a second mrna encoding a different product in no case are the mrnas exact complements of virion rnas this is obvious in the case of the mononegavirales where as many as 710 mrnas are produced from a single long genomic rna but is also true of the segmented rna viruses where the mrnas lack cis-active sequences required for encapsidation and replication that are present near the ends of the antigenome segments thus the mrnas of rna viruses do not replicate nor are they packaged into virions in contrast to the translation strategy used by the rna viruses the rna viruses do not produce polyproteins that require processing by virally encoded enzymes and virus-encoded proteases are unknown among them however most of the glycoproteins of the rna viruses are produced as precursors that are processed by cellular enzymes and some of these precursors can be considered to be polyproteins replication of the rna genome requires the production of a complementary copy of the genome called an antigenome or virus-complementary rna vcrna which is distinct from the mrnas schematically illustrated in figs 111c and d neither the genomic rna nor the antigenomic template produced during replication is ever free in the cytoplasm instead replication of the genome as well as the synthesis of mrnas takes place in nucleocapsids sometimes referred to as ribonucleoprotein or rnp which always contain the phosphoprotein and the polymerase as well as n and the viral rna replication can only occur in the presence of ongoing protein synthesis to produce the new proteins required to encapsidate the genome or antigenome the mrnas can be synthesized in the absence of viral protein synthesis and lack encapsidation signals so that they are released into the cytoplasm where they can associate with ribosomes and be translated thus early after infection mrnas are synthesized after translation of the mrnas which leads to production of sufficient amounts of viral proteins a switch to the production of antigenomes for use as templates occurs followed by production of genomic rna from the antigenomic templates the genomes or genome segments of all rna viruses have sequences at the ends that are complementary so-called inverted terminal repeats in the bunyaviruses the rnas form panhandles circular structures that are visible in the electron microscope panhandles have also been reported for influenza a virus in other viruses circles have not been seen but may form transiently during replication it is possible that these complementary sequences exist to promote cyclization of the rna which may be required for replication of the genome or synthesis of mrnas it has been shown for influenza a virus that the viral rna replicase interacts with both ends of the rna during synthesis of rna similar to the story for alphaviruses and flaviviruses described in chapter 3 another possible explanation for the complementary sequences is that the promoter at the 3 end of the genomic rna that is recognized by the viral rna synthetase for the production of antigenomes is the same at least in part as the promoter at the 3 end of the antigenomic rna that is used to initiate the production of genomic rna in this event the sequences at the two ends of the genome or antigenome that encompass these promoters would be complementary all seven families contain members that infect higher vertebrates including humans for five of the families only vertebrate hosts are known the rhabdoviruses and bunyaviruses however have a broader host range some are arboviruses that replicate in an arthropod vector as well as in a vertebrate host and others infect only insects in addition some genera of rhabdoviruses and bunyaviruses consist of plant viruses some of these are transmitted to the plants by insect vectors in which the viruses also replicate the vsv nucleocapsid has about 1250 copies of n protein as its major structural component leading to the conclusion that each n protein interacts with 9 nucleotides of rna the nucleocapsid also contains about 470 molecules of p and 50 copies of l it can synthesize rna and p l and n are all required for this activity the organization of the genome and the production of five mrnas from it are illustrated in fig 42
 there is a single polymerase entry site at the 3 end of the genome and production ofmrnas is obligatorily sequential synthesis begins at the exact 3 end of the genome and a leader rna of 48 nucleotides is first synthesized the leader is released and synthesis of the first mrna that for n is initiated the rna polymerase complex has capping activity and the mrna is capped during or shortly after initiation at the end of the gene for n the transcriptase reaches a conserved sequence auacuuuuuuu where it begins to stutter and produces a polya tract at the 3 end of the mrna the polymerase complex will not terminate or stutter unless the conserved auac is present immediately upstream of the u7 tract and the sequence auacu7 is therefore a consensus termination-polyadenylation signal the capped and polyadenylated mrna for n is terminated and released the transcriptase skips the next two nucleotides which are referred to as the intergenic sequence and initiates synthesis of the second mrna that for p at the conserved gene start signal uuguc following synthesis of this mrna the polymerase again stutters at the oligou tract in the auacu7 signal to produce a polya tract releases the capped and polyadenylated mrna skips the next two nucleotides and begins synthesis of the third gene that for m the process continues in this way through the fourth gene the g protein and the fifth gene the l protein l for large because it comprises about 60 of the genome in this way five capped and polyadenylated mrnas are produced in vsv the intergenic sequence is always two nucleotides after releasing the l mrna the polymerase complex terminates synthesis some 50 nucleotides before the 5 end of the genome is reached as described earlier synthesis of the mrnas proceeds in strict sequential order and the attenuation that occurs at each initiation step results in a gradient in the amounts of mrnas produced this attenuation appears to be important for regulation of the virus life cycle so that the mrnas for proteins needed in most abundance are produced in most abundance reorganization of the genome to change the order of genes gives rise to viable virus but the yield of such virus during an infection cycle in cultured cells and thus the fitness of the virus is reduced 
the mrnas for n m g and l are each translated into a single protein that for p is translated into three proteins the major translation product of this mrna is p which is produced using an initiation codon near the 5 end of the mrna initiation of translation also occurs at two downstream augs these two downstream augs are in frame with one another but in a different reading frame from p use of these alternative augs leads to the synthesis of short proteins of 55 and 65 amino acids of which the shorter protein is a truncated version of the longer one the functions of these small proteins have not been established for vsv but extra products translated from the p gene of the paramyxoviruses are known to interfere with host defense mechanisms as described later synthesis of viral proteins in particular of the n protein allows the enzymatic activity present in the genomic nucleocapsid to switch from synthesis of messengers to replication of the genome replication requires producing a full-length antigenomic template and the immediate encapsidation of the newly synthesized rna into plus-strand rnp containing n p and l during synthesis is required in the absence of n for encapsidation the system defaults to synthesis of mrnas the m protein also appears to regulate rna synthesis in the replication mode the polymerase complex ignores all of the initiation termination and polyadenylation signals utilized to produce mrnas and instead produces a perfect complementary copy of the genome the antigenomic rna can be copied by the polymerase activity in the rnp to produce more genomic rna this also requires that the rna be immediately encapsidated the new genomic rnp can be used to amplify the replication of viral rna or later in infection can bud to produce progeny virions the g protein has a 16-residue n-terminal signal sequence that leads to its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum during translation the signal is removed by cellular signalase the resulting 495-residue protein is anchored near the c terminus by a 20-residue transmembrane anchor with the 29 c-terminal residues forming a cytoplasmic domain ie it is a type 1 integral membrane protein g is glycosylated on two asparagine residues and transported to the plasma membrane where progeny viruses are formed by budding fig 223d the m protein appears to form an adaptor between the glycoprotein present in the plasma membrane and the nucleocapsids assembled inside the cell m also acts to repress rna synthesis by the viral nucleocapsid the g protein contains the fusion activity and receptor recognition activities of the virus and it is the only protein present on the surface of the virion the assembled virion contains about 1200 molecules of g present as trimers that form spikes visible in the electron microscope and about 1800 molecules of m vsv causes nonfatal but economically important and debilitating disease in cattle pigs and horses the name of the virus comes from the vesicles that it induces on the tongue and lips these symptoms resemble those caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus and epidemics of vsv disease in domestic animals result in disruptive quarantines as well as complications in efforts for control of fmdv human infection is common in rural areas where vsv is endemic in domestic animals 2590 of farmers in such areas may have anti-vsv antibodies showing past infection by the virus human infection is largely asymptomatic or associated with a mild febrile illness sometimes accompanied by herpes-like lesions in the mouth or on the lips or nose serological surverys also show that the virus infects bats deer and monkeys in endemic areas the virus also replicates in numerous arthropods and has been isolated from mosquitoes sand flies black flies culicoides houseflies and eye gnats the natural cycle of vsv in nature is not understood and the epidemiological importance of mosquitoes or other hematophagous arthropods in transmission of the virus is not clear 
vsv is endemic in latin america from mexico to northern south america where outbreaks of disease occur every year vsnjv accounts for the majority of the clinical cases in this region sporadic outbreaks occur both north and south of this endemic area in the united states sporadic outbreaks occur in the southwest at intervals of about 10 years caused by both vsiv and vsnjv in the southeast vsnjv was endemic until the 1970s after this vsnjv remained endemic only on ossabaw island off georgia where it is transmitted to feral pigs by sand flies in the rest of the southeast no clinical disease caused by vsv has been reported since 1976 and there have been only occasional findings of seropositive wild animals chandipura virus another member of the genus vesiculovirus table 42 is widespread in india where it infects humans and domestic animals it is also present in senegal it has been isolated from sand flies which are believed to serve as vectors of the virus until recently it was thought to cause no disease or only mild febrile illness in humans however recent epidemics of encephalitis in children in india in 2003 and 2004 have been traced to the virus showing that it has the potential to be a significant human pathogen in the 2003 epidemic in andhra pradesh for example 183 of 329 affected children died more than 20 other vesiculoviruses are known as one example isafahan virus has been isolated from sand flies in iran there is serological evidence of human infection in several central asian countries but no definite evidence for human illness caused by it most lyssaviruses cause the disease called rabies in humans and other mammals it is a uniformly fatal disease of man and of other mammals and has been known since the twenty-third century bc rabies virus is present in the saliva of a rabid animal and is transmitted by its bite infection begins in tissues surrounding the site of the bite without treatment the virus may be transmitted to the brain where replication of the virus leads to the disease called rabies it is believed that the virus enters neurons by using acetylcholine receptors as a receptor followed by transport up the axon until it reaches the cell body the probability that rabies will develop following the bite of a rabid animal depends on the location of the bite the species doing the biting and the virus strain in the absence of treatment bites on the face and head result in rabies in 4080 of cases whereas bites on the legs result in rabies in 010 of cases the incubation period to development of symptomatic rabies can vary from less than a week to several years once the virus reaches the brain it spreads from there to a variety of organs to be transmitted it must spread to the salivary glands infection of neurons in the brain may result in behavioral changes that cause the animal to become belligerent and bite other animals so that the virus present in salivary fluid is transmitted in humans the disease may be paralytic or may result in nonspecific neurological symptoms including anxiety agitation and delirium biting behavior is not a consequence of rabies-induced neurological disease in humans and human-to-human transmission does not occur two to 7 days after symptoms of rabies appear coma and death ensue only three cases of humans recovering from symptomatic rabies have been recorded for centuries the saliva of a rabid dog was thought to be the source of rabies infection but it was only in 1804 that zinke succeeded in transmitting rabies from it in the late 1800s pasteur adapted rabies virus to laboratory animals and developed the concept of protective vaccination against rabies the dessicated spinal cords from rabies-infected rabbits became the first rabies vaccine on july 6 1885 this vaccine was used to immunize joseph miester who had been bitten 14 times by a rabid dog because of the multiplicity of bites he would almost surely have died but the pasteur vaccine saved him a vaccine grown in nervous system tissue and inactivated by phenol rather than drying was the accepted rabies vaccine for decades in the 1960s a safer inactivated virus vaccine derived from virus grown in cultured human cells was introduced the rabies vaccine is unique in that it is normally given after exposure to the virus in conjunction with anti-rabies antiserum this is possible because there is a window of time following the bite of a rabid animal before rabies develops during which a protective immune response can be induced veterinarians and wildlife workers who are potentially exposed to rabid animals as well as biologists who work with rabies virus in the laboratory are immunized prophylatically but the protective immune response can be of short duration and immunity must be tested at regular intervals in the united states canada and western europe where vaccination of domestic dogs is widely practiced wild animals such as raccoons and skunks maintain the virus and transmit it to humans or their domestic animals fig 43
shows the decline in number of cases of rabies in dogs and humans in the united states since the 1940s the result of compulsory vaccination of pet dogs fig 43 also shows the increase in rabies in wild animals since 1940 fig 44
illustrates the explosive spread of rabies in raccoons on the eastern seaboard in the last 20 years the focus of this spread in virginia arose from the import of 3500 raccoons from florida into the washington dc area by members of the cabinet of president carter for the purpose of raccoon hunting these imported animals ignited an epidemic of rabies in raccoons that has slowly spread up and down the atlantic seaboard as shown in fig 44 in other parts of the united states foxes and skunks are important hosts for rabies and disease also occurs at times in wolves and coyotes bats are also an important carrier of rabies in other parts of the world where licensing and immunization of pets is not required domestic dogs continue to be the principal vectors that transmit rabies to humans rabies remains a significant global health problem more than one million people annually undergo antirabies treatment following exposure to the virus and 50000 people die of rabies each year efforts to control rabies in wildlife in the united states and western europe have met with some success these efforts involve vaccinating wildlife with attenuated rabies virus or with recombinant vaccinia viruses that express the rabies g protein using bait containing one of these viruses that is dispersed by hand or by airplane in the eastern united states spread of baits has been used to slow or prevent the further spread of rabies up the eastern seaboard in europe baits have been used to set up barriers to halt the spread of rabies in foxes the european efforts have been more successful than those in the united states the perpetuation of rabies in nature is somewhat of a mystery because of the fact that it can be maintained only in rabid animals who die quickly of the infection how is it that the virus manages to persist one possibility arises from recent findings that rabies virus can establish a latent infection in humans five cases have been documented in which people did not develop symptoms for 7 or more years after infection with the virus in at least some of these cases progression to rabies appeared to be triggered by hormonal changes during puberty if the virus can establish a latent infection in other animals that is later followed by reemergence of the virus and its transmission to new susceptibles this could serve as a reservoir of the virus bats may also be an important reservoir of classical rabies virus bat lyssaviruses are discussed separately later rabies virus infection of bats seems to take longer to kill the animal during which time the virus may be transmissible through the bite of an infected bat or through aerosols from infected bat feces or saliva spray however rabies virus in bats is distinguishable from rabies virus strains in other wildlife by nucleotide sequence analysis thus mixing of bat rabies and rabies in other wildlife is infrequent bats can transmit rabies to humans and cases of human rabies transmitted by bats in the united states have been documented in fact in the united states in recent years cases of human rabies resulting from infection with bat-associated rabies virus have been more numerous than cases resulting from infection by bites of other rabid wildlife in many cases of bat-associated rabies the mechanism by which the virus was transmitted to the human is not known because no exposure to bats rabid or otherwise could be shown australia was long believed to be completely free of rabies however it has recently been found that many australian bats carry a virus known as australian bat lyssavirus ablv two cases of fatal human rabies that were caused by infection with this bat virus have occurred in the last few years in one case a woman caring for injured bats was bitten by a bat in her care in the second incident a woman was bitten while trying to remove a bat that had landed on a child no rabies has been found in other animals presumably because there is no efficient mechanism for transmission of the virus among other mammals present in the continent however the disease could potentially spread to dogs and cats that have been introduced into australia over the years there are two major types of bats bats belonging to the suborder megachiroptera of which 40 genera are recognized are large and feed on fruit and nectar in flowers members belonging to the genus pteropus are often called flying foxes and are found from australia across india to madagascar there are four species of flying foxes in australia bats belonging to the suborder microchiroptera are smaller feed on insects and have developed echolocation to find their prey in the dark both types of bats carry ablv in australia and of the two cases of human infection that have resulted one was from a flying fox and the second was from an insectivorous bat the strains of virus in the two types of bats are distinguishable differing by about 20 in nucleotide sequence two different european bat lyssaviruses exist four human deaths resulting from infection by these viruses have occurred and there is concern that more cases might occur mokola virus has also infected humans in africa bovine ephemeral fever virus genus ephemerovirus is an arbovirus that causes economically important disease in domestic cattle and water buffalo in tropical areas of the old world this virus as well as other members of the genus are not known to be human disease agents the genome encodes five additional genes located between g and l one of these encodes an additional glycoprotein whose significance is unknown the other four genes encode five small proteins of unknown function the novirhabdoviruses infect salmon and other fish and are responsible for economic losses in fish farming operations one additional gene is present in infectious hema-topoietic necrosis virus located between g and l the nucleorhabdoviruses and cytorhabdoviruses are plant viruses that are transmitted by arthropods they replicate in both the arthropod vectors as well as in plants and are the plant equivalent of arboviruses two in maize fine streak virus a nucleorhabdovirus or four in northern cereal mosaic virus a cytorhabdovirus additional genes are positioned between p and m there are in addition many plant rhabdoviruses that have not been assigned to genus the genome organizations of five viruses representing five genera of the paramyxoviruses are shown in fig 46
 the paramyxovirus genome is larger than that of the rhabdoviruses 1520kb and encodes more proteins 811 or more a core of six genes is present in paramyxoviruses n p m f h l different names are used for some of the genes as shown in the figure the p gene uses more than one reading frame to encode multiple proteins in most of these viruses rubulaviruses possess a seventh gene encoding a protein called sh and pneumoviruses possess an even larger constellation of genes 10 in number it is possible that still other genes are hidden within some of these large genomes for example the sh gene encoding a very small protein was discovered only recently the n or np  n in rhabdoviruses p m and l proteins serve the same functions as their counterparts in rhabdoviruses g of rhabdoviruses is replaced by two glycoproteins in paramyxoviruses one called f and the other h or hn or g depending on the virus the order of genes in the paramyxoviruses is the same as in the rhabdoviruses and the genome of the ancestral paramyxoviruses could have arisen from that of a rhabdovirus by insertion of extra genes or vice versa by deletion of genes of interest is the fact that the rhabdovirus n protein binds nine nucleotides whereas the paramyxovirus n protein binds six nucleotides and paramyxoviral rnas where studied contain a number of nucleotides divisible by six virus replication occurs in the cytoplasm like the rhabdoviruses paramyxovirus mrnas are transcribed sequentially beginning at the 3 end of the genome and the mechanisms to produce these mrnas are similar to those employed by rhabdoviruses a leader is first transcribed polya tracts are added by stuttering at oligou stretches at the end of each gene intergenic nucleotides are skipped by the polymerase during synthesis of mrnas and attenuation of mrna synthesis occurs at each junction the intergenic nucleotides are variable among paramyxoviruses however they are gaa or ggg for some viruses but are variable in sequence and in length from 1 to 60 nucleotides for others the mechanisms by which the virus switches from synthesis of mrnas to replication of the genome are the same as those used by the rhabdoviruses paramyxovirus virions are 150350nm in diameter and contain a helical nucleocapsid that is 812nm in diameter virions are usually round but pleomorphic fig 222c and filamentous forms are also produced by some viruses that are more common in clinical isolates fig 225e virions are produced by budding from the plasma membrane figs 225e and f the virion size differs even within a single species and the composition of the virion is not as well defined as for some enveloped viruses there are two glycoproteins on the surface one is a fusion protein that is required for the fusion of the viral membrane with the cell plasma membrane paramyxoviruses fuse with the plasma membrane not with endosomal membranes and fusion does not require exposure to low ph the fusion protein is produced as a precursor called f0 when first synthesized f0 has an n-terminal signal sequence that results in its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum during translation the signal sequence is removed by signal peptidase and the resulting type 1 integral membrane protein is anchored by a membrane-spanning region near the c terminus f0 is cleaved either by cellular furin many paramyxoviruses or cathepsin l henipaviruses within the cell or by other cellular enzymes after release of the virion from the cell depending on its sequence cleavage is required for the virus to be infectious and the cleavage products f1 the n-terminal part of the precursor and f2 the c-terminal part which is anchored in the membrane remain covalently linked through a disulfide bond the fusion domain consists of the n-terminal 20 amino acids of f2 but this domain is not fusogenic until cleavage of f0 has occurred those strains whose f0 can be cleaved intracellularly by furin which recognizes the sequence rxrr or rxkr or cathep-sin l are able to spread systemically and in general cause serious disease in contrast viruses that require cleavage of f0 by proteases after the release of noninfectious virions from the cell usually at a single basic residue by trypsin-like enzymes such as clara or miniplasmin that are limited in their distribution in the animal cannot spread systemically and are usually restricted to the respiratory tract f oligomerizes to form trimers that are visible as spikes on the surface of the virion 
the second glycoprotein is called the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase hn the hemagglutinin h or simply g for glycoprotein depending on the virus this protein is a type 2 integral membrane protein the signal sequence at the n terminus is not removed but instead serves as the transmembrane anchor for the protein so that it has its n terminus inside and its c terminus outside this protein contains the receptor-binding activity of the virus many paramyxoviruses belonging to the genera respirovirus and rubulavirus use sialic acid n-acetylneuraminic acid bound to protein or lipids as a receptor because this receptor is also present on red blood cells these viruses can cause red blood cells to clump or agglutinate a process called hemagglutination heme  the red compound in red blood cells that binds oxygen in paramyxoviruses that use sialic acid as a receptor this second glycoprotein is also a neuraminidase in which case it is called hn neuraminidase removes sialic acid from potential receptors and from virus glycoproteins by removing sialic acid from the virus glycoproteins and from the cell surface released virus is prevented from aggregating with itself or sticking to infected cells it also increases the probability that the virus will successfully initiate infection of a suitable animal mucus which lines the respiratory tract where the viruses begins infection contains sialic acid and might otherwise bind virus preventing its entry into cells if the virus could not release from mucous by destroying these receptors other receptors used by paramyxoviruses include among others cd46 measles virus ephrin b2 henipaviruses and glycosaminoglycans respiratory syncytial virus if the receptor used by the virus is found on red blood cells the viruses will hemagglutinate but if the receptor is not sialic acid the virus will not contain a neuraminidase in this case the second glycoprotein is called h if the viruses are not known to hemagglutinate the second glycoprotein is simply called g for glycoprotein in any event this second glycoprotein of paramyxoviruses best studied in the case of the hn of some paramyxoviruses oligomerizes to form tetrameric spikes on the surface of the virion some paramyxoviruses belonging to the genera rubu-lavirus and pneumovirus encode a third integral membrane protein this small 4464 residues protein is called sh or 1a and is glycosylated in the pneumovirus respiratory syncytial virus but not in the rubulaviruses sv5 and mumps in the rubulaviruses the protein is a type 1 integral membrane protein whose gene is positioned between f and h or hn in sv5 and probably in mumps virus also the protein interferes with the tnf- mediated apoptosis pathway mutants lacking this protein will replicate in cell culture but cause extensive apoptosis and are attenuated in animals expression of the p gene of paramyxoviruses belonging to the subfamily paramyxovirinae sometimes called the pv or pcv gene is remarkable as illustrated in fig 47
 the p gene or its equivalent of most rna viruses is used to make more than one protein as was described earlier for the vesiculoviruses and as will be described later for other viruses but the translation strategies used by some paramyxoviruses result in maximal use of the potential information contained within this gene in some paramyxoviruses alternative aug start codons are used to produce two different proteins translated from different reading frames similar to what occurs in the vesiculoviruses a second strategy used by paramyxoviruses is to add nontemplated nucleotides to the mrna during synthesis in order to shift the reading frame downstream of the added nucleotides the ultimate use of the paramyxovirus p gene occurs in some viruses in which all three reading frames are translated by using one or both of these strategies to produce four or more proteins in respiroviruses morbilliviruses and henipaviruses translation of p mrna can start at one of two different augs that are in different reading frames one of the two proteins produced is called c and the other p fig 47 in addition during transcription of p mrna in most members of the paramyxovirinae nontemplated g residues are added at a specific site in the gene in measles or sendai viruses addition of one g shifts the reading frame after this point to produce a new protein called v which is rich in cysteine residues thus p and v share their n-terminal sequence but diverge after the site where the extra g is added in the case of parainfluenza virus 3 addition of two gs leads to mrna translated into a protein called d another respirovirus hpiv-1 lacks editing in the p gene fig 47 in the rubulaviruses the v protein is translated from the unmodified transcript and production of mrna for p requires addition of two nontemplated g residues in mumps virus addition of 4g residues also occurs to produce a third protein during translation of these p mrnas the situation becomes even more complicated in some viruses multiple in-frame start codons are used to initiate translation of c thus different forms of c are produced that are variously truncated at their n terminus for example sendai virus expresses four c proteins called c c y1 and y2 of which c starts at an acg codon the many different protein products produced from the p gene have not been fully characterized and perhaps not yet fully enumerated and the various functions of this wealth of proteins are only partially unraveled addition of the nontemplated g residues is thought to involve a mechanism similar to the stuttering that produces a polya tract opposite a string of us in the template the nontemplated gs are always added at a specific unique place in the genome characterized by a string of cs there must be some signal within the genome that is recognized by the viral polymerase for the addition of the extra gs similar to the case for the addition of the polya tract at the end of mrnas 
an important function of the v and c proteins perhaps the primary function is to block the action of the hosts interferon ifn system such an activity is called a luxury function because it is not needed for virus replication in cultured cells but is needed for a successful infection of an animal production of ifn is the first line of defense of birds and mammals against virus infection and the system is described in detail in chapter 10 the importance of ifn in controlling viral infection is shown by the fact that most if not all viruses interfere with its action in some way in paramyxoviruses the v and c proteins act in different ways to block ifn production or its activity once induced a potent inducer of ifn production is double-strand rna dsrna and there are at least two cellular sensors that detect dsrna and induce the production of ifn described in more detail in chapter 10 intracellular dsrna can be sensed by a helicase called rig-1 through a complicated pathway involving caspase-recruitment domains card two transcription factors irf-3 and nfb are activated and transported to the nucleus these form a complex that leads to the transcription of the mrna for ifn- an overlapping pathway can start from extracellular dsrna which is bound by a cellular receptor called toll-like receptor 3 the resulting signal cascade results in the production of the same two activated transcription factors the v proteins of several paramyxoviruses interfere with either activation pathway preventing the induction of ifn in addition the w protein of nipah virus blocks the activity of irf-3 in the nucleus the cysteine-rich c-terminal domains of the v proteins are highly conserved and presumably work in the same way in this pathway the v proteins and in some cases the p proteins also block the activity of ifn- once it is produced ifn- is exported from the cell where it can be bound by type i ifn receptors at the surface of the same cell or other cells once ifn- is bound the receptor which consists of two different subunits heterodimerizes and associated adaptor proteins phosphorylate one another and phosphorylate transcription factors called stat1 and stat2 once phosphorylated the stats heterodimerize and are transported to the nucleus where they form part of a transcription complex that transcribes mrna from hundreds of ifn-responsive genes and the products of these genes establish an antiviral state the v protein and p protein of nipah virus cause the stats to aggregate into large inactive complexes the v proteins of several other paramyxoviruses cause stat1 or stat2 to be degraded by proteasomes the w proteins of nipah virus also blocks the activity of the stats in the nucleus by causing the proteins to aggregate the net result of these activities is that the genes responsive to activation by ifn- are not transcribed and ifn activity is aborted see also chapter 10 the v proteins are also involved in the regulation of rna synthesis after infection where studied they downregulate the production of viral rna the genus respirovirus contains several parainfluenza viruses abbreviated pivs and sendai virus from sendai japan where it was isolated also called mouse piv-1 table 43 the two human respiroviruses hpiv-1 and hpiv-3 cause a respiratory illness similar to that caused by influenza virus and utilize sialic acid as a receptor as does influenza they were once grouped with influenza virus as myxoviruses myxo from mucus because the viruses attach to mucus which contains sialic acid when they were separated from influenza virus into a distinct family they were called parainfluenza viruses and the family was named paramyxoviridae the respiratory tract infections caused by hpiv-1 and hpiv-3 may be limited to the upper respiratory tract causing colds or may also involve the lower respiratory tract causing bronchopneumonia bronchiolitis or bronchitis these viruses are widespread around the world and are an important cause of lower respiratory tract disease in young children serological studies have shown that most children are infected by hpiv-3 by 24 years of age and that the incidence of infection can be as high as 67 out of 100 children per year during the first 2 years of life ie reinfections are common thus immunity is incomplete and the viruses continue to reinfect older children and adults however subsequent infections are normally less severe and there is a reduction in the incidence of lower respiratory tract disease which is more serious than infection of the upper respiratory tract the viruses as is common for respiratory tract infections are spread by respiratory droplets attempts to develop vaccines against the hpivs have not met with success because of incomplete immunity produced by natural infections the primary purpose of a vaccine would be to decrease the severity of natural infection by the virus even so results to date have been disappointing inactivated virus vaccines developed for hpiv-1 and -3 as well as for hpiv-2 a rubulavirus were antigenic but failed to induce resistance to the viruses this could have resulted from failure to develop iga following a parenterally administered vaccinechapter 10 and attempts to develop effective vaccines are continuing the genus rubulavirus gets its name from an old name for mumps which is the disease produced in humans by mumps virus the only natural hosts for mumps virus are humans and the virus is transmitted from person to person by contact the disease has been known at least from the fifth century bc the incubation period that is the period of time between infection by the virus and the development of symptoms is about 18 days during the last 7 days of the incubation period a person sheds virus and is capable of infecting others infection of children is usually not serious but mumps virus infection can cause serious illness particularly in adults infection begins in the upper respiratory tract but becomes systemic with the virus infecting many organs where it replicates in epithelial cells it is best known for infection of the parotid salivary glands leading to painful swelling of these glands more serious disease can result from the replication of the virus in other organs however the central nervous system cns is a common target for the virus and 0523 cases of mumps encephalitis are fatal infection of the pancreas can occur and it has been suggested that mumps may be associated with sudden onset insulin-dependent diabetes the heart is sometimes infected resulting in myocarditis infection of the testes in adult males can lead to orchitis and in rare cases to sterility infection of the fetus can result in spontaneous abortion at one time mumps was one of the common childhood diseases that was contracted by almost everyone it is now controlled in developed countries by an effective attenuated virus vaccine that was selected by passage of the virus in embryonated eggs this mumps vaccine is given as part of the mmr measlesmumpsrubella combination vaccine the dramatic decline in cases of mumps in the united states after introduction of this vaccine is shown in fig 48
 because mumps is exclusively a human virus that induces effective immunity following infection and infection of an individual requires direct contact with a person actively shedding the virus the virus requires a population of at least 200000 people to sustain it such a population density was first attained 4000 or 5000 years ago before which mumps could not have existed at least in its current form other human rubulaviruses include hpiv-2 and hpiv-4 they are named human parainfluenza viruses because the disease they cause is similar to that caused by hpiv-1 and hpiv-3 however they are genetically related to the rubulaviruses rather than to the respiroviruses fig 45 other members of the rubulavirus genus infect many mammals and birds one of the most intensively studied rubulaviruses studied as a model system for replication of members of the family has been sv-5 simian virus 5 during the development of the polio vaccine rhesus monkey kidney cells were used for replication of poliovirus in culture and these cultures were often contaminated with monkey viruses these simian viruses svs were simply numbered as they were isolated and any particular sv may be totally unrelated to any other two of the most widely studied are sv-5 and sv-40 which are not related to one another sv-5 is an rna-containing paramyxovirus and sv-40 is a dna-containing polyomaviruschapter 7 the avian viruses include nine serologically distinct paramyxoviruses these viruses form a distinct lineage but clearly group with the rubulaviruses fig 45 apmv-1 is also known as newcastle disease virus ndv which causes a highly contagious and fatal disease of birds ndv has serious economic consequences because it infects chickens among other avian hosts when epidemics break out and they do with some regularity many birds die causing economic losses quarantines are placed on the movement of birds during epidemics in an effort to curtail the spread of the virus which has further economic consequences menangle virus is a newly described virus that emerged in australia in 1997 as the cause of severe reproductive disease in pigs menangle virus is a bat virus that was present in flying foxes that formed a large colony near the pig farm where the virus emerged how the virus was transmitted to pigs is not known with certainty two farm workers appeared to have been infected during the outbreak and suffered influenza-like symptoms menangle is an example of emerging viral diseases a topic covered in more detail in chapter 8 measles virus causes serious illness in man infection begins in the upper respiratory tract but becomes systemic and many organs become infected lymphoid organs and tissues are prominent sites of viral replication and one consequence of virus infection is immune suppression that lasts for some weeks apparently due to suppression of t-cell responses immune suppression can result in secondary infections that may be serious even life threatening and interference with immune function is a major cause of measles mortality measles also has uncommon neurological complications including encephalomyelitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis sspe in sspe the virus sets up a persistent but modified infection in the brain in which m protein is produced in only low amounts downregulation of production of m protein appears to be necessary to establish the disease syndrome symptoms of sspe appear several years after measles infection and the disease progresses slowly but inexorably serious complications caused by viral infection of other organs can also occur like mumps measles is a disease of civilization the virus is a human virus although subhuman primates can be infected by the virus and suffer the same disease as humans humans are the only reservoir of the virus in nature infection requires direct contact with an infected person and recovery from infection results in solid lifelong immunity to the virus thus a minimum size population is required to maintain the virus in which the continuing birth of new susceptibles occurs at a rate sufficient to maintain continuous virus infection within the community the requirement for a minimum sized human population to sustain the virus is illustrated in fig 49
 in this figure data from 19491964 before tourism became as popular as it is today are plotted that show the duration of measles epidemics on various islands in fig 49a we see that an island must have a population sufficient to produce about 16000 surviving newborns a year population about 500000 in order to maintain the virus continuously in the population if the population is smaller the epidemic burns itself out when all susceptibles have been infected the island is then free of measles until sufficient new susceptibles have been born and measles is once again introduced into the island from outside the smaller the population the longer this takes note that guam and bermuda with their heavy tourist influx had measles present more than expected from the curve because the virus is introduced more often that is the island population is not truly isolated figure 49b illustrates that the more densely packed the population the more readily the virus spreads and therefore the sooner the epidemic burns itself out the islands shown in this panel all have about the same population but when the population is compressed into a smaller area such as in tonga person-to-person spread is more efficient and epidemics do not last as long as when the population is dispersed over a larger area such as in iceland the study of measles epidemics on islands first demonstrated that lifelong immunity arises following infection by measles after an epidemic of measles in the faeroe islands in 1781 the islands were free of measles until the virus was again introduced in 1846 by a danish visitor in the 1846 epidemic 77 of the population of the islands contracted measles but no one over 65 years of age came down with the disease the requirement for a minimum sized population to maintain the virus means that even though measles virus is extraordinarily infectious the virus could not have existed until perhaps 5000 years ago when human population density became sufficient to support it at about this time large population centers arose in the fertile crescent a region of the middle east encompassing parts of modern iraq syria jordan israel lebanon and turkey which included the upper tigris and euphrates rivers and whose climate was conducive to primitive agriculture these population centers were associated with the cultivation of food plants and the domestication of animals including bovines measles virus is most closely related to rinderpest virus fig 45 which infects cattle and swine an obvious hypothesis is that the close contact between humans and their domesticated animals allowed rinderpest virus or perhaps another virus of domestic animals to jump to humans and evolve to become specific for humans subsequent coexistence of the virus with its human host led to the present situation where infection results in significant but relatively low morbidity and mortality epidemics of measles were undoubtedly widespread in the old world following the appearance of measles although it is difficult now to ascertain the causes of epidemics that occurred thousands of years ago however it is clear that measles was widespread in europe at the time the europeans began their explorations of the americas and of the many isolated island communities around the world and europeans carried measles with them as they traveled introduction of measles virus into virgin populations resulted in very high mortality mortality was 26 in fiji islanders when measles was introduced in 1875 for example it has been estimated that 56 million people in the americas died of old world diseases following european exploration of the new world and measles and smallpoxchapter 7 were significant contributors to these deaths the introduction of measles and smallpox by the spaniards facilitated the conquest of the americas by them and the subsequent depopulation of central and south america allowed the spaniards to remain dominant it has been suggested that the depopulation of the americas caused by these diseases led the europeans to introduce africans as slaves to replace native americans being used as slaves the very high mortality caused by the virus in naive populations which contrasts with the low mortality in europeans was probably due to two causes europeans and other old world peoples have been continuously exposed to measles for millennia and have been selected for resistance to measles the people in the americas had never experienced measles infection however a second factor that led to high mortality rates was the introduction of measles into a virgin population in which not only young children but also all of the adults were susceptible meaning that the entire population became seriously ill simultaneously this surely disrupted the ability of the society to maintain itself because there was no one healthy enough to care for the sick at one time measles virus was epidemic throughout the world and caused one of the childhood illnesses contracted by almost everyone because of the extraordinary infectiousness of the virus very few people escaped infection by it in the united states there were about 4 million cases of measles a year of which about 50000 required hospitalization and 500 were fatal there were 4000 cases of measles encephalitis each year with many patients suffering permanent sequelae in addition some fraction of children infected as infants went on to develop sspe which is a progressive neurological disease that results in death within about 3 years of the appearance of symptoms throughout the world an estimated 25 million children died annually of measles because measles was a widespread and serious disease attempts to develop a vaccine began at about the same time as attempts to develop a poliovirus vaccine one vaccine used in the united states from 1963 to 1967 consisted of inactivated measles virus the vaccine was poorly protective and recipients of this vaccine exposed to measles sometimes developed a more serious form of measles called atypical measles characterized by higher and more prolonged fever severe skin lesions and pneumonitis inflammation of the lungs from pneumon  lung and itis  inflammation the increased severity may have resulted from an unbalanced immune response primed by the formalin inactivated virus or to a lack of local immunity in the respiratory tract see chapter 10 similar problems occurred following vaccination with inactivated respiratory syncytial virus a paramyxovirus described later an attentuated measles virus vaccine now given as part of the mmr combination vaccine produced much more satisfactory results the live virus vaccine gives solid protection from disease caused by the virulent virus and has largely controlled the virus within the united states fig 410
 following introduction of the vaccine the number of cases dropped dramatically the virus continued to circulate among nonimmunized individuals however and thousands of cases per year still occurred sometimes associated with epidemics of more than 50000 cases as vaccine coverage became more effective cases dropped to new lows but another epidemic in 19891991 caused about 50000 cases this epidemic occurred in young immunized adults as well as in young children who had not been immunized some of the cases in young adults were due to vaccine failures about 5 of humans immunized with a single dose of the measles vaccine fail to develop immunity to measles but other cases appear to have been due to waning immunity thus immunity induced by the vaccine is probably not lifelong in contrast to natural infection by wild-type measles virus the guidelines now call for a second immunization on entry to elementary or middle school this not only boosts immunity in individuals whose immunity is waning but also usually leads to immunity in those who did not develop immunity after the first dose in addition some colleges require immunization on entry with these changes the number of cases of measles in the united states was only 100 in 1998 molecular genotyping has increased our understanding of the few cases of measles that occur annually in the united states today in 19881992 all the reported isolates of measles virus were subgroup 2 the indigenous north american strain however by 19941995 all outbreaks were caused by one of four other subgroups that are endemic in other parts of the world thus these outbreaks were initiated by viremic visitors from asia and europe one notable outbreak is thought to have been initiated by a single visitor to las vegas and resulted in small epidemics in five states after control of measles in the united states and other developed countries the virus remained epidemic in many parts of the developing world control has recently been established throughout most of the americas but measles remains a serious pathogen in other parts of the developing world in fact measles is the leading cause of vaccine preventable deaths in the world the world health organization has initiated a campaign to eradicate measles but the campaign has met a number of stumbling blocks because the virus infects only humans in nature it should be possible to eradicate it using the same techniques that were used for smallpox and that are being used for poliovirus a major problem with measles however has been the inability to effectively immunize young infants against the disease before they become naturally infected by the virus newborns are protected from infection for 612 months by maternal antibodies and a live vaccine does not take while they are thus protected in many societies measles is so pervasive that very shortly after the infant becomes susceptible to infection infection by wild-type virus occurs thus keeping wild-type virus in circulation as described in chapter 10 attempts to overcome maternal immunity by increasing the dose of the vaccine virus have not led to satisfactory results new guidelines being developed recommend multiple immunizations against measles in such circumstances starting at an earlier age in order to catch the child with the vaccine as soon as it becomes susceptible to the virus the receptor for measles virus is a protein called cd46 that is expressed on the surface of human and monkey cellschapter 1 which is bound by the measles h protein in view of the fact that sialic acid was not the measles receptor the apparent lack of neuraminidase activity in the h protein was not surprising recent studies of the morbillivirus h protein have shown that it is related in structure to the hn protein of paramyxoviruses however and that the related rinderpest and peste-des-petits-ruminants viruses possess neuraminidase activity this neuraminidase activity differs in its specificity from that exhibited by the respiroviruses and the orthomyxoviruses explaining why it had not been observed previously presumably this activity is also found in the measles h protein and the function of this enzyme in the measles life cycle remains to be determined two species of henipaviruses are currently recognized hendra virus and nipah virus hendra virus first emerged in 1994 when an outbreak of severe respiratory illness with a 75 fatality rate occurred in horses near brisbane australia two humans also contracted the disease of whom one died hendra virus was quickly isolated and shown to be responsible for the disease subsequent studies established that the reservoir of the virus was fruit bats called flying foxes small outbreaks of hendra also occurred in northern australia in 1994 1999 and 2004 hendra virus is widespread and antibodies to it have been found in all four species of flying foxes in australia but from no other animal except the horses infected in these outbreaks nipah virus shares 83 amino acid sequence identity with hendra virus it is widely distributed in southeast asia and has been isolated from fruit bats in malaysia cambodia and bangladesh it first emerged in 19981999 when an outbreak of 258 cases of human encephalitis occurred in malaysia and singapore that had a 40 mortality rate the epidemic was associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs and humans infected with the disease were pig farmers or others closely associated with pig farming there was no evidence for human-to-human transmission in this outbreak recent epidemics of nipah virus encephalitis have occurred in bangladesh in 2001 2003 2004 and 2005 in these epidemics there was no evidence for the infection of an intermediate animal such as occurred in the malasian epidemic furthermore in the 2004 epidemic evidence was obtained that person-to-person transmission of the virus had occurred and it is possible that the disease was transmitted directly from bats to humans possibly by human consumption of partially eaten fruit followed by person-to-person transmission the fatality rate in these epidemics has been as high as 75 in nearby india an epidemic of nipah occurred in 2001 hendra virus and nipah virus represent emerging pathogens they are previously unknown viruses that are causing serious disease over widely separated geographic areas a more detailed discussion of emerging viral diseases is found in chapter 8 the genus pneumovirus subfamily pneumovirinae contains the respiratory syncytial viruses rsvs rsvs are known for cattle mice sheep goats and turkeys as well as humans the genome of rsv is more complex than other paramyxoviridae having more genes fig 46 the polymerase gene of rsv is more closely related to those of the filoviruses than to those of the paramyxovirinae making classification of these viruses problematical human rsv is the most important cause of pneumonia in infants and children worldwide half of hospital admissions in the united states in january and february of infants less than 2 years old are due to infection by rsv infants are normally infected at 6 weeks to 9 months of age infection begins as an upper respiratory tract infection that progresses to the lower respiratory tract in 2540 of primary infections immunity following infection is incomplete and reinfection is common in children and adults but reinfection tends to produce less severe disease symptoms can include bronchitis and pharyngitis itis  inflammation so inflammation of the mucous membranes of the bronchi or pharynx rhinorrhea runny nose cough headache fatigue and fever pneumonia inflammation of the lungs in which the air sacs become filled with exudate can result particularly in infants or the elderly it is estimated that 17000 people in the united states die annually from rsv infection and the great majority of these are people over 65 years old rsv infection is particularly serious in the immunocompromised as one example individuals of any age undergoing bone marrow transplantation have a 90 mortality rate if infected by rsv no vaccine is available at the current time for rsv because of the widespread prevalence of infection by the virus and the severity of the disease it causes especially in infants efforts are ongoing to develop a vaccine that would provide protection against disease or that would at least protect against severe disease a clinical trial with an inactivated virus vaccine in a group of children some years ago gave disastrous results however not only did the inoculation with the candidate vaccine fail to protect the children against subsequent infection by rsv but it was found that when infected the vaccinated group suffered a much higher proportion of serious illnesses such as viral pneumonia than did the control group thus immunization potentiated illness possibly because of an unbalanced immune response this result has impeded efforts to develop a vaccine and made it clear that a better understanding of the interaction of the virus with the immune system is important many viruses belonging to several different families have now been described that cause respiratory disease and more viruses belonging to other families will be described later for comparative purposes an overview of viruses that cause respiratory disease is shown in table 44
 this table is not meant to be comprehensive and includes only a sampling of viruses furthermore some of the viruses in the table such as measles virus are better known for disease other than respiratory disease however the table makes clear that a large number of diverse viruses can infect the respiratory tract and cause illness 
table 45
lists the known filoviruses which are classified into two genera marburgvirus and ebolavirus four species of ebolavirus are known three from africa zaire sudan and ivory coast ebolaviruses and one from the philippines andor southeast asia reston ebolavirus the filovirus genome is 19kb in size and contains seven genes which result in the production of seven or eight proteins following infection fig 41 the biology of filoviruses has been very difficult to study most filoviruses are severe human pathogens that must be handled under biosafety level 4 conditions bsl-4 which restricts the number of laboratories that can work with the virus and the number of experiments that can be done furthermore until recently the reservoir of the virus in nature was unknown limiting studies of the ecology of the virus a dendrogram showing the relationships among the filoviruses is shown in fig 411
 the viruses have a genome organization similar to that of other members of the mononegavirales their sequences suggest that they are most closely related to the pneumoviruses and they are assumed to replicate in a manner similar to that for the rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses there are four structural protein genes encoding the nucleoprotein np the glycoprotein gp and two matrix proteins vp24 m2 and vp40 m1 there are three nonstructural protein genes encoding the viral polymerase and two proteins called vp30 and vp35 the gp gene gives rise to one protein gp in marburg virus in the ebola viruses however a second gly-coprotein called sgp is also produced from an edited version of the mrna for gp sgp is a soluble truncated version of gp whose function is unknown but it is speculated that sgp interferes with the host immune system in some way the filovirus virion is enveloped as is the case for all minus-strand viruses but rather than being spherical the virion is long and thread-like whence the name filo as in filament the infectious virion is 8001000nm in length and 80nm in diameter fig 223e but preparations examined in the electron microscope are pleomorphic and oddly shaped often appearing as circles or the number 6 but sometimes branched figs 223f and g there is one glycoprotein gp in the envelope present as homotrimers that is both n- and o-glycosylated and has a molecular weight of 120170kda 
most of the known filoviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with a mortality rate as high as 90 because of the dramatic symptoms of the disease involving bleeding from multiple orifices and the high fatality rate following infection these viruses especially zaire ebolavirus have been the subject of much discussion in the popular press and have appeared in a number of works of nonfiction as well as fiction to date ebolaviruses have caused only a limited number of human cases but there is always the fear that if the virus were to adapt to humans in a way that allowed for easier transmission it could become a very big problem the filoviruses are examples of emerging viruses and a more detailed discussion of their emergence and the epidemics of disease caused by them are found in chapter 8 marburg virus was first isolated in 1967 when it caused an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in germany and yugoslavia originating from african green monkeys imported from uganda the virus is native to central africa and there have subsequently been epidemics in kenya zaire the democratic republic of congo angola and zimbabwe involving from one or a few cases to as many as 374 cases with an overall mortality rate of 8090 ebola virus was first isolated during a 1976 epidemic of severe hemorrhagic fever in zaire and sudan and named for a river in the region subsequent epidemics in these countries and in gabon and uganda have occurred at regular intervals see chapter 8 the number of cases in an epidemic has been as high as 600 and the case fatality rate has varied from 50 to 90 asymptomatic infection during these epidemics appears to be rare a milder strain of ebola virus was isolated from the ivory coast in 1994 and three strains or species of african ebolaviruses are now recognized which differ in their virulence table 45 and fig 411 zaire ebolavirus is the most virulent with a case fatality rate approaching 90 sudan ebolavirus is less virulent and ivory coast ebolavirus is the least virulent human-to-human transmission of the virus requires close contact with the tissues blood or other exudates from an infected person and barrier nursing is sufficient to contain the spread of the disease no vaccine exists for the viruses but candidate vaccines are in an advanced stage of study the natural reservoir of ebola virus in africa has recently been shown to be bats it is clear that monkeys can be infected by the virus and spread it to humans often when humans use monkeys for food how the monkeys contract the virus or how human epidemics get started when monkeys are not implicated is not known a fourth strain of ebola virus called reston ebolavirus first appeared in 1989 in a primate colony in reston virginia as the causative agent of an epidemic of hemorrhagic fever in monkeys imported from the philippines although highly lethal in monkeys the virus is not known to cause human disease nucleotide sequencing has shown that reston ebolavirus is closely related to the african ebola viruses and the reason it is attenuated in humans is not known borna disease virus is the sole representative of the family bornaviridae in the order mononegavirales table 46
 it has a nonsegmented minus-sense genome of 89kb containing by one definition five genes the general organization of the genome and the suite of genes contained in the genome resembles that of other members of the mononegavirales fig 41 however the virus replicates in the nucleus not in the cytoplasm splicing of mrnas occurs to form an incompletely characterized set of alternatively spliced mrnas from the five genes furthermore alternative start codons are used during translation of some of the mrnas a trait shared with other rna viruses so that overlapping open reading frames are present in some of the genes overall the number of protein products produced and the complexity of the readout of the genome exceed that of other rna viruses the genome organization and transcriptional map of borna disease virus as currently understood is shown in fig 412
 
borna disease virus is neurotropic and establishes a chronic or persistent infection despite an immune response to viral infection the chronic infection results at least in part because the virus downregulates its replication resulting in very low production of infectious virus downregulation to establish a persistent infection uses a mechanism different from those described in chapter 3 for alphaviruses shutoff of minus-strand rna and for pestiviruses titration of a cellular component required for rna replication borna disease virus like other rna viruses has an inverted terminal repeat at the ends of the genomic rna that contains promoters for rna replication during replication the four terminal nucleotides at the 5 ends of both the genomic and antigenomic rna are often trimmed so that the majority of rnas are missing these four nucleotides the truncated rna can be transcribed to produce mrna but cannot replicate thus resulting in downregulation of rna replication borna disease virus appears to have a very wide host range it was originally described as a pathogen of sheep and horses in germany but is now known to infect a wide variety of warm-blooded vertebrates birds as well as mammals the reservoir host in switzerland has recently been reported to be a shrew crocidura leucodon these rodents are exclusively terrestrial and it is thought that horses become infected by grazing on forage contaminated by excretions from infected shrews as described the virus establishes a chronic infection characterized by neurotropism and low production of virus infection may be asymptomatic or may result in disease characterized by movement and behavioral abnormalities naturally infected horses exhibiting such abnormalities usually recover but the disease may progress to paralysis and death experimentally infected rats and primates also exhibit behavioral abnormalities because of these effects on other animals several recent studies have tried to determine if the virus is associated with neurological disease in man in particular with schizophrenia serological surveys have found that psychiatric patients are more likely to have antibodies to bornavirus than normal controls surveys which assay for the presence of viral rna in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pmbcs are even more suggestive in some surverys up to 66 of psychiatric patients including schizophrenics are positive for bornaviral rna compared to 5 of normal controls furthermore very small amounts of virus-specific rna have been isolated from postmortem brain samples from patients suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder but not from normal individuals or patients suffering from other neurological disorders interestingly a recent study found that two patients hospitalized for severe depression exhibited a rise in bornavirus antigen in pmbcs during the course of the disease which fell to very low levels on recovery whether these different associations are indicative of causality remains to be determined but it is conceivable that the virus causes recurrent episodes of depression on reactivation of a latent infection the proteins encoded in the different gene segments of influenza a and influenza c viruses are described in table 48
 influenza a produces 10 proteins from its eight genome segments and most of these proteins have analogues in other rna viruses fig 41 the matrix protein m1 and the nucleocapsid protein np perform functions similar to those of m when present and n of other rna viruses respectively the three proteins encoded in the three largest segments of influenza called pb2 pb1 and pa b or a refers to a basic or acidic pk possess the rna polymerase activities encoded in the l protein and the p protein of other rna viruses influenza a and b have two surface glycoproteins called ha and na but influenza c has only one called hef these glycoproteins have the receptor-binding fusion and receptor-destroying activities present in surface glycoproteins of rna viruses two proteins called ns1 and ns2 ns for nonstructural are produced from rna segment 8 ns1 is produced from the unspliced mrna replication occurs in the nucleus it binds to rnas in the nucleus including cellular pre-mrnas cellular snrnas which are involved in splicing and dsrna its activities inhibit the transport of cellular mrnas from the nucleus and promote the synthesis of influenza mrna ns1 also regulates splicing of influenza mrnas and their transport from the nucleus to the cytosol another function of ns1 is to interfere with the interferon pathwaychapter 10 in part by binding dsrna which is a major inducer of interferon and a cofactor for some proteins in the interferon response to viruses and in part by interacting with cellular proteins involved in the interferon response influenza virus lacking ns1 is very sensitive to interferon and is replication defective in cells or hosts capable of synthesizing interferon whereas the wild-type virus is resistant to the interferon pathway ns2 is produced from a spliced mrna it interacts with m1 attached to influenza rnp and promotes the transport of the rnp to the cytoplasm it is present in small quantities in the virion and so is not truly nonstructural protein m2 is produced from a spliced mrna from segment 7 it forms ion channels in membranes probably as a tetramer that allow passage of h ions during transport of ha to the cell surface the presence of m2 in the membrane of the transport vesicle causes the ph within the vesicle to equilibrate with that in the cytosol this prevents low ph activation of the fusion activity of ha during transport because transport vesicles are otherwise acidic m2 is also present in virions and is required for the disassembly of the virus and for the activation of the rna polymerase activity to become active the polymerase in the interior of the virus must be exposed to low ph influenza virus enters the cell in endosomes which are progressively acidified the acidic ph not only triggers a conformational change in ha that results in fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane but it also activates the rna polymerase of the virion through the activity of m2 m2 is the target of the drug amantadine one of the relatively few drugs that are effective against a viral disease amantadine binds m2 of most influenza strains and prevents it from acting as an ion channel which prevents the activation of the polymerase when taken early during infection amantidine ameliorates the symptoms of influenza a worrisome trend is the appearance of amantidine-resistant variants of influenza in particular the h5n1 strain referred to as bird flu in most but not all influenza a viruses an 11th protein pb1-f2 is made this protein is translated from an alternative reading frame from the mrna of pb1 it is present in mitochrondria in infected cells and may serve to regulate apoptosis by the cell comparison of the glycoproteins of influenza a virus and the paramyxovirus sv-5 is of interest in both influenza a virus and sv-5 one of the glycoproteins is type 1 n terminus out and one is type 2 c terminus out in both cases the type 1 glycoprotein is produced as a precursor that must be cleaved to activate the fusion activity required for entry into cells the type 1 glycoprotein of influenza a has fusion and receptor-binding hemagglutinating activities and is called the hemagglutinin or ha the precursor is called ha0 and the cleaved products are called ha1 and ha2 which remain covalently linked by a disulfide bond after cleavage of the peptide bond fig 16 cleavage is required to activate the fusion activity of the virus and the nature of the cleavage site influences the virulence of the virus if the cleavage site consists of a single basic amino acid cleavage is extracellular and influenza replication is restricted to the respiratory tract and in the case of birds the gut as well where there are enzymes that can cleave this site if the cleavage site consists of multiple basic residues that can be recognized by the intracellular enzyme furin the virus can replicate systemically in at least some hosts the sv-5 type 1 glycoprotein has only fusion activity and is called f as described before it is produced as a precursor f0 which is cleaved to f1 and f2 and the nature of the cleavage site affects the virulence of the virus see viral glycoproteins under paramyxoviridae earlier in this chapter the receptor bound by both influenza a virus and by sv-5 for entry into cells is sialic acid the type 2 glycoprotein of influenza has neuraminidase activity and is called the neuraminidase or na it removes sialic acid from glycoproteins for the same reasons as described for the paramyxoviruses that use sialic acid as a receptor the type 2 glycoprotein of sv-5 has both neuraminidase activity and receptor-binding hemagglutinating activities and is called hn influenza ha is present as a trimer on the surface of the virus as is f of sv-5 the trimeric spike has a long stalk and a head containing the sialic acid binding sites as shown in fig 16 exposure to acid ph in endosomes produces a dramatic rearrangement of the spike in which the fusion peptide which forms the n terminus of ha2 is moved over a distance of more than 10nm to the tip of the spike here it inserts into the target membrane and promotes fusion of the viral membrane with the target membrane na is present as a tetramer as is hn of sv-5 and forms a spike that is distinguishable in the electron microscope from the ha spike there is only one surface glycoprotein in influenza c the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein hef influenza c virus has therefore one fewer gene segments than influenza a hef has receptor-binding hemagglutination fusion and receptor-destroying activities the receptor is sialic acid but the activity that destroys the receptor is an esterase activity the esterase does not remove sialic acid from proteins as does na of influenza a instead it removes the 9-o-acetyl group from 9-o-acetyl-n-acetylneuraminic acid the receptor used by influenza c and the virus does not bind to the deacylated sialic acid synthesis of influenza virus rnas occurs in the nucleus rather than in the cytoplasm as for most rna viruses this makes possible the differential splicing observed for two of the mrnas following infection by the virus the viral rnps are transported to the nucleus and mrna synthesis begins during synthesis of mrna influenza engages in a process called cap-snatching capped cellular pre-mrnas present in the nucleus are bound by ns1 and the 5-terminal 1013 nucleotides containing the 5 cap are removed by pb2 this oligonucleotide is used to prime synthesis of mrna from the influenza genome segments as illustrated in fig 413
 once initiated other aspects of mrna synthesis resemble those that occur in rhabdo- and paramyxoviruses synthesis continues to near the end of the genome segment where an oligou stretch is encountered here the enzyme stutters to produce a polya tail on the messenger and then releases it in addition to its role as a primer using a cap derived from cellular mrna relieves the virus of the necessity of encoding enzymes required for capping and ensures that the virus mrna has a cap suitable for the cell in which it is replicating this mechanism also results in interference with the synthesis and transport of host mrnas furthermore because the mrnas have a different 5 end and lack the 3 end of the antigenomic rna they lack promoters required for replication and packaging and are therefore dedicated mrnas each genome segment gives rise to one primary mrna species however two of these can be spliced and both the unspliced and spliced rnas serve as messengers thus two mrnas are formed from each of two of the segments and in total 10mrnas are formed and 10 proteins are produced 11 in the case of viruses that also produce pb1f2 described earlier the formation of the two mrnas from segment 7 and their translation into proteins is illustrated schematically in fig 414
 when sufficient amounts of viral proteins have been synthesized and transported to the nucleus viral rna replication begins replication requires encapsidation of progeny genomic and antigenomic rnas as described for other rna viruses and the mechanisms that lead to a switch between synthesis of mrnas and replication are thought to be similar to those that occur in rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses during replication the viral genome is copied into a faithful antigenomic rna vcrna fig 413 which is a perfect complement of the genome and serves as a template for production of genomic rna 
synthesis of viral rna whether plus strand or minus strand requires that the synthetase interact with both ends of the rna whether vrna or vcrna that is the promoter for synthesis of rna is composed of elements from both ends of the rna this is analogous to what has been found for alphaviruses and flaviviruses described in chapter 3 and may be a general mechanism used by many or all rna viruses thirteen nucleotides at the 5 end of the vrna and 12 nucleotides at the 3 end are highly conserved in influenza a viruses and these seem to contain the entire promoter element these sequences form an inverted terminal repeat and are capable of forming a panhandle structure fig 415a
 bringing the two ends together where they might interact with the rna synthetic machinery an alternative structure called the corkscrew structure is thought to be the structure recognized by the synthetase for initiation of rna synthesis fig 415b cyclization is also hypothesized to play a role in addition of polya to mrnas by causing the polymerase to stutter at the oligou tract located just before the double-strand stem of the circular structure figure 415c illustrates an experiment to examine the sequence requirements within the panhandle or corkscrew structure influenza virus matures by budding of nucleocapsids through the cell plasma membrane virions are pleomorphic but clinical specimens are primarily filamentous and can be up to a micrometer or more in length upon passage in cell culture most strains eventually give rise to virions that are primarily spherical averaging 100nm in diameter the form that the virions assume is genetically determined studies of a strain of influenza a that remained filamentous after passage in cell culture could be induced to form spherical particles by changes in the m1 protein the significance of filamentous versus spherical particles is unknown but filamentous forms must have a selective advantage in the infected animal whereas spherical forms seem to be selected upon passage in cell culture during assembly the eight genome segments are reassorted in progeny virions if the cell is infected with more than one strain of influenza reassortment to produce viruses with mixed genomes is efficientthe segments are almost randomly reassorted to give all possible combinations of genome segments in the progeny virions this process is analogous to the reassortment of chromosomes that takes place during sexual reproduction in diploid organisms budding must result in the packaging of the 8 different genomic segments that constitute the viral genome into one virus particle if it is to be infectious reoviruseschapter 5 have an assembly mechanism whereby the 1012 different segments are recognized and assorted so that each virus particle has one each of the different segments the case for influenza virus is not completely clear evidence has been presented that the virus appears to package more than 8 segments possibly about 10 that are randomly chosen from the intracellular pool random packaging of 10 segments would result by chance in about 3 of the virions having at least 1 each of the 8 different genome segments however more recent data argue that the virions package exactly 8 segments one each of the 8 different segments for this to occur the packaging machinery has to recognize internal sequences in each of the segments and not just a packaging signal in the conserved ends of the viral rnas influenza a virus infects a wide variety of birds and mammals a phylogenic tree that shows the relationships of the np genes of viruses isolated from humans pigs and birds is shown in fig 416
 the human isolates and the pig isolates are closely related as described later the pig viruses probably originated from a human virus the humanpig clade is distinct from the avian clade however influenza a viruses are characterized by their two major surface antigens ha and na there are 16 different ha subtypes numbered h1 to h16 has in different subtypes differ by 30 in sequence and are not immunologically cross protective there are also 9 different na subtypes numbered n1 to n9 the major reservoirs of influenza a in nature are wild ducks and other waterfowl such as gulls terns and shearwaters and viruses containing all 16 subtypes of ha and all 9 subtypes of na have been isolated from waterfowl influenza replicates in the lung and in the gut of birds and the infection is normally asymptomatic but epidemics of fatal influenza have occurred in turkeys and chickens and the emerging h5n1 virus has caused fatal infection in a number of different bird species ducks can excrete virus in feces for weeks infecting other ducks via contaminated water and a significant fraction of ducks may become infected by the virus in this process migratory ducks then spread the virus around the world normally in a northsouth direction the viruses in birds are in stasis almost no differences in amino acid sequences of the various proteins are present in viruses separated by many de-cades although the nucleic acid sequences encoding these proteins do drift this together with the fact that the viruses seldom cause disease in their avian reservoirs show that influenza in birds is ancient and the virus has adapted to its primary host the gene segments of influenza a virus reassort readily during mixed infection and viruses with new combinations of genes arise frequently newly arising reassortants can cause major epidemics of influenza when introduced into humans a process called antigenic shift not all combinations of genes give rise to viruses that are capable of epidemic spread in humans only three subtypes of ha h1 h2 and h3 and two or three subtypes of na n1 n2 and possibly n8 have been found to date in epidemic strains of human influenza virus the first influenza virus isolated in 1933 was called h1n1 this virus first appeared as the cause of the great influenza epidemic of 1918 see later the virus isolated in the epidemic of 1957 had a different subtype of both ha and na and was called h2n2 the h2n2 virus replaced the h1n1 virus as the cause of influenza epidemics fig 417
 the h2n2 virus was itself replaced by h3n2 virus beginning with the epidemic of 1968 serological surveys suggest that prior to 1918 the virus that circulated was an h3n8 virus that first appeared as the cause of an epidemic in 1890 the reason that only a subset of has appear to be capable of causing epidemics in humans is at least in part the fact that the receptors for the virus are somewhat different in birds and humans sialic acid is linked to galactose predominantly by 26 linkages in humans but by 23 linkages in birds similarly only certain types of the other segments are compatible with infection of and epidemic spread in humans for example the nucleocapsid gene has diverged into five lineages but only one of these lineages is present in viruses isolated from humans see eg fig 416 ns1 is also at least partially host specific and thus only certain ns1s are compatible with human infection other proteins also differ somewhat for optimal replication in birds versus mammals it is thought that reassortment can result in the introduction of a new ha or na gene into a human virus that is a virus whose other gene segments are optimized for human infection the ha and na proteins are the most important antigens of the virus and change of one or both of these antigens gives rise to a virus for which the majority of the human population has no immunity and which is therefore capable of causing a global pandemic one possible scenario is that pigs serve as intermediates mixing vessels in the recombination process because pigs can be infected by both avian and human viruses they contain sialic acid in both 23 and 26 linkage and reassortment could occur in this host influenza a virus is an example of a zoonotic disease in humans the reservoir of the virus is ducks and other birds and human infection is irrelevant for the maintenance of the virus in nature influenza a virus causes a serious human illness influenza it is perhaps confusing and unfortunate that the term flu is often used to describe any respiratory tract infection and at times even infections of the gastrointestinal tract even those that are fairly mild the symptoms of true influenza are usually more severe than those resulting from other respiratory tract infections and include fever headache prostration and significant muscle aches and pains myalgias that last for 36 days weakness and cough can last 12 weeks more the fever can be high 3940c is not uncommon in adults and can be higher especially in children the morbidity that accompanies the disease can cause the patient to remain bedridden for a week or longer in young children the high fever can result in reyes syndrome an encephalopathy that may be fatal the probability of contracting reyes syndrome is higher if aspirin is administered to control the fever lower respiratory tract infection can also occur following influenza infection and result in primary viral pneumonia invasion of the damaged lungs by pathogenic bacteria may follow and result in secondary bacterial pneumonia influenza can be fatal usually because of pneumonia resulting from viral infection whether the pneumonia is due to primary viral infection or more commonly due to secondary bacterial infection fatal infection is more common in the very young whose immune system is not fully developed and in the elderly whose immune system may be waning before the advent of antibiotics bacterial pneumonia killed many following severe bouts of influenza but even today influenza remains a serious killer it has been estimated that influenza virus infects 1020 of the worlds population every year causing five million cases of severe illness and 250000 to 500000 deaths in the united states alone the estimated death rate from influenza in an average year is 2000030000 and can be significantly higher in epidemic years people over 65 are at particular risk from influenza the annual death rate in the united states from influenza a in people over 65 is 1 per 2200 and in an epidemic year the death rate may be 1 in 300 ie 1 of every 300 people over the age of 65 die of influenza during the epidemic the excess mortality caused by influenza is illustrated in fig 417 in which the different strains of influenza a or b responsible for the epidemics are indicated although influenza a is usually the most serious cause of mortality in some years influenza b is more of a problem than influenza a a pandemic of influenza erupted in 1918 due to the emergence of a virulent h1n1 strain this extremely virulent virus swept around the world over a period of about a year and infected an estimated 30 of the worlds population causing 20100 million deaths although the very young and the elderly are normally at the most risk from influenza this influenza pandemic of 19181919 was unusual in that mortality was highest in healthy young adults the age distributions of people dying of influenza and the related pneumonia are compared for the years 1917 and 1918 in fig 418
 the much higher death rates in the young and the el-derly in 1917 the normal pattern is apparent the dramatic increase in the death rate in the 20- to 29-year-old group in 1918 in which people of this age were more likely to die than the old and the young is striking death rates in young adults 1534 years of age were more than 20-fold higher in the 19181919 pandemic than in the preceding years and the death toll in young adults in the united states was high enough that overall life expectancy dropped sharply as illustrated in fig 419
 the overall mortality was perhaps 2 of the world population but in some regions of the world for example regions of central america and certain islands in the pacific 1020 of the entire population died in the epidemic in some remote alaskan villages more than 70 of all adults died usually as a result of the simultaneous incapacitation of the entire population so that supportive care was not available the final death toll can never be known with certainty and estimates vary widely from 20 to 100 million the death toll exceeded that produced by world war i which was ongoing at the time in fact 80 of deaths in the us army during world war i resulted from influenza and it is thought that the final collapse of the german army in 1918 may have been precipitated by widespread influenza in the troops the surgeon general of the united states had expressed the hope that wwi would be the first war in which more us soldiers died of war injuries than died of disease but this hope was shattered by the influenza epidemic descriptions of the epidemic with a focus on its effects on us society are found in the books flu by g kolata americas forgotten pandemic by a w crosby and quite recently the great influenza by john m barry the reasons for the extreme virulence of the 1918 virus and why healthy young people were more likely to die a topic made even more important by the appearance of h5n1 bird flu see chapter 8 have been addressed recently using the power of modern molecular biology the pandemic of 1918 occurred before influenza virus could be isolated however the sequences of all eight gene segments of the 1918 influenza genes have been obtained starting from a number of tissue isolates samples of preserved lung tissue taken at autopsy from two us soldiers who died of influenza in september 1918 in new york and south carolina were found to contain detectable influenza rna albeit in fragmented condition a third source of influenza rna came from an alaskan inuit victim who died in november 1918 and was buried in permafrost and whose body was sufficiently well preserved that lung samples containing fragmented viral rna were obtained two additional sources of influenza sequences come from two victims of influenza who died of pneumonia in november 1918 and february 1919 at the royal london hospital reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction technology was used to obtain sequences from influenza rna in these tissue samples that could be used to reconstruct the complete sequences of genome segments the sequences from these five victims are almost identical and showed that the virus belonged to strain h1n1 the ha genes from these five humans differ by only one to three nucleotides despite the fact that they came from five humans whose deaths were separated by over 7500 miles and several months in time the sequence of this gene places it in the humanswine lineage not in the avian lineage and at the root of the tree leading to later isolates of human or swine influenza fig 420
 thus the ha of the virus does not appear to have come directly from an avian source it is now possible to use reverse genetics to take a cloned dna copy of an influenza gene and rescue a virus containing this gene to do this cells are transfected with up to 17 plasmids that express the 8 genome segments of influenza as well as the rna polymerase proteins pb1 pb2 and pa and the np protein and in some cases the other influenza proteins as well infectious influenza virus is produced and buds from the cell using this system influenza virus has been produced that contains various combinations of the 1918 ha and na genes with other cloned genes from the 1918 virus or from recent isolates including virus that contains the complete complement of the 1918 genes and thus is a complete reconstruction of the 1918 virus various constructs have been tested in mice whereas recent isolates of influenza virus cause only mild disease in mice the 1918 virus causes severe often fatal disease in mice a virus containing only the h1 and n1 of the 1918 virus was found to be highly virulent and caused fatal infection in mice virus grew to high titer in the lungs of the mice and was associated with an influx of neutrophils and macrophages into the infected lung the complete 1918 virus has also been tested under bsl-4 high containment conditions in monkeys as well as mice the virus caused severe usually fatal disease in monkeys that was marked by much higher replication rates and more extensive spread in the lungs it was also marked by an abnormal innate immune response see chapter 10 certain elements of the innate response were attenuated perhaps because of the activity of the ns1 gene which is known to interfere with the immune response in contrast other immune responses in particular inflammatory cytokines were enhanced resulting in a cytokine storm the results are consistent with the hypothesis that in humans the 1918 virus provoked an extreme but unbalanced reaction by the immune system and that healthy young people who have the strongest immune systems suffered from more extensive release of potent cytokines that resulted in more extensive tissue destruction the devastation caused by the 1918 virus raises continuing concern that a strain of influenza of equal virulence might appear and again cause immense suffering worldwide new pandemic strains of influenza appear three or four times a century if a pandemic strain emerged from a virus such as the h5n1 strain of bird flu see chapter 10 which has a very high mortality rate in humans the resulting epidemic could indeed be devastating immunity to influenza a virus following infection is long lived but may not be complete and is subtype specific and even strain specific the continuing appearance of new strains that arise from antigenic drift and of new subtypes that arise from antigenic shift lead to continuing epidemics normally two or three strains of influenza a circulate in the human population at any one time spread from person to person is by respiratory droplets requiring close proximity but people travel extensively and new strains of the virus speed around the globe as they arise antigenic drift is the process by which mutations accumulate in the virus genome usually because of immune selection that result in the development of new strains of the virus these new strains are partially resistant to the immunity induced by infection with previous strains of virus after several years of drift the strain may be sufficiently distinct to cause disease in a person previously infected but the illness is usually less severe because of partial immunity to the new strain however new strains capable of causing serious illness can arise by antigenic shift whereby reassortment results in change of the surface glycoproteins of the virus the reassortants that cause the biggest problems are those belonging to a new subtype as illustrated by fig 417 as described such a new subtype may cause a pandemic in the human population because there is little immunity to the virus carrying these new surface antigens as happened in 1918 h1n1 1957 h2n2 and 1968 h3n2 h1n1 virus which had disappeared with the appearance of the h2n2 epidemic strain in 1957 suddenly reappeared in 1977 this h1n1 virus which first appeared in northern china in may 1977 and was called the russian flu was virtually identical to influenza virus isolated from an epidemic in humans in 1950 it circulated in young people who had not been exposed to h1n1 virus because it was virtually unchanged despite 27 years having elapsed it seems unlikely that it arose again de novo presumably this virus had been preserved in a frozen state probably in a laboratory freezer in 1976 in response to reports that investigators outside western europe planned to develop and test vaccines against h1n1 influenza a who meeting report urged extreme caution in developing live vaccines from epidemic h1n1 strains because of the possibility of spread of the virus one year later the virus reappeared because of the seriousness of influenza disease especially in the elderly attempts are made each year to vaccinate the population at risk because of drift and shift the vaccine must be reformulated every year to reflect the viruses currently circulating in the human population there are three strains of virus included in the most common vaccine an inactivated virus vaccine produced from viruses grown in eggs these are two influenza a viruses and one influenza b virus these viruses are chosen from those that are circulating in late spring because these viruses are usually those that will cause epidemics the following winter the choice must be made by late spring in order to allow time for the pharmaceutical companies to prepare the vaccines and an element of risk is involved that the right choices will not be made the world health organization publishes choices and supplies seed virus based upon the recommendation of an international group of scientists but the final selections are made by individual health agencies and the choices are usually but not always correct the number of vaccine manufacturers has declined dramatically in the united states over the last 2 decades because of legal liability problems and what limited capacity that exists for manufacturing flu vaccine is mostly present in europe production problems by one of the manufacturers has resulted in recent shortages of vaccine the necessity to grow the virus in fertilized eggs also limits the amount of vaccine that can be produced there are efforts to develop a cell culture system for virus production for vaccine use which could then be produced in larger amounts efforts are also being made to develop better adjuvents for use with the vaccine which could reduce the amount of antigen required per inoculation in addition obtaining the reassortants required for vaccine production is a time-consuming endeavor using classical methods of coinfecting cells with two different viruses and searching through the progeny for the wanted reassortants if reverse genetics described earlier can be developed in a way that satisfies the regulatory agencies concerned with vaccine safety the desired reassortants could be obtained much more quickly allowing quicker responses to new strains of virus in addition to the inactivated virus vaccine that is very widely used a new live virus vaccine based on a cold attenuated virus has been licensed recently reassortment is used to introduce the ha and na of the predicted epidemic strains into this attenuated virus because the attenuation of the virus results from changes in other genome segments the recombinant strain is also attenuated the vaccine is administered by nasal spray rather than by injection as is the inactivated virus vaccine to date this vaccine is only licensed for use in people between the ages of 5 and 49 and thus it cannot be used for the populations most at risk for serious illness but clinical trials are continuing it remains to be seen how well accepted this vaccine will be the necessity of reformulating the vaccine every year is inconvenient for a number of reasons including the fact that the vaccine cannot be stored for use in the following years in addition the vaccine is not always effective because wrong predictions were made about which strains of virus would be the biggest problems there is an effort being made to develop universal vaccines that would target all strains of influenza a and b and that would therefore provide protection against all influenza strains and that could be used year after year one possibility that is being pursued is to use influenza a m2 protein as an antigen this protein is highly conserved among all a strains but is not normally seen by the immune system for some reason preliminary studies have shown that this protein linked to hepatitis b core protein is highly immunogenic in mice and provides protection against influenza a infection in mice regardless of strain for influenza b a subunit vaccine based upon the sequence surrounding the cleavage site of the ha precursor which includes a highly immunogenic part of the fusion peptide shows promise in early animal trials continuing surveillance of influenza strains in nature is required in order to reformulate the vaccines each year this surveillance also serves to watch for the possible appearance of another killer strain of influenza an episode that occurred during the ford administration however illustrates the potential difficulties of identifying such a strain and reacting in time in february of 1976 a young soldier at fort dix died of influenza and others became seriously ill tests showed that most of the soldiers were suffering from the avictoria strain of influenza that was epidemic in the united states at the time or from adenovirus infection however the soldier who died and three other soldiers who were ill were infected with an influenza strain that was epidemic in pigs referred to as swine flu serology studies indicated that 200 or more other soldiers had been infected by this virus as well showing that the virus was being transmitted from person to person the swine flu virus was closely related to the 1918 pandemic virus and is thought to have been introduced into pigs in 1918 from humans and to have continued to circulate in pigs after it had died out in humans could it be possible that the 1918 virus had reappeared as an epidemic virus in humans the decision was made by president ford in consulation with leading scientists to begin a crash program to develop a vaccine against swine flu and to begin to immunize the american population it was thought with some justification that to wait for an epidemic to begin before an immunization program was undertaken would mean that it would be too late to be effective given the speed with which influenza epidemics spread further influenza is usually epidemic in winter and the early detection of this virus made possible the preparation of a vaccine before the next winter flu season set in forty million americans were immunized against swine flu no epidemic of swine flu developed however and litigation began the pharmaceutical companies had been reluctant to participate in the program pointing out that at any one time a certain fraction of americans would develop encephalitis or rheumatoid arthritis or any one of hundreds of other diseases if disease developed in proximity to receiving a new and relatively untested vaccine a lawsuit would certainly follow and the potential damages were enormous the program could only advance when congress agreed to indemnify the pharmaceutical houses the vaccine was never conclusively shown to cause disease although there seemed to be a slight increase of guillain-barr syndrome following inoculation litigation went on for years and substantial damages were paid out in retrospect it is easy to criticize the program as an overreaction but what would have been the reaction if nothing had been done and an influenza epidemic developed that resulted in 50100 million americans becoming seriously ill with 12 million deaths given the state of knowledge at the time many leaders felt there was no choice further the decision to vaccinate was not so different from current policy where strains of influenza a circulating in the spring are incorporated into a vaccine to be given in the fall a quote from the us surgeon general at a meeting of the association of state and territorial health officiers in 1957 is worth thinking about i am sure that what any of us do we will be criticized either for doing too much or for doing too little a recent scare began when 18 people in hong kong became seriously ill from influenza in 1997 and 6 died the culprit was an avian influenza h5n1 that was epidemic in birds being sold in the markets for food avian viruses do not normally infect people and there was fear that an avian virus had made the jump to humans and might cause an epidemic of lethal influenza the hong kong authorities destroyed 16 million domestic birds in order to eradicate the epidemic in birds no human-to-human transmission took place and the virus disappeared in 2002 however h5n1 virus reappeared and by 2006 it has spread throughout asia and into africa and europe this virus has a mortality rate of about 50 in humans and more than 140 people have died of h5n1 infection as of this date there is no person-to-person transmission to date but there is concern that the virus might mutate and cause a wide and devastating pandemic of influenza this subject is considered at more length in chapter 8 humans are the reservoir of influenza b virus it causes influenza in humans but there exists only one subtype and antigenic shift does not occur antigenic drift does occur and the virus can cause epidemics of serious illness that result in increased mortality particularly among the elderly as shown in fig 417 for this reason the current strain of circulating influenza b is included in the annual flu vaccine however wide-ranging pandemics do not occur and the virus is therefore not as much of a problem as influenza a less attention has accordingly been given to the study of this virus influenza c is not a serious human pathogen and has been even less well studied thogoto virus is present in regions of africa southern europe and asia it is a tick-borne virus that is primarily known from infection of livestock such as cattle camels and sheep there is significant amino acid sequence identity between some of the thogoto proteins and their counterparts in influenza so these viruses are fairly closely related it has only six genomic segments however human infection is known to occur in endemic areas infectious salmon anemia virus infects salmonid fish atlantic salmon are particularly susceptible to the virus and the virus is a particular problem for fish farming farm populations can suffer 100 mortality in outbreaks the virus has eight gene segments the genomes of representative viruses belonging to the five genera of the bunyaviridae are illustrated in fig 421
 all bunyavirus genomes consist of three segments of rna referred to as small medium and large that together total from 11 to 19kb depending on the virus table 410
 the s segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein m the two surface glycoproteins and l the polymerase protein in addition viruses belonging to three of the genera encode two nonstructural proteins nss in segment s and nsm in seg-ment m replication of bunyavirus genomes and the synthesis of mrnas take place in the cytoplasm the l protein and n protein are required components of the rna synthesis machinery like influenza viruses these viruses engage in cap-snatching in order to prime mrna synthesis in bunyaviruses however the caps are captured from cytoplasmic mrnas rather than from nuclear pre-mrnas the promoter for mrna synthesis and for rna replication involves nucleotides located at both ends of the genomic template which are complementary and form hairpin circles but with some unpaired nucleotides that are thought to be important recognition signals table 411
 thus as with many other rna viruses the viral rna polymerase must interact with both ends of the rna template in order to initiate synthesis and complementarity between nucleotides at the 5 and 3 ends is required for promoter recognition the terminal complementary sequences are highly conserved within each genus of bunyaviruses but differ between genera table 411 perhaps because of this reassortment occurs only between viruses belonging to the same genus during initiation of mrna as studied in hantaviruses the l protein cleaves the 5-terminal 718 nucleotides from a cellular mrna cleavage is after a g residue which pairs with the c residue at position 3 the primer is elongated by a few residues and there is then a backward shift of 3 nucleotides so that the mrna attached to the primer begins precisely at the 3 end of the template this prime and realign strategy fig 422
 works because of the repeat triplets at the 3 end of the rna template table 411 transcription continues to near the end of the template but the termination of an mrna does not appear to be precise and the exact mechanism used for termination of the mrnas is not known no polya is added to the 3 end of the mrna upon its release and thus the mrnas are capped but not polyadenylated during replication of the genome an exact complementary copy called crna or vcrna is produced this rna serves as a template for producing genomic rna and in the case of ambisense segments for producing the mrna for producing the ambisense-encoded protein the switch to replication is assumed to use the same mechanisms as used by other rna viruses the s segment of bunyaviruses encodes one or two proteins fig 421 in the hantavirus and nairovirus genera s encodes only n in the other genera s encodes both n and nss using one of two different mechanisms in the genus orthobunyavirus the two proteins are translated from a single mrna using two different start codons in different reading frames the coding region for nss is completely contained within that for n in the phleboviruses and tospoviruses however an ambisense coding strategy is used for the two proteins ambi  both in this strategy the two genes encoded in a genomic segment are linked tail to tail so that they are in different polarities as illustrated in fig 423
 the gene for n is present at the 3 end of the genomic s segment in the minus-sense orientation and synthesis of the mrna for n occurs from the genome segment expression of this gene occurs early because its mrna is synthesized from the entering genome by the polymerase activity present in viral nucleocapsids the gene for nss is plus sense within the genome but the genomic rna does not serve as mrna instead an mrna for nss is synthesized from the antigenomic rna thus nss is expressed late because its mrna can only be made after replication of the incoming genomic rna to produce the antigenomic rna termination of either mrna occurs at a secondary structure between the genes for n and ns which appears to cause the polymerase to fall off and release the mrna n has a number of functions in viral infection it encapsidates the viral rna interacts with l to synthesize viral rnas and is believed to interact with one of the glycoproteins during virus assembly in at least some viruses the protein also modifies cellular metabolism presumably antagonizing antiviral defenses of the cell or otherwise subverting cellular processes to support viral replication the n protein of hantaviruses which is larger than those of other bunyaviruses except for that of the nairoviruses interacts with a number of cellular proteins the best studied of these are proteins in the small ubiquitin-like protein sumo pathways such as ubc-9 which conjugates sumos to proteins sumo-1 itself and daxx to which sumos are conjugated sumolation of proteins is an important regulatory process in cellular metabolism the nss protein of rift valley fever virus and presumably of other viruses as well inhibits host mrna synthesis including the mrna for interferon- and - thus it suppresses the host immune response and is a major virulence factor two glycoproteins at one time usually called g1 and g2 but now called gn and gc are translated from mrna made from m fig 421 they are produced as a polyprotein that is cleaved by a cellular protease to separate the two glycoproteins analogous to what happens in some of the rna viruses that have envelopes eg coronaviruses and flaviviruses gn is n terminal in the polyprotein and gc is c terminal where studied the enzyme responsible for the cleavage is a subtilase ski-1s1p or a related enzyme gn and gc form a heterodimer that is transported to the golgi apparatus virus budding occurs at the golgi membrane heterodimerization recalls the processes that occur in the assembly of alphaviruses and flaviviruses and like e1 or e of these viruses respectively the gc protein is a class ii fusion protein the m segments of hantaviruses and nairoviruses encode only the two glycoproteins but in the other three genera m encodes a third protein called nsm fig 421 and table 410 in phleboviruses and members of the genus bunyavirus nsm forms part of the polyprotein translated from the single mrna produced from m nsm is formed during posttranslational processing of the polyprotein in tospoviruses an ambisense strategy is used to encode nsm and the translation strategy is the same as that shown in fig 423 the function of nsm is not known there is no matrix protein in bunyaviruses budding at the golgi membrane is assumed to involve a direct interaction between the glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid protein the virion is spherical 80120nm in diameter the three nucleocapsids are circular when isolated from the virion there are about 50 currently recognized species in the genus orthobunyavirus of which the majority have several distinct strains that are often given separate names together these viruses have a worldwide distribution most of these viruses are mosquito-borne although some are tick-borne and some may be transmitted by culicoid flies or phleboto-mines they are true arboviruses replicating in the arthropod vector as well as in vertebrates bunyamwera virus the prototype member of the genus was first isolated in uganda in 1943 it causes a febrile illness accompanied by headache arthralgia rash and occasional nervous system involvement there are 24 named subtypes in the bunyamwera serogroup of interest is a reassortant virus isolated during an epidemic of hemorrhagic fever in kenya and somalia in 1998 rift valley fever virus was responsible for some of the cases but many were caused by a bunyavirus whose l and s segments were derived from a bunyamwera virus but whose m segment came from a different bunyavirus this reassortant virus named garissa virus thus caused a disease different from bunyamwera virus perhaps due to the different properties of the m segment viruses belonging to the california encephalitis group of which la crosse virus is the best known are also of medical interest la crosse virus was named for the town of la crosse wisconsin where it was first identified as the causative agent of encephalitis primarily in children about 100 cases per year of encephalitis are caused by la crosse virus concentrated in the midwest mortality is low 03 but 10 of patients suffer neurological sequelae no vaccine exists for the virus and control measures have involved control of the mosquito vector the principal vector of la crosse is aedes triseriatus this mosquito breeds in tree holes but abandoned tires filled with rainwater constitute an important breeding area for it close to human habitation such abandoned tires serve as a beautiful incubator for the development of mosquito larvae and efforts to eliminate this source of mosquitoes as well as the institution of other mosquito control measures has resulted in a reduction in the number of cases of disease abandoned tires are important in the transmission of other arboviruses as well old tires are abundant in puerto rico for example and contribute to the endemic transmission of dengue virus all four serotypes of which are present on the island old tires have also been responsible for the introduction into the united states of aedes albopictus the so-called asian tiger mosquito that is the vector of dengue virus in asia loads of old tires that were brought from asia to houston for recycling contained eggs or larvae of the mosquito after its introduction into the houston area this mosquito spread over large areas of the united states and there is fear that it might become an efficient vector of arboviral disease in this country the ictv currently recognizes 9 species of phleboviruses but there are an additional 16 tentative species many of the species have a number of strains that are given their own names all are arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes phlebotomine flies or ticks the most important of these is rift valley fever virus an african virus that was first isolated in 1930 in the rift valley of east africa the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes hemorrhagic fever in humans it also causes disease in domestic animals and many widespread epidemics in cattle sheep and humans have occurred over the years in africa in 19771978 for example an epizootic in egypt infected 2550 of cattle and sheep in some areas and 200000 human cases resulted in at least 600 deaths a more recent large epidemic in east africa in 19971998 was associated with the heaviest rainfall in 35 years 60100 times normal in some areas as described before the epidemic was caused by rift valley fever virus and by garissa virus losses of 70 of sheep and goats and 2030 of cattle and camels were reported and there were hundreds of cases of human hemorrhagic fever contact with livestock was statistically associated with acute infection with rift valley fever virus indicating that during epidemics contact transmission becomes important as a means of spread to humans laboratory-acquired cases contracted through aerosols are also known sand fly fever virus is transmitted by phlebotomine flies and causes an acute nonfatal influenza-like disease in man it is found in the mediterranean area north africa and southwest asia related viruses are found in south america the nairoviruses have a much larger genome than members of the other genera primarily because the l segment is twice the size of those of the other genera of animal viruses table 410 they are named for nairobi sheep disease virus now considered a strain of dugbe virus there are seven species recognized all of which consist of multiple strains with distinct names the viruses are tick-borne although a few can also be transmitted by culicoid flies or mosquitoes nairobi sheep disease virus causes acute gastroenteritis with hemorrhagic symptoms in sheep and goats with mortality rates over 90 in some populations it was first identified as the causative agent of the disease in 1917 and is transmitted by the tick rhipicephalus appendiculatus humans can be infected by the virus but suffer only mild illness there is a close relative of the virus called ganjam virus present in india which also causes disease in sheep and goats it is transmitted by the tick haemaphysalis intermedia crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchf is the most important nairovirus in terms of human disease it was first identified in the 1940s in the crimean region of the former ussr and in the democratic republic of congo the virus is now known from at least 30 countries it is found from southern africa through eastern europe and the middle east to western china the principal vector is hyalomma ticks but dermacentor and rhipicephalus ticks can also transmit the virus sheep goats cattle ostriches wild herbivores and hares become infected by cchf but most infections result in subclinical disease in contrast infection of humans results in severe hemorrhagic fever with a 30 mortality rate humans are infected by the bite of a tick or by contact with blood or tissues of infected livestock transmission to hospital personnel treating infected patients has occurred there are 22 species of hantaviruses currently recognized and as with other genera of the bunyaviruses many of the species have a number of named strains many hantaviruses cause serious human disease including hemorrhagic fevers and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome unlike other members of the bunyaviridae they are not arboviruses the hantaviruses are associated with rodents which form their natural reservoir and are transmitted to humans through contact with aerosolized urine or feces from infected rodents each hantavirus establishes persistent infections in one particular species of rodent and is maintained in nature in this way humans are not an important host for the virus and do not contribute to its maintenance in nature related to this is the fact that the viruses do not cause serious disease in their rodent hosts but many cause quite serious illness in humans an evolutionary tree of hantaviruses is shown in fig 424
 the rodent hosts for the viruses are also indicated the viruses assort by host rather than by geographical proximity all of the viruses whose hosts belong to the order murinae group together as do those that use rodents in the order arvicolinae and those that use rodents in the order sigmodontinae as one example consider prospect hill virus and new york virus both found in the northeastern united states prospect hill virus is associated with rodents of the genus microtus order arvicolinae and is more closely related to puumala virus of europe which uses clethrionomys glareolus order arvicolinae than it is to new york virus new york virus is associated with rodents in the genus peromyscus order sigmodontinae and is closely related to sin nombre virus of the southwestern united states which is associated with peromyscus maniculatus the fact that the evolutionary tree of the hantaviruses resembles that of their rodent hosts rather than being based on geographical proximity is evidence that they have coevolved with their rodent hosts over a very long period of time the first of the hantaviruses to be identified was the causative agent of more than 3000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome now called korean hemorrhagic fever that occurred in us troops during the korean war the virus was called hantaan virus after a river in the area where it was isolated in korea hantaan virus is associated with the field mouse apodemus agrarius the virus also occurs in eastern europe and china where it is associated with apodemus flavicollis and causes a disease similar to korean hemorrhagic fever fig 425
 viruses related to hantaan virus have now been isolated from all over the world including the americas many old world viruses cause hemorrhagic fever in humans and more than 100000 cases occur worldwide with a case fatality rate between 01 and 10 depending on the virus puumula virus occurs in western europe fig 425 and causes a disease characterized by acute fever with renal involvement seoul virus first identified in seoul korea is associated with wild urban rats rattus norvegicus and has been found all over the world because wild urban rats have been inadvertently
introduced almost everywhere it causes a mild form of korean hemorrhagic fever in seoul but does not cause apparent illness in most other areas where it has been found the discovery of seoul virus led to an intensive study of rats in central baltimore where it was found that a high percentage of them were infected with seoul virus and furthermore that a substantial fraction of the people living in the slums of downtown baltimore showed evidence of infection by hantavirus no disease is known to be associated with this virus but statistical studies suggest that infection may lead to high blood pressure and possibly renal failure the new world hantaviruses that cause disease in humans cause a syndrome called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome or hps which has a fatality rate of 2040 the first such virus to be identified was sin nombre virus which caused an epidemic of hps in the four corners area of the united states in 1993 that resulted in about 25 deaths the virus is associated with the deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus sin nombre virus or related viruses have now been identified in virtually all states within the united states and into latin america and fatalities due to infection by the virus have occurred in many states one of the cases in california is of interest because the person died more than a year before the four corners epidemic retrospective studies of serum collected from the patient at the time of his hospitalization showed that he was infected with a hantavirus the number of cases of hps in the americas from 1993 to 1998 totaled by country and the names of the viruses responsible in various areas are shown in fig 426
 of interest is andes virus which has the potential for human-to-human transmission the mortality rate following infection with sin nombre virus or its close relatives is close to 50 the mortality in the earliest cases was even higher because the pulmonary syndrome results from the rapid extravasation of fluids into the lungs which can result in respiratory death this loss of fluids from the intravascular compartment also leads to an increase in the hematocrit the percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells early attempts to decrease the hematocrit by supplying fluid intraveneously simply exacerbated the pulmonary edema even with the best treatment today however the mortality rate is still very high it is clear that hantaviruses are widely distributed around the world and have been present in their rodent hosts for a very long time although many are capable of causing serious illness in man the number of human cases is fortunately small however there is always the fear that one of these viruses might acquire the ability to spread more readily from human to human and thereby become a more serious problem the genome organization of an arenavirus is illustrated in fig 427
 arenavirus genomes consist of two segments of rna naturally called large and small both genomic rnas are ambisense in character the s segment corresponds to the bunyavirus s and m segments linked tail to tail in an ambisense arrangement fig 41 the l segment corresponds to the l segments of bunyaviruses but with the addition of a second gene encoding a protein called z in an ambisense orientation expression of the encoded genes follows an ambisense strategy as described for some of the bunyaviruses the mrna for one gene is synthesized from the genomic rna and is expressed early whereas the mrna for the second gene is synthesized from the antigenomic or vcrna and is expressed late fig 427 as in the bunyaviruses synthesis of arenavirus mrna occurs in the cytoplasm using a primer that is snatched from cellular mrnas there is a secondary structure in the rna between the two ambisense genes that causes termination of transcription and the mrnas are not polyadenylated the genomic s rna is the template for synthesis of the mrna for n and n is therefore expressed early after for the synthesis of infection because n is required for the replication of the viral rna as is the case for all rna viruses this arrangement is necessary if the virus is to replicate the mrna for the glycoproteins g1 and g2 is transcribed from the antigenomic copy of s and is therefore expressed late the glycoproteins are produced as a polyprotein that is cleaved in a process that is similar to what happens in the bunyaviruses there is an n-terminal signal sequence that leads to the insertion of the precursor called gpc into the endoplasmic reticulum the signal sequence is removed by cellular signalase the resulting precursor is cleaved by the cellular subtilase ski-1s1p the same enzyme that processes the hantavirus glycoprotein precursor into the n-terminal gn sometimes called g1 or gp-1 and the c-terminal gc sometimes called g2 or gp-2 gn and gc remain associated as a heterodimer only gc has a transmembrane anchor and the process thus resembles what happens in ha of influenza or f of paramyxoviruses where a type i glycoprotein is cleaved into n-terminal and c-terminal subunits that remain associated by noncovalent bonds producing the glycoproteins late has the effect of delaying virus assembly this allows rna amplification to proceed for an extended period of time before it is attenuated by the incorporation of nucleocapsids into virions attenuation of rna synthesis is also effected by the z protein in the case of the l segment the mrna for protein l is produced early by synthesis from the genomic rna proteins l and n are necessary and sufficient for rna replication and this orientation of the genes is necessary for virus replication the mrna for protein z mrna is transcribed from the antigenomic and thus z is expressed late after replication of the rna begins z is a small protein of about 11kda that has multiple functions in viral replication it has a ring finger motif and binds zinc it downregulates rna replication and the synthesis of mrnas it is also required for budding of virions in fact expression of z in the absence
of other viral proteins results in the formation of virus-like particles and z has a role in budding analogous to the role played by the m proteins of other rna viruses or the gag protein of retroviruses it has been found that z recruits a cellular protein called tsg101 to the site of budding tsg101 has been shown to be required for budding of at least two arenaviruses of hiv and of ebola virus tsg is a component of the vacuolar protein sorting machinery of the cell and is therefore active in promoting cellular budding pathways z was originally thought to be a nonstructural protein and was called ns it is now known to be present in the virion the stoichiometry of proteins in virions of lassa virus was found to be 1160606020 for lngngcz lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv the prototype virus of the family is associated with the house mouse mus domesticus and mus musculus this virus is widespread in europe along with its host and spread to the americas with the inadvertent introduction of the house mouse by european travelers lcmv has been intensively studied in the laboratory as a model for the arenaviruses in part because it is less virulent for humans than many arenaviruses and in part because its natural host is widely used as a laboratory model for animal work mice are small reproduce rapidly and there is a great deal of experience in maintaining this animal in the laboratory lcmv is widespread often being present in colonies of laboratory mice even without overt introduction it is also present in wild mice and may be present in pets such as hamsters lcmv infection of humans usually results in mild or even inapparent illness although serious illness can result with occasional mortality in a recent incident a woman had been infected with lcmv from a pet hamster she suffered no apparent illness from the viral infection but died of an unrelated cause a stroke her liver lungs and kidneys were harvested for transplantation transplantation of liver lungs and kidney requires immunosuppression so that the transplanted organs are not rejected three patients receiving the liver lungs and a kidney developed overwhelming infection by lcmv and died a fourth patient who received a kidney also became quite ill from lcmv infection but survived aided by reduction in the immunosuppressive drugs being given the rodent reservoir of lassa virus is mastomys natalensis lassa virus causes outbreaks in west africa of an often fatal illness in humans called lassa fever the mortality rate averages 1015 but may be as high as 60 in some outbreaks the virus has a broad tissue tropism and symptoms include fever myalgia and severe prostration often accompanied by hemorrhagic or neurological symptoms development of hemorrhagic symptoms indicates a poor prognosis and death often follows fatal infection is also characterized by higher viral loads survivors of severe infection often suffer nerve damage and may be deaf because of such damage the full extent of lassa disease is not known because most africans infected by the virus do not seek help and there is little monitoring of the disease however estimates range from 100000 to 300000 cases per year lassa virus was first isolated in 1969 when a nurse in a rural mission hospital in nigeria became infected she was transported to jos nigeria where several health care workers became infected serum samples were sent to the united states and a well-known virologist at the yale arbovirus research unit dr jordi casals became infected with the virus while working with it and became very seriously ill he eventually recovered but later that same year a technician in another laboratory at yale became infected with lassa fever virus and died whereupon yale ceased to work with the virus the containment facilities in 1969 were not of the quality of those in current use and virologists in those days literally took their lives in their hands when working with dangerous agents the study of virology owes a great deal to the courage exhibited by these earlier workers lassa has been imported to the united states on at least one occasion in the form of a viremic individual a resident of chicago attended the funerals of relatives in nigeria who had died of lassa fever and became infected there on return to chicago he began suffering symptoms of lassa fever but the local hospitals were unable to diagnose the cause of his disease being unfamiliar with it he eventually died of lassa fever but fortunately there were no secondary cases several south american arenaviruses belonging to group b are very important disease agents because they cause large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates the names of a number of these viruses and the places where they are found are shown in fig 428
 they include junn virus causative agent of argentine hemorrhagic fever machupo virus bolivian hemorrhagic fever guanarito virus venezuelan hemorrhagic fever and sabi virus cause of an unnamed disease in brazil the diseases caused by these viruses are often referred to as emerging diseases because the number of human cases has increased with development and expanding populations the increasing number of cases results from development of the pampas or other areas for farming bringing humans in closer association with the rodent reservoirs furthermore the storage of grain near human habitation results in an increase in the local rodent population and plowing of the fields leads to the production of aerosols which may transmit the disease to humans an attenuated virus vaccine against junn virus has been developed and is widely used in populations at risk the vaccine is effective and has reduced dramatically the number of cases of argentine hemorrhagic fever no vaccines are in use for the other viruses however three arenaviruses have been isolated in the united states whitewater arroyo virus present in the southwest bear canyon virus in california and tamiami virus present in florida fig 428 none of these viruses all of which belong to group a had been known to cause illness in humans until very recently in 19992000 three californians died following infection by whitewater arroyo virus the disease these three suffered was ards acute respiratory disease syndrome although two also had hemorrhagic manifestations thus like the hantaviruses the us arenaviruses may cause isolated cases of serious illness there are also a number of group b viruses in south america table 412 but these are not known to cause disease in humans many viruses belonging to several different families have been described that cause hemorrhagic fever in humans table 413
contains a listing of many of these viruses these viruses include members of the arenaviridae bunyaviridae filoviridae and flaviviridae many cause severe disease with high mortality but although the disease is severe with the exception of some arenaviruses survivors have few sequelae the dramatic symptom of profuse bleeding has excited the purple prose of many lay authors best illustrated by recent discussions of ebola virus and struck terror in native populations with the exceptions of yellow fever virus and junn virus there are no vaccines and treatments are primarily supportive although ribavirin therapy holds some promise for arenavirus disease human-to-human transmission is uncommon where limited transmission has occurred it has been by exposure to contaminated blood or possibly exposure to other bodily fluids and resulted in limited epidemics for such viruses as ebola and machupo virus as has been described all rna viruses share a number of features these include virion structure enveloped viruses with helical nucleocapsids mechanisms for replicating the genomic rna replication within rnp which requires ongoing protein synthesis self-complementarity of the ends of the rna with its implications for promoter elements involved in replication mechanisms for synthesis of mrna synthesis of leaders or the use of primers for synthesis of mrna the presence of intergenic sequences and the suite of proteins encoded these similarities make it seem likely that all rna viruses have diverged from a common ancestor fairly recently on a geological timescale certainly more recently than the divergence of the extant plus-strand rna viruses from a common ancestor the rna viruses are much more divergent in structure and in the strategies used for replication and expression of the genome suggesting that they have had a much longer period in which to diverge from one another although the suite of proteins encoded is very similar in all rna viruses the rate of evolution of rna viruses is so fast that little sequence identity can be demonstrated between different groups however where studies have been performed evidence for common origin of at least some of these proteins has been shown as an example the m proteins of vsv and influenza virus are related and have diverged from a common ancestor it seems likely that most of the various proteins are related in this way although it is clear that some viruses have genes that are not represented in all viruses and which presumably arose by recombination events that led to the insertion of new functions or to deletion events that resulted in a virus with fewer genes or probably to both because the rna viruses appear to be more recent than the rna viruses it is reasonable to postulate that they arose from the rna viruses if so one obvious candidate for the ancestor is a coronavirus like the rna viruses coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a helical nucleocapsid that synthesizes rna leaders and use primers to prime mrna synthesis traits in which the coronaviruses differ from other rna viruses if the rna viruses did arise from the rna viruses what traits might account for their success once they arose one obvious possibility is the ability to synthesize individual mrnas for each protein needed this trait also carries with it the necessity to include the rna synthesis machinery in the virion but the ability to control the order of synthesis and the translation frequency of the different proteins has obvious advantages for control of the replication cycle the rna viruses with segmented genomes also have the ability to undergo ready reassortment which is clearly advantageous in the orthomyxoviridae and probably important for all viruses with segmented genomes rna viruses that infect animals do not have segmented genomes except for a few insect viruses with bipartite genomes for reasons that are not clear rna viruses of plants with segmented genomes are common however it is perhaps suggestive that the rna viruses have not been as successful in plants as they have been in animals and the rna plant viruses that do exist also replicate in arthropods which serve as vectors for transmitting the virus to plants  plenary lectures the molecular epidemiology of enteric protozoan infec- tions-emerging issues and paradigm shifts r thompson c andrew paul bates  in recent years a variety of issues have emerged concerning the epidemiology of zoonotic protozoan infections that result from the ingestion of environmentally resistant infective stages they have many features in common regarding their transmission which can be direct or via water or food and most exhibit low host specificity although they have been the subject of research for many years recent studies have raised fundamental questions concerning our understanding of the epidemiology of infections with these parasites giardia and blastocystis both have wide host ranges and are genetically very divergent yet how this variability is reflected in terms of zoonotic potential clinical significance and virulence is not clear with cryptosporidium many taxonomic and epidemiological questions have been resolved but recent studies have not only questioned cryptosporidiums phylogenetic affinities but have also revealed new aspects about its life cycle and development these findings will have a major impact on both surveillance and control in the case of toxoplasma recent studies in domestic animals and wildlife have raised questions about how the parasite is maintained in nature in particular the role of vertical transmission in wildlife populations may have been underestimated in the case of blastocystis entamoeba coli chilomastix and dientamoeba they have been largely

emphasis on how molecular tools and epidemiological studies can help resolve these questions leishmania and sand flies parasite-vector co-evolution or opportunism liverpool school of tropical medicine pembroke place liverpool uk leishmaniasis is an emerging and re-emerging disease in several parts of the world one of the principle areas of investigation that helps us to understand a change in disease epidemiology are the key biological factors responsible for disease transmission for vector-borne diseases like leishmaniasis an understanding of vector specificity and the mechanics of transmission are two such key factors recent work in several laboratories has shown that leishmania and sand flies provide a range of examples from both ends of the spectrum with regard to vector specificity for example leishmania major and phlebotomus papatasi appear to be a very specific parasitevector combination and co-evolution has driven the molecular differentiation of a specific ligand on the surface of the parasite that binds to a corresponding galectin on the wall of the sand fly midgut thus p papatasi is a representative member of a group that can be called the restricted vectors of leishmaniasis at the other extreme lies lutzomyia longipalpis which transmits l infantum in central and south america there is now strong evidence that this parasite has only very recently been introduced into the americas from europe in last few hundred years probably when european colonists brought l infantuminfected dogs to america lutzomyia longipalpis was already there and was adopted as a vector by the incoming parasites taking over from p perniciosus and p ariasi found in southern europe all of these vectors belong to a second group the permissive vectors of leishmaniasis although in nature they usually only transmit one particular species of parasite this wwwelseviercomlocatemeegid appears to be more due to ecological constraints rather than any intrinsic barrier as under laboratory conditions they can support the development of many species of leishmania thus this parasite-vector combination can be regarded as a case of evolutionary opportunism current work is being pursued to investigate the molecular basis of this opportunism once the parasite has established an infection in a particular sand fly it must then overcome the challenge of transmission by bite how can the parasite travel against the flow of an incoming bloodmeal recent work has shown that a gel-like material secreted by parasites in the sand fly gut plays a key role in promoting transmission the so-called promastigote secretory gel psg creates a blocked fly that cannot feed properly this material must be egested by regurgitation before bloodfeeding can proceed thereby egesting the infective parasites at the same time this mechanism of transmission appears to be common amongst the leishmania parasite-vector combinations examined so far it may have evolved either before or after the specialisation of individual leishmania species to a particular vector thus representing either a conserved or convergent evolutionary response what lies ahead for se asia leishmaniasis may remain a relatively rare disease but the emergence of an epidemic of cutaneous leishmaniasis in sri lanka in the past 5 years cases of visceral disease in thailand and reports of leishmaniasis in kangaroos in australia all illustrate that complacency is dangerous as the examples mentioned above show both parasites and vectors have shown themselves capable of adapting to new circumstances either by the spread of a well-established parasite-vector combination due to changes in ecology or the establishment of a novel parasite-vector partnership virology and molecular microbiology unit department of pathology faculty of medicine ramathibodi hospital mahidol university bangkok 10400 thailand in post-genomics era we have found the additive effect of individual genetic variations in loci encoding metabolic enzymes drug transporters cell surface markers and cellular growth and differentiation factors may play a significant role in the variability of response and toxicity of a number of drugs the one-size-fits-all regimen of antiretroviral treatments results in interpersonal variation in drug concentrations and differences in susceptibility to drug toxicity many of the antiretrovirals are metabolized by polymorphically expressed enzymes cytochrome p450 cyp450 glucuronyl transferase gt andor transported by drug transporters abc and slc families the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nnrtis nevirapine and efavirenz are metabolized primarily by cyp2b6 the associations have been identified between a frequent cyp2b6 variant g516t and nnrti pharmacokinetics greater plasma efavirenz exposure was predicted by cyp2b6 g516t and recent data suggest that g516t also predicts nevirapine exposure study the effect cyp2b6 polymorphism in mother-to-child hiv transmission of single-dose nevirapine is currently studied in thailand the clearest asso-ciation between genetic variants and response relates to the hypersensitivity reaction that occurs with abacavir the identification that the major histocompatibility complex haplotype acts as a strong genetic predisposing factor which can be translated into a pharmacogenetic test however much more work needs to be done to define the genetic factors determining response to antiretroviral agents in thailand pharmacogenomics project was established in 2003 study of allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium of markers in drug related genes loci are relevant to the objective of this project we genotyped 1536 haplotype tagging snps known polymorphic sites in 182 drug

hasnain 12  niyaz ahmed 1 1 pathogen evolution group centre for dna fingerprinting and diagnostics hyderabad india 2 university of hyderabad hyderabad india mycobacterium tuberculosis leptospira and helicobacter pylori are some of the bacterial pathogens that trigger diseases with a complex interplay between infection dynamics pathogen biology and host immune responses the whole genome sequence determination has greatly facilitated our understanding of these pathogens tuberculosis is the disease with a highest morbidity and mortality worldwide the disease haunts millions of people in india with a huge death rate the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of the underlying m tuberculosis strains are largely unknown in the context of this country that has earned dubious distinctions for tuberculosis prevalence our ongoing large-scale analysis of hundreds of strains of tubercle bacilli highlighted a clear predominance of ancestral m tuberculosis genotypes in the indian subcontinent compared to other regions of the world and support the opinion that india is a historically ancient endemic focus of tuberculosis it is hypothesized that such ancient bacilli are relatively docile than some of the highly killer ones such as the highly disseminating beijing types which harbor inherent propensity to acquire multiple drug resistance mdr and are spreading in india through major metropolitan cities beijing strains are likely to evade and replace ancestral reservoirs of m tuberculosis in the country if that happens india will probably face large institutional outbreaks involving hospital wards prisons schools etc this is perhaps a major issue that needs to be addressed in the post-genomic scenario with the same magnitude of zeal that researchers have shown towards drug discovery and diagnostic or vaccine development leptospirosis is another major pestilence a worldwide zoonosis caused by the spirochetes of the genus leptospira the leptospires have been extremely diverse pathogens having more than three hundred different strains or serovars with specific geographic distribu-tion but this enormous inventory of serovars based mainly on an ever-changing surface antigen repertoire throws an artificial and unreliable scenario of strain diversity it is therefore difficult to track strains whose molecular identity keeps changing according to the host and the environmental niches they inhabit and cross through to address this problem we have developed highly sophisticated genotyping systems based on integrated genome analysis approaches to correctly identify and track leptospiral strains these approaches are expected to greatly facilitate epidemiology of leptospirosis apart from deciphering the origins and evolution of leptospires in a global sense the human gastric pathogen h pylori is presumed to be co-evolved with its human host and is again a very highly diverse and robust pathogen our geographic genomics study tests the theory that h pylori existed in humans as a benign bacterium for thousands of years until it acquired some virulence factors from the microorganisms abundant in the human societies of the neolithic period after the domestication of agriculture and livestock we found traces of east asian ancestry in the gene pool of native peruvian strains amerindian this finding supports ancient human migration across the bering-strait 20000 years bp we also attempted to support the idea that the major single virulence factor of the bacterium the cag pathogenicity island cagpai was acquired during different times at different places in the world and from a local microbial source we followed this with theoretical approaches to find significant overlap among the h pylori population expansion time and domestication of agriculture in the world this study provides some new insights into the ancient origins and diversity of h pylori and the significance of such diversity in the development of gastroduodenal pathology why has this bacterium survived for this long time in humans does this association makes the colonization beneficial or of low biological cost these are the questions that need to be answered in the near future viral population size is a key element in the risk assessment of the emergence in humans of a pandemic prone h5n1 avian influenza virus laboratory for urgent response to biological threats institut pasteur paris france the surge of the global avian influenza epizootic caused by genotype z h5n1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses hpaivs has posed numerous questions in particular to risk managers and policy makers scientific knowledge is limited on many aspects of the ecology and environmental properties of hpaivs in particular h5n1 in addition to being an animal health issue with strong impact on human nutrition and socioeconomics consequences the current widespread epizootic has spilled over as a human health issue indeed some 250 zoonotic cases of h5n1 infections have been reported worldwide since the end of 2003 current h5n1 hpaivs are however poorly transmissible from domestic birds to humans and need specific conditions to achieve this passage besides virus transmission between humans is rare and extremely inefficient this is due to two probable main reasons 1in humans h5n1 hpaivs find their preferred receptor structures terminal sialic acid moieties in a 23 bonds in the lower respiratory tracts particularly in alveolar cells 2their optimum temperature of replication is higher than the temperature of the upper parts of the human respiratory tract these facts could make it difficult for the virus to reach its proper targets in humans during the contamination process and could confine the virus deep in the lungs without possibility of easy exit necessary for virus transmission in the past new virus subtypes emerged in the human population either by reassortments between humanmammalian and avian influenza viruses as probably happened around 1957 and again around 1968 or by accumulation of point mutations as probably occurred with the precursor of the spanish influenza virus indeed some residues have been pointed out as important for the adaptation to new hosts and their accumulation could pave the way to a virus adapted to humans 1amino acid aa 627 on pb2 is probably involved in temperature dependence 2aa 223 in the haemagglutinin is involved in binding to terminal sialic acid moieties which vary from one host species to another and within a host species from one tissue to another other determinants probably in the np or ns genes may greatly contribute to viral adaptation to their hosts influenza viruses are present in the form of quasi-species ie populations of viral genomes bearing point differences between them viral diversity increases the probability of a group of minority viral genomes to harbour a set of mutations directly involved in an increased viral capacity for human-to-human transmission viral diversity depends both on virus intrinsic variation capabilities and viral population size influenza virus polymerase complexes are error prone and generate frequent point mutations when a virus succeeds in changing host its mutation rates seems generally higher in the new host from a phylogenetic viewpoint this is also true among birds when an avian influenza virus aiv jumps from a duck species to chickens or turkeys in the past the hypothesis has been raised according to which precursor viruses would pre-exist in their current host where they acquire the necessary set of mutations through a hypermutation mechanism this would be due to a polymerase complex with an error rate higher than that of other viruses following the acquisition of point mutation mutator mutations affecting the enzyme fidelity in vitro studies using avian-like influenza a h1n1 viruses introduced in the pig population in germany during the early 1980s suggest that there is no such thing as mutator mutations their conclusion was that the increased viral diversity was linked more to the global size of the virus population rather than to an enhanced mutation capacity of the virus applying this to the h5n1 current situation it is probable that the animal host demographic factor especially in domestic flocks is a critical factor in viral diversity for example the poultry population increased from 11 billions in 1980 to 49 billions in 2002 in china only offering a possibility of vast virus populations present at any one time in domestic poultry virus global maintenance in nature is a key element to understand its population dynamics data from the literature on aiv worldwide and long-term cycles in birds and in the environment are rather limited and there is a lot more to understand using a virus population approach and basing it on sequence variation data it should be possible to estimate the risk of a set of mutations to occur and thus the risk of viral emergence by accumulation of point mutations sakuntabhai a laboratoire de la gntique de la prdisposition aux maladies infectieuses institut pasteur 28 rue du dr roux 75015 paris france malaria has exerted considerable selective pressure on the human genome most notably apparent in the prevalence of hemoglobin mutations in regions endemic for malaria epidemiological studies in regions of high malaria endemicity have consistently shown that the severity of disease considerably decreased after the first years of life whereas parasite prevalence and incidence remain high throughout adolescence and only decrease slowly in adults knowledge of the relationship between parasite infection and disease remains one of the major enigmas of malaria epidemiology no clear picture of the mechanisms underlying naturally acquired immunity to malaria or disease transmission have yet emerged we carried out a human genetic study of two well-defined cohorts in whom malaria parameters were recorded longitudinally from two continents senegal and thailand the major difference apart from genetic background between the two cohorts is the presence of plasmodium vivax in thailand we first estimated genetic effect for each phenotype as quantitative traits by mean of variance component we found that number of clinical malaria attacks for the three species p falciparum pf p vivax and p ovale and trophozoite density of pf are significantly under human genetic influence in addition human genetic factors showed significant effect on gametocytogenesis of pf which may influence transmission of the disease we performed genome screening linkage analysis and tested the effect some known and candidate genes we confirmed the previous finding of linkage on chromosome 5q31 pfil1 with parasite infection level we found a new region on chromosome 5p15 which showed linkage to clinical pf attacks both in senegal and thailand there are genes involved in complement activation cytokines etc we planned to perform systematic screening of this region using information from the public database defining risk to pathogenic infections utilizing the hap-map database and broad based screens to discover host susceptibility genes to infectious diseases tive against human fascioliasis including two main axes a transmission and epidemiology studies b control activities by mainly treatments with triclabendazole egaten 1  a singledose highly effective drug results obtained during the last years have furnished numerous hitherto-unknown aspects and new information which have given rise to a complete new general picture of this disease explaining why human fascioliasis has recently been included within the list of important human parasitic diseases fascioliasis is the vector-borne disease presenting the widest latitudinal longitudinal and altitudinal distribution known recent studies have shown it to be an important public health problem human cases have been increasing in 51 countries of the five continents recent papers estimate human infection up to 17 million people or even higher depending from the hitherto unknown situations in many countries mainly of asia and africa major health problems are known in andean countries the caribbean northern africa and western europe in asia the area of most concern is the region around the caspian sea iran and neighbouring countries moreover data from the beginning of this new century indicate that south-east asian countries may also be seriously affected with around 500 cases in the 2002 2003 period and up to 2000 cases from the beginning of 2006 to nowadays in vietnam when comparing different human endemic areas a large diversity of situations and environments appear fascioliasis in human hypo-to hyperendemic areas appear to present in the different continents a very wide spectrum of transmission and epidemiological patterns related to the very wide diversity of environments this large diversity indicates that once in a new area where the disease is emerging studies must be performed from zero and shall comprise a multidisciplinary approach to assess which kind of epidemiological pattern are we dealing with within this multidisciplinarity molecular epidemiology studies become crucial molecular markers developed during recent years shall be applied to both liver flukes from humans and animals and to freshwater lymnaeid transmitting snails in order to establish which combined haplotypes are involved in the disease transmission locally in asia molecular epidemiology studies performed in the area around the caspian sea show that the transmission pattern may be very complicated due to the overlapping of both f hepatica and f gigantica the appearance of intermediate fasciolid forms and the participation of lymnaeid vector species belonging to different groups as radix galbafossaria stagnicolines and pseudosuccinea a similar situation may be expected throughout other asian regions as in vietnam and neighbouring countries the flukesnail host species specificity factor plays a fundamental role although the domestic animal fauna mainly livestock mainly sheep cattle buffaloes goats donkeys and pigs but sometimes also sylvatic herbivorous mammals as lagomorphs and rodents are also worth noting molecular techniques as dna target sequencing single nucleotide polymorphisms snps and microsatellites are of great help to assess the transmission patterns and origins of human contamination in the way to establish the appropriate individual prophylaxis and general control measures centre for nephrology university college london royal free campus rowland hill street london nw3 2pf uk the immune response to pathogens is dependent on the presentation of microbial peptides by human leukocyte antigens hla to t cells and natural killer nk cells the genes encoding hla and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors kir are highly polymorphic this diversity has functional implications and is likely to be driven by microbial selection acting on hla and kir gene loci different ethnic groups vary in their hla and kir allele profiles which in turn can act as highly informative correlates of ethnicity in anthropological studies the analysis of hla and kir gene profiles in ethnic thais has revealed that this major ethnic group is highly representative of the overall gene pool within the large populations of mainland se asia thus this geographic region is most suitable for largescale population-based genetic epidemiological studies of emerging infectious diseases such as hiv-1 and dengue which are of increasing public health concern hla and kir association studies with hiv-1 have been performed in numerous ethnic groups a variety of effects have been observed particularly with hla-b57 -b27 and -a11 molecules there is evidence that the diversity of hiv-1 clades and recombinants infecting different populations is being driven by immune responses controlled by polymorphic hla molecules such an effect may well be responsible for the prevalence of hiv-1 clade e or the crf01ae recombinant in the ethnic thai cambodian khmer and vietnamese kinh populations while hiv-1 clades b and c and recombinants thereof have seeded predominantly into the more northern sino-tibetan-burman populations of this region by contrast all four of the major dengue virus serotypes are known to circulate in mainland se asian populations there is evidence in ethnic thais that the outcome of exposure to dengue virus in previously exposed and immunologically primed individuals associates with hla-a2 -b5 and -b15 molecules depending on the dengue serotype responsible for secondary infections taken together these studies are of relevance to the design testing and implementation of new vaccine control programmes in populations at risk of exposure to hiv-1 and dengue develop new and effective antimalarial agents and understand the molecular basis of drug resistance in malaria parasites so far resistance in malaria has been found to be associated with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in the gene ie pfmdr1 n86y and pfcrt k76t are associated with quinoline resistance whereas pfdhfr n51i c59r s108n and i164l correlated with resistance of antifolate antimalarial drugs the dhfr of p falciparum  pfdhfr represents one of the most well-defined drug targets in malaria research on pfdhfr including gene cloning expression generation of mutants resistant to inhibitors and structural studies during the past two decades has contributed tremendously towards the understanding of antifolate binding and molecular mechanism of antifolate resistance in malaria studies of malarial dhfr will be discussed with respect to the interactions to malarial thymidylate synthase ts domain the results could provide insights into better understanding of how effective inhibitors could be developed in order to overcome malaria resistance works in wss laboratory have been supported by tdr grants environmental change infectious disease emergence and dengue department of tropical medicine medical microbiology and pharmacology university of hawaii manoa 651 ilalo steet biosciences building 320 honolulu hi 96813 usa regional environmental change driven largely by globalization and population growth with associated increases in resource consumption and waste generation plays a primary role in the emergence of infectious disease especially in tropical developing regions associated land use and transformation of resource production urbanization agricultural expansion and intensification and natural habitat alteration have produced changes in ecological systems notably in landscapes and in turn their natural communities and ultimately in their pathogen animal host and human populations thus the altered host-pathogen dynamics facilitate novelty including exchange of genetic material among pathogens resulting in rapid adaptation by the pathogens and more frequent generation of novel pathogen variants some will be more virulent infective andor capable of enhanced transmission contributing to disease reemergence or emergence factors related to public health infrastructure and climate variability and their interactions with regional environmental change also contribute significantly to disease emergence dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf is possibly the clearest case of disease re-emergence and emergence associated with regional environmental change specifically urbanization failure to effectively control of denguedhf in many regions argues for new approaches that integrate research on the vector pathogen human and environment within a defined ecosystem classical ecological concepts are key to understanding population community and ecosystem level dynamics influencing disease emergence but more recent advances and research tools in evolutionary ecology are also fundamental to understanding both vector and pathogen transmission dynamics that underlying emergence integrating this research with social ecological concepts represents a promising new transdisciplinary approach to dengue control symposium coevolution host pathogen 1 1 peopling of south america and south asia insights through helicobacter pylori genomics centre for dna fingerprinting and diagnostics cdfd hyderabad 500076 india the human gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori is co-evolved with its host and therefore origins and expansion of multiple populations and sub populations of h pylori mirror ancient human migrations ancient origins of h pylori in the new world and in india are debatable it is not clear how different waves of human migrations in these large continents contributed to the evolution of strain diversity of h pylori we tried to address these issues through mapping genetic origins of h pylori of native peruvians of amerindian ancestry and indians and their genomic comparison with hundreds of isolates from different geographic regions for this purpose we attempted to dissect genetic identity of strains by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism faflp analysis multilocus sequence typing mlst of the seven housekeeping genes atpa efp urei ppa muty trpc yphc and the sequence analyses of the babb adhesin and oipa genes the whole cag pathogenicity-island cagpai from these strains was analyzed using pcr and the geographic type of caga phosphorylation motif epiya was determined by gene sequencing in case of south american h pylori populations we observed that while european genotype hp-europe predominates in native peruvian strains approximately 20 of these strains represent a sub-population with an amerindian ancestry hsp-amerind all of these strains however irrespective of their ancestral affiliation harbored a complete western type cagpai and the motifs surrounding it this indicates a possible acquisition of cagpai by the hsp-amerind strains from the european strains during decades of co-colonization our observations therefore suggest presence of ancestral h pylori hsp-amerind in peruvian amerindians which possibly managed to survive and compete against the spanish strains that arrived to the new world about 500 years ago we suggest that this might have happened after native peruvian h pylori strains acquired cagpai sequences either by new acquisition in cag-negative strains or by recombination in cag positive amerindian strains in case of indian strains almost all the isolates analyzed revealed a european ancestry and belonged to mlst genogroup hp-europe the cagpai harbored by indian strains also revealed european features upon pcr based analysis and whole pai sequencing these observations therefore suggest that h pylori in india have ancient origins in europe highly similar mlst and cagpai genotypes observed for ethnically and linguistically diverse indian people might argue for a european-central asian root of population expansion in the indian subcontinent predominance of genogroup hp-europe in india amidst non-existence of other genogroups such as hp-africa and hp-east asia point to the fact that the strains of former type carried a special fitness advantage in indian stomachs possibly conferred by complete and intact western type cagpais to outcompete endogenous strains if any these results also might potentate speculations related to large-scale replacement of the ancient indigenous people of india by outsiders bringing first neolithic practices and languages from the fertile crescent and central asia 2 a genomics approach to understanding host response during dengue infection genome institute of singapore group leader infectious disease genome institute of singapore 02-01 genome building 60 biopolis street singapore 138672 singapore dengue infection results in a wide clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic through fever df to the life threatening complications hemorrhagic fever dhf and shock syndrome dss although we now understand that factors such as repeat infections and the type or magnitude of the host response are important in determining severity the mechanisms of these actions remain largely unknown understanding this hostpathogen interaction may enable outcome prediction and new therapy options developments in biology now allow a systems approach to be applied to this problem utilizing whole genomes of both human and virus in vitro and in vivo to enable a more complete picture of their interplay to be built up we have developed a whole genome approach to viral sequencing to increase efficiency and enable large numbers of genomes to be completed together with a web-based interpretation tool we have also applied human genome expression arrays to characterize the types of host response made to the different viruses and also investigate the role of host variation using human whole genome genetic association studies these technologies have identified novel host pathways involved in viral replication and also host immune responses such as the interferon signaling pathway that are influenced by viral sequence and thus viral evolution 3 taming of host innate response by a potential biothreat agent burkholderia pseudomallei department of microbiology faculty of science mahidol of university bangkok thailand burkholderia pseudomallei is a facultive intracellular gramnegative bacillus classified by cdc as a category b agent it not only has potential for bioterrorism but also causes potentially fatal septicemia in humans and animals we have previously shown that b pseudomallei is able to survive and replicate in mouse macrophage cell lines escape into the cell cytoplasm and induce cytoplasmic protrusion leading to direct cell-to-cell spreading the bacteria induces cell fusion resulting in multi-nucleated giant cell formation and apoptotic cell death the macrophages infected with b pseudomallei exhibit reduced and delayed formation of tnf-a and fail to stimulate inos and no production thus allowing the bacteria to survive intracellularly one of the mechanisms responsible for the depressed response is most likely associated with a failure to induce ifn-b production required for phosphorylation of stat1 and induction of irf1 the latter is one of the transcription factors needed to turn on the inos gene on the other hand we can favorably modulate host cell response by using immunomodulating agents eg cpg oligodeoxynucleotide that can boost up its innate immunity by enhancing inos production increasing uptake and intracellular killing capacity of the macrophages b pseudomallei may also produce negative regulator that in turn turns off a subsequent host cell response to these stimuli we recently demonstrated that b pseudomallei could readily induce the expression of negative regulators that interfere with host cell response to interferon-g stimulation thus allowing the bacteria to escape killing by the activated phagocytes furthermore we now have additional information from dna microarray study using affymetrix chips with human lung epithelial cell line infected with b pseudomallei there was a down regulation of il-6 il-8 and the adhesion molecule icam-1 when compared with cells infected with its avirulent counterpart altogether the data strongly indicate that b pseudomallei successfully modulate host innate response for its own survival inside the infected host 4 the human emr1 gene is under strong balancing selection and may have a role in susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis genome institute of singapore singapore one third of humanity is infected by mycobacterium tuberculosis and more than two million people die from the infection each year and yet despite this awful toll only a tenth of the infected billions will ever succumb to or even exhibit symptoms of the disease this bespeaks a major role for genetic variability in determining the outcome of tb exposure and infection identifying the relevant genetic variation has stymied investigators for some time with most progress to date arising from studies of severe mendelian mycobacterial susceptibilities in a preliminary analysis of two distinct data sets comprised of 1 10000 snps distributed throughout the human genome and genotyped in 42 active tuberculosis cases matched with 42 household and community controls and 2 110000 snps genotyped in 111 active cases and 116 controls we have seen statistically significant associations among numerous snps one of the genes that has been strongly implicated in our study is emr1 this unusual gene is a member of the egf-tm7 family of receptors that are predominantly expressed by cells of the immune system in the course of resequencing this gene to search for putatively functional variants that could be involved in the tb disease process we observed patterns of genetic variation that were strongly suggestive of natural selection shape variation of the wing of aedes aegypti was examined in three isofemale lines a b and c under controlled laboratory conditions during ten generations the landmark coordinate data were collected from cross veins and junctions for morphometric analysis to quantify shape variation we used the metric disparity index known to be independent of sample sizes statistical comparisons were performed by non-parametric tests bootstraps it was assumed that isofemale lines had been founded by parents having different genotypes and that no new genotypes appeared during the 10 generations of follow-up metric disparity was scored across lines within a given generation and across different generations within a given line it was shown that the metric disparity index behaved as expected for an indicator of genetic diversity increasing when mixing different lines not increasing when adding individuals of the same line in addition a simple classification tree of the total sample showed that even after 10 generations the wings were clustered into three groups according to the initial founders this study suggests a genetic basis for wing geometry of a aegypti the epidemiological interest of wing shape behaving as a genetic character would be to help in detecting natural patterns of population structuring at a low cost in the same way three experimentally isolated lines were recognized by individual wing traits it is expected that any isolated field population could also be detected similar conclusions were obtained previously on various old laboratory lines of a aegypti in asia the anopheline biodiversity is very rich and the main malaria vectors belong to complexes in which species are morphologically indistinguishable recent advances in systematics and molecular identifications have allowed a clarification of phylogenetic relationships and a simplification of species identification among and within the sibling species or anopheles groups this is of primordial importance for applying appropriate vector control programs the presentation of the latest data on the main malaria vectors in southern asia will highlight the importance of precisely identifying the species assessing relationships among members of complex and testing phylogenetic hypotheses involving closely related anopheles species to conduct adequate and efficient vector control strategies the minimus complex is widely distributed on the asian continent and is composed of two species considered as malaria vectors in se asia this complex belongs to the funestus group which comprises 27 closely related species distributed in africa and in asia based on molecular and morphological characters and a complete phylogenetic work a new systematic scheme was recently presented which reflects the evolutionary relationships within species of this group the sundaicus complex is distributed along the coast of asia and is known as one of the main malaria vector in southern asia recent molecular works on this complex have allowed the recognition of at least three species for which phylogeographic evolutionary scenario will be presented along with the malaria risk linked to specific human activities other anopheles complexes with major malaria vectors will be mentioned such as the dirus fluviatilis and culicifacies in relation to systematics and malaria transmission 7 from population structure to genetically engineered vectors new ways to control vector-borne diseases school of agriculture food and rural development newcastle university agriculture building newcastle-upon-tyne ne1 7ru uk epidemiological studies on ticks and the pathogens they can carry such as lyme disease are showing some correlations between infection rates and biodiversity highlighting the dilution effects on potential vectors while other studies comparing sympatric small rodent species demonstrated that rodent species transmitting more pathogens are parasitized by more ectoparasite species further studies on host dispersion also showed some impacts on genetic diversity in the ticks with some other comparisons between tick sex location and genetic flows within these ectoparasite populations however other studies highlighted no evidence in gene flows in ornithodoros coriaceus and a far more complex situation with ixodes uriae the ongoing sequencing of ixodes scapularis vector of the lyme disease spirochaete borrelia burgdorferi the zoonotic babesia microti and the hge agent now part of the anaplasma phagocytophilum complex furthermore complementing results in genetic improvement in mosquitoes genetic markers sexing genetic sterilization and fail-safe systems will also increase performance as it has already been shown in field applications in developing countries recent results have greatly improved the fitness of genetically modified insects compared to wild type populations with new approaches such as the post-integration elimination of transposon sequences stabilising any insertion in genetically modified insects encouraging results using the sterile insect technique sit highlighted some metabolism manipulation to avoid the viability of offspring from released parent insect in the wild if necessary recent studies on vector symbionts would also bring a new angle in vector control capabilities these new potential approaches will improve the levels of control or even in some cases would eradicate vector species and consequently the vector-borne diseases they can transmit this paper will review the work on different genetic approaches to understand host pathogen interface in vectors and new genetically modified techniques used to control them in order to compare the genetic diversity among populations of two main vectors of dengue in thailand aedes aegypti and a albopictus were collected from several sites including urban rural and forested areas of bangkok nakhonpathom khonkaen chiangmai and kanchanaburi province various methods were used such as ovitrap landing catch andor aspirator in addition a albopictus from france was also collected and manipulated compared with the thai populations all adult mosquitoes were species identified and kept at 20 8c until processed dna extraction was carried out using a classical extraction buffer as previously described collins 1987  molecular characterization and genetic lineages identification were done among all collected sample populations by using three genetic markers including the mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenase subunit 5 nd5 fragment the nuclear ribosomal dna second internal transcribed spacer region its2 and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase i coi aligned sequences of a aegypti and a albopictus genes from six localities were compared pairwise the preliminary result showed marqued differences in nucleotide composition among aedes mosquito populations of nakhonpathom province as compared to the others this study reveals information on divergence of dengue vector from endemic areas and will help to understand vector competence and efficiency in transmitting the virus furthermore it will serve as an informative knowledge on the species dispersal modalities and mean for implementing control strategies keywords genetics aedes aegypti aedes albopictus thailand france student symposium canine monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by ehrlichia canis is veterinary importance worldwide in thailand there has been little information available on e canis and its phylogeny the objective of this study was to characterize and establish molecular structure and phylogeny of thai ehrlichia and anaplasma strains ehrlichia-positive blood samples of dogs were extracted for genomic dnas 15 kb pcr products of 16s rrna gene were obtained using designed genus-specific primers for ehrlichia and anaplasma nearly complete sequences of the 16s rrna gene were compared with other sequences available in the genbank database percentage of similarity as well as secondary structure analysis of 16s rrna sequences indicated that they are new e canis and a platys strains phylogenetic analysis revealed that two strains of thai e canis were closely related and formed a single cluster within the cluster amongst previously published e canis from different countries a platys found in this study showed close relation-ship with earlier report of a platys in thailand this report represents the first molecular characterization of e canis in dogs from thailand leishmaniases are severe diseases affecting humans and animals caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the leishmania genus and transmitted by female sandflies bites these parasitoses are widespread over all continents except antarctica nowadays leishmaniases still pose considerable public health problems at present it is suggested and even admitted that leishmania species present a basically clonal population structure associated to rare sexual recombination events however such a statement mostly relies on population genetics studies that may be criticised the markers used were little adapted lack of resolution or dominant markers and clonality was inferred from the analysis of linkage disequilibria across loci that are far from ideal in that respect leishmania braziliensis is an important leishmaniasis agent in south america the principal objective of our work was to study the population structure and reproductive mode of this species in peru and bolivia and for the first time using microsatellite markers on the whole 124 human isolates 68 from peru and 56 from bolivia were genotyped on 12 microsatellite loci various population genetics tests were applied the results obtained appear in contradiction with a simple clonal propagation indeed strong homozygosities found at each locus associated to strong linkage disequilibria across loci advocated for an inbred reproductive strategy further analyses suggest that a significant part of the high heterozygote deficits observed in our samples is likely the consequence of a wahlund effect ie the coexistence of strongly differentiated genetic entities within each sample this work brings key information concerning the biology of these organisms and opens new prospects on the study of this species and other members of the genus cystic fibrosis cf is the most common genetic condition among caucasians eighty percent of people with cf are infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa by adulthood and most die from complications arising from chronic lung infections p aeruginosa is widespread in various environments including hospitals it was once generally accepted that individual cf patients acquired p aeruginosa from their environments and thus each patient carried their own unrelated or unique strain recently however clonal or epidemic strains have been reported in europe and australia in this study dna restriction fragment length polymorphisms rflp of p aeruginosa isolates from 112 patients attending an adult cf clinic at royal prince alfred hospital in sydney australia were analysed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pfge cluster analyses were performed using computer-aided software gelcompar ii isolates sharing a similarity greater than 85 defined by the dice coefficient with a position tolerance of 10 and an optimisation of 10 were considered as a clone the dna fingerprint of each isolate from the same clone had up to a three-band difference which confirmed their close relatedness two major clones aes-1 and aes-2 were isolated from 38 and 5 of 112 patients respectively there is a 66 similarity between aes-1 and aes-2 clones the aes-1 strain had an identical dna banding pattern with a previously reported melbourne epidemic strain the aes-2 strain was also identical to an epidemic strain reported from brisbane known as a pulsotype ii aes-1 isolates were significantly more resistant to gentamycin amikacin and timentin 1 than non-clonal isolates reflecting treatment difficulties these strains have not been detected from the environment suggesting that person-to-person transmission may play a role in such cases these results have led us to implement a segregation policy in our clinic as well as emphasising the important role of molecular typing in infection control annual outbreaks of influenza cause substantial morbidity and mortality and also cause heavy economic losses in recent years the threat of a human influenza pandemic has increased considerably as humans have become susceptible to infection by the avian influenza virus h5n1 however our current understanding of influenza and the ability to evaluate the threat are limited several important issues including the influence of climate variability on influenza epidemic patterns and intraspecific and interspecific interactions between various circulating influenza types subtypes and strains have not yet been sufficiently studied in this study we explored the immunological dynamics and epidemiological dynamics of influenza using our host immune unit-virus-susceptible hvs model by matching model output to epidemiological patterns identi-fied in surveillance data collected from united states we found that three types of interspecific competitions between influenza a and b influenza a subtypes h1 and h3 and new and circulating strains are essential to depict phylogenetic patterns of influenza the study therefore illustrates the population dynamics of the emergence circulation and elimination of new influenza variants subtypes or strains two of the most striking attributes of rna viruses are their small genome size the average rna virus is only 9 kb long and their high mutation rate it has been argued that these attributes are linked with genome size being limited by the accumulation of deleterious mutations in a long stretch of rna genome size is also linked to mutational robustness which can be thought of as the local gradient of the adaptive landscape around its peak sharper peaks represent less robust genomes where mutations have a proportionately greater negative effect on fitness viruses with larger genomes should evolve to be more mutationally robust because on average they can expect to experience more mutations per round of replication we investigate the relative mutational robustness of rna viruses by measuring the amount of gene overlap most rna viruses have some nucleotides that code for more than one protein by being in two overlapping reading frames in such viruses some mutations will therefore affect more than one gene and hence will have an increased negative effect on viral fitness we analysed the sequences of 700 viral species correcting for phylogenetic non-independence and found that -as predictedgene overlap is strongly negatively correlated to genome length furthermore in the relative abundance of different frameshifts we find evidence for two evolutionary processes having been at work new genes being created in other frames within older genes and creeping overlap between originally contiguous genes that happen to be in different frames we propose two simple evolutionary models to explain these processes orientia tsutsugamushi is the causative agent of scrub typhus infection and is a major cause of human disease in rural areas of south east asia seventeen in vitro isolates of o tsutsugamushi from patients with scrub typhus disease in north-eastern and western thailand between 2003 and 2005 were examined to determine phylo-temporal and phylo-geographic relationships between the samples implications for diagnosis were also investigated phylogenetic analysis of the entire 56 kdatype-specific antigen gene 16 kb found that the majority 1117 647 of the isolates clustered within karp genotype and 4 of 17 235 isolates within the gilliamkawasaki cluster two isolates grouped with each of the historical thai isolates ta763 karp-like and ta716 kato-like twodimensional cross-binding of patient antibody reactivity against o tsutsugamushi isolate antigens demonstrated relationships similar to 56 kda gene nucleotide sequence results with distinct differences between the binding of gilliamkawasaki antibodies and karp antigens results from 56 kda genetic analysis demonstrates a karp type strain dominance similar that reported in studies from 1960s and 1970s there were no clear geographical associations from this study however more isolates are required to confirm this observation the majority of scrub typhus vaccine candidates are based on the 56 kda protein of karp type strain and the results presented here demonstrate that karp type strain should be a major component of a future vaccine however it is unclear what is the efficacy of such a vaccine with other type strains 15 sequence analysis of the c-terminal region of merozoite surface protein-1 of plasmodium falciparum pfmsp-119 and p vivax pvmsp-119 as vaccine candidate antigens among iranian clinical isolates in this study we analyzed the sequence variation of the cterminal region of merozoite surface protein-1 of plasmodium falciparum pfmsp-119 and p vivax pvmsp-119 genes as the most promising blood stage vaccine target antigens in 70 p vivax and 92 p falciparum infected blood samples collected from areas with different malaria endemicity in iran the presence of polymorphism in this region may compromise its use as a vaccine candidate all p vivax samples have shown 100 conserved sequences among northern and southern isolates however the mad20 allele was found significantly among p falciparum clinical isolates in south furthermore mad20 allelic type showed four different allelic forms while the k1 allelic type showed no polymorphism these results are discussed with regards to evaluation of these vaccine antigens in both malaria species and in compare with the studies that were conducted in other areas in southeast asia and africa such study would complement this information and would allow comparing the iranian p falciparum and p vivax populations with those found in distinct and contrasting epidemiological settings the first subunit malaria vaccine tested in humans was based on the plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein pfcsp the t-cell helper epitopes th2r and th3r found in the carboxylterminus region included in some vaccine formulations showed sequence diversity which could be a potential problem for vaccine efficacy the aim of this study was to define the nature and extend of pfcsp genetic polymorphism in isolates collected from patients in iran the data would complement information obtained in other endemic settings a total of 21 complete and 69 partial pfcsp sequences were derived from isolates collected in the south-eastern hypoendemic area of iran although nine different allelic forms were observed in the 21 complete sequences they were mainly due to variation in the repeat units number and arrangement whereas only two haplotypes were noted for the combined th2r th3r epitopes for each of which only two allelic variants were noted comparison of the 3 0 -end region of all 90 sequences revealed only one more th2r variant and a total of five combined haplotypes of which three were dominant and two only found in a minority of samples collected from non-iranian patients who acquired the infection abroad thus the pfcsp gene of the parasites circulating in iran displays a very low level of diversity these results contrast with observations made in africa but are akin to those observed in other regions papua new guinea thailand and brazil despite the ability to treat tuberculosis and the continued decline of mortality rates tuberculosis continues to have a detrimental impact on the quality of life for many aboriginal people in northern canada where morbidity rates remain high in a small isolated community the rate of tuberculosis is 60 times higher than that of the average canadian aboriginal population previous research demonstrated that significant differences exist in the frequency of cytokine gene polymorphisms maintained by distinct aboriginal and caucasian populations in manitoba the den are a discrete aboriginal cultural group and recent analysis has shown that this group maintains a high frequency of cytokine gene polymorphisms tnfa il-6 ifng il-10 tgfb related to an effective th2 immune response but a less effective th1 response to infectious diseases in addition the den have a high frequency of gene polymorphisms in the vitamin d receptor gene which may in part contribute to their susceptibility to tuberculosis this presentation will describe the analysis of a panel of purported tuberculosis-susceptibility genes vitamin d receptor and cytokine snps from a northern canadian den cohort the den have a unique history and prehistory in relation to other northern canadian aboriginal populations and as a result they have preserved their cultural identity and along with that their distinct immunogenetic profile that is well adapted to a specific pathogen environment 18 malaria plasmodium agent induces alteration in the head proteome of their anopheles mosquito host host behavioural changes induced by parasites that increase the likelihood of parasite transmission has long captured the interest of parasitologists and behavioural ecologists for instance in pathogens-insect vector systems several studies support the idea that pathogen manipulates the behaviour of their vectors such as feeding behaviour in a way that increase the contact with the vertebrate host and hence favour the parasites transmission despite increasing evidence of such behavioural changes the underlying mechanisms causing infected vectors to act in ways that benefit pathogen transmission remain enigmatic in most cases here 2d difference gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry were employed to analyse and compare the head proteome between malaria plasmodium berghei infected mosquitoes and uninfected mosquitoes anopheles gambiae this proteomics approach detected 12 protein spots in two cohorts of mosquitoes with altered levels in the head of sporozoite infected individuals these proteins were subsequently identified using mass spectrometry and functionally classified as metabolic synaptic molecular chaperone signalling and cytoskeletal proteins our results indicate an altered energy metabolism in the head of sporozoite infected mosquitoes some of the up down regulated proteins identified such as synapse associated protein 14-3-3 protein and calmodulin have previously been shown to play critical roles in the central nervous

mechanisms underlying behavioural modifications and offer new insights into the study of intimate interactions between plasmodium and its anopheles vector nf-kb is a key transcription factor that has been implicated to play a crucial role in host survival during infection by pathogens therefore it has been a priority of many pathogens to manipulate the cellular nf-kb activity in order to create a favorable environment for their survival inside the host in this report we provide evidence for a novel mechanism of inhibition of nf-kb activity which is mediated by the major capsid orf2 protein of the hepatitis e virus heterologous expression of the orf2 protein in human hepatoma cells was found to inhibit ikba ubiquitination by interfering with the assembly of the scf btrcp complex thus resulting in stabilization of the cellular ikba pool with a concomitant reduction in the activity of nf-kb and its downstream targets nf-kb inhibitory activity exhibited by the orf2 protein was found to depend on its ability to retrotranslocate from the endoplasmic reticulum er to the cytoplasm where it was observed to be stably present further retrotranslocation of the orf2 protein was dependent upon the glycosylation status of the protein mediated in a p97 dependent pathway and independent of ubiquitination of the former the orf2 protein therefore exploits the er associated degradation pathway to gain access to the cytoplasm where it interferes with the ikba ubiquitination machinery leading to inhibition of host cell nf-kb activity keywords retro-translocation nf-kb er stress erad

chaiyaroj 1 candida albicans is one of the most important opportunistic dimorphic fungi responsible for hospital acquired fungal infection in humans generally candidiasis rarely occurs in healthy individuals but it is frequently associated with patients who receive immunosuppressive drug therapy or long-term catheterization and patients who suffer from aids navarro-garcia et al 2001  to date there are neither effective vaccines nor therapeutic protocols to eradicate these fungal infections we therefore utilized immunomics approach to assist in the identification of the fungal immunoprotective epitopes first a molecular database of c albicans virulence factors called candivf was developed url httpantigeni2ra-staredusgtemplar db-candivf the database contained 153 virulence proteins of c albicans it also provided a t-cell epitope predictive algorithm called hotspot hunter which was previously developed by our group hotspot hunter facilitated the prediction of promiscuous peptides that can bind specifically to eight supertypes of hla-drb1 drb10101 0301 0401 0701 0801 1101 1301 1501 in order to verify t-cell epitope prediction by hotspot hunter secretory aspartyl proteinase 2 sap2 was selected as a study model sap2 was a c albicans common antigen during infection and capable of inducing ige-mediated allergic reaction in atopic individuals suenobu et al 2002  primary sequence analysis revealed that sap2 contained two different sequences groups 1 and 2 a total 40 conventional overlapping peptides of sap2 20-mer overlapped 10-mer in length were then synthesized all peptides were used to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells form hla-drb1 specific blood donors to determine the proliferative response eleven of eighteen peptides within the prediction areas were able to induce pbmcs proliferation however when anti-il-2 elispot assay was used to confirm the cell proliferation result only two of eleven peptides stimulated significant t-cell activation outside the predictive areas peptide 11 could induce proliferation of il-2 producing clone in one donor of hla-drb10404 the use of immunomics can assist the identification of immunoprotective eptiope and the development of a potential peptide-based vaccine keywords immunomome immunomics t-cell epitope database and candida albicans despite remarkable advances in medical research and treatments during the 20th century infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide the main causes for this phenomenon are 1 emergence of new infectious pathogens 2 re-emergence of old infectious diseases have reappeared after a significant decline in incidence and 3 persistence of intractable infectious pathogens indeed the previous decades have been marked by several striking episodes of emerging and re-emerging pathogens such as hiv marburg virus hepatitis c virus hantavirus ebola virus west-nile virus dengue virus yelow fever virus and more recently sars coronavirus and avian flu new infectious diseases continue to evolve and emerge according to the center for disease control and prevention in atlanta 70 of emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic pathogens in order ta anticipate the measures to be taken to prevent or control future epidemics considerable attention has recently been directed to emerging and re-emerging infections at national and international level httpeurowhoint surveillance to adopt the appropriate containment measures towards emergent pathogens fast sensitive and reliable diagnostics are key element nucleic acid amplification is widely used for the detection and identification of pathogens one of the main problems for pathogens detection in clinical but also in environmental samples is that they generate false negative results this problem is mainly due to three reasons presence of inhibitors absence of a universal extraction method lack of a rapid and reliable pathogen concentration methodology the above-mentioned disadvantages would be compensated by the use of a very sensitive method consisting of a matrix-bound apoh which has a particular property to fix a broad panel of pathogens interestingly apoh strongly interacts with various viruses such as hbv hcv orthopoxviruses dengue virus hantavirus h5n1 west nile which are either endemic or emerging diseases in south-east asia 22 capture and concentration of orthopox virus using apoh coated nanomagnetic beads for ultrasensitive detection nancy ernst 12  jana rdig 1  sonja linke 1  elias stefas 2  francisco veas 3  heinz ellerbrok 1 major obstacles for the detection of pathogens in clinical or environmental samples are false negative results this is mainly due to the lack of a rapid and reliable pathogen concentration methodology that allows detection of highly diluted samples and the inability of most of the currently used technologies to eliminate or neutralize interfering natural inhibitors that could be present in biological samples in order to improve virus diagnostics we wanted to exploit the non-self recognition and binding properties of human apolipoprotein h apoh apoh binds and captures pathogens enabling their concentration from different kinds of biological samples we have used magnetic beads coated with apoh recombinant protein as a pre-treatment step for orthopox viruses to improve the detection threshold and to increase the sensitivity for diagnosis with this approach virus was concentrated dna was extracted and subsequently detected and quantified by real-time pcr after apoh-treatment vaccinia virus was detected from highly diluted samples where diagnosis had been negative with a standard dna preparation protocol at present the concentration and improved detection of other viruses with an apoh-enhanced protocol is under investigation hv infections are mainly transmitted to humans by inhalation of virus-contaminated aerosols of rodent excreta and secretions however sporadic person-to-person transmissions of the andes hantavirus andv have been reported based on the knowledge that human apolipoprotein h apoh a constituent of human plasma interacts with viral proteins we wished to asses a possible interaction between apoh and andv the major etiological agent hcps in south america materials and methods blood and urine samples from acute-hcps patients were selected on the basis of their availability samples collected as part of the research initiative nihniaid ai 45452 were kindly supplied for this study donor patients met the clinical criteria for hcps and harbored igm antibodies reactive with hantavirus antigens hv genomic rna was confirmed in plasma by an in-house developed rt-pcrhemi-nested pcr using primers designed to partially encompass the s segment orf of the andes virus strain chi-7913 samples used as negative control were collected among the laboratory staff apoh-coated magnetic beads and apohcoated elisa plates used in this study were supplied by apoh technologies sa and used following their instructions results we report that andv interacts with apoh and that apoh-coated magnetic beads or apoh-coated elisa plates can be used to capture and concentrate virus from serum and urine samples allowing virus detection by both immunological and molecular approaches we then developed an andv-high throughput screen assay and assessed andv in urine samples from 50 patients with acute andv-hcps collected during 5 days following hospitalization 45 patients showed detectable amounts of andv in urine in at least one tested sample conclusions apoh capture assay increases the sensitivity of virus detection by both molecular and immunological methods this apparent enhancement in sensitivity most probably stems from the fact that virus is being concentrated from a larger sample volume additionally we demonstrate that andv can be shed in the urine of infected individuals although our data do not necessarily predict the presence of infectious virus in urine the fact that andv is readily detected in urine samples of acute-hcps patients not only lends support to the possibility that urine is a route for person-to-person transmission of hcps but also raises the intriguing prospect that virus might be present in other biological secretions this study was supported by the jeunes equipes associes  lird program to mll and

progression and response to antiretroviral therapy has proved critical for designing efficient interventions hiv entry into cells results from complex interactions between env gp120 with cd4 and co-receptors ccr5 the major receptor for cytokines is also the main co-receptor for macrophage-tropic r5 strains the ccr5-delta32 homozygous deletion and the ccr5-m303 variant have been associated with resistance to hiv infection and ccr5-delta32 heterozygosity with delayed disease progression also the minor co-receptor ccr2 64i variant has been associated with delayed progression the effect on progression of sdf1 polymorphisms a ligand for the chemokine receptor cxcr4 remains controversial with regards to innate or specific host immune response to hiv while there are conflicting results on the role of neutralizing antibodies studies have shown an association between hla class i alleles and natural resistance to infection or disease progression discordance between maternal and infant hla genotypes may have a protective effect response to antiretroviral drugs involves both host genetics and hiv variation while the ability of hiv to mutate and escape drug pressure varies with each drugs specific mechanism of action human polymorphisms have been associated with increased toxicity of some antiretroviral drugs until today the challenge has been to demonstrate the clinical significance of identified polymorphism following a pathogenesis hypothesis driven approach genepathway candidates following completion of the human genome sequencing numerous snps have been identified whose biological significance remains unknown and the challenge is to discover associations between such snps and characterized phenotypes understanding a polymorphism functional significance becomes the next step discordant couples transmitting motherspartners rapid progressors under therapy or long term untreated non-progressors are phenotypes which have been widely used in the rapidly evolving

zoology university of oxford oxford uk 2 department of pathology university of california san diego la jolla usa and mutation rate from changes in selective pressure and effective population size using this technique we have identified a previously unknown association between the silent evolutionary rate of hiv and the rate of disease progression in infected individuals this finding demonstrates that cellular immune processes which are already known to determine hiv pathogenesis also determine viral replication rates and therefore impose important constraints on hiv evolution humoral immune responses on the other hand are the major determinant of nonsynonymous rate changes through time in the envelope gene and our relaxed clock estimates support a decrease in selective pressure as a consequence of immune system collapse 27 the presence of anti-r7v antibodies in hiv-1 infected patients a novel efficient marker for the non-progression to aids background concerning hiv life cycles it is well known that the hiv acquires a cellular antigen when the virus is released from the host infected cell the epitope is defined as a peptide seven amino acids rtpkiqv r7v the previously study reported that the presence of antibodies directed to the peptide r7v in hiv infection correlated with the non-progression to aids objectives t5o determine the correlation between the anti r7v antibodies in thai treated-naive hiv-1 infected patients and the clinical status methods a retrospective study was carried out in 124 normal population and 128 thai treated-naive patients infected with hiv-1 for more than 5 years presence of anti r7v antibody was detected by the anti r7v elasa od was read at 450 nm results we found that treated-naive hiv-infected patients presented anti-r7v antibodies at higher level than in normal population 328 and 08 respectively p  0001 relative to clinical status of patients the frequency of positive anti r7v antibodies level had significantly higher in non-progressors and moderate progressors 100 and 49 respectively p  0001 we did not find anti r7v antibodies in rapid progressors these results demonstrated a strong correlation between the presence of anti-r7v antibodies and a good prognostic status of thai hiv-1 infected patients conclusion this study provides the strongest evidence to date for the presence of the anti r7v antibodies in nonprogression of hiv infection west central african chimpanzees pan troglodytes troglodytes are now recognized as a natural reservoir of simian immunodeficiency virus sivcpz and the immediate source of at least two human cross-species infections i hiv-1 group m the pandemic form of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and ii hiv-1 group n thus far identified only in a few aids patients from cameroon a third lineage hiv-1 group o also falls within the sivcpzptt radiation but the ape reservoir of this virus has not yet been identified first we report here the geographic distribution and the genetic diversity of groups m-and n-like viruses in wild chimpanzee communities in southern cameroon and secondly the detection and molecular characterization of sivs closely related to hiv-1 group o in wild-living gorillas gorilla gorilla in the same country more than 1300 ape fecal samples were collected at 18 remote forest sites in cameroon overall 62 were from chimpanzees and 21 were from gorillas the remainder were found to be degraded or from other primate mammal species following mitochondrial dna analysis all were tested for hiv crossreactive antibodies using a commercial hiv-12 confirmatory assay thirty tree different pan troglodytes troglodytes apes were found to be siv-infected and six samples corresponding to three different gorillas as determined by microsatellite analysis contained antibodies reactive with the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 fecal rna was isolated and partial pol andor gp41 sequences were amplified by rt-pcr phylogenetic analysis of these siv sequences showed that the 33 newly identified sivcpz and the 3 sivgor strains fall within the hiv-1sivcpzptt radiation the identified sivcpz strains were characterised by a high genetic diversity and a phylogeographic clustering the latter allowed us to trace the origins of hiv-1 group m and group n to distinct chimpanzee communities in southern cameroon phylogenetic analysis of the 3 sivgor strains revealed a monophyletic lineage within the sivcpzptt radiation which was most closely related to hiv-1 group o we also confirmed further absence of sivcpz infection in 78 samples from pan troglodytes vellerosus these findings showed that chimpanzees likely served as the primary reservoir of sivs now found in chimpanzees gorillas and humans hiv-1 groups m and n clearly arose by transfer of viruses from chimpanzees to men while the origin of hiv-1 group o is less clear chimpanzees could have transmitted group o-like viruses to gorillas and to humans independently or they could have transmitted the virus first to gorillas which in turn transmitted it to humans 3 guilan university of medical sciences guilan province iran nested polymerase chain reaction which targets the conserved 18s small-subunit rna genes of parasite not only permits a malaria infection in anopheles mosquitoes to be detected but also allow each plasmodium species present to be detected mosquitoes were collected from guilan province in northern iran after morphological identification and dissection head and thorax of 197 pools 985 individual mosquitoes of anopheles maculipennis complex anopheles sacharovi and anopheles hyrcanus group were used for dna extraction pcr amplified a 205 bp fragment of plasmodium falciparum in one pool of an hyrcanus group specimens from fooman district the pcr method shows greater sensitivity and specificity and confirmed the existence of p falciparum in an hyrcanus group that so far has been considered as non-vector in iran this unexpected presence of p falciparum in anopheles hyrcanus population urges prompts investigation and standardization of control methods in islamic republic of iran azerbaijan and armenia as chloroquine cq resistance spreads across iran the sulfadoxinepyrimethamine sp combination therapy with cq are being used as alternative first-line drugs for the treatment and prevention of plasmodium falciparum malaria we determined the genotype of three different genes p falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter  pfcrt dihydrofolate reductase dhfr and dihydropteroate synthase dhps in 208 clinical p falciparum isolates pre-treatment and post-treatment from iran which were collected during 2003-2005 dna was isolated and analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism pcrrflp to detect polymorphisms previously shown to be associated with resistance the results showed that 77 of field isolates carried parasites with double mutant alleles of pfdhfr c59r  s108n while retaining a wild type mutation at position 51 and all pfdhps s436fa a437g k540e and a581e 187 of field isolates carried parasites with double mutant alleles of pfdhfr c59r  s108n and single mutant alleles of pfdhps a437g limited and stable polymorphism over the time particularly in pfdhps revealed that the sp is still effective as antimalaria drug in iran furthermore the putative key codons of novel candidate gene for chloroquine resistance pfcrt was determined and the high levels of cq pressure have let to strong selection of the pfcrt76t 220s and 326s polymorphism among p falciparum isolates in iran these results may have important implications for the future surveillance of both cq and sp resistance by the use of molecular markers in iran 31 epitope mapping and analysis of sequence variation in var2csa dbl3x involved in p falciparum placental sequestration pregnancy-associated malaria pam is a major health problem which mainly affects primigravidae living in malaria endemic areas the syndrome is precipitated by accumulation of infected erythrocytes in placental tissue through an interaction between chondroitin sulphate a csa on syncytiotrophoblasts and a parasite encoded protein on the surface of infected erythrocytes believed to be var2csa women in endemic areas develop immunity to pam and anti-var2csa antibody levels correlate with protection var2csa is a polymorphic protein of approximately 3000 amino acids forming six duffybinding-like dbl domains for vaccine development it is important to define the antigenic targets for protective antibodies and to characterize the consequences of sequence variation in this study we show that the var2csa dbl3x domain mediates binding to csa which makes it a leading vaccine candidate we characterize sequence variation in the dbl3x domain comprising single nucleotide polymorphisms deletions and variable number of tandem repeats using bayesian inference of selection pressure and recombination rate analysis combination of these results with structural modelling shows that sequence variation mainly occurs in regions under strong diversifying selection predicted to form flexible surface loops from peptide array data we show that these regions are main targets of naturally acquired igg and accessible for antibodies reacting with native var2csa on infected erythrocytes interestingly surface reactive anti-var2csa antibodies also target a conserved dbl3x region predicted to form an a-helix finally we identify dbl3x sequence motifs that are more likely to occur in parasites isolated from primi-and multigravidae respectively these findings strengthen the vaccine candidacy of var2csa and will be important for choosing epitopes and variants of dbl3x to be included in a vaccine protecting women against pam keywords malaria var2csa pregnancy vaccine pfemp1 dbl selection recombination pepscan epitope 32 polymorphisms in the genes of interleukin 12 and its receptors in association with resistance to severe malarial anemia in children residing in western kenya of the more than 1 million africans who die from plasmodium infection each year most are children under five years of age the majority of these deaths are from severe malarial anemia plasmodium falciparum has been shown to drive selection of human genetic variants for conferring protection against severe forms of malaria such as severe malarial anemia sma malarial anemia is characterized by the destruction of malaria infected red blood cells and suppression of erythropoiesis recent studies in murine models of malarial anemia have demonstrated that interleukin 12 il12 significantly boosts erythropoietic responses furthermore several immunological studies conducted in africa have shown that il12 production was suppressed in children with sma compared to asymptomatic children for these reasons the genes encoding the two il12 subunits il12a and il12b and its receptors il12rb1 and il12rb2 are attractive candidate genes for studying sma in this study a total of 75 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms tagsnps covering these four genes were examined genotyping was performed with the iplex massarray technology sequenom in a cohort of 940 children from the asembo bay region of western kenya an area with intense malaria transmission individuals possessing two copies of il12a common allele rs2243140 at 3 0 utr showed increased susceptibility to sma hb  6 gdl and the presence of p falciparum  10000ml  p  0009 rr 185 95ci 110-310 individuals

identification of genetic polymorphisms that influence human host susceptibility to malaria infection and severe disease outcomes may help us to better understand the immune response to malaria and design novel treatments against severe malarial anemia the intractability of studying host-pathogen interactions within the arthropod mid-gut remains a problem in arthropod vector-pathogen research for example neither currently available cell lines nor primary mid-gut cell cultures support plasmodium ookinete invasion penetration and differentiation to oocytes whilst the absence of apical-basal differentiation and thus the control temporal and cellular route of mature infective arbovirus virion export is not correctly mimicked and indeed may be biochemically somewhat artifactual and affect cellular defective interfering virion function and accumulation using a biphasic culture system and nanofiber based lamina hydrogels we have established apical-basal differentiated primary mid gut cell cultures from anopheline and culicine mosquitoes although heterogeneous in cell morphology they are principally comprised of columnar epithelial cells including vatpase ve cells with mid-gut specific gene expression as determined by rt-pcr these cultures support plasmodium ookinete invasion penetration and basal lamina differentiation to oocytes ca 20 of cells and so potentially provide the first amenable cell culture system for the detailed proteomic and genomic analysis of plasmodium gallinaceum p falciparium and p vivax mid-gut invasion and subsequent differentiation they may also prove to be a tractable model system for the screening of both potential resistance genes and allelic variances between parasite and host isolates and the subsequent screening of the efficacy of transgenes prior to the labour intensive genetic modification of mosquitoes moreover following apical infection ca 90 of cells dengue and japanese encephalitis viruses are replicated and baso-laterally secreted suggesting these cell cultures may be amenable to arbovirus-hostsymbiont interaction studies as well as virus-virus interaction within the same host tissue or cell to illustrate this point we present preliminary results of inducible rnai and defective interfering particle encoding phagemids upon dengue replication and baso-lateral secretion as well as interactions with natural symbionts in these cell cultures immunogenetics may provide key insight into epidemiology and transmission ecology it may contribute to the understanding of the distribution of area of endemism and of the risk of emerging diseases in natural populations one of the leading goals of immunogenetics has been to understand the associations of genetics to immune related diseases in this context the major histocompatibility complex mhc has been extensively studied it is a central component of the vertebrate immune system there are multiple lines of evidence supporting the idea that this polymorphism is maintained by some form of balancing selection mediated by pathogens and parasites through frequency-dependent selection among mhc class ii genes are known for their role in puumala hantavirus infections severity in humans during this talk we are going to analyse the genetic diversity of two class ii mhc genes dqa and drb at different evolutionary scales in rodents in relation with hantaviruses distribution and phylogeny first we analysed the phylogenetic organisation of mhc allelic forms within vole and mice species in europe and southeast asia two area of endemism of human disease caused by hantaviruses this revealed the existence of trans-species polymorphism tsp among voles additional data on mice is needed to test whether tsp occur among mice and between vole and mice tsp indicates that a balancing selection acts on these genes probably through the mediated-selection exerted by shared pathogens second we searched for associations between mhc haplotypes and the presence of hantavirus in the bank vole clethrionomys glareolus the reservoir of the puumala hantavirus responsible of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans voles were serologically checked for antibodies associations between genetic parameters haplotypes or heterozygosity and infection status were explored using multivariate analyses we detected significant associations between one mhc-haplotype and the susceptibility to hantavirus infection similar studies are under progress among other rodent species in europe and southeast asia our preliminary results highlights the potential importance of immunogenetics in understanding the emerging of rodent-born diseases like hantavirus infection we are currently involved in a franco-thai program devolved to a multidisciplinary investigation of muridae rodents mice and rats their parasites and the pathogens that they may carry and or transmit to human with a better understanding of diseases emergence as an ultimate goal in such a context pathogens circulation in the wild is a complex but pivotal phenomenon which requires a continuum of scientific approaches to be accurately apprehended in particular a rigorously comparative study is mandatory in order to take into account the interactions between parasites wild and domestic hosts uncluding human and their environment this is the reason why we rely on both concepts and techniqueq from a wide range of disciplines including taxonomy cytogenetics phylogenetics phylogeography population genetics ecology geography as well as modeling with the following objectives objective 1 to precisely identify and characterize the rodent species acting as reservoirs and to document their ecology geographic distribution as well as the genetic structure of their populations to assess parasite and pathogen diversity in relation to their associated rodent hosts to provide cophylogenies and co-phylogeographies in order to enlight the evolutionary relationships of hosts and parasites objective 2 to map and correlate the observed rodents distributions with their species-specific environmental landscapes in order to extrapolate their potential real range and to anticipate their future distributions in relation to landscape modifications objective 3 computing epidemiological databases crosschecking field data and gis data definition and standardization of a risk-scale finalization of maps of risks and distributions atlas of thai muridae reference collection of thai muridae education and training of students following the listing of the objectives we expose the first results of our studies and we sketch future projects in its human host leishmania donovani is an intracellular parasite of macrophages and parasitism display a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infections to fatal visceral leishmaniasis vl a bulk of evidence from mice and man now indicate that host genetic factors play an important role in determining susceptibility to vl until now studies aimed at unravelling human genetic susceptibility to vl have focussed on the analysis of clinical phenotypes these clinical phenotypes probably result from the interaction of both host and parasite genetic factors but also environmental factors making these phenotypes complex for genetic dissection we propose here a novel alternative approach based on the study of a cellular phenotype established in vitro in this study we have established the in vitro macrophage infection status of 20 healthy blood donors and their response to ifng we demonstrate the existence of an important inter-individual variability of the macrophage permissive phenotype parasitic index ranging from 20 to 100 amastigotes 100 macrophages as well as important differences in the individual response to ifng parasitic index reduced in only half of the subjects upon ifng activation in a second step we attempted to correlate the observed cellular phenotypes with the expression of various macrophage genes implicated in leishmania recognition cr1 msf1r macrophage activationdeactivation il1 il6 il10 il12 rantes mip1b tnfa and macrophage microbicide activity nos2 arg1 nadph p40phox significant correlations were found between the ratio of nos2arg1 and the p40 phox unit of the nadph oxidase but none of the measured variables were explicative of the capacity to respond to ifng these preliminary results indicate that this approach provide a valuable tool to analyse host-parasite interactions at the host cell level indeed studies in mouse derived macrophages or human monocytic cell line have shown that infection by leishmania has a profound influence on the macrophage transcriptome however studies are lacking that address specifically the question of the variability of macrophage responses to leishmania infection in human and its relation with resistancesusceptibility to vl one of the most important genes involved with metabolic insecticide resistance specially ddt resistance in anopheles gambiae is the epsilon class of the glutathione s-transferase super family in current study pcr analysis of gste2 region have shown nucleotide variations within populations of anopheles stephensi the most important malaria vector in iran and middle east specimens were collected from three different zones including chabahar sarbaz nikshahr iranshahr saravan and khash districts in sistan and baluchistan province iran which are under insecticide application for a long time areas that has not been treated with insecticides for a long time kazeron fars province iran and an stephensi population from pakistan the result revealed that iranian strains collected from sistan and baluchistan province were 100 identical in gste2 dna sequences except saravan strain which has showed 100 identity with pakistani strain and 99 identity with others kazeroon strain was 99 identical with both pakistani and iranian strains with a c  g transversion and a  c transition in 105th and 174th nucleotides respectively pakistani and saravan strains showed a  g transition in position 243 and c  t transition in nucleotide number 351 the follow up study on further specimens from those areas has detected two types of nucleotide variation in sarbaz samples one type is identical to saravnian and pakistani samples and the other type is similar to other sistan and baluchisatn samples however in amino acid level all the sequences were 100 identical proving that the nucleotide variation which was observed does not involve with the insecticide resistance we will further discuss the cloning results related to gste2 in sarbaz populations of an stephensi wolbachia are a group of cytoplasmically inherited bacteria that cause reproduction alterations including parthenogenesis cytoplasmic incompatibility feminization of genetic males and male killing based on 16srdna and protein-coding gene wsp sequences wolbachia can be typed into six different super groups or strains a b c d e and f three a b and e types and member of f type are found in arthropods in this study we aimed to detect the wolbachia in iranian culicidae anopheles aedes and culex spp specimens by molecular technique mosquitoes were collected from guilan kerman sistan and baluchistan khorasan azarbijan and hormozgan provinces in iran dna extracted from 204 specimens was amplified by using specific diagnostic pcr of wsp and 16srdna genes that can differentiate between a and b groups of wolbachia the length of amplified fragments by 16srdna b and wsp b primers was 261 and 442 nucleotide in sequenced specimens respectively within iranian culicidae only b type of wolbachia was detected while there was no discrepancy in the amplified products of 16srdna b and wsp b therefore we postulate that the similarity of 100 in 16srdna and wsp genes could be a reason for close evolutionary relation in wolbachia pipientis populations circulating in iranian culicidae species in the recent years due to the global warming agricultural changes as well as other human impact on the environment several tick-borne pathogenic organisms have re-emerged in europe a total of 991 ticks from two different geographical areas in slovakia carpathians mountain and pannonian plain and one in the czech republic czech massif were tested by pcr analysis for the presence of borrelia burgdorferi sl and the members of the family anaplasmataceae the overall borrelial prevalence varied between 17-36 b afzelii b garinii b valaisiana b burgdorferi ss were present in all three sites moreover b lusitaniae was present at the locality in north-central sub-mountain area of slovakia where 80 of all positive ticks belonged to this species b garinii 43 was consistently the predominant species in carpathian basin regions of eastern slovakia the most common species in the czech republic was b afzelii 52 the sequencing of 5s-23s rdna revealed high intraspecific variability within the detected species the dna of i ricinus ticks was also tested for the presence of anaplasmaehrlichia spp by pcr-sscp analysis and sequencing of a variable 247 bp fragment of 16s rdna anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected in 43 of ticks moreover 21 ticks were infected with neoehrlichia mikurensis and 06 ticks carried an anaplasma-like microorganism recently detected in i ricinus ticks from northern africa furthermore we have developed a new detection system-microarray-based assay of bacterial tick borne pathogens present in central-europe our oligo-chip is a sensitive and reliable for detection of following genera borreliae rickettsiae anaplasmae and ehrlichiae this method is based on detection of fluorescent signal after hybridization reaction by using laser scanner and has a potential of use in the largescale epidemiological studies as well as fast diagnostic method since all relevant pathogens can be detected in one step keywords ixodes

cat population in thailand is a considerable problem because they are usually poorly cared for and thought to carry infectious agents such agents include the feline haemoplasma species mycoplasma haemofelis and candidatus m haemominutum together previously known as haemobartonella felis the larger species m haemofelis is an etiologic agent of infectious hemolytic anemia in cats while the less virulent m haemominutum has only been associated with disease in immunosuppressed cats these pleomorphic bacteria adhere to erythrocytes and can spread among cats by blood transfer although not yet confirmed these apparently obligate prokaryotic parasites are thought to be naturally transmitted by arthropod vectors that are abundant in tropical climates including thailand conventional detection of m haemofelis and m haemominutum involves light microscopy of stained blood smears and these organisms can be difficult to detect and differentiate from each other and stain artifacts the objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of these pathogens in stray cats from bangkok to accomplish this we utilized applied molecular methods to detect and differentiate m haemofelis and m haemominutum five hundred blood specimens randomly derived from stray cats were tested with a pcr-rflp assay this technique was able to detect and distinguish these two feline haemoplasma species

transmitted from a host to another by biting insects krinsky 1976 foil 1989  however parameters of mechanical transmission are not well known as well as medical epidemiological economic and genetic impacts a series of experiments carried out in cattle allowed to demonstrate mechanical transmission of trypanosomes t vivax and t congolense by tabanids atylotus agrestis and a fuscipes desquesnes and dia 2003a dia b 2004  high transmission power of tabanids was demonstrated as well as pathogenicity of trypanosomes mechanically transmitted t vivax is more easily mechanically transmitted than t congolense due to its high parasitaemia data collected daily during the experiments allowed to develop a mathematic model of the transmission which dynamic has important epidemiological applications the epidemiology of cattle trypanosomosis due to t vivax in the absence of tsetse latin america is very different from that observed in the presence of cyclical vectors africa desquesnes 2004  medical and economical impacts are also different in mixed transmission areas the relative impact of mechanical transmission is very difficult to establish in the presence of tsetse cattle trypanosomosis is most often highly endemic with prevalence regularly above 70 in such conditions addition of mechanical transmission to cyclical one has little epidemiological impact however it contributes to the predominance of t vivax versus t congolense coming to population genetic mechanical transmission increases the circulation of t vivax amongst cattle which tends to homogenize the parasitic genetic material present in hosts transferring a very little quantity of blood mechanical transmission tends to clone parasites not only it tends to select the most prolific parasitic sub-populations consequences on genetics of mechanically transferred pathogens should be studied humans are exposed to populations of environmental mycobacteria em whose composition varies between regions human populations are subject to variable potentials for mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb transmission due to differences in demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds the bacille calmette-gurin bcg vaccine is widely used worldwide but its efficacy has revealed great variability against pulmonary tuberculosis we develop mathematical models that describe the transmission of mtb under constraints that are imposed by host immunity elicited by previous exposures to em mtb and bcg we describe how levels of tuberculosis and vaccine efficacy depend on the hypothesized interactions among the three mycobacterial populations we determine a threshold in mtb transmission -the reinfection threshold -above which tuberculosis endemicity is high and insensitive to both em and bcg by contrast variability rules below the reinfection threshold bordetella pertussis and b parapertussis are two closely related human pathogens causing whooping cough b parapertussis has received limited interest because its symptoms are typically milder and its incidence allegedly lower than those of b pertussis however some epidemiological studies suggest that the prevalence of the two pathogens may actually be similar because of under-reporting of b parapertussis cases sustained coexistence of these two competing species is surprising recently experiments in mice have demonstrated that crossimmunity between b pertussis and b parapertussis is not symmetric immunity induced by b parapertussis infection efficiently protects against subsequent infections by either species while immunity induced by b pertussis infection does not efficiently protect against b parapertussis infections using mathematical models we explored the possible consequences of this asymmetry on the coexistence of the two pathogen species at the population level in particular we investigate the effects of anti-pertussis vaccination and fitness variation on both the shortterm dynamics and the longer-term equilibrium of the system 44 reciprocity between modelling and experiment to meet the challenge of controlling antigenically diverse pathogens epidemiology and ecology group department of biological sciences university of warwick coventry cv4 7al uk previous models for antigenically diverse pathogens have predicted vaccine induced strain replacement under certain con-ditions to assess the risk of such an event predictive models for the transmission dynamics of these pathogens must be developed when modelling the transmission dynamics there is a conflict between the level of detail required to capture the interactions between strains and the sparseness of the data available to parameterise the models it is necessary therefore to make simplifying assumptions about individual immune responses to develop viable models this presentation will demonstrate how such assumptions impact on the population level behaviour of antigenically diverse pathogens i will highlight the need for further experimental investigation to develop and parameterise models to a point where they have predictive value as an example i will present a case study of human respiratory syncytial virus in rural kenya where models were involved in the design of a cohort study this example will demonstrate the challenges and potential for the fusion of modelling and experiment to address this problem symposium molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis and leprosy 46 mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from south india belongs to an ancient lineage disease transmission the genetic information resulting from high prevalence areas such as ours would prove useful for defining phylogenetic links that exists with tb genomes and for constructing models of genome evolution this will also help in the elucidatation of the evolutionary history of ancient tubercle bacilli we have used a number of genotypic tools like is6110 rflp spoligotyping deletion microarray and deletion pcr to understand the lineage of m tuberculosis in southern india we used a standardized international protocol for is6110 rflp and spoligotyping was done according to the protocol supplied by isogen bioscience bv manarssen and instructions of the manufacturer all of the spoligotype patterns were coded using the octal code system we then referred to a standardized international database of spoligotype patterns spoldb3 available at httpwwwpasteur-guadeloupefrtbspol3 www pasteur-guadeloupefrtbspol3 to determine whether each pattern had been previously reported we selected 25 isolates for comparative whole-genome hybridization using an affymetrix dna chip santa clara california usa we identified putative deletions in the experimental strains relative to the sequenced reference strain h37rv using delscan software abasci san pablo california usa and confirmed the putative deletions by direct sequencing for the detection of lsps by multiplex real-time pcr we designed a series of assays based on different taqman primerprobe combinations we also used previously published studies of genomic deletions to identify phylogenetically important genomic deletions and screen for them using pcr our results showed that the major clade present in tiruvallur s india belong to the group which is designated as the most ancient lineage of m tuberculosis 47 the use of proteomics and bioinformatics to identify novel antigens of mycobacterium leprae towards the development of a rapid diagnostic test for the early detection of leprosy comparative genomic analysis of the m leprae genome has identified 1614 open reading frames and up to 165 genes with no homologues in m tuberculosis diagnosis of leprosy is a major obstacle to disease control and has been compromised in the past by the lack of specific reagents understanding which antigens might be useful in either cell mediated or antibody response assays has been hampered by the fact that m leprae is an uncultivatable microorganism capable of growth only in humans armadillos and immunocompromised nude mice nevertheless using proteomic analysis we have identified 256 proteins from the native subcellular fractions of m leprae which represents approximately 16 of the potential open reading frames thought to be coded by the genome in addition using an oligonucleotide chip we have further identified up to 702 genes that are thought to be transcriptionally active of these there were 41 genes that coded for proteins that are unique to m leprae and 205 genes that coded for proteins that are conserved hypotheticals proteins which are limited to mycobacteria using the information from these studies a picture of those antigens that might be both specific to m leprae and important in evoking either cell mediated or antibody responses in leprosy patients is unfolding in previous work we found that a number of recombinant m leprae proteins or peptides behaved reproducibly as t cell antigens inducing stronger ifn-g responses from tuberculoid leprosy patients than tuberculosis patients or endemic controls in addition we are examining the potential of proteinpeptide arrays to define the humoral immune response to identify disease-state-specific antigen profiles those antigens that provide specific responses in leprosy patients could be developed into a rapid diagnostic test for the early detection of leprosy and epidemiological surveys of the incidence of leprosy of which little is known mycobacterium tuberculosis is the principal etiologic agent of human tuberculosis tb in most regions of the world while m africanum is frequent in certain regions in the africa mycobacterium bovis is the principal cause of tb in cattle and causes tb in humans upon ingestion of unpasteurized milk and products or after prolonged contact with infectious cattle the other species of the m tuberculosis complex mtc m microti m pinnipeddi and m caprae are less frequently observed and the classification within the mtbc of rare variants such as the dassie and oryx bacilli remains to be defined the genetic differences between mtbc strains besides being the cause of host preference can be useful for diagnosis and better define epidemiology and appropriated treatment help identifying potential virulence markers and fine-tune mtbc phylogeny genetic characteristics such as deletions insertions inversions duplications and single nucleotide polymorphism snps are nowadays used to help identifying mtbc isolates to the species level in the present study 47 strains isolated from different tb patients from ghana were characterized using either pcr-based protocols for detection of genomic deletion or pcr-rflp for detection of earlier or presently described snps a total of 13 deletions is1561 cpf32 rd701 rd702 rd713

rd711 390  were analyzed using this approach it was possible to differentiate all m tuberculosis n  12 from m africanum n  29 strains and to recognize m africanum subtype ia n  9 and m africanum ib n  20 in addition the presence of the hereby described snps nat 751 and rd711 390  were analyzed in a well-characterized collection of mtbc isolates huard 2006  nat 751 was only pesent in m africanum ia while rd711 390 was only pesent in m africanum ib this suggests that some species or sub-species within the mtbc can be differentiated looking at particular snps and that newly discovered snps could help fine tuning the mtbc to the species level 49 identification of trypanosomes using molecular methods from wild caught tsetse in tanzania tsetse flies transmit many species of trypanosomes in africa some of which are human and livestock pathogens of major medical and socio-economic impact identification of trypanosomes is essential to assess the disease risk posed by particular tsetse populations we have developed two tests to replace the multiple speciesspecific pcr tests used previously to identify the trypanosome species carried by individual tsetse flies product of the its-1 region of the ribosomal rna repeat region enables species identification 2 fluorescent primers size variation within the 18s rdna region is used to identify species products are sized with greater accuracy by the use of an automated dna sequencer this enables identification of species with increased precision and sensitivity using the generic systems we have been able to identify a new species of trypanosome the 18s region of this trypanosome has been sequenced and we can confirm the new trypanosome is most closely related to trypanosoma godfreyi a suid trypanosome the easy identification of this new trypanosome by pcr will facilitate studies of its epidemiology both methods facilitate the identification of samples quickly and accurately and have been used for large-scale field studies the results of these studies and the respective advantages and disadvantages of the two methods will be discussed tsetse flies transmit african trypanosomes the causative agents of sleeping sickness in human and nagana in animals this disease affects many people with considerable impact on public health and economy in sub-saharan africa while trypanosomes resistance to drugs is rising sodalis glossinidius a symbiont of tsetse flies is considered to be involved in vector competence in a former study no direct correlation was found between the presence of s glossinidius and the ability of the insect to acquire trypanosoma congolense however glossina palpalis gambiensis and glossina morsitans morsitans were shown to harbour genetically distinct populations of s glossinidius suggesting that vector competence for a given trypanosome species could be linked to the presence of specific genotypes of the symbiont rather than a mere presence absence in order to assess this hypothesis glossina palpalis individuals were fed on blood infected with either trypanosoma brucei gambiense tbg or trypanosoma brucei brucei tbb species and the genetic diversity of s glossinidius strains isolated from dissected flies was investigated using aflp markers correspondence between occurrence of these markers and parasite establishment was analysed using multivariate analysis we demonstrated that the distribution of s glossinidius strains from tbg-infected flies differed strongly from those from tbb-infected individuals some aflp markers were shown to be significantly linked to the ability of tbg or tbb to establish in the glossina midgut this suggests the differential presence of sodalis genotypes to influence parasite establishment and could explain variations in glossina vector competence in the wild the markers identified may be useful to assess prevalence of sodalis genotype facilitating establishment of parasite species and to develop novel risk-management strategies the cestode echinococcus multilocularis is widely known in the northern hemisphere to infect mainly foxes and rodents and accidentally human however human seems not to be equal facing the alveolar echinococcosis ae disease many factors such as environmental conditions immunology or genetic susceptibility can explain the heterogeneity of infection in human few data existed concerning the influence of the e multilocularis genetic diversity up to now the genotracking of subspecies was impossible due to a lack of fast evolutionary markers recently a tandem repeated multilocus microsatellite named emsb was discovered in the e multilocularis genome our objective was to assess the limit of emsb discriminatory power at three geographical scales i at a world scale by studying alaskan european and asian endemic areas with parasitic lesions from definitive and intermediate hosts ii at a continental scale by studying adult worms circulating in so-called old and new endemic areas in eight european countries and iii at a local scale n  100 km 2  in the french region of the ardennes the hierarchical clustering analysis of the results helped us to explore relevant questions as the spatial dynamic the circulation of the parasite between different hosts the emergence or the re-emergence of ae in human to increase our knowledge on the parasite transmission and to enhance the public health management superoxide dismutase sod forms part of the defense mechanism that helps to protect organisms from superoxide anions this enzyme is one of the isoenzyme systems commonly used to differentiate tb gambiense from tb brucei and tb rhodesiense to understand the genetic basis of the differences observed between sod electrophoretic profiles of t brucei sub-species we undertook the identification and the characterization of sod gene repertoire in tb gambiense this study was performed on seven stocks 4 tb gambiense group 1 and 3 group 2 showing different sod profiles four sod genes soda sodb1 sodb2 and sodc were identified in tb gambiense genome these genes were cloned and their predicted amino acid sequences were deduced few differences were observed between nucleotide sequences of the four sod genes of tb gambiense group 1 and 2 stocks even with tb brucei few differences were observed several amino acids specific to fesod were found in the four sods sequences of tb gambiense aligning the four tb gambiense protein sequences with those of others organisms important differences were found with mnsod and cuznsod but high similarity with fesod indicating that the sods of tb gambiense are fesod high similarity exists between the proteins sequences of tb gambiense and tb brucei despite the differences observed in sod electrophoretic profiles there is a genetic stability of the sods genes in t brucei sub-species 53 can the evolution of avian influenza virus aiv be predicted faculty of medicine siriraj hospital mahidol university thailand because the previous influenza pandemics were caused by either viruses of avian origin or reassortant viruses with some of their genomes derived from avian viruses it is believed that the h5n1 aiv which already causes limited outbreaks in human may become the source of the next pandemic continuously evolving the virus may adapt to the point that it can transmit efficiently in human population an insight in the viral evolution may help us to estimate the risk understand the cause and prevent the emergence of a pandemic strain trying to understand the viral evolution we need to look at the viral dynamics and selection pressures while the evolution of human influenza viruses is driven mainly by immunological selection pressure it is not clear what drives the evolution of aiv the current h5n1 aiv has diverged into multiple sublineages because these sublineages or clades are antigenically distinct it is likely that immunological pressure has played a role in the divergence of h5n1 aiv it is also likely that the immunological pressure was the result of massive immunization in poultry especially in china the recent emergence of the new fijian-like strains further supports this notion in general genomes of most aiv are in evolutionary stasis because of they are in equilibrium with their natural host once transmitted to a new host species the virus starts rapid evolution to adapt itself to the new host virus-host interaction is therefore considered an important factor in the evolution of h5n1 aiv genome analysis has revealed positive selection pressure on some parts of the viral genome some of these sites may eventually fix and become host-specific residues when the virus reaches the optimum in the new hosts although the avianhuman inter-species barrier may involve several genetic determinants the most important one may be the receptor binding preference a few point mutations in the receptor-binding pocket of hemagglutinin have been shown to increase human-type receptor binding of h5 we have found such mutation in viral quasispecies from a human respiratory specimen this suggests that there is a selection pressure driving the virus toward humantype receptor specificity in human infection viral genomes may be shaped not only by selection pressures but also mutational bias recent observation has shown that avian and human influenza viral genomes are different in their gc content it was suggested that this indicates a difference in mutational bias between the two hosts however i would like to point it out that this may not be entirely correct genome composition may also be influenced by codon composition which could be affected by selection pressure we analyzed codon volatility which represents the propensity to change non-synonymously and found some differences in the genome volatility between the two virus groups higher codon volatility in human viruses is likely the result of higher degree of evolution and changes and may explain at least part of the difference in genome composition we also found that hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of h5n1 aiv have high codon volatility suggesting that the genes are rapidly evolving such analyses may help us to identify viral genome regions with high potential to change and may help us to predict the pattern of viral evolution in july of 2005 in suzdalka village novosibirsk region russia the mass mortality of poultry and wild birds was registered highly pathogenic influenza viruses of h5n1 subtype were isolated from different organs of three dead birds the aturkeysuzdalkanov-105 strain was isolated from turkeys spleen the achickensuzdalkanov-1105 and a chickensuzdalkanov-1205 stains-from chickens kidney this was the first case of isolation of high pathogenic influenza viruses of h5n1 subtype in russian federation the phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin gene sequences showed that these strains form a cluster support index is equal to themselves and between them and the humancivet isolates the most variable regions are located in the genes coding for nsp3 orf3a spike protein and orf8 when bat and human civet g2b-cov isolates are compared genetic analysis demonstrated that a diverse g2b-cov population exist in bat habitat the spike protein s protein of coronavirus is known responsible for receptor binding to the host cells the receptor binding domain rbd of humancivet g2b-cov and its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 were well characterized however two deletion sites 5 and 12 aa respectively are located in s protein of bat g2b-cov compared with that of human g2b-cov thus the interaction between bat g2b-cov s protein and the ace of human and bat was investigated kriangkrai witoonsatian 12  theera

the nonradioactive digoxigenin dig-labeled 604 base pairs bp 544 bp and 274 bp cdna probes for viral rna encoding the matrix protein hemagglutinin and neuraminidase respectively of aiv type a h5n1 strain were generated by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr the hybrid formation was detected with anti-dig conjugated alkaline phosphatase and nitrobule tetrazolium 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate nbtbcip substrate the strong positive signal typically was exhibited a dark purple reaction product in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells with red background of the nuclear fat red-staining whereas the less intense signal was detected in the interstitial and alveolar macrophages in contrast all of non-aiv-infected chicken lung tissues were negative by ish therefore ish developed in this study was useful for detection of aiv in tissues taken from naturally infected chickens trypanosoma lewisi is the type species for herpetosoma a homogenous subgenus of several dozen named species often described as morphologically indistinguishable t lewisilike parasites these parasites normally infect rodents and utilize fleas as vectors although this trypanosome subgenus is considered non-pathogenic to normal hosts some of them are on rare occasion reported in association with human disease recently a t lewisi-like infection was detected in a sick thai infant thus the objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of t lewisi infections among different rodents indigenous to thailand blood was collected from a total of 129 rodents trapped from urban and rural areas of three thai provinces loei kalasin and phrae between 2005 and 2006 these samples were processed for dna isolation and tested with a pcr assay universal for the genus trypanosoma followed by internal transcribed spacer 1 its1 sequence analysis to identify infections in positive samples amplicons of approximately 623 bp the size consistent with the stercorarian trypanosome group were generated from 217 of all rodents tested further analysis suggested that its1 sequences from these amplicons were 98 identical to that reported for t lewisi from an experimentally infected rat only two of six rodent genera tested pcr-positive for these parasites the highest prevalence of herpetosoma infections was found among rodents from phrae province 26 these results suggest that in thailand humans exposed to certain rodents or their ectoparasites could be at risk of infection with t lewisi-like parasites more work is warranted to identify vectors of these trypanosomes and to compare the prevalence of these infections among rodent and human populations in thailand in the present study the impact of t cruzi dual-clone infections on benznidazol treatment efficacy compared with the respective monoclonal infections was investigated for this eight clonal stocks two of each major genotypes 19 and 20 t cruzi i hybrid genotype 39 and 32 t cruzi ii were combined into 24 different mixtures balbc mice were inoculated by intraperitoneal route with 5000 blood trypomastigotes of each clone and treated with oral doses of 100 mg benznidazolkg20 days the cure control was performed by fresh blood examination hemoculture pcr elisa and detection of anti-live trypomastigotes antibody the identification of each clone from not cured mice was performed by microsatellites assay cure in dual-clonal infection was detected in 284 of treated animals considering the cure rates of mice for all t cruzi i 354 t cruzi ii 60 groups and their associations were not observed difference in relation to the expected benznidazole bz susceptibility for combinations t cruzi i  i 0 i  ii 221 except ii  ii 600 susceptible for major

cure rates of their combinations ranged from 0 to 245 nine out of 24 dual infections changed their profile of bz susceptibility 20  39 n  2 20  32 n  1 19  39 n  3 19  32 n  2 and 39  32 n  1 although molecular characterization had identified few mixed infections in isolates from not cured mice very interesting results were observed in some mixtures sensitive  resistant the selected clone identified after bz treatment was that previously identified as sensitive to bz in monoclonal infections these results suggest that mixed infections so current in nature may have important impact on chemotherapy efficacy further studies to elucidate the mechanisms involved in this process are essential for advances in the knowledgment of chagas disease chemotherapy 59 the epidemiology of surra trypanosoma evansi infection in se asia can molecular tools provide the answers we need school of veterinary and biomedical sciences murdoch university western australia australia trypanosomiasis caused by trypanosoma evansi surra is endemic in se asia where it is a significant but often underestimated cause of mortality in livestock recent estimates suggest that 22 of indonesian buffalo infected with t evansi either die or are sold for salvage slaughter in the last 10-15 years a series of severe outbreaks of surra have occurred in the philippines what is most puzzling is that the epidemiology observed in these outbreaks differs from other parts of se asia such as indonesia these differences include the observation of fatal disease in small ruminants and cattle and the observation of different presenting signs in addition there have been reports of isolated cases of human trypanosomiasis in india a variety of epidemiological tools are required in order to gain a better understanding of the biological basis of the epidemiological conundrum that we are faced with in particular molecular tools can provide us with unique methods of providing us with insight but they must be used with caution to ensure that the benefit from the research reaches the key stakeholders-the farmer this talk will describe a multidisciplinary approach to unraveling the epidemiology of surra in the philippines the first case of human trypanosomiasis in asia was evidenced in 2004 in seoni india a farmer presented a fluctuating trypanosome parasitaemia associated with febrile episodes for five months clinical and biological examinations including parasitological serological and molecular biological tests confirmed the infecting species as t evansi  suramin was efficient to cure the patient  the sra gene xong et al 1998 was not detected by pcr in the t evansi dna which had homogeneous kdna minicircles of type a truc et al 2007  the parasite appeared to be a typical t evansi suggesting that the explanation for this unusual infection may lie with the patient normally humans exhibit innate immunity against t evansi and t brucei and in the latter case this immunity is known to involve apolipoprotein l-i apol-i vanhamme et al 2003  the serum of the patient was found to be devoid of trypanolytic activity and this was linked to the absence of apol-i due to frameshift mutations in both apol-i alleles unpublished data therefore the lack of apol-i was sufficient to explain the human infection by t evansi because of a mechanical transmission by insects was suspected a serological investigation was conducted in the patient village in 2005 out of 1806 individuals tested using the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasistrypanosoma evansi pathak et al 1997  no trypanosomes were detected in the blood of 60 people who were positive at a significant serum dilution 14  the results indicate a frequent exposure of the human population to t evansi in the study area suggesting frequent vector transmission of parasites to humans  further investigations are required to evaluate the importance of this phenomenon and the potential emergence of a new zoonotic disease brun 2005 the impact of landscape fragmentation due to human and climatic pressures on the structure of a metapopulation of glossina palpalis gambiensis diptera glossinidae was analysed in the mouhoun river basin burkina faso allele frequencies at eight microsatellite loci and morphometric features based on 11 wing landmarks were compared among four populations the populations originated from the mouhoun river and one of its tributaries the among-populations distances were 74 61 and 81 km upstream to downstream totalizing 216 km between the first and the fourth both microsatellites and wing geometry demonstrated a structuration between the populations but no isolation there was no clear relation between gene flow and geographic distance nevertheless the type of gallery forest and particularly their disturbance level assessed using phytosociological censes seemed to be of tricking importance the impact of the fragmentation of peri-riverine landscapes on tsetse metapopulations structure and its potential implications for control campaigns is discussed 62 the potential use of temperate chimeric phages in arthropod vectored disease control transgenic arthropod technology potentially suffers from recombination mediated loss or alteration of the transgene especially if virus derived and typically provides a single shot gene drive system paratransformation systems may theoretically overcome recombination but are both hard to stably manipulate and to get the correct transgene expression profile and secretion out of the bacteria likewise cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing isolates of the arthropod symbionts wolbachia cardinium and rickettsia as potential transgene drive candidates may provide multiple drive opportunities but are hard to transfect however at least some of the temperate phage isolates of wolbachia reveal a chimeric nature at both the dna sequence level and in the ability to form virions and tails the recent development of host-specific replication or infection incompetent phage strains cell free assembly systems and evaluation of the control of lysogenic insertion and lytic switch mechanisms has enabled considerable targeted manipulation of this system thus cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing wolbachia isolates act not only as factories for the in situ production of chimeric phage within the target arthropod vector cells but provide the gene drive system leading to rapid near fixation of the infected phenotype in the arthropod population which can be replaced by other ci types providing the ability to replace or remove transgenic phages from the population as required we outline i the development of chimeric phages that encode for defective interfering particles to reduce vector competency of arthropod vectored arboviruses or arthropod pathogens and illustrate current progress using dengue and japanese encephalitis viruses within mosquito cell lines and mid-gut tissue culture ii the adaptation of this system to control ssrna viral pathogens of commercial shrimps and honey bees and iii the engineering of key genes from ichnoviruses agicvak45 into ci-wolbachia for paratransformation of insect parasitoids and their lepidopteran pests to enhance integrated pest management schemes through altered host immunity to parasitoids 63 ornithodoros savignyi as a vector of

salivary glands of thai cattle ticks boophilus microplus ectoparasites of livestock in thailand and are responsible for severe economic losses through direct effects of feeding and as vectors of pathogens the feasibility of an anti-tick vaccine against b microplus has recently been successful excluding bm86 and bm95 other potential candidate proteins were searched and developed a protein bm91 has regions of amino acid sequence similarity to angiotensin converting enzymes bm91 has also been found to be effective as the candidate antigen on its own for the anti-tick infestation the objective of this study was to clone and sequence cdna encoding bm91 from b microplus indigenous to thailand mrna was isolated from salivary glands and cdna encoding bm91 was amplified with pcr cloned into the ppicza vector and transformed into escherichia coli dh5-a competent cells purified plasmid dna was sequenced with dye terminator cycle sequencing reactions and bm91 nucleotide and deduced amino acid were analyzed nucleotide sequence analysis showed open reading frames of 1893 bps encoding proteins of 631 amino acids by using the ncbi-blast conserved domain search for similar domain the result showed similarities to peptidasem2 the angiotensin-converting enzyme the predicted n-glycosylation sites by netnglyc 10 server was found at amino acid positions 51 58 88 113 207 306 313 475 and 628  comparison of both nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acids showed high identity to an angiotensin-converting enzyme-like protein precursor of b microplus registered in genbank ac no u62809 resulting in 96 identity to our knowledge this work represents the first report of bm91 sequence analysis from an asian strain of b microplus bm91 divergence among thai and other b microplus strains suggests that further work is warranted to determine if a geographic strain-specific vaccine would be more effective in thailand proteomics is an experimental approach to understand the message

birds are a natural reservoir of influenza viruses from which influenza can penetrate in population of domestic birds migrations of wild birds promote geographical spreading of various strains of influenza a viruses it is necessary to monitor the circulation of influenza viruses among wild birds in regions located on birds migration ways the special importance should be given to monitoring of influenza viruses among synanthropic birds because of their close contacts with man and domestic animals on the one hand and with wild biocenoses on the other the susceptibility of synanthropic birds to high pathogenic avian influenza hpai virus was shown in many works since september 2005 till march 2006 we have collected samples from synanthropic birds in omsk and novosibirsk region south of western siberia to investigate the influenza virus infection carrier state we have investigated 458 samples from 10 bird species as a result of screening research in chicken embryos we have isolated five viruses that showed gemmaglutination activity serological typing of isolates was carried out with the help of serums kindly given by dr b webster memphis usa isolate of h4 serotype was isolated only from one bird from pica pica during the epizootic period that is equal to 02 all the other four isolates belonged to a new castle virus thus we have not registered high pathogenic avian influenza viruses in synanthropic birds during epizootic and postepizootic periods probably it accounts for weak susceptibility of synanthropic birds or small amount of samples the problems of property preservation of museum and collection strains of mycobacteria of the tuberculosis complex at long-term cultivation cultivating microorganisms on an artificial medium we recover it from the process of interaction with macroorganism and start the process of changes in genotype stability the recent data are indicates on property changes of many bacterial pathogens after two to three passages while cultivation on artificial media we have developed a new method of cultivation of pathogenic mycobacteria on a basis of continuous cell culture the investigated strains of pathogenic mycobacteria are passaged with the help of two methods on levenstein-yensen medium and on dm eagles mem growth medium with vero cell culture sensitive laboratory animals guinea pigs were used for pathogenicity studies the guinea pigs were euthanasied on day 80 post-infection estimation of pathological changes in internal organs of guinea pigs showed that pathologic changes started eliminating with third passage while cultivating on levenstein-yensen medium evaluation of internal organs of guinea pigs infected with m tuberculosis grown on dm eagles mem vero medium showed that pathological changes are observed at least up to passage 13 the examination of internal organs of guinea pigs infected with m tuberculosis grown on dm eagles mem-vero medium showed that pathological changes were high and constant the following conclusions can be drawn from the obtained results the virulence of mycobacterium of the tuberculosis complex decreases while cultivation on levenstein-yensen medium pathological pictures differ in animals infected with mycobacteria cultivated using a continuous cell culture and in those infected with mycobacteria grown on levenstein-yensen medium we have developed a new method of cultivation that allows to remain the most important biological properties unchanged at long-term cultivation on a continuous cell culture supatra areekit arda pakpitchareon sunsanee phasook sintawee

infected not only human but also animals such as cats monkeys and dogs whereas b pahangi causes morbidity only in cat reserviors due to their similarity in morphologies and others the identification of both brugian species in such carriers based on traditional detection tools can be difficult and mostly lead to misdiagnosis hence the data based on genes is the alternative useful information for not only parasite identification but also their genetic diversities the internal transcribed spacer its regions were used to determine the genetic diversity of brugia spp within domestic cat reservoirs from different geographical areas in thailand microfilaria was separated and their dna was extracted prior to pcr amplification the specific primers of its1 and its2 regions were used to yield the pcr products of 580 bp and 660 bp in size respectively the fragments were cloned sequenced and aligned in comparison to the reported data of b malayi and w bancrofti it was found that its1 and its2 phylogenetic trees demonstrated the genetic variation among brugia spp phylogenetic trees based on neighbor joining nj and dna parsimony dna pars revealed both single infection of either b malayi cats 1 3 and 4 or b pahangi cats 6 and 7 and mix infection of both brugia spp cats 2 and 5 it can be proposed that its regions could be used for studying genetic diversity of brugia spp

 spread over most of the country wide variations of level of incidence over areas mean that to be efficient the control strategy needs the delineation of risk areas classical entomological indices are used by public health authorities to launch local vector control activities but their reliability to identify areas with higher incidence and to reduce it is limited in the frame of a who-tdr program to develop new entomological indices based on pupae counts an exhaustive survey of potential breeding sites has been done in areas with different types of urbanization in thailand a gis has been developed using the precise localization gps of houses as a basic layer the characterization of the most productive breeding sites in terms of pupae the density of human population and socio economical indicators such as the field description of the type of dwellings unmanaged urban environment town houses residential and administrative areas villages were additional layers of information most productive bs were similar in the different areas the containers for water storage produced up to 90 of the pupae which density could reach 01-26 pupae per person the correlation between the number of potential bs and the number of pupae is higher 09 if we consider groups of neighboring houses density of attributes a minimal threshold was defined under which stochastic process in bs colonization may lead to an interruption in pupae production spatial patterns in the distribution of pupae allows to identify areas were targeted vector control should be easier and more efficient this method combining field survey for the characterization of productive breeding sites and gis technology to delineate areas with a specific type of urbanization will help to identify similar environments likely to evolve simultaneously in response to the emergence of epidemic phenomena control strategies can therefore target the most productive containers but also key areas in the

university of edinburgh united kingdom as concern mounts over the threat posed by rna viruses and the amount of genomic information we have for them increases a single web application providing key genomic resources for all species is timely we have created the rna virus database to perform six main services for all 700 rna viral species identify submitted viral nucleotide or amino acid sequences provide curated whole genome nucleotide alignments -with corresponding phylogenetic trees -for each virus align submitted nucleotide sequences to the above provide amino acid sequences for all viral genes and allow the user to extract the corresponding region from the above whole genome alignments provide whole translated genomes for each viral species show links to the more specialised web sites for the viruses of greatest medical importance including genotyping tools we also link to other sites providing further taxonomic or biological information for each virus we are currently using the database to analyse the deep phylogeny of rna viruses and the relationship between genome size and genome architecture we expect the website version of the database to facilitate and

disease causing respiratory illness when a susceptible human host inhales contaminated aerosolized water molecular epidemiology and diversity studies of l pneumophila usually compare pfge andor aflp patterns from bacterial cultures derived from respiratory and environmental samples recently a sequence based typing scheme based on six loci has been developed for this species which is also applied on cultured isolates but culture of this species on selective media despite its high specificity presents low sensitivity only 5-15 of the samples produce cultured isolates in order to improve the efficiency of sequence based analysis of l pneumophila we have developed a protocol to amplify and sequence dna extracted from uncultured respiratory samples and we have used it to sequence and compare three intergenic regions and internal fragments of six genes of the l pneumophila clinical and environmental origin sequences of these nine markers were derived from 40 environmental samples and 40 clinical samples taken from different years and were used to study the genetic diversity and population structure of legionella strains in a spanish region that includes an area where legionellosis has become almost endemic with continuous bouts of sporadic cases and several outbreaks affecting tens even hundreds of people we have also studied the phylogenetic relationships among all these 80 isolates phylogenetic analyses have revealed that isolates recovered from patients in years 1999 2004 and 2005 from this area were almost identical moreover genetic differentiation between clinical isolates from this area and the remaining clinical strains was detected statistics measuring genetic differentiation between clinical and environmental data sets also showed a significant differentiation for all 9 markers both when analyzed independently and when combined these results are suggestive of an unexpected differentiation between clinical and environmental

malaria is the major vector-borne infectious disease nearly 40 of the worlds population is at risk and close to 2 million persons mostly children under the age of five die every year many insects posses lectins with distinct sugar specificities which play important recognition and protective roles in immune defense against microbial pathogens and parasitic protozoans interactions between parasites and vector gut walls may be mediated by the carbohydrates on the surface of parasites and lectin in the vector gut fibrinogen-related proteins are a kind of lectin so in this study we used primers that flanking a sequence of fibrinogen gene based on anopheles gambiae genome anopheles stephensi specimens were collected from sistan and baluchistan province followed by dna extraction amplification of a 380 bp fragment and sequencing by using fbn9 primers two samples originated from sarbaz and nikshahr districts had 100 similarity with each other and a gc count of 5684 however its nucleotide similarity with this fragment in anopheles gambiae is about 90 while amino acid sequences had 92 similarity in these two main vector species of malaria in africa and asia in order to study the role of these genes in interaction between plasmodium and anopheles and to find candidate molecules in designing transmission blocking vaccine it is necessary to do further research to obtain more information on the structure of lectin related genes in this important but neglected anopheles vectors objective the goal of the work was to assess the heterogeneity of the regions encoding reverse transcriptase and protease of the hiv variants circulating in novosibirsk and to analyze the emergence of the virus variants carrying drug-resistance mutations patients and methods the peripheral blood samples of hiv-infected patients from the novosibirsk aids center were used in the work the patients were divided into two groupsthose received antiretrovirus therapy art and not received it hiv-1 rna was isolated from blood sera dna nucleotide sequences were determined in a beckman ceq2000xl beckman coulter usa automated sequencer mutations were assayed for their connection with drug-resistance using the stanford university hiv database drug resistance results overall the fragments for the regions of hiv-1 reverse transcriptase were obtained and analyzed for 84 hiv-1 variants of protease for 54 variants phylogenetic analysis of the obtained reverse transcriptase sequences demonstrated that the hiv variants cluster into two main clades one belonging to hiv-1 subtype b and the other to subtype a the mutations belonging to the secondary resistance mutations described for hiv-1 subtype b were detectable in all the samples the mutations connected with the drug resistance to protease inhibitors were recorded in the following codons i13v 40 of the samples studied h69k 70 m36i 100 v77i 50 and i93l 100 the detected occurrence rate of mutation a62v in reverse transcriptase gene amounted to 81 analysis of the samples for the presence of primary mutations rendering hiv-1 resistant demonstrated that the hiv-1 variants isolated from the not received art patients had no primary resistance mutations the mutations determining resistance to a wide range of drugs were found in 78 hiv variants from the art patients in the studied hiv variants isolated from the patients receiving reverse transcriptase inhibitors the most frequently met mutations occur at codons 215 184 41 and 210 in the case of administration of nucleoside inhibitors and at codons 103 181 184 188 and 190 in the case of nonnucleoside inhibitors in the case of treatment with protease inhibitors the resistance mutations emerge at a considerably lower rate conclusion as no resistant variants were isolated from the patients that did not receive art we may assume that the resistant variants had not distributed in novosibirsk the hiv variants isolated from art patient treated for a period over 1 year developed multiple drug resistance this work demonstrates that it is of the utmost importance to monitor the hiv-1 drug resistance in the clinical practice administration of the anti-retrovirus therapy in our country is only at its very beginning therefore emergence of hiv-1 drug resistant variants is possible in the nearest future keywords hiv-1 reverse transcriptase protease genetic heterogeneity drug-resistance mutations the association of host hla type and the sequence variation of gag gene of hiv-1 crf01ae subtype human immunodeficiency virus or hiv is one of the most well-known viruses as other viruses the survivability of hiv is hanged in the balance with two arms first side is the selection pressures such as an immune response and antiretroviral drug and another is the capability of the virus for escaping from these selection pressures because hiv has an extraordinary of genetic diversity and the ability that can infect and replicate in the cellular component of the immune system these seem to make hiv undefeatable however the immune pressure also leaves the scare as a traceable history on the viral genome to determine the effect of host immune response we analyzed the viral genetic diversity of 370 hiv-1 crf01ae gag sequences obtained from 116 hiv-1 infected couples and examined the association between host hla and the sequence polymorphism we found that the rate of sequence variability was depended on the region of gag gene the part of gag gene that had highest mean sequence variability was p2 spacer region followed by p6 matrix p1 nucleocapsid and the most conserved capsid region respectively we had identified 52 variable sites that were associated with 12 host hla alleles most associations were observed in the positions that had high polymorphism the variable sites that associated with the same hla were clustered in the specific region of gag especially hla-a hla-a02 a11 and a24 associated variable sites were clustered in the matrix protein whereas the variable sites that associated with hla-b were distributed in all parts of gag protein fifteen variable sites located within hla-specific ctl epitopes although most of variable sites did not locate within hla-specific ctl epitopes we found that some of them were correlated with the variable sites that located within hlaspecific ctl epitopes this correlation might be a compensatory mechanism of the escape mutation reversion of the mutated to wild type amino acid was commonly found in many variable sites when the virus was transmitted from the hla-presented patient to their wives or husbands that did not have that hla the rate of reversion depended on the strength of the association our result showed that the hlarestricted immune response and the reversible escape mutation were the basic mechanism that caused the sequence variation of hiv-1 saber gholizadeh 1  sedigheh zakeri 1  seyda azra qamar 12  navid dinparast djadid 1 1 malaria research group mrg

sequences of 18s rdna 2100 bp from 42 isolates of trypanosomes were aligned against those of euglena viridis and khawkinea quartana by using clus-talx program the dna parsimony dna par phylogenetic tree showed five hypervariable regions hv within 18s rdna sequences upon analysis of each region it was found that dna par tree of the hv region 2 272 bp was corresponded to dna par tree of 18s rdna in classification of trypanosoma sp the hv regions 1 and 3 242 bp and 314 bp the distinction of section salivaria from other trypanosoma sp whereas hv regions 4 and 5 292 bp and 402 bp could discriminate only section stercoraria from the others based on the analysis it can be concluded that dna par tree inferring from hv regions of 18s rdna could represent the tree of 18s rdna thus this could be applicable for identification and discrimination of trypanosoma sp which will be useful for epidemiological study and the control of the disease the nucleotide sequences of 18s rdna and internal transcribed spacer its regions were used for studying the relationships of trypanosoma evansi isolate from a buffalo the sequences were analyzed and compared to 18s rdna and the its regions of the other trypanosoma spp maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using leishmania major as the outgroup the tree of 18s rdna indicated that t evansi buffalo b18 isolate was closely related to those of taiwan and t brucei stock the its tree showed the genetic diversity among 32 clones of t evansi b18 within a single host this data will be useful for epidemiological and dynamic studies for designing the rational control programs of the disease echinococcus multilocularis is a cestode responsible for one of the most important zoonosis in the northern hemisphere the alveolar echinococcosis disease the parasite involves in its live cycle mainly foxes as definitive hosts dh and rodents as intermediate host ih  human can accidentally act as ih and develop the disease after a long incubation period 10-15 years in france about 15 new cases are recorded each year the parasite is chiefly present in the east and the centre of the country since 1984 7 human cases were described in the department of the ardennes and then could be considered as an emergent endemic focus moreover the prevalence in foxes reached 53 due to the long incubation period the number of human cases could not reflect the current activity of the parasite in this area the genetic diversity of the parasite could reflect its activity in the ardennes in this aim we have studied two microsatellite dna targets the tandem repeat multilocus microsatellite emsb and the single locus microsatellite nak1 on a panel of 25 red foxes presenting different worm burdens these two targets allowed us to defined 6 main genotypes among 145 adult worms a fox presenting the more important worm burden n  73380 worms harboured individuals with a heterozygote genotype for the nak1 locus suggesting cross-fertilization event from the microsatellite analysis we proved to be able to detect genetic variability in restricted areas and thus to track dynamic transmission of e multilocularis at local scale an emerging infectious disease called infectious salmon anemia isa among farmed salmon has raised the concern of its impact on salmon-farming industry the causative agent was identified to be a segmented rna virus and named as infectious salmon anemia virus isav earlier phylogenetic analyses classified the isav predominating in european and north american aquacultural farms separately into two genetically distinct strains european eu and north american na type it was suggested that human traffic and trading have transported their common ancestor between these continents and led to their local emergences a recent evolutionary study on isav hemagglutinin-esterase he and fusion protein fp gene suggested under global molecular clock assumption atypically low substitution rates 10 6 and 10 5 substitutionssiteyear respectively comparing to other rna viruses this result has new implications on the viral epidemiology and the hypothesis of origin eu and na isolates may have separated long before any human traffic could transport the virus we examined the genetic sequences of he gene from both eu and na strains of isav our result demonstrated a large disparity of the substitution rates with in the phylogeny which disrupted the molecular clock assumption was caused by the presence of a small group of virus isolates with extremely low rate the presence of these isolates in the phylogeny can mislead the substitution rate estimation in global clock analysis by using relaxed molecular clock models implemented in the bayesian framework which accommodating the rate variation the time of the most recent common ancestor of eu and na strains was extrapolated to around 300 years ago this finding reasserts the original hypothesis suggesting the translocation of ancient isav between north america and europe could be a consequence of human cross-ocean traffic and trading which had been refuted by the recent global clock analysis two samples of pigs infected food and mouth disease virus fmdv in the central part of thailand in 2005 were identified by rt-pcr and nucleotide sequencing the nucleotide sequence was analyzed of multiple alignment and constructed dendrogram by

and sergipe a total of 2000 mtb isolates was submitted to spoligotyping and 42 of the isolates were from the southeastern region the richest and most industrialized brazilian region a considerable variability of spoligotypes was observed and upon comparison with already described genotype families 515 were classified as the latin american and mediterranean lam family 20 as the t family and 13 as the haarlem family within the lam family 27 was lam 9 and within the haarlem family 55 belonged to the haarlem 3 class 69 of the t family was t1 another 16 were recognized as other families including the x family s family east african and indian family and the beijing family 3 strains in rio de janeiro city unrecognized profiles u and profiles that were classifieds only by the type number in the spoldb4 database were also observed besides genotypes already described in literature 15 were classified as new types and include profiles belonging to lam haarlem t and other families interestingly was the absence of lam class 7 and 10 furthermore no genotypes characteristic for other species of the mtbc were observed our data demonstrate the high prevalence of some strain families

pathogenesis of disease phenotype was assessed by a novel approach for this organism consisting of gastric mucosal h pylori gene transcription levels determination and comparisons made according to disease phenotype materials and methods gastric mucosal biopsies were collected from patients with peptic ulcer disease pud gastritis and normal mucosa in an academic medical center in lebanon h pylori was detected in these biopsies by rapid urease clo tm  test and pcr amplification of the ureasea gene h pylori virulence genes their transcription and transcription levels were determined respectively by pcr rt-pcr and real time rt-pcr results forty-five percent of patients were h pylori positive by pcr of the ureasea gene 375 of whom had caga and 594 had vaca the vaca s1a allele was more prevalent in our study population and appeared to be associated with increased virulence the caga and vaca genes were detected and transcribed more frequently in pud patients and the transcription levels of both caga and vaca genes were observed to be higher in endoscopically apparent disease phenotypes ie pud gastropathy than in controls suggesting that they likely contribute to disease pathogenesis conclusions this study provided insight into the virulence potential of h pylori encountered in lebanese patients with gastroduodenal pathology the results of our investigation in

marked imbalance in th 1 th 2 activity is noticeable africa we have compared the genetic profile of pyrimethamine-resistance in melanesia where unique chloroquine resistance developed independently including the polymorphism of the dihydrofolate reductase gene dhfr and microsatellite haplotypes flanking dhfr in a total of 285 isolates from different regions of melanesia papua new guinea vanuatu and solomon and southeast asia thailand and cambodia nearly all isolates 92 in melanesia harbored a dhfr double mutant cnrni at positions 50 51 59 108 and 164 whereas 98 of isolates were either triple cirni or quartet cirnl mutants in southeast asia microsatellite analysis revealed two distinct lineages of the dhfr double mutants in melanesia one lineage had the same microsatellite haplotype as reported in southeast asia and africa suggesting the spread to melanesia from southeast asia the other lineage had microsatellite haplotype not found elsewhere this study therefore provides evidence for independent at least partly unique evolution of p falciparum pyrimethamine-resistance in melanesia in contrast to the apparent common evolution in southeast asia and africa in mexico

pigs from several districts in mexico state and cysticercus racemosus and c cellulosae from patients with neurocysticercosis were pcr-rflp analyzed with several restriction enzymes the pcr-rflp data were analyzed with the li nei s ij  2 n i  j n i  n j  index the similarity matrix was constructed among the different isolates of cysticerci using ntsys-pc version 20 software and the corresponding dendrogram with the upgma program the statistical analysis was done with the manteel test these analyses showed three groups of cysticerci isolated from pigs and three groups from human brain the dendrograms demonstrated that there is intraspecific variability in t solium isolates from mexico state sequencing and polymorphism analysis showed that the phylogenetic tree of its1 has two related groups the first mexican and the second phylipino the consensus tree of the coi gene shows four groups and the highest nucleotide diversity of the three analyzed sites we analyzed group of 98 vre

checked for species-specific enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis ddl genes by pcr mics for ampicillin and glycopeptides were determined vana vanb vanc and vand genes were detected by pcr virulence factors genes were detected using pcr method with primers specific for five genes from cytolysin complex gelatinase aggregation substance enterococcal proteins efaa and surface protein genes among 98 strains of vre the most prevalent was e faecium 827 according to biochemical identification results other vre species embraced e faecium e durans e gallinarum and two strains of enterococcus

understand the interaction between a series of efavirenz derivatives with wt and k103n hiv-1 rt to model the potential binding modes of efavirenz derivatives in the binding pocket of wt and k103n hiv-1 rt molecular docking approaches by using gold and autodock 30 programs were performed the results show that the docking results obtained from both methods reveal a good ability to reproduce the x-ray bound conformation with rmsd less than 10  for both wt and mutant enzymes the docking calculations of all efavirenz derivatives in the data set were consecutively performed to elucidate their orientations in the binding pockets the results derived from docking analysis give additional information and further probes the inhibitor-enzyme interactions the correlation of the results obtained from docking models and the inhibitory activities validate each other and lead to better understanding of the structural requirements for the activity therefore these results are informative to improve the development of more efficient hiv-1 rt inhibitors especially active against mutant enzyme based on the molecular alignment of conformations obtained from molecular docking procedures the high predictive 3d-qsar models were produced by using comfa and comsia approaches the comfa models reveal the importance of steric and electrostatic interactions through contour maps the resulting comsia models enhance the understanding of steric electrostatic hydrophobic electron donor and acceptor requirements for ligands binding to the k103n hiv-1 rt consequently the results obtained from structure-based and ligandbased design approaches can be integrated to identify the structural requirements of hiv-1 rt inhibitors in the class of efavirenz compounds the principle derived from the

maryam saleh 12  virander singh chauhan 12 1 pasteur institute of iran tehran iran 2 icgeb new delhi india introduction malaria is still a major parasitic disease despite efforts spanning more than a century to eradicate or control it because of the poor understanding of the functions of the malaria parasite one of the main reasons for the slow progress in the development of new anti-malarial or for an effective malaria vaccine has been the poor understanding of the functions of most of the malaria parasite proteins recently rna interference rnai has emerged as a powerful tool to understand the gene function in variety of organisms and to inhibit the gene expression on the level of single gene gene families and the entire genome the major goals of this study is to develop rnai technologies for functional genomic studies in malaria and follow it for next studies in future is to understand molecular mechanisms of malaria drugs and host-parasite interactions method plasmodium falciparum and to a much lesser extent plasmodium vivax are the main causes of disease and death from malaria the genome sequencing project of the human malaria parasite p falciparum has identified 5300 proteins of which 60 3208 have not been assigned any function even though gene targeting by homologous recombination has been successfully used to understand the functions of a number of parasite proteins it still has limitations following methodology has been used for carrying out rnai for the two cystein protease genes of plasmodium falciparum 1 selection of dsrnasirna sequences the length requirement of dsrna has been recommended greater than 500 bp 2 dsrna preparation using pcr with appropriate rna polymerase 3 preparation of sirna donze and picard 2002  4 treatment of parasite with dsrnasirna 5 facs analysis of dsrnasirna treated gfp parasite lines 6 detection of reduction in protein by western blotting results this study earlier carried out an in-depth study to establish rnai in p falciparum in vitro for the two cystein protease genes  falcipain 1 and 2 of the parasite using dsrnas corresponding to cystein protease genes of p falciparum we demonstrated that falcipains play an important role in hemoglobin degradation in this process specific dsrna elicits the degradation of cognate mrna the factors involved in the reactivation of chagasic infection are not clear enough and may be related to selective host immune depletion or parasite genetic diversity to evaluate the role of the parasites genetic in t cruzi infection reactivation induced by ciclophosphamide immunosupression groups of 32 swiss mice were inoculated with t cruzi clonal stocks classified as t cruzi i cuicacl1 p209cl1 gambacl1 sp104cl1 and t cruzi ii bug2148cl1 mncl2 ivvcl4 mvbcl8 were used infected animals were treated with ciclophosphamide when was with subpatent parasitemia still during the acute phase ap and chronic phase cp animals infected with t cruzi i stocks showed 826 and 475 of parasitemia reactivation during the ap and cp respectively being observed 0 100 100 and 100 of parasitemia reactivation in animals inoculated with clones sp104cl1 gambacl1 cuicacl1 and p209cl1 respectively in the ap and 80 40 50 and 20 in cp on the other hand animals infected with t cruzi ii showed only 41 of parasitemia reactivation when immunosuppressed during the ap and 0 in cp however the heart and skeletal muscle lesions of animals infected by t cruzi i were similar to those observed in controls infected and not immunosupressed group ci by the way an increase of encephalic lesions in animals immunosupressed during the cp in relation to ci was observed although parasitemia reactivation was not observed in animals infected with t cruzi ii clones an increase of inflammatory process in the heart and skeletal muscle but not in the brain was observed among animals infected with bug2148cl1 these results showed that the genetic diversity of t cruzi has an important role on the reactivation of the infection after immunosupression and corroborates the working hypothesis subjacent to the model clonal theory in t cruzi identification of theileria in endangered serow and

in japan the completely sequence of 18srrna will be done soon this is the first report of theileriosis in the wildlife serow and elders deer in the zoo in thailand mosquitoes acting as vectors of diseases are particularly involved in the transmission of viruses thus the abundance of some tree-hole breeding species strongly depends on weather specially rainfall the aim of this paper is to provide a tool to predict vector abundance in order to describe the dynamics of these mosquito populations we developed a matrix model integrating climate fluctuations the population is structured in five stages two egg stages immature and mature one larval stage and two flying stages nulliparous and parous adult females we considered the water availability in breeding-sites as the main environmental factor affecting the mosquito life cycle the model represents the evolution of the mosquito abundance in each stage over time in connexion with water availability this model was used to simulate the abundance trends over three years of two mosquito species aedes africanus theobald and aedes furcifer edwards vectors of the yellow fever in cte divoire west africa water dynamics in the tree-hole was reproduced from daily rainfall data the results we obtained show a good match between the simulated population and the field data over the time period considered hepatitis c virus hcv is a major cause of liver disease worldwide and a potential cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in the future the prevalence of hcv infection is estimated to be 2 representing about 170 million people in the world hepatitis c virus is characterized by a high degree of genetic heterogeneity although homologous recombination has been demonstrated in many members of the family flaviviridae to which hcv belongs there are few studies reporting recombination on natural populations of hcv suggesting that these events are rare in vivo furthermore these few studies have focused on hcv recombination between different genotypes subtypes but there are no reports about the extent of intragenotype or intra-subtype recombination between viral strains infecting the same patient given the important implications of recombination for rna virus evolution our aim in this study has been to assess the existence and eventually the frequency of intragenic recombination on hcv for this we have analyzed two regions of the hcv genome ns5a and e1-e2 in viruses obtained from patients belonging to two different groups i infected only with hcv either treated with interferon plus ribavirin or treatment nave and ii hcv-hiv co-infected patients with and without treatment against hiv the complete data set included more than 16000 clonal sequences from 215 samples of 119 patients recombination analyses were performed using 6 different methods implemented in rdp3 program we have detected recombination events by at least 3 of the 6 methods used in 12 of the samples which belonged to all the groups described and to the two genomic regions studied consequently intragenic recombination cannot be disregarded as a potentially important mechanism generating genetic variation in hcv beth shapiro robert belshaw andrew rambuat oxford university department of zoology oxford ox1 3ps uk although approximately 200000 gene sequences and 1000 complete genomes from rna viruses are available on gen-bank the origin phylogenetic relationships and mechanisms of genome evolution of these important infectious agents are largely unknown this is due in part to the rapid rate of mutation of rna viruses which results in very little sequence similarity remaining even between closely related viruses and after relatively little evolutionary time as a consequence traditional phylogenetic methods are inappropriate for reconstructing evolutionary relationships between rna viruses here we use an alignment-free method to assess the relatedness between rna viruses we perform pairwise comparisons between all available rna virus genomes and between each viral genome and 1000 simulated genomes to assess the extent to which short fragments of amino acid sequences are conserved across various taxonomic levels we find significantly more conservation of amino acid fragments than is expected by chance when comparing within genera within subfamilies and within families these results suggest that despite the high rate of mutation it may be possible to use phylogenetic methods based on identifying sequence homology to reconstruct deeper taxonomic relationships among rna viruses towards

deal with a large scale the molecular approach offers this flexibility thus two pcr assays based on the ssu rrna and cytochrome b genes were developed in our laboratory these new ways of diagnosing malaria are designed for being compatible with high-throughput methods namely dot blot and snp analysis in cambodia a cross-sectional malaria survey was conducted in the rattanakiri province which is characterized by a high malaria transmission rate and low levels of drugresistance compared with the rest of the country in three selected villages 337 blood spots were collected based on these samples our new diagnosis techniques were compared with two reference methods microscopy and a nested pcr method published by singh et al 1999  our results confirmed the previously reported high sensitivity and specificity of molecular methods indeed the prevalence of plasmodium infections in the three studied villages increased from 415 using giemsa-stained thick blood smears to 76 using the reference pcr method the new high-throughput methods resulted in a prevalence of 80 dot blot and 85 snp analysis respectively for the majority of samples species typing was also confirmed by these three methods contradictory results were mostly related to detection of minor species p malariae and p ovale in mixed infections however similar results were obtained in 83 of tested isolates molecular large-scale methods provide more accurate informations of the malaria epidemiology in a country or region in particular they reveal a much larger distribution of plasmodium infections than previously supposed and thus are useful for a better follow-up of malaria control measures the implication of these new tools will be discussed in particular the possibility to adapt cytochrome b snp

paper we phylogenetically examine the promoter region of cd40l in primates and other mammals via phylogenetic shadowing this analysis revealed several regions of the promoter of cd40l that were highly constrained and thereby inferred to be functional these constrained regions confirmed known regulatory sites that had been studied in vitro in additional a highly constrained region with an nf-at recognition site was also identified this region would be an excellent target for studies of cd40l regulation in vitro these analyses also showed that the primate and rodent cd40l do not share a similar set of promoter binding sites and instead that a mouse specific and a primate specific promoter has evolved suggesting that this gene is differently regulated in these species the

singapore the sars-cov nucleocapsid n protein is a major structural component of the virus capsid and is postulated to play important roles in viral pathogenesis replication and rna packaging besides these the n protein has also been predicted to be involved in a variety of other important functions in the viral life cycle here we present and discuss recent data obtained from our laboratory showing the diversity of host pathways that this protein may be involved in we have tested the capability of n protein to self-associate using its 140 amino acid interaction domain implying that n may be involved in various regulatory activities in the infected cell mammalian cell expression studies further proved our in-silico predictions that the 46 kda n protein is a phosphoprotein immunoflouresence in-vitro phosphorylation and c-dna substraction tech-niques subsequently were used to prove that the serinephosphorylated n was stable and localized in the cytoplasm and

development of anti-flu and anti-hiv microbicide preparations questions concerning the development of optimal means of transporting the complex compounds of this class are investigated and the effective medicinal forms also are prepared in order to eliminate irritating action we included efficient antivirus compounds into the ph-dependent interpolymeric complex ipc which is stable into weakly acidic media and decompose with the release of active anti-virus preparation in neutral andor alkaline media the anti-virus efficiency of some ipc proposed has been demonstrated experimentally in vitro up to 99 hiv-1 suppressed along with a decrease in local toxic action of preparation included in the ipc in vivo when applied on vaginal mucous membrane of white mice morphological studies

globally emergent infectious disease involving complex ecological processes that as such requires a systems analytic approach in order to elucidate patterns of pathogen transmission within the host reservoir community an ecosystems-level model of leptospirosis acknowledges the cross-scale interactions that are relevant to the ecology of this disease and recognizes the necessity of a trans-discipline solution that includes consideration of the molecular cellular and organismal factors likely to be involved in disease emergence in human populations we highlight three specific contributions to an understanding of leptospirosis in the environment that can be made by application of a recent advance in molecular techniques specifically quantitative polymerase chain real-time reaction or q rt-pcr methods the use of q rt-pcr in ecological investigations of pathogenic leptospires allows for 1 the ability to quantify an environmental disease risk to humans 2 an estimate of pathogen type abundance which thereby allows for an understanding of pathogen community assembly and 3 the ability to investigate thresholds of pathogen persistence in the environment while q rt-pcr will help little in elucidating the evolutionary relationships amongst leptospiral types of interest this promising modern molecular technique should be useful for identifying the scale and magnitude of transmission patterns of pathogenic leptospires in the environment in order to investigate the genotype of giardia duodenalis from domestic and stray cats in iran feces were collected from 181 cats screened by microscopy and examined by molecular method which included dna extraction triosephosphate isomerase gene amplification pcr and restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp 21 cats were found to be infected with giardia and harboring cysts or trophozoites belonging to assemblage a and subtypes of this assemblage also the human isolate of giardia in iran has been clearly specified to be assemblage a and its subtypes these findings suggest that infection of humans by zoonotic genotypes from domestic and stray cats and vice versa is possible and could be of high significance this is

immunological defects in man characterized by blocking in t-cell development andor functions with variable degree of simultaneous association of b-cell or natural killer nk cell dysfunction previous studies indicated that there was a genetic heterogeneity underlying scid including mutation in il2rg il7ra jak3 and cd3d gene recently we have molecularly characterized a 2 year-old girl presenting with bcgosis and recurrent serious bacterial infections including sepsis this patient had distinctive immunological profiles of t   b   nk  scid therefore we firstly analyzed il7ra and cd3d genes which have been previously shown to cause such phenotype we identified a novel adenine insertion at an adenine tract located between nucleotide 444-450 of il7ra encoded cd127 resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon a quantitative real-time pcr analysis revealed that the relative mrna expression were markedly reduce 0037 in the patient and considerably decrease and her parents 0119 0167 compared to normal 1 n  8 this suggested that this mutation hampered mrna expression possibly due to the non-sense mediated decay mechanism nmd using flow cytometric analysis we demonstrated that there was a significant reduction of cd127 positive-t cells in the patient confirming in vivo reduction at the protein level finally this truncated cd127 protein was identified as expected by 2-dimention electrophoresis-western blotting assay our study provided for the first time the molecular basis of scid in southeast asian population and characterization of further cases will provide

gardel and welgevonden have been completely sequenced the three strains display genomes of differing sizes with 1499920 bp 1512977 bp and 1516355 bp the genome organization is highly conserved with a

genomes rearrangements ie deletions or extensive mutations e ruminantium displays a strong strandspecific compositional bias as well as a specific group of membrane proteins e ruminantium displays a strong gc bias resulting in the presence of different codon usages in leading and lagging strands moreover e ruminantium displays an active specific process of genome expansioncontraction targeted at tandem repeats in non-coding regions and based on the addition or removal of ca 150 bp tandem units two populations of tandems repeats are present short tandems displaying a period of 12-15 bp associated to coding sequences and long tandems displaying a period of 150 bp and associated to noncoding regions the long tandems are affected by a gc bias whereas the short tandems are not this

rain forests worldwide peter grubb j peter bellingham j takashi kohyama s frida piper i alfredo valido   it has long been established that in tropical lowland rain forest tlrf on most soils there is a suite of species which need canopy gaps for establishment swaine  whitmore 1988 such gapdemanding species are absent from lowland rain forests only on the poorest soils where the trees are relatively short many of the taller trees die standing and substantial canopy gaps made by treefall are few eg in amazonian caatinga on seasonally waterlogged white sand soils coomes  grubb 1996 and heath forests on welldrained sands in se asia l nagy personal communication ashton 2013 gapdemanders depend on rapid growth for their persistence in the community and this is made difficult when paucity of nutrient supply andor periodic dry spells combine with root competition in relatively small canopy gaps the reality of such competition was shown experimentally for amazonian caatinga by coomes  grubb 1998 concerning the forests on more fertile soils denslow 1987 p 436 wrote tree species that have a high demand for light are a larger proportion of the flora in forests subject to largescale disturbances whitmore 1989 accepted that there are many more individuals of gapdemanding trees in areas with a greater extent of disturbance eg papua new guinea compared with borneo but emphasized that in both these areas only a small minority of the tree species are gapdemanding for establishment however a smallerscale comparison is informative within the island of borneo there is a strong contrast in the incidence of gapdemanding species between the geologically young area in brunei where the slopes are steep and landslips are common and the geologically older danum area of sabah with subdued slopes few strong winds and few treefall gaps in the former area a comparatively large number of gapdemanding species is present in the forest eg at least 11 species of macaranga and in the soil seed bank mitchell 1994 while in the latter area there are few gapdemanding species and very little seed of such species in the soil seed bank kennedy  swaine 1992 this comparison gives support to denslows 1987 suggestion warm temperate rain forest wtrf is found at a wide range of latitudes usually within the limits 2643 north or south of the equator but at 2432n in china there have been numerous studies of the dynamics of the forest and the regions are known to differ in the extent of disturbances opening up the canopy but there has been no comparison of all the different regions in terms of the incidence of gapdemanding species we define wtrf as built from evergreen trees able to establish away from canopy gaps and gapdemanding trees that are either evergreen or deciduous depending on the region with the most numerous leafsize class among the evergreen species being microphyll sensu raunkiaer 1934 wtrf is usually 154045 m tall almost no tree species have buttress roots few or none are cauliflorous or ramiflorous depending on region and relatively few species c 1020 have compound leaves in all regions bar east asia few or no species have leaves or leaflets with driptips the forest contains numerous individuals and species of small trees and treelets andor herbs angiosperms or ferns depending on site climbers can be common but very few species make stems of diameter at breast height dbh 10 cm vascular epiphytes vary greatly in abundance but in most regions make up only a small biomass wtrf varies greatly in the role played by conifers depending on region in new zealand and south africa conifers are among the species reaching the greatest heights and girths in new zealand they often form a prominent emergent layer of crowns and the same is seen locally in south africa in eastern asia only conifers reaching moderate to small size are present in chile conifers in the upland part of the core wtrf reach moderate size and only the species of waterlogged sites attain great heights and girths in the azores there is one conifer of moderate height that invades treefall gaps in australian wtrf no conifer is present tree monocots are generally absent bamboo is abundant in chile but otherwise absent treeferns are absent in chile uncommon in japan and china and limited to wetter facies in australia and south africa but are widespread and common in new zealand the distinctions between wtrf and the most similar forest formationtypes both dominated by microphylls are set out as supplementary material in online appendix s1 where we also note species in wtrf that are exceptions to the statements above about buttresses tree monocots cauliflory girthsize in climbers and incidence of prominent epiphytes we define cool temperate rain forest ctrf as differing from wtrf through having a clear dominance of nanophylls sensu raunkiaer 1934 among the taller trees the climatic conditions experienced by the various regions of wtrf which commonly occurs up to an altitude of 600800 m are shown in table 1 near sea level the warmth index of kira 1991 ranges from 7080cmonth in chile to c 150 in the azores in all regions other than eastern asia the cold index of kira 1991 is zero in japan it varies from 0 to 5cmonth rarely down to 10cmonth as shown in fig 2 of hmetahti ahti  koponen 1974 the mean annual rainfall is most often in the range 10002000 mm but can be as low as 700 mm or as high as 4000 mm the seasonality of rainfall varies from a summer maximum via a rather even distribution through the year to a summer minimum there is usually no dry month sensu walter  lieth 19601967 but in the northern part of the chilean wtrf region there are one to two dry months in summer before human intervention wtrf covered a large area in japan and china substantial areas in new zealand chile and south africa and smaller areas on the azores and in se australia fig 1 because most of the wtrf on the azores has been lost and the remainder badly damaged fernndezpalacios et al 2011 we consider the situation in the floristically related subtropical montane rain forest stmrf of southern macaronesia canary islands which also resembles floristically the wtrf of southern europe lost during the last few million years axelrod 1975 the stmrf is similar in structure and physiognomy to the wtrf but  apart from being exclusively montane  it generally differs in being richer in bryophytes on the trees and the ground a result of the frequent cloud cover the dominant leafsize class may be microphyll or notophyll see online appendix s2 several authors have used or continue to use the term subtropical for what we call wtrf see online appendix s1 but we consider that the term subtropical lowland rain forest stlrf should be confined to those forests which are structurally and physiognomically like tlrf except for being dominated by notophylls sensu webb 1959 best exemplified by the lowland rain forest that stretches discontinuously on favourable soils from 22 to 34s in eastern australia speciesrichness is much lower in wtrf than in tlrf or stlrf major families typical of tropical forests in the strictest sense are absent dipterocarpaceae lecythidaceae and myristicaceae in addition certain dicot families and subfamilies typical of both tropical and subtropical forests are absent or represented by very few species annonaceae bignoniaceae burseraceae clusiaceae malpighiaceae melastomataceae meliaceae moraceae phyllanthaceae putranjivaceae rhizophoraceae sapotaceae vochysiaceae dilleniaceaedelinoideae and doliocarpoideae malvaceaebombacoideae and sterculioideae sapindaceaesapindoideae old flacourtiaceae now part of salicaceae and tree apocynaceae euphorbiaceae and urticaceae the lauraceae are notable as providing major shadetolerant species in all areas of wtrf bar that in se australia in that area too the family may well have been prominent before the extent of wtrf became much reduced in the pliocene see byrne et al 2011 as leaf fossils suggest that lauraceae were codominant in the miocene in the area immediately to the north owen 1975 lange 1982 our first objective in this paper is to review the proportion of species needing canopygaps for establishment or soon after establishment in the four major regions of wtrf the small area in se australia and the stmrf of the canary islands and to determine whether or not they can be related to differences in the extent or types of disturbance opening up the forests our second objective is to review the evidence for a seed bank in the soil in earlier studies in tlrf it seemed that persistent seed in the soil was a characteristic of gapdemanding species swaine  whitmore 1988 but later work showed that some shadetolerant species also build up a considerable soil seed bank jankowskabaszczuk  grubb 2006 is the wtrf similar in this respect our third objective is to determine whether or not mean seed mass increases significantly with mature tree height in each area of wtrf as is found in global comparisons made without respect to vegetation type see moles et al 2005 this is a necessary background to any comparison of seed mass between gapdemanding and shadetolerant species past comparisons have not allowed for any differences in mature height between the two groups our fourth objective is to find the extent of variation in seed size among both the species that need canopy gaps for establishment and those that do not early studies in tlrf emphasized the idea that gapdemanders have smaller seeds on average than shadetolerators swaine  whitmore 1988 however for japanese wtrf kohyama  grubb 1994 documented a wide range in seed dry mass among shadetolerators and the existence of tinyseeded species that benefit from being able to come to rest in minute picosites on steep microslopes free of litter for the same forest grubb 1996 noted that among gapdemanders the range was narrower because of a lack of tinyseeded species 1 mg dry mass and that the largestseeded species had seeds a little larger than those of the largestseeded shadetolerator large seed size in gapdemanders was related to attraction of relatively large animals that disperse the seeds does wtrf in other areas contain notably smallseeded shadetolerators andor notably largeseeded gapdemanders for each of the six regions we used standard floras and published floristic accounts of forest remnants to produce a long list of woody species normally reaching a height of at least 5 m that might be in the core list we then excluded i those not or doubtfully native ii those which are scandent iii those which are rare and localized in distribution iv those typically found at specialized sites lower rainfall rocky very wet riveredge coastal highaltitude or forestedges and v those confined to one edge of the range of wtrf eg the subtropical or highaltitude margin we accepted as core species those with a wide geographical range but a strong tendency to occur only on lower slopes or only on ridges likewise we accepted as core species those with a wide geographical range despite being absent from a considerable part of the total range of the wtrf in a region the full details are set out in online appendix s2 where the species that we have excluded from the core are listed in our tables angiosperm species are assigned to families recognized by stevens 2012 and conifers to families recognized by farjon 2010 the sources of our nomenclature for species are given in online appendix s2 where there has been a recent change in the accepted name the earlier name is given in parentheses in the appropriate table it is not possible to make a critical comparison of the five regions of wtrf in respect of the proportion of daylight penetrating the canopy away from gaps because no single standardized technique for measuring light has been used in all of the regions for japan kira 1975 and yoda 1978 used matched selenium photocells in one type of wtrf oakdominated and found that 0510 of daylight reached the seedling layer while kusumoto 1957 obtained a value of 12 in another oak stand further north at one new zealand wtrf site 35s dfrp burslem  pj bellingham unpublished data found that seedlings in the deepest shade experienced 16 canopy openness measured using hemispherical photos analysed using gla 20 software see frazer canham  lertzman 1999 at a second new zealand wtrf site 38 s lusk duncan  bellingham 2009 found that the commonest value for canopy openness measured using licor canopy analyzers under overcast conditions was 12 this may equate to 12 penetration of photosynthetically active radiation par but that needs to be checked for chilean wtrf the same method was used by lusk 2002 and lusk et al 2008 they found that seedlings in the deepest shade experienced approximately 2 canopy openness we have not traced any modern measurement of light penetration for wtrf in south africa but phillips 1931 pp 4445 and 72 reported 1 penetration of diffuse light using clementss stopwatch photometer method there appears to be no published work on light penetration in wtrf in australia aschan et al 1994 reported 2 of par penetrating to the forest floor of stmrf on tenerife canary islands to summarize it seems likely that in general the proportion of daylight penetrating to the most shaded sites in wtrf is 12 ie slightly greater than in tlrf but sometimes the proportion is the same as in tlrf 051 which would be consistent with the lower but overlapping values for leaf area index reported 59 versus 79 see coomes  grubb 2000 the absolute amounts of par penetrating will of course depend on degree of cloudiness slope and aspect for each region we have assigned species to three groups those in group 1 need a canopy gap for establishment those in group 2 either establish in deep shade but for survival and onward growth need a canopy gap within a relatively short period after establishment a few months to a few years or can tolerate only light shade at the time of establishment group 3 species can establish and persist in deep shade for long periods though most benefit from canopy gaps as they grow toward their full height group 1 species are placed in subgroups based on the kind of canopy gap that favours them 1a windinduced treefall 1b landslides or new volcanic deposits 1c flooddeposits 1d opening by fire and 1e fire or flood or treefall in some forests most canopy gaps arise from trees dying standing rather than being blown down swept away or consumed by fire among the different wtrf regions this phenomenon is seen most often in south africa the one tree species that uses the gaps so formed is placed in group 1a a more subtle effect occurs on very steep slopes where trees gradually bend downhill becoming nearly horizontal and let much more light reach ground level the one tree known to use such gaps is placed in group 1a the species invading the upper parts of landslides new volcanic deposits and flood deposits do not face immediate competition from established seedlings and saplings or herbs angiosperms or ferns but must be able to grow on a substratum containing no organic matter or very little nitrogen is thus likely to be a primary limiting nutrient walker  del moral 2003 pioneers on soil parent materials containing high concentrations of phosphorus are likely not to be limited by phosphate supply vitousek  farrington 1997 but on substrata poor in p or basic cations one or more of these elements may colimit with nitrogen bishop et al 2010 vitousek et al 2010 for a seedling on bared mature soil in a canopy gap the primary limiting nutrient is likely to depend on rooting density changing from phosphate to nitrate as rooting density increases see grubb 1986b
 the species invading burntforest sites may face shortage of nitrogen from the start while benefitting from an enriched supply of cations and in some cases p from the ash demeyer voundi nkana  verloo 2001 a potential difficulty arises in assessing dependence of species on disturbance events that have a long return time on the order of once per century but have major effects on the forest there is increasing evidence for tlrf in se asia that exceptional blowdowns and very severe droughts can have lasting effects as a result of gapformation ashton 2013 and it is possible that this will prove to be true for wtrf and stmrf as well a different problem arises where human intervention has been allpervasive in the forest remnants found today this is the case for most of the stmrf on the canary islands the possibility arises that the gapdemanders in the stmrf today played no part in that forest before the impact of humans an extreme view is that they existed only in the heath forest found at higher altitudes than the stmrf and on rock outcrops in the stmrf zone the idea becomes plausible by observations made in other rain forest areas where it has been possible to see primary forest opened up after being hardly impacted by humans until the 20th century grubb  stevens 1985 reported what happened in a lower montane rain forest in an isolated valley in papua new guinea little affected by humans until a saw mill was opened and the forest was clear felled of the five most abundant tree species in the secondary forest up to 20 years old in 1970 only one was also found in treefall gaps in the primary lower montane forest and it was very rare in that forest two came from upper montane rain forest and two from naturally unforested river gravels many of the dominant and occasional species were seen at the edges of lower montane forest against seminatural grassland on waterlogged soils clearly in cases like that of the stmrf in the canary islands observations on the stands least affected by humans are vitally important for the assignment of species to the core group 1 the definition of species as needing canopy gaps for establishment is not straightforward for some species seen as adults only at edges and in treefall gaps within the forest it is found by critical observation that they not infrequently become established under canopy shade but die if a gap is not formed within a relatively short time examples in chilean wtrf are embothrium coccineum and lomatia hirsuta figueroa  lusk 2001 for plants of tlrf in australia and se asia grubb  metcalfe 1996 and jankowskabaszczuk  grubb 2006 identified a small group of species unable to establish in the full shade of the understorey diffuse site factor 0420 but able to establish in microgaps ie where a limb has fallen rather than a whole crown or at a site a little distance from a crownfall diffuse site factor 24 to be compared with 4 in singletreefall gaps we have not been able to identify a corresponding group of species in wtrf this means that there is a clear disjunction between species in groups 1 and 2 in wtrf but not in tlrf for species not demanding canopy gaps for establishment classification into more and less shadetolerant groups is made difficult by changes in relative shade tolerance that occur as plants become older and taller the potential importance of this issue has been emphasized for tlrf by clark  clark 1992 hawthorne 1993 grubb 1996 and poorter et al 2005 and for wtrf by lusk et al 2008 2011 the issue was not considered by those who formulated tolerance indices for tree species in northern temperate deciduous forests eg baker 1945 and ellenberg 1963 for wtrf some clear examples of the problem are known at a site in chile figueroa  lusk 2001 reported the mean percentage canopy openness under which the juveniles up to 1 m tall of 26 species were found they showed that both laureliopsis philippiana and aextoxicon punctatum were among the most shadetolerant however veblen ashton  schlegel 1979 found that at a later stage in the life cycle the laureliopsis needed a canopy gap for onward growth while the aextoxicon did not when we describe species as strongly shade tolerant and assign them to group 3b we indicate either an ability to mature in deep shade relevant to tall shrubs and small trees or an ability to grow to full height without the formation of a canopy gap above relevant to mediumheight and tall trees assignments of species to gapresponse groups are based on the relevant literature indicated in each of the tables on the advice of ecologists who have long experience of the forests in question acknowledged in the headings to the tables and on personal observations tsk has 26 years of experience of working in wtrf in japan pjb 21 years in wtrf in new zealand and fip 6 years in wtrf in chile pjg has worked briefly in all six study areas pjb in all areas bar se australia and av on madeira in addition to the canary islands many group 1a species in tlrfs are known to have seed banks in the soil that persist for at least a few years dalling swaine  garwood 1994 jankowskabaszczuk  grubb 2006 dalling  brown 2009 and we sought to determine how far this is true of such species in wtrf beveridge 1967 who worked with podocarpaceae in new zealand made the only study which attempted to separate species persisting for different lengths of time in the soil in a way that meets the criteria of thompson bakker  bekker 1997 the basis of our analysis of such evidence as is available is given in online appendix s3 a commentary on all the sources from which we obtained values for seed mass is given in online appendix s4 and the sources are listed in tables 2 3 4 5 6 7 we present new values for dry seed mass for species in japan new zealand chile and the canary islands with the exception of one data set see online appendix s4 we defined a seed as a single mature fertilized ovule including the testa plus the fibrous inner part of the fruit wall when present any aril sarcotesta or fleshy part of the fruit wall and any wing was removed sampling was haphazard and often limited to a single fruiting individual no conscious bias was employed in the terms of the size of the seed or fruit collected except that an effort was made to cover the full range of size in apparently healthy fruitsseeds a minimum of 10 seeds was collected for each species with larger numbers for species with very small seeds for species on the canary islands a more rigorous pattern of sampling was adopted no more than five seeds were collected from any one tree and at least 80 seeds were collected per species all seeds were cleaned and dried for 48 h at 80c dry mass values were determined for single seeds or known numbers of seeds on an electronic balance to a precision of 01 mg the values quoted have been rounded off to two significant figures the only critical information we have found concerning variation in seed mass in a single collection for wtrf species is that recorded by glenny 1986 who used c 100300 seeds per species for 10 new zealand trees and tall shrubs the coefficient of variation ranged from 12 for sophora microphylla to 43 for prumnopitys ferruginea the distribution was positively skewed for six species negatively skewed for two species and without skew for two species we first determine whether there is any significant relationship between mean seed mass and mature height of a species within each of the six forest regions considered several of our sources for normal mature height use mostly or exclusively 5 m intervals at least for species over 10 m tall only for new zealand has there been a critical study of mature heights for all the core species of wtrf differentiating them at intervals of 1 m for japan and chile we have similarly precise values for some species for the plot of log mean seed dry mass against log normal maximum height if more than one value is available for one or both variables we use arithmetic mean values for seed mass and the highest values reported for tree height except where those are given in parentheses as in tables 2 3 4 5 and 6 indicating that they are reached only exceptionally we compare species in groups 1 and 3 in respect of seed size firstly without reference to phylogeny or mature plant height and then analyze the seven cases in which intrafamilial intergeneric comparisons can be made between groups 1 and 3 and the single case in which an intrageneric comparison is possible when there is more than one recorded mean seed mass for a species we use the arithmetic mean but when we have two or more species in a shadetolerance group in the comparison we use the logarithmic mean where there are sufficient group 1 species in the forest to make the exercise worthwhile we go on to compare species in groups 1 and 3 at the same height in order to find whether any consistent pattern emerges finally we compare species in groups 2 and 3 typhoons which occur every year create canopy gaps by treefall at a relatively high rate saito 2002 but several authors have noted that most gaps are relatively small and inadequate for the most lightdemanding species naka 1982 naka  yoneda 1984 miura et al 2001 japan lies in a seismically active zone and landslides are also relatively common though not as frequent as treefall gaps tanouchi  yamamoto 1995 masaki et al 1999 fresh lava flows from active volcanoes are only of local importance and the plants favoured by them overlap with those favoured by landslips see tagawa 1964 thirtytwo group 1a species ie species establishing only in treefall gaps and at forest edges against streams rivers andor bluffs or mostly there and only occasionally on landslides or lava flows have been recorded in 35 ecological studies spread from yakushima at c 30n to near mt fuji at c 35n table 2 and these make up 33 of the total list of core species almost all are deciduous table 2 in hilly and mountainous country the deciduous species are most abundant along the gullies where there is more frequent disturbance the forest along narrow ridges lets in more light than that on slopes and favours more lightdemanding species but is not subject to especially frequent disturbance one evergreen species symplocos prunifolia is gapdemanding for establishment in the northern part of the wtrf but shadetolerant in the southern on yakushima kohyama 1986 we count it in the not gapdemanding category in the summary in table 8 we recognize only four group 1b species those that are earliest to invade landslides and lava flows table 2 one is an evergreen conifer and three are deciduous dicots pinus thunbergii is probably the species that benefits most by landslides alnus firma and salix sieboldiana also establish on periodically flooded soils at scoured sites on floodplains these days lindera citriodora is most often seen as an invader along roadsides the key feature of the microsites on which these four species become established is the inorganic nature of the substratum  the absence or nearabsence of organic matter by contrast group 1a species generally invade soil containing some organic matter even though they are commonest on tipups see grubb 1992 a few group 1a species are relatively early invaders of landslides and lava flows in addition to establishing in treefall gaps mallotus japonicus prunus jamasakura styrax japonicus but they do not invade as abundantly as pinus thunbergii and alnus firma shimokawa 1984 of the 25 group 2 species ie those routinely establishing in canopy shade but with a limited ability to persist and 
continue growing unless in light shade 10 are oaks we review in online appendix s5 the evidence for a gradient in lightdemand among them one laurel species is assigned to group 2 persea thunbergii which is very common it was shown by sato tanouchi  takeshita 1994 that seedlings of this species become established in large numbers on the forest floor but rather few grow into saplings and they need a gap above them for onward growth earlier tagawa 1979 had shown that the seedlings of persea thunbergii have a higher mortality rate than those of castanopsis cuspidata especially in their first year the key difference seemed not to concern shade but to be their greater sensitivity to latesummer drought eleven species are assigned to group 2 largely on the basis of their being more abundant in secondary forest than in primary forest in the same area kohyama  aiba 1997 aiba hill  angetsuma 2001 and three on the basis of other studies of forest dynamics listed in table 2 the only longterm study of changes in composition of wtrf after severe disturbance is that of yamada et al 2012 this emphasizes the rise of the fagaceae after clearfelling their subsequent decline and their failure to increase markedly as a result of typhoon damage the study reveals little about group 1 species or nonfagaceae group 2 species as they are too sparse more details are provided in online appendix s5 many of the 36 group 3 species ie those variously more shadetolerant have not been studied critically in terms of their relative light demands in table 2 we have separated those species for which reverse j distributions of plant size have been documented mostly by kohyama 1986 but in one case by tanouchi  yamamoto 1995 the strongly shadetolerant tinyseeded species eurya japonica and rhododendron tashiroi are effective pioneers in full daylight on rocky roadside cuttings where there is very little soil they cannot compete with the herbaceous and shrubby species that dominate stretches of roadside where the soils are deep on yakushima one of us tsk made two comparisons of the densities of saplings 50 cm tall 2 cm dbh i between treefall gaps and closed stands in forest and ii between a rocky roadside and closed stands fig 2 in the first case there was no correlation between density quotient and seed mass for 14 species fig 2a but in the second case tinyseeded species were overwhelmingly important four largerseeded species were absent and five had only one to two saplings on 90 m2 of roadside fig 2b as expected tinyseededness facilitates invasion the failure of the fastergrowing competitors on the most infertile soil and consequent invasion by eurya japonica and rhododendron tashiroi enabled us to see that strong shadetolerance does not necessarily imply shaderequirement before the road was built this important point would not have been apparent the extent to which species have been recorded in the seed bank is summarized in table 2 with additional detail given in online appendix s3 nine of the 32 group 1a species have been recorded and it is thought that some are shortterm persistent lasting at least 24 years in the soil no group 1b species or group 2 species has been reported in the soil seed bank in more than trace quantities but 14 of the 36 group 3 species one of these symplocos prunifolia behaves as a gapdemander in the northern part of the wtrf where the seedbank study was made another eurya japonica was described by naka  yoda 1984 as intermediate between pioneer and late successional species manabe  yamamoto 1997 showed that it recruits strongly in canopy gaps but also establishes commonly in deep shade we suspect that most of the other group 3 species are present in the seed bank only transiently except for rhododendron tashiroi which has a recruitment pattern like that of eurya japonica see tagawa et al 1984 cyclones that originate in the tropical southwest pacific ocean affect the warm temperate regions of new zealand more frequently than the rest of the country shaw 1983 severe cyclones reach new zealand about every 10 years martin  ogden 2006 and can cause treefall gaps to occur in oldgrowth forests sometimes over extensive areas conway 1959 ogden  stewart 1995 the trajectory of extratropical cyclones is affected by the phase of the el nio southern oscillation enso those formed in la nia years are more likely to track over or close to new zealand but the strongest cyclones tend to affect new zealand when the enso cycle is between el nio and la nia sinclair 2002 extratropical cyclones and other major storms cause local wind and highintensity rainfall events that result in floods landslides and treefalls although most of new zealand is seismically active the warm temperate zone is generally the least affected by earthquakes anderson  webb 1994 however some areas are directly affected by smallscale volcanism eg on and near the auckland isthmus on which primary successions occur clarkson 1990 smale  gardner 1999 secondary successions after human clearance are widespread throughout much of the region wardle 1991 in new zealand there has been a very short history of human occupation only since c 1280 ad wilmshurst et al 2008 natural lightninginduced fires were very rare throughout the holocene and virtually nonexistent in the wtrf ogden basher  mcglone 1998 fires caused by volcanic eruptions wilmshurst  mcglone 1996 were also very infrequent and local humaninduced fire kills almost all the rain forest trees there are 10 group 1a species ie species that establish only in treefall gaps and at forest margins or mostly there and occasionally on landslides table 3 three of these species are fully deciduous aristotelia serrata fuchsia excorticata and plagianthus regius a characteristic more typical in new zealand of tree species that grow at forest margins and on nutrientrich soils than of species subject to greater winter cold mcglone et al 2004 although fire was a negligible form of disturbance in the wtrf before human intervention two group 1a species kunzea ericoides and leptospermum scoparium both myrtaceae are notable for being commonly dominant initially in postfire successions today the leptospermum has capsules with a degree of serotiny ie retention of seed until heated in a fire a fuller account of these species is given in online appendix s5 of the two group 1b species pioneers on volcanic deposits metrosideros robusta is rarely a terrestrial tree but it colonises bare lava clarkson 1990 otherwise it establishes in the crowns of mature rain forest trees in oldgrowth forests as a strangler wardle 1991 coriaria arborea which is nitrogenfixing colonises not only recent volcanic tephra and scoria but also landslides clarkson 1990 and denuded floodplains bellingham peltzer  walker 2005 the 28 group 2 species include eight conifers some of which grow to very large size and can be very longlived notably agathis australis ogden  stewart 1995 some conifer species are highly dependent on disturbance for regeneration with disturbances ranging from the very large scale eg after catastrophic eruption wilmshurst  mcglone 1996 to individual treefall gaps cameron 1955 ogden  stewart 1995 regeneration of most of these conifers takes place through an overstorey of shortlived angiosperm trees typically species in groups 1 and 2 esler  astridge 1974 pook 1978 and also weinmannia silvicola group 3 burns  smale 1990 the tall conifer dacrycarpus dacrydioides can also establish directly on denuded floodplains smale 1984 duncan 1991 in contrast to the tall longlived conifers most of the angiosperm trees in group 2 are shortstature fastgrowing shortlived species exceptions are considered in online appendix s5 the separation of the 37 group 3 species into groups 3a and 3b is not sharp our assignment of some species eg coprosma grandifolia and prumnopitys ferruginea should be seen as tentative typically species in group 3a show discontinuous regeneration exemplified by most of the podocarps wardle 1963 coomes  bellingham 2011 while species in group 3b have a continuous reversej distribution of tree sizes exemplified by beilschmiedia tawa west 1995 the smallestseeded of the group 3 species especially weinmannia silvicola 01 mg schefflera digitata 0506 mg and raukaua edgerleyi 25 mg establish preferentially on fallen logs and the trunks of tree ferns pope 1924 bellingham  richardson 2006 gaxiola burrows  coomes 2008 the same is seen for the smallestseeded group 2 species especially quintinia serrata 003 mg the studies of the soil seed bank are the best that have been made for any wtrf see online appendix s3 of the 10 group 1a species seven have been recorded as having an appreciable occurrence in the soil seed bank four in the shortterm persistent category table 3 one of the two group 1b species coriaria arborea can have a transient seed bank only 6 of the 28 group 2 species and 8 of the 37 group 3 species have been reported to have an appreciable soil seed bank table 3 there is evidence of a shortterm persistent seed bank for only three group 2 species brachyglottis repanda melicope ternata and prumnopitys taxifolia and only four group 3 species coprosma arborea macropiper excelsum melicytus ramiflorus and prumnopitys ferruginea a few group 2 species have been recorded as pioneers in full daylight on landslides for example smale mcleod  smale 1997 recorded leucopogon fasciculatus olearia rani pittosporum tenuifolium and pseudopanax crassifolius on tertiary mudstones in the warm temperate zone of new zealand they were accompanied by two group 3 species melicytus ramiflorus and myrsine australis in cool temperate southern new zealand mark et al 1964 and mark dickinson  fife 1989 found that young 15 years old landslide surfaces of exposed gneiss were colonized by a group 2 species griselinia littoralis and a group 3 species podocarpus cunninghamii formerly p hallii accompanied by weinmannia racemosa which is closely related to the group 3 species w silvicola thus as in japan shadetolerance does not necessarily imply shadedemand the wtrf of chile is not subject to damage by cyclones but severe storms do occur natural treefall gaps vary greatly in size veblen 1985 worked at three sites and found the range to be c 801060 m2 with median values for different gapmaking species of 80200500 m2 vallejos 2004 found gaps to vary from c 4050 to c 400700 m2 depending on the species of gapmaker in forests where some canopy gaps are natural and others are caused by selective felling c 2030 years earlier the size ranged from c 2030 to c 240540 m2 in one study gonzlez et al 2002 and from 274 to 970 m2 in another muoz  gonzlez 2009 veblen 1985 recorded the mean incidence across species of different causes of gap formation uprooting 3364 depending on site windsnap 3350 and branch breakage 017 for the one gapmaker encountered 10 times at each of two sites eucryphia cordifolia uprooting ranged from 27 to 58 windsnap from 33 to 55 and branch breakage from 8 to 18 in contrast to the situation in japan or new zealand there are bamboos chusquea spp that are very widespread grow to 5 m tall invade most gaps and severely suppress the growth of other species veblen schlegel  oltremari 1983 c quila is the major species at lower altitudes and c culeou at higher altitudes largerscale disturbances caused by landslides probably occur more often in chile than in japan or new zealand certainly it was suggested by veblen et al 1996 that the incidence of landslides is greater in inland southern chile than in any other part of the world except perhaps new guinea there are significant differences between the area of wtrf along the coastal cordillera and that on the andes the former experiences less frequent disturbances by landslides but is still subject to wind disturbances that cause large canopy gaps veblen et al 1981 disturbances also occur in chilean wtrf as a result of heavy ash showers from the nearby volcanoes jara  moreno 2012 these have a greater effect on and near the andes than on the coastal cordillera most recently the caulle volcano has spread ash over a very large area on 15 june 2011 it was estimated by remote sensing that the area affected within 30 km of the crater was c 2600 km2 comisin nacional de medio ambiente chile but significant falls of ash occurred much further away in both chile and argentina the area affected has declined since june 2011 the wtrf was probably affected less often by catastrophic floods it was possibly affected by lightninginduced fires veblen et al 1983 fresh lava flows are frequent on the flanks of volcanoes above the altitudinal limit of wtrf they are uncommon lower down but are found eg on volcn llaima segura uauy 1999 we recognize no group 1a species and only one group 1b species nothofagus obliqua table 4 this species is different in nature from any group 1b species seen in japan or new zealand it can establish in the shade of bamboo and even grow to about 1 m tall but such plants all die and therefore the species effectively needs areas of bare ground for its early life if it is to persist in the landscape veblen et al 1983 1996 the only possible chance otherwise is to establish in a canopy gap in one of the rare years when the bamboo dies all across the landscape however observations made in the early 1990s after such a mass death of bamboo showed that the seedlings of bamboo grew faster than those of the nothofagus obliqua which again succumbed to shading gonzlez et al 2002 it is probable that before the arrival of humans effective invasion by nothofagus obliqua occurred most often on landslides where it may form almost pure stands initially veblen  ashton 1978 veblen et al 1983 this is true even for the coastal regions armesto mitchell  villagrn 1986 where the largest earthquakes can have huge impacts in the last 60 years two had a moment magnitude scale m
w  8 chapron et al 2006 moreno rosenau  oncken 2010 nothofagus obliqua probably also invaded land covered in deep ash and alluvial deposits from catastrophic floods veblen et al 1983 and veblen 1989 tentatively explained the present abundance and widespread distribution of the species in wtrf as the result of past forest clearance by aborigines using fire five species which are widespread in forest gaps and at forest edges must be placed in group 2 because critical observations show that although they require light shade or formation of a new canopy gap for persistence they do become established in shade three species aristotelia chilensis embothrium coccineum and lomatia hirsuta occur in both lower and higheraltitude forests sophora cassioides at lower altitudes and nothofagus dombeyi at higher altitudes observations on their shade tolerance were published by figueroa  lusk 2001 lusk 2002 belov lavruchin  martin 20052009 and lusk et al 2011 figueroa  lusk 2001 reported that aristotelia chilensis and lomatia hirsuata germinated freely under canopy shade 68 and 57 respectively in the understorey versus 93 and 83 in a canopy gap of c 80 m2 while embothrium coccineum was more inhibited 11 versus 93 there is one noncore group 2 species with a very different kind of life history gomortega keule it has very large seeds and sprouts freely forming multistemmed individuals believed to be very longlived muozconcha  davey 2011 see online appendix s5 the 22 species assigned to group 3 vary greatly in the amount of light needed for onward growth donoso 1989 2006 lusk et al 2008 however even the least shadetolerant can establish and persist for a significant time in the understorey many shoots of anomyrtus luma caldcluvia paniculata eucryphia cordifolia laureliopsis philippiana and lomatia dentata seen on the forest floor are from rootsuckers but careful inspection shows that there are also many seedlings gonzlez et al 2002 lusk  piper 2007 lusk et al 2008 we have separated five species into group 3b the evidence for this is given in online appendix s5 the four smallestseeded species in group 3 caldcluvia paniculata weinmannia trichosperma eucryphia cordifolia and laureliopsis philippiana 00620 mg all become established preferentially on fallen trunks veblen et al 1981 lusk 1995 christie  armesto 2003 lusk  kelly 2003 raukaua laetivirens 35 mg also establishes on logs but more often grows as a hemiepiphyte on large living trees veblen et al 1981 four of the five species in group 2 not sophora cassioides and 422 species in group 3 were recorded by veblen  ashton 1978 as invading recent landslides exposed bedrock or pumiceous lapilli at altitudes 500 m table 4 those found most widely were eucryphia cordifolia 55 sites sometimes with a higher frequency at a given site than the group 1 species nothofagus obliqua and lomatia hirsuta 35 of the eight invasive species seven have winddispersed seeds aristotelia chilensis being birddispersed armesto  rozzi 1989 is the only exception the largestseeded of the seven species are close to nothofagus obliqua in seed dry mass table 4 veblen  ashton 1978 emphasized that high dispersibility is not enough to make invasion of young landslides possible and some species with very small seeds dasyphyllum diacanthoides laurelia sempervirens laureliopsis philippiana and saxegothaea conspicua establish only rarely presumably because of intolerance of the wholly open conditions andor the nutrientpoor substratum vera et al 2008 found a very high mortality in new germinants of laureliopsis philippiana when they were grown in open conditions by contrast survival was almost 100 under light shade in the same experiment seedlings of the same age of aextoxicon punctatum had a very high survival rate under both light regimes at least two of the group 2 species embothrium coccineum and lomatia hirsuta and one group 3a species lomatia ferruginea can invade young lava flows found at higher altitudes than wtrf eg seen at c 8001000 m on volcan osorno pj grubb personal observations november 2006 veblen et al 1977 earlier recorded the embothrium invading higheraltitude flows segura uauy 1999 recorded lomatia ferruginea on young lava flows within the altitudinal zone of wtrf where such flows are uncommon thus the assertion of alberdi et al 2009 that l ferruginea does not invade volcanic deposits is untrue there has been little research on the possibility of a soil seed bank in chilean wtrf this issue is considered in online appendix s3 violent winds are rare in the wtrf and there is a contrast with the more northerly subtropical forests in eastern south africa where cyclones play a role midgley et al 1997 mucina et al 2006 geldenhuys  maliepaard 1983 found that most gaps in the canopy are small and most trees die standing as a result of old age disease or stress  70 in an extensive study by midgley cameron  bond 1995 the latter authors found that in their plots the trees had almost never established on a fallen trunk or on a tipup mound or in a pit caused by tree uprooting there is also a virtual lack of seismic activity and landslides and an absolute lack of any volcano producing fresh lava flows fire plays a dominant role in restricting the distribution of the wtrf and in the dynamics of the surrounding communities fynbos heathland and grassland and of the forest edges but it plays a very limited role in the dynamics of the forest geldenhuys 1994 midgley et al 1997 again there is a contrast with other forest types to the northeast everard 1985 lightning sometimes kills small groups of trees but seems not to start a forest fire and the commonly accepted view is that the forest is virtually unburnable mucina et al 2006 however exceptional fires fanned by bergwinds do burn into forests as happened in 1996 and 1998 and the legume virgilia divaricata can then form dense stands recruited from the soil seed bank c 160250 seeds m2 much of it at depth and responding only to very high soilsurface temperatures the other wtrf species reestablish in these stands cj geldenhuys personal communication the virgilia is common at the forestfynbos margin but it seems likely that where the soil seed bank inside the forest is dense it results from a previous incursion of fire and subsequent dense stands of the virgilia perhaps 200 years earlier geldenhuys 1994 elephants spend time in the forest but there is no evidence that they initiate episodes of regeneration by felling or killing trees the nearby fynbos heathland may well be their major source of food our assignment of species to groups follows midgley et al 1990 1995 1997 and professor jj midgley personal communication the single species recorded as needing treefall gaps for establishment group 1a in table 5 zanthoxylum davyi is sparse in the forest not even recorded in the extensive study of midgley et al 1995 on gapmaking and gapfilling there are eight species in group 2 and nine in group 3a within both groups there are probably significant differences in the extent to which they need canopy gaps to reach full size in group 3b we have placed the four species considered by professor j j midgley to be the most shadetolerant there is generally a negligible soil seed bank apart from the virgilia divaricata mentioned above midgley et al 1997 cj geldenhuys personal communication the significant forms of disturbance were reviewed critically by melick  ashton 1991 violent winds are not a major cause of forest gaps in contrast to the situation further north on the east coast of australia see adam 1992 the gaps formed by death or fall of one or more trees are 530 m across although there is little seismic activity landslides are a significant means of disturbance on steep rocky slopes there is no extant volcano in the area producing fresh lava flows periodic floods affect the forest patches along valley floors killing sensitive species through soil anoxia ripping out trees and creating new sediments the greatest differences from the situation in south africa are that i the forest patches are smaller and ii periodically they are penetrated deeply by fire from the surrounding sclerophyll forest or humaninduced vegetation our assignment of species to groups 1ce in relation to disturbance regime table 6 is based wholly on the account of melick  ashton 1991 there is no species assigned to group 1a ie establishing only in or almost only in gaps made by tree death or tree fall within the forest endogenous gaps in the terminology of melick  ashton 1991 the single group 1c species tristaniopsis laurina generally dominates valley floor sites and in the runs of years between significant floods the shadetolerant floodingintolerant species establish beneath it and may grow to large size the tristaniopsis which is confined to valley floors by its droughtintolerance establishes only in gaps but after a disturbance it may respond by producing sprouts as well as giving rise to new seedlings it commonly leans over in the direction of water flow and in extreme cases will layer produce new roots on shoots where it touches the ground group 1d contains eleven species of sclerophyll vegetation particularly wet sclerophyll forest that invade after fire has opened the rain forest pomaderris aspera is the most consistent invader see online appendix s5 group 1e contains three species all invaders typical of the matrix of sclerophyll vegetation in which the patches of wtrf are found they all need a gap created by fire or flood or an endogenous gap none of the six group 3 species is regarded as especially shadetolerant like the species in group 3b in new zealand chile and south africa at least two of the species are able to establish in full daylight acmena smithii and pittosporum undulatum which sometimes colonize talus slopes the resistance and resilience of group 3 species in the face of periodic fire is summarized in online appendix s5 only the most skeletal information is available concerning the soil seed bank of species in australian wtrf the group 3 species seem to have little or none while the available evidence mainly from other forest types suggests that species of acacia and pomaderris aspera have persistent seed banks in the soil those of eucalyptus have shorterlived seed banks in the canopy and species of olearia and tristaniopsis laurina have no persistent seed bank see online appendix s3 the general perspective of melick  ashton 1991 is that in the absence of an increase in frequency and intensity of fires resulting from human activity the wtrf and sclerophyll forest can persist in a longterm alternation and balance rather like the better known system in tasmania where cool temperate rain forest dominated by nothofagus cunninghamii alternates with wet sclerophyll forest dominated by eucalytus regnans see howard 1981 in most years violent winds are not a major cause of forest gaps but occasionally they have a big impact especially in rugged areas with narrow ridges in 2004 storm delta flattened c 150 ha of forest on the enchereda massif of la gomera ab fernndezlpez personal communication another infrequent cause of gaps perhaps experienced on the order of once every hundred years could be killing of trees by exceptionally severe drought unlike most areas of wtrf the stmrf of the canary islands regularly suffers a 5month dry season table 1 and some extreme droughts are likely to occur at the present time some areas of forest on la gomera are suffering dieback from an unknown cause or causes with a concomitant increase in gapdemanders ab fernndezlpez personal communication how far such dieback occurred before invasion by humans is hard to assess landslides are rare and generally confined to the steepest slopes and despite the volcanic origin of the islands there has not been any new lava flow in the montane rain forest zone for at least a million years fernndezpalacios  arvalo 1998 it is virtually certain that before the arrival of humans about 20002500 years ago fire was a part of the natural disturbance regime in the vegetation types found above the montane rain forest belt where it is much drier but there is no evidence that it was significant in the rain forest fire was definitely important in the forest of pinus canariensis which is one of those pines that regenerate from epicormic buds after being burnt keeley  zedler 1998 climent et al 2004 following the exceptionally dry period from autumn 2011 to summer 2012 fires in early august 2012 almost certainly started by humans spread into the stmrf destroying 2025 of the garonajay national park on la gomera where the best areas of forest remain thus the forest can burn in exceptional years and might conceivably have done so before human intervention as a result of fires spreading from the drier pine forest above it or the drier broadleaved forest below it now largely cleared  see online appendix s2 but there is no definite evidence that it did so in two areas of forest on tenerife arvalo  fernndezpalacios 1998 found the canopy gaps to be mostly small the mean for gaps 10 m2 in area was found to be c 40 m2 on la gomera the trees are bigger and create larger gaps many in the range 40160 m2 ab fernndezlpez personal communication on tenerife arvalo  fernndezpalacios 1998 found that many gaps are filled by sprouts rather than by trees newly established from seed arvalo  fernndezpalacios 2007 found that in the rare large gaps 100 m2 in their study area there was a trend toward a negative effect of increased irradiance on juveniles of shadetolerant species and no increase in the establishment of shadeintolerant species so great has the human impact on the canary islands been see online appendix s2 that we have to consider the possibility that the gapdemanding plants in the forest today erica arborea e scoparia and morella faya table 7 played no part originally in the stmrf see section ii3 there is no doubt that in the seminatural remnants of stmrf on the canary islands today they need welllit microsites to become established fernndezpalacios  arvalo 1998 arvalo  fernndezpalacios 1998 in addition at a site on la palma where coppicing is practised and plots up to 60 years old were studied it was found that establishment of new seedlings of erica arborea and morella faya ceased within 3 years as shade intensified bermdez et al 2007 viable seeds of all three species can be found in appreciable quantity in the soil and that is not true of any of the other tree species but new work is needed to determine whether they form even a shortterm persistent seed bank see online appendix s3 there is no doubt that the abundance of all three species has increased greatly as a result of human utilization of the forest also all three species have declined markedly where forests have been protected from human exploitation over the last four decades ab fernndezlpez personal communication it is tempting to take the view that the three species have invaded the stmrf as a result of human impact but we reject this extreme view and we place all three species in group 1a on the basis of their behaviour in the forest that has been least disturbed by humans that on la gomera 
erica scoparia occurs there on very steep slopes where the trees gradually bend over to form a horizontal forest that lets much more light penetrate to ground level erica scoparia then establishes on the mosscovered soil ab fernndezlpez personal communication morella faya produces sucker shoots freely leading to successive generations of trunks that enable individuals to last for many years  long enough by hypothesis for the species to invade new gaps made by rare disturbance events such as large blowdowns and exceptional droughts erica arborea is the species least understood a study in northernmost morocco found that healthy mature plants can be found under considerable shade not deep shade from the sclerophyll quercus suber on drier sites and the semideciduous q canariensis on moister deepersoil sites ojeda arroyo  maran 2000 by contrast in a study of forest woodland and open woodland sites in extreme southwestern mainland spain dominated by these two oak species seedlings of erica arborea were found only in open woodland with a mean global site factor proportion of full daylight of 27 at 05 m above the soil and then only rather few prezramos  maran 2012 the latter authors concluded that erica arborea behaves as a pioneer sensu swaine  whitmore 1988 being recruited from the soil seed bank where a canopy gap is formed by a tree falling or by fire we suggest that in view of the species surviving appreciable shade as an older plant it should be regarded as a latetolerant sensu oldeman 1990 we hypothesize that i in the stmrf of the canary islands the requirements are essentially similar to those found in the western part of the mediterranean basin except that fire was not involved in the natural forest and ii the canopy gaps necessary for longterm persistence in the landscape have arisen in the past from the causes suggested for morella faya there appears to be only one group 2 core species ilex canariensis is described as intermediate in tolerance between shadeintolerants and shadetolerants by arvalo fernndezpalacios  palmer 1999 who showed that it survives largely as a result of basal sprouting projection models of real stands reveal that without this asexual reproduction it becomes extinct in this respect it is like the lithocarpus spp in japanese wtrf there are three noncore species that are probably best placed in group 2 see online appendix s5 there are 10 group 3 species all of them encountered as shaded seedlings in the critical studies of arvalo  fernndezpalacios 1998 and fernndezpalacios  arvalo 1998 the prunus encroaches strongly on canopy gaps by lateral spread of the crown pj bellingham and pj grubb unpublished observations and was found by fernndezpalacios  arvalo 1998 to produce many more effective sprouts than seedlings six other group 3 species have basal sprouting suckers all four laurels apollonias barbujana laurus azorica ocotea foetens persea indica ilex perado ssp platyphylla and less often viburnum rigidum fernndezpalacios  arvalo 1998 arvalo et al 1999 fernndezpalacios et al 2004 ocotea foetens is the rarest of the laurels bramwell  bramwell 1974 grows tallest and is centred on gulley sites where it can create deep shade and is often dominant on tenerife the stands are typically rich in ferns of which 15 species were recorded by rivasmartnez et al 1993 a single stand on la palma described by lohmeyer  trautman 1970 was different in kind having abundant hedera canariensis on the ground and only scattered individuals of the few other species in the experience of ab fernndezlpez personal communication four species are particularly shadetolerant table 7 the one study of the dynamics of wtrf on the azores elias  das 2009 revealed two species needing canopy gaps for establishment erica azorica shorterlived and juniperus brevifolia longlived the group 3 species include frangula azorica and laurus azorica which establish in shade but need canopy gaps to grow tall and ilex azorica able to regenerate wholly in the understorey in a glasshouse experiment lasting 2 years many seedlings of erica azorica grew from soil samples but no juniperus brevifolia the numbers of species in groups 1 2 and 3 in each of the six regions are shown in table 8 the extent of statistically significant differences in the incidence of group 1 species was determined using fishers exact test table 9 following moran 2003 we did not make bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons the australian and japanese forests do not differ significantly from each other but both have a significantly greater incidence of group 1 species than the forests in new zealand south africa and chile the forest on the canary islands does not differ significantly in incidence of group 1 species from any of the other forests as to the incidence of group 2 species among the group 2 plus group 3 species none of the forests is significantly different from any of the others as shown in fig 3

number of species in a functional group is appreciable there is a strikingly wide range of values the broadest ranges were found for the group 3 species they covered between four and five orders of magnitude in chile and four in new zealand these ranges parallel that of four orders published earlier for shadetolerators in japan kohyama  grubb 1994 the range for shadetolerant core species in australia of which there are only six is much smaller between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude however if two noncore species are admitted the range increases to about four orders of magnitude these species are eucryphia moorei cunoniaceae mean dry seed mass 019 mg and livistona australis arecaceae 2000 mg seed mass values are taken from floyd 2008 the various regions differ in whether or not the smallestseeded group 1 core species has seeds smaller than the smallestseeded group 3 core species it is the case in the wtrf of new zealand table 3 and australia table 6 and in the stmrf of the canary islands table 7 but it is not the case in japan even though there are many group 1 species table 2 or south africa two group 1 species table 5 or chile one group 1 species table 4 if the noncore species eucryphia moorei is admitted see preceding paragraph then in australia also the seed of the smallestseeded gapdemander is larger than that of the smallestseeded shadetolerator in japan as shown in table 2 the largestseeded group 1 species aleurites cordata with mean value 730 mg and sapindus mukorossi 890 mg have larger seeds than all but two of the group 3 species camellia japonica 6801100 mg and nageia nagi 340880 mg there is no group 1 species with such relatively large seeds in any of the other five forest regions studied on the other hand one of the group 1 species in se australian wtrf has a much bigger seed than the majority of gapdemanders in tropical lowland rain forests elaeocarpus reticulatus 210 mg in wtrf outside japan the only group 2 core species with a mean seed mass 300 mg is seen in new zealand vitex lucens 680 mg and the next largest is ekebergia capensis in south africa 220 mg however in chile the noncore group 2 species gomortega keule has a seed including endocarp of mean dry mass c 4000 mg muozconcha  davey 2011 disturbance regimes in general cannot be summarized wholly satisfactorily in single values because they are multidimensional involving variation in frequency intensity timing and extent white 1979 grubb  hopkins 1986 loehle 2000 in the specific case of wtrf and stmrf no single measure of disturbance is wholly satisfactory because gapdemanding species exploit qualitatively different kinds of gap treefall gaps caused by wind landslides lava flows ash falls gaps made by fires or floods etc nevertheless if the relevant data were available it might still be useful to have a single index based on the sum of the proportions of the forest changing into gap per say century as a result of all the various causes in this way the forests of concern would be separated into those highly disturbed japan new zealand chile and australia and those experiencing little disturbance south africa and canary islands there next arises the question of the extent to which different kinds of disturbance have led to the local evolution of or invasion from elsewhere by specialist species a striking feature of table 8 is how few specialists there are on landslides or lava flows or deposits of scoria or flooded areas in many areas this situation may be explained at least partly by the shorter returntime of winddriven treefall gaps compared with landslides etc but this is doubtfully the case for the slopes of the andes in chile which are extremely active tectonically landslides account for much larger areas than lava flows etc but still a notable proportion of the gapdemanding species pioneering on them also occur in canopy gaps caused by windthrow viz 37 in japan and 34 in new zealand tables 2 and 3 moreover in chile all eight of the major pioneer trees on landslides also become established in forest although the one group 1 species does need landslides for persistence in the natural landscape table 4 from the point of view of understanding the proportion of gapdemanding species in wtrf in different regions a reasonable approximate index of the extent of disturbance in wtrf would generally be the proportion of forest going into the gap phase per unit time as a result of windthrow provided it was based on studies covering a large enough area and a long enough period unfortunately for most regions we do not have the data needed to create such an index with such an index one could reasonably plot incidence of gapdemanding species against incidence of canopy gapformation two areas stand out as needing different treatment for the wtrf in australia the proportion going into the gap phase as a result of fire should be added to that caused by wind and for that part of the wtrf in chile on the slopes of the andes the proportion subject to landslides should be added we leave aside initially the region with the highest incidence of group 1 species australia 71 conscious that this high incidence might reflect to a significant degree the fact that the rain forest occurs in small fragments within an extensive matrix of sclerophyll vegetation which provides most of the group 1 species instead we consider first the contrast in tables 8 and 9 between the region with the next highest incidence of group 1 species japan 37 and the two regions with the lowest incidence south africa 9 and chile 4 the lower incidence of group 1 species in south african wtrf than in japanese is consistent with the much smaller degree of disturbance no typhoons and almost no landslides however there is reason to believe that another factor has been influential the paucity of group 1 species in south african wtrf may be a result chiefly of the extremely low fertility of the soils see van daalen 1984 an evolutionary result paralleling the effect seen in certain tropical forests and cited at the start of section i it is significant that the one group 1a species in our list of core species for the south african wtrf zanthoxylum davyi is much more abundant in stmrf southern mistbelt forest which occurs on more fertile soils mucina et al 2006 in this forest there is at least one other gapdemanding tree ptaeroxylum obliquum see geldenhuys 2010 and the forest is notably subject to invasion by gapdemanding aliens rubus spp and solanum mauritianum mucina et al 2006 at first sight there is a problem with this approach in that some of the bestpreserved wtrf in japan with numerous species confined to treefall gaps that on yakushima is found on highly leached infertile soils over granite however the persistence of gapdemanders in the system may be dependent on the fact emphasized by grubb 1992 that establishment of gapdemanding species in singletreefall gaps is commonly confined to tipup mounds where  by hypothesis  root competition from established trees is significantly reduced in the south african wtrf there are few tipups and by hypothesis few microsites where root competition is not effective in that case it is the interaction of nutrient paucity and the disturbance regime which has been important in inhibiting the evolution of species needing gaps for establishment a quite different kind of complication is involved in the much lower incidence of group 1 species in the chilean wtrf than in the japanese 4 versus 37 it is certainly not consistent with the hypothesis that the incidence of gapdemanders reflects the extent of disturbance because the chilean forest suffers a very high frequency of landslides considered on a world scale veblen et al 1996 and some significant strong winds and yet there is only one group 1 species among a core set of 28 species we suggest that this is an evolutionary result of the allpervading presence of bamboos chusquea spp which invade canopy gaps effectively by vegetative spread and grow both tall 5 m and quickly the five group 2 species exploiting canopy gaps have evolved an ability to establish in a degree of canopy shade and persist in a little more shade than the one group 1 species nothofagus obliqua we now return to the area with the highest incidence of group 1 species australia with 71 the statistically significant contrasts with new zealand chile and south africa table 9 are undoubtedly compatible with the idea that incidence of such species parallels the incidence of disturbance because periodic disturbance by fires is so common and widespread in australian wtrf and no form of disturbance is so common and extensive elsewhere however we must ask whether the proportion of group 1 species in australian wtrf is very high wholly as a result of the very high incidence of disturbance could the relatively small number of shadetolerant species result partly from the stands of wtrf occupying in total a very small area while the wet sclerophyll forest dominated by various eucalyptus spp and containing almost all of the group 1 species of the wtrf occupies a large area this issue is especially important because the area of wtrf in se australia has been small throughout the quaternary and is thus not a recent phenomenon resulting from human activity see kershaw et al 1991 byrne et al 2011 studies of mediterraneantype sclerophyll forest and stmrf in south africa yielded only a weak correlation between area of a forest fragment and number of species in it and a shallow slope for the relationship bond  eustonbrown 1993 everard midgley  van wyk 1993 however there could still be a significant effect of area when the total area of a given forest type in a particular region is very small for a long time we now turn to a different kind of complication possibly partly responsible for the significantly lower incidence of group 1 species in the wtrf of new zealand compared with that in japan 16 versus 37 it is tempting to explain the lower incidence of group 1 species in terms of a lower incidence of disturbance in japan the wtrf suffers frequent disturbance by strong winds and significant numbers of landslides in new zealand it suffers a lower incidence of strong winds cyclones on the order of once a decade versus typhoons in japan every year and probably about the same incidence or a lower one of landslides there is a lack of comparative data on incidence of landslide formation in new zealand and japan and our expectation is based on the total rainfall the frequency of very heavy falls and the extent of sloping topography it seems likely that the wtrf in japan has experienced during evolutionary time a greater incidence of disturbance overall despite this potential fit with the incidence of disturbance we suspect that a quite different factor has played a significant part the great difference between japan and new zealand in the availability of floristic groups with the potential to give rise to group 1 species japan has been continuously close to land that provided a connection with the subtropical and tropical areas to the south hope et al 2004 reflected in the presence today among the group 1 species of 10 genera that are most speciose in the tropical lowland regions table 2 aleurites mallotus and sapium euphorbiaceae aphananthe cannabaceae clerodendrum lamiaceae ehretia boraginaceae ficus moraceae lindera lauraceae sapindus sapindaceaesapindoideae and schoepfia olacaceae in japan there is also a rich temperate deciduous flora to the north which has been in contact with the wtrf for a very long time confining ourselves to genera occuring widely in cool temperate deciduous forest today we find five among the group 1 species acer sapindaceaeaceroideae three spp alnus and carpinus betulaceae one and two spp respectively prunus rosacae one sp and salix salicaceae one sp by contrast the islands comprising new zealand are at the present time isolated from the nearest land masses by 2150 km or more and recent research suggests that most of their flora has been recruited by longdistance dispersal mcglone duncan  heenan 2001 winkworth et al 2002 mcglone 2006 almost all the species below the treeline can be seen as having primarily warm or cool temperate lowland or tropicalsubtropical montane affinities there are only a few exceptions that have strong tropicalsubtropical lowland affinities the palm rhopalostylis the climbing pandan freycinetia the dicots alectryon sapindaceaesapindoideae dysoxylum meliaceae syzygium myrtaceae pisonia nyctaginaceae planchonella sapotaceae and vitex verbenaceae all with one species each and beilschmiedia lauraceae two spp freycinetia pisonia and planchonella are not among the core tree species of the wtrf see online appendix s2 none of the group 1 species in new zealand table 3 belongs to a primarily tropicalsubtropical lowland genus except perhaps the dodonaea see harrington  gadek 2009 the small number of species with tropicalsubtropical lowland affinity may well reflect not only the difficulty of access but also the fact that the wtrf was being constantly squeezed into the northern tip of new zealand during the pleistocene glaciations see mcglone newnham  moar 2010a
 a second contrast with japan is the lack of a rich temperate deciduous flora in the south of australasia we suggest that easy access to japanese wtrf of two contrasted floristic elements tropical lowland and temperate deciduous has played a significant part in the recruitment of proportionally more group 1 species than are found in new zealand it is possible that the lack of group 1 species in chilean wtrf apart from nothofagus obliqua also results in part from the lack during geological time of a deciduous flora to the south comparable with acer alnus carpinus and prunus which have given rise to group 1 species in japanese wtrf by contrast the lack of group 1 species in tropicalsubtropical genera cannot be explained by a lack of connection to such a flora it is true that the atacama desert to the north and the andes to the east of the wtrf constitute barriers now however during the palaeocene there were present in central chile two families that are strictly tropical at the present time lecythidaceae and myristicaceae and there were several that are currently tropicalsubtropical in distribution as defined in section i annonaceae arecaceae bignoniaceae erythroxylaceae and vochysiaceae plus the subfamilies bombacoideae and sterculioideae of the malvaceae hinojosa  villagrn 1997 villagrn  hinojosa 1997 a number of these tropicalsubtropical families persisted in the eocene when there was an increase in the representation of families prominent now in southern temperate forests villagrn  hinojosa 1997 gay hinojosa  villagrn 2005 there was then a decline in the representation of the tropicalsubtropical families in the oligocene and early miocene followed by an increase in the midmiocene hinojosa 2005 what is not known is when the various tropicalsubtropical families were lost from central chile troncoso  encinas 2006 reported the presence of six genera of annonacae two of melastomataceae and one each of caryocaraceae malpighiaceae and sapotaceae as late as the miocenepliocene junction c 5 million years ago at least one of the genera persisting to this period includes many group 1a species in the neotropics today miconia melastomataceae the tropicalsubtropical families that persisted to the end of the pliocene were lost during the repeated glaciations of the pleistocene when there were severe reductions in forest area and in species richness villagrn  hinojosa 1997 there is yet another possible complicating factor the inhibition of mesomorphic gapdemanding species by a regular summer dry season this particularly concerns the canary islands where the total number of core species in the stmrf is small and the incidence of group 1 species is not significantly different from that in the wtrf of any region the range of mean annual rainfall in the stmrf of the canary islands c 500850 mm is lower than in any of the wtrf regions they have c 7002400 mm leaving aside exceptionally wet areas table 1 more significantly the whole of the stmrf in the canary islands suffers a lack of rain every summer hllermann 1981 pointed out that there are five dry months by the criterion of walter  lieth 19601967 ie when the mean rainfall in mm is less than twice the mean temperature in c the total rainfall for the months juneaugust is only c 1545 mm baares et al 1991 of the five wtrf regions only that in chile regularly suffers a dry spell in summer and it affects only about a third of the total area and lasts a much shorter time than that in the canary islands at the northern margin of the wtrf zone eg at concepcin there is a season with two dry months by the definition of walter  lieth 19601967 januaryfebruary and a mean total annual rainfall c 1300 mm further south eg at temuco there is just one dry month january and a total of c 1200 mm luebert  pliscoff 2006 the central and southern parts of the chilean wtrf zone do not experience a dry month in japan there is evidence of a short period of reduced rainfall in summer in one relatively small area at some sites in northwestern shikoku and on the opposing coast of honshu mean annual rainfall c 11501450 mm august is on average markedly drier than the other summer months but it is not a dry month by the definition of walter  lieth 19601967 all of the rain forests of the canary islands are dependent on cloud both interception of cloud water as an addition to rainfall and reduction of evapotranspiration accurate assessment of the interception of cloud water by plants is notoriously difficult however there have been recent critical measurements that range from 80 mm in three summer months garcasantos marzol  aschan 2004 through 110 and 150 mm in two summers garcasantos  bruijnzeel 2011 to 880 mm marzol 2008 it seems likely that most of the forest receives 50150 mm and amounts as high as 400900 mm are confined to certain ridge tops fernndez 2002 the reality of summer water shortage for the plants despite the interception of cloud water has been shown by measurements of the rate of sap flow in some of the most abundant tree species 1996 1999 changes in osmotic potential and tissue elasticity gonzlezrodrguez et al 1999 and closure of stomata and changes in fluxes of carbon dioxide jimnez et al 1999a
 gonzlezrodrguez morales  jimnez 2002 it is no wonder that the three species found by arvalo  fernndezpalacios 1998 to be most abundant within the stmrf are either very closely related to widespread species of mediterranean sclerophyll forest laurus azorica and viburnum rigidum or found in such forest at the western end of the mediterranean basin prunus lusitanica all of the group 1 species included in the core list are sclerophylls erica arborea e scoparia ssp platycodon and morella faya which flourish at both drier and moister sites the three softleaved relatively lightdemanding species in the stmrf which we have tentatively rated as at the more lightdemanding end of the range of group 2 species see online appendix s5 are all excluded from our core list because they are either rather rare or extremely rare euphorbia mellifera gesnouinia arborea and sambucus nigra ssp palmensis all are absent from the drier forest sites but the extreme rarity of euphorbia mellifera and sambucus nigra is apparently to a large extent a result of human activity so that it is not possible to be sure of their tolerances in forest free of human interference ab fernndezlpez personal communication nevertheless there is a prima facie case that the combination of root competition and summer drought has reduced the incidence of softleaved relatively lightdemanding species to summarize some of the differences in the incidence of group 1 species among the six regions studied are likely to be explicable at least in part by the extentofdisturbance effect australia versus new zealand south africa and chile and japan versus new zealand and south africa but other factors are also important  sometimes more important soil infertility presence of aggressive gapfilling bamboo ease of access to speciesrich tropical evergreen and temperate deciduous floras and possibly lack of water in summer here we consider briefly three disparate topics the incidence of group 2 species variation in tolerance within group 2 and group 3 species and invasion of open sites by shadetolerators there is no significant variation among regions in the incidence of group 2 species among species of groups 2 and 3 section iii7 we might have expected some parallel with the incidence of group 1 species in the total set there is almost certain to be significant variation in the degree of shadetolerance among both the group 2 and the group 3 species we have recognized as yet there are critical data on the degree of shade tolerated at different stages of development only for chile lusk et al 2008 and it is highly desirable that the same methodology be applied in other regions of wtrf it should be accompanied by experimental work which reveals any interactions between the effects of shade and those of nutrient supply see grubb et al 1996 andor watershortage see sack 2004 in work on the temperate forests of the northern and southern hemispheres the idea that species might benefit from shade rather than simply tolerating it was not much discussed in the older literature but its importance has been demonstrated in more recent physiological and biochemical studies eg those of murchie  horton 1997 naidu  delucia 1997 kitao et al 2000 and valladares et al 2002 for plants of temperate deciduous forest in the northern hemispshere and those of tausz warren  adams 2005 and reyesdaz et al 2009 for trees of cool temperate rain forest in the southern hemisphere by contrast in the wet tropics earlier researchers were more aware of benefit from shade for shadetolerant species see murray  nichols 1966 and the phenomenon has been well established in more recent physiological studies eg those of krause  winter 1996 lovelock jebb  osmond 1994 scholes press  zipperlen 1997 and matsubara et al 2008 most of these studies have concerned transitions in growing conditions from shade to bright light but some have concerned growth in bright light from the start while some species might benefit from shade rather than simply tolerating it the converse applies to other species coomes  bellingham 2011 argue that even longterm survival in deep shade counts for little unless accompanied by height growth they reviewed data on comparative growth rates of temperate podocarps and angiosperms in deep shade and considered that even though survivorship of some podocarps in deep shade is high growth into the canopy for some of them eg dacrydium cupressinum is likely to depend on periodic openings in the canopy above them despite the mounting evidence for photoinbition of shadetolerant species some species that are seen to regenerate commonly in deep shade in tlrf can establish and grow healthily in the open eg on the bared rock and subsoil of extensive roadside cuttings a clear example in ne australia is the winddispersed darlingia darlingiana proteaceae which was shown experimentally by bloor  grubb 2003 to be very shadetolerant we have seen that at least a few group 3 species of wtrf similarly invade roadcuttings or landslides or talus slopes or lava flows in full daylight eurya japonica and rhododendron tashiroi in japan melicytus ramiflorus and myrsine australis in new zealand eucryphia cordifolia and lomatia ferruginea in chile and acmena smithii and pittosporum undulatum in australia as emphasized by veblen  ashton 1978 such species must combine ease of dispersal with an ability to grow in the open on a slender nutrient supply this is especially true of those with very small seeds which fail to compete on roadsides with deeper soils where there is a greater supply of nutrients the only studies we have found of experimental work on photoinhibition in species of wtrf are those of castroarvalo et al 2008 and alberdi et al 2009 who compared the lightdemanding embothrium coccineum the intermediate gevuina avellana and the shadetolerant lomatia ferruginea the thermal dissipation of excess energy was saturated at a notably lower irradiance in lomatia ferruginea than in the other two species leaving unresolved the leaflevel mechanisms by which this species can be successful in completely open areas new work is needed to understand its ability to grow and resist photodamage as judged by leaf colour in full daylight a study on three stmrf species in the canary islands showed that the gapdemander morella faya is most resistant to high light while the shadetolerant laurus azorica and persea indica were successively more sensitive gonzlezrodrguez et al 2001 studies on diurnal changes in components of the violaxanthin v and lutein epoxide lx cycles in leaves of the four canarian laurel species in the field were reported by esteban et al 2007 they found a functional v cycle in all four species but a functional lx cycle only in ocotea foetens more work is needed to relate these findings to the extent of highlight tolerance in the various species at different stages of the life cycle our review has shown that much is yet to be learnt about soil seed banks in wtrf there is some evidence that the most abundant species that are at least shortterm persistent in the soil are mostly gapdemanders but some shadetolerant species also persist in the soil as is often found in both tlrf and in northern temperate deciduous forests see jankowskabaszczuk  grubb 2006 good examples are eurya japonica and rhododendron tashiroi in japan and macropiper excelsum and melicytus ramiflorus in new zealand the most general advantage of a seed bank for shadetolerators is riskspreading avoidance of seedling loss to predators disease physical damage or unfavourable weather in any given year jankowskablaszczuk  grubb 2006 presented evidence for riskspreading in both temperate and tropical species and considered the possible advantage to have been unduly neglected for plants in forests riskspreading is most convincingly the chief advantage for shadetolerators with larger seeds say 100500 mg such as the two new zealand prumnopitys spp the seeds of which were found by beveridge 1967 to be alive after 5 years on the forest floor for shadetolerant species with small seeds say up to 12 mg such as rhododendron tashiroi eurya japonica macropiper excelsum and melicytus ramiflorus a major advantage of a seed bank may be an ability to invade promptly various kinds of litterfree microsites on soil disturbed within the forest pitsides and mounds made by tippedup standing dead trees heaps and mounds made by animals microlandslides within the forest and places where the litter has been scraped away by a thick heavy trunk sliding down a slope see fig 1 in grubb 1996 in view of the findings summarized by jankowskabaszczuk  grubb 2006 and by dalling  brown 2009 it would be particularly interesting to know whether in general the most persistent species in the soil seed bank of wtrf are among the largest present as in tlrf or among the smallest as in northern temperate deciduous forest there is a need for not only further work on which species are in the persistent seed bank but also experimental work on the effective triggers to germination for species with differentsized seeds orozcosegovia snchezcoronado  vzquezyanes 1993 kyereh swaine  thompson 1999 daws et al 2002 and pearson et al 2002 reported evidence that in tlrf smallerseeded species are stimulated to germinate by the amount of light andor the redfarred ratio and are best suited to smaller canopy gaps while largerseeded species are stimulated by increased diurnal fluctuations in temperature and best suited to larger canopy gaps will the same be found for trees in wtrf allowance should always be made for changes in sensitivity as the ungerminated seeds age such as found by orozcosegovia  vzquezyanes 1989 and metcalfe 1996 it has long been known that at the world scale there is a trend to larger seed size in taller plants thompson  rabinowitz 1997 but from the time of salisbury 1942 onward ecologists have generally made comparisons of seed size between more and less shadetolerant species without regard for mature height see grubb 1998b
 this becomes a serious issue if in a given forest type the shadetolerators and gapdemanders differ markedly in mature height in fact we did not find the usual significant trend in seed size with mature height in trees and tall shrubs in three of the five regions of wtrf that we studied chile south africa and australia or in the stmrf of the canary islands only in the wtrf of japan and new zealand for the wtrf in new zealand we found that the largest mean seed mass increased markedly with final plant height but the smallest mean seed mass did not do so a pattern shown for tlrf by grubb coomes  metcalfe 2005 for the wtrf of chile and south africa a previously unrecorded pattern was found the largest mean seed mass increased with increasing height and the smallest mean seed mass decreased with increasing height both patterns can be interpreted in terms of the range of feasible seed sizes increasing dramatically with wholeplant size the fact that there is no significant difference in final height between species in groups 1 and 3 in wtrf in the three regions where there are many group 1 species japan new zealand and australia makes our interpretation of the comparison of seed mass values more secure in new zealand the group 3 species had greater mean seed mass than the group 1 species the result found most often since the time of salisbury 1942 and also suggested by the trend in wtrf in the regions where there are extremely few group 1 species chile and south africa the same result was found in all seven intrafamilial intergeneric comparisons and the one intrageneric comparison made without reference to final height table 10 more interesting are the results from japan and australia where the seed mass values of group 1 and group 3 species overlap widely and there is no significant difference between the means fig 5 this result arises because there are smallseeded shadetolerant species and largeseeded gapdemanders a position that is common in tlrf grubb 1998a
 the tinyseeded shadetolerators are unable to establish where the substratum is covered by litter they need either steep picosites at soil level from which litter is shed as emphasized by kohyama  grubb 1994 for japan and by metcalfe grubb  turner 1998 for se asia or fallen logs and treefern trunks as noted by various authors reporting on wtrf in new zealand and chile from pope 1924 onward see sections iii1 and iii2 plants tolerant of deep shade do not need especially large seeds in order to survive in low light this point was already appreciated by glenny 1986 and was independently emphasized by later authors kohyama  grubb 1994 metcalfe  grubb 1995 and grubb 1996 it is notable that in three of the five regions of wtrf the seeds of the smallestseeded group 3 core species are smaller than those of the smallestseeded group 1 species japan chile and south africa tables 2 3 4 and 5 the same phenomenon is found in se australia if the noncore species eucryphia moorei is admitted see section iv2 although none of the shadetolerant trees on the canary islands has tiny seeds one of the widespread shadetolerant mediumheight shrubs hypericum grandifolium 2 m was found by us to have a mean seed mass of 005 mg this is still not as low as the value of 003 mg for the group 1 taxon erica scoparia ssp platycodon 6 m it is also significant that augspurger 1984 boot 1996 and bloor  grubb 2003 all showed that among shadetolerant species of tlrf survival of very deep shade eg 0210 daylight was not correlated with seed size grubb  metcalfe 1996 argued that the significance of greater seed mass in shade plants where it is not primarily an attractant to large animals that disperse the seeds is that it enables seedlings to emerge through litter to root down through litter to resist being scratched out of the soil by litterfeeding birds to make possible recovery after being partially eaten to resist more prolonged drought and to compete more effectively for light the twin advantages to a gapdemander of having smaller seeds are i they are likely to be more highly dispersible and ii there is an associated increase in the number of seeds together these two effects have the potential to increase the number of canopy gaps invaded however it is clear that some gapdemanders have evolved large seeds that are so attractive to disperser animals that they reach many gaps despite their larger size and reduced numbers two of the species with the largest seeds in japanese wtrf are group 1 species aleurites cordata and sapindus mukorossii table 2 dr t riyou personal communication found that seeds of aleurites cordata that have turned black and fallen to the ground are taken by a rat rattus sp while professor t yumoto personal communication suggested that the jungle crow corvus macrorhynchos may also be involved in dispersal wakasugi et al 2001 reported that a murine rat is the major disperser of sapindus mukorossii the north american s drummondii which also produces large oneseeded fruits is dispersed by the ringtail bassariscus astutus a member of the racoon family procyonidae taylor 1954 neither aleurites cordata nor sapindus mukorossii was mentioned in the wideranging studies of noma  yumoto 1997 and yumoto et al 1998 on dispersal by birds and by macaque monkeys macaca fuscata yakui on yakushima group 2 species were identified in five of the six regions studied in new zealand their mean seed mass was significantly smaller than that of the group 3 species unpaired t

there are significant problems in how to make a critical comparison of the different regions of wtrf differences in the amount and type of research carried out on the light climate and forest dynamics subjectivity in the classification of species especially for those in groups 2 and 3 lack of coverage of differences in regeneration behaviour eg sprouting versus nonsprouting across the ranges of individual species cases where human impact has been so great that it is difficult to be sure whether or not the lightdemanding tree species common in the forest today had a role in the forest under natural conditions and most seriously lack of exactly comparable data on gap sizes and proportions of forest area entering the gap phase per unit time as a result of different kinds of disturbance particularly disturbance events with a longer return time nevertheless a worthwhile preliminary analysis is possible because many of the differences among regions in disturbance regime and in proportion of gapdemanding species are quite grossthe incidence of group 1 species among the core species declines along the following series australia 1521 species japan 3697 canary islands 314 new zealand 1277 south africa 223 and chile 128 the differences between the australian forest and the forests in new zealand south africa and chile but not those in japan or the canary islands are statistically significant as are the differences between the japanese forest and the forests in new zealand south africa and chile some of these differences are consistent with the extent of opening up of the canopy by disturbance events but we argue that other factors are also involved and may be more important in some cases soil infertility presence of aggressive gapfilling bamboo limited access during evolutionary time to lineages able to give rise to gapdemanding species and possibly lack of water in summerthe incidence of group 2 species among groups 2 and 3 declines in the series new zealand 2865 japan 2561 south africa 821 chile 527 canary islands 111 and australia 06 but none of the differences is significantexperiments in japan and new zealand show that the proportion of species probably in the shortterm persistent soil seed bank is greater for group 1 species than for group 2 and group 3 species but that some group 3 species do build up large numbers of persistent seed in the soil preliminary studies for wtrf in south africa and australia have found only group 1 species with an appreciable amount of persistent seed and there may be none in the soil of stmrf in the canary islands very little is known as yet of the seed bank in chilean foreststhe trees of wtrf in chile south africa and australia and of stmrf in the canary islands do not carry significantly larger seeds on tallergrowing species the general trend in wtrf is for the largest mean seed mass to increase with tree height while there is either no appreciable change in the smallest mean seed mass or it decreases with tree heightthe trees of wtrf in japan and australia show that lightdemanders do not always have on average significantly smaller seeds than shadetolerators in wtrf in new zealand there are significant differences between group 1 and group 3 only among the taller speciesoutside japan the only group 1 species in wtrf with a seed of mean dry mass 100 mg is in australia and the only group 2 species with a mean dry mass 500 mg are in new zealand and chile by contrast group 3 species with seed of mean dry mass 1 mg are found in wtrf not only in japan but also in new zealand chile and australia and there are shadetolerant shrubs with such seeds in stmrf on the canary islands evolution of gapdemanding species with large seeds dependent on dispersal by larger animals has been much less common than evolution of shadetolerant species with very small seeds dependent on exploitation of specialized microsites in adequately moist regions

 the aim of this study is to describe clinical characteristics of adults with flu-like symptoms visiting an influenza outpatient clinic in amsterdam during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic furthermore we aim to provide an overview of the distribution and possible mutual interferences of different viral agents causing respiratory infections in our outpatient population another secondary objective is to evaluate the practical usefulness of several existing clinical case definitions attempting to predict influenza virus infection by comparing their predictive values the data that have been collected were studied in order to provide an epidemiological overview of the causative viral respiratory pathogens and general characterization of the 2009 flu pandemic in a population of adults all adults aged 18 years presenting with any flu-like signs and symptoms at the slotervaart hospital from august 12 2009 until december 31 2009 were included for our analysis patients could be referred by their general practitioner or other para- medical but so-called self-referred patients were also welcome to sign-up for a consultation and those were included in our analysis as well the slotervaart hospital is a general 410-bed teaching hospital that provides basic care for the western region of amsterdam serving a low- to middle-income urban population of about 140000 inhabitants the population consists for 49 of ethnic minorities most of them from moroccan and turkish origin ethical approval and informed consent were not required since this study solely describes findings resulting from regular patient care in our hospital 
influenza virus rna was amplified and detected by real-time one-step reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr performed on oropharyngeal aspirates16 a generic pcr directed against the matrix gene was used to detect influenza virus type a or b and an h1n1-specific pcr was applied to the h1 gene next to influenza the presence of the following pathogens was also detected by rt-pcr parainfluenza-1 parainfluenza-2 parainfluenza-3 parainfluenza-4 adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus rsv human rhinovirus human metapneumovirus human coronavirus oc43 human coronavirus 229e human coronavirus nl63 chlamydia pneumoniae mycoplasma pneumoniae and legionella species upon presentation at our hospital every patient with any flu-like signs or symptoms was submitted to a structured patient history and physical examination by one of our internal medicine residents an oropharyngeal swab sample was collected by a trained nurse for diagnostic purposes when indicated additional laboratory and imaging tests were performed to exclude influenza-related complications or any suspected differential diagnoses test results with regard to presence or absence of influenza virus rna were mostly available within 24 h adults with suspected influenza infection according to the case definition that was used in our hospital ghor  dutch organization of medical assistance for accidents and disasters  website wwwghornl were always given the strict advice to stay at home until the definitive influenza test results were known if the test turned out positive the advised period to stay at home was extended until at least five days after the onset of complaints if the test turned out negative the strict staying-at-home advice was undone 
table 1
describes 4 influenza case definitions that are applied worldwide the national ghor case definition has been used in our clinical practice aiding in our prediction of a clinical diagnosis and the initiation of proper medical management the remaining case definitions have been used for analytical purposes in order to compare associated predictive values between different definitions treatment with the antiviral drug oseltamivir was started in suspected influenza cases conform national guidelines wwwrivmnlen oseltamivir was prescribed only in high-risk patients age 60 years pregnancy in 3rd trimester or suffering from a specified chronic medical condition and in patients with a complicated course if the clinical suspicion was confirmed by a positive test result patients were supposed to finish the five-day course with the antiviral in case of a negative test result the use of oseltamivir was immediately discontinued antibiotics were prescribed at the discretion of the responsible physician hospitalization would follow in case of a complicated course andor instability of the patients medical condition statistical analysis was performed using the spss software package version 180 spss inc chicago illinois continuous variables were summarized as means and for categorical variables percentages of adults in each group were calculated demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between groups using a students t-test or non-parametric test for continuous variables and chi-square or fishers exact test for categorical variables as appropriate stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed in order to determine which independent variables contributed significantly to the prediction of the outcome variable in general a p-value of less than 005 was considered statistically significant from august 12 2009 until december 31 2009 a total of 964 adults visited the influenza outpatient clinic of our hospital the overall mean age was 36 years and 43 were male general characteristics as well as the presence of certain risk groups and way of referral are summarized for patients with and without any detected respiratory pathogens in table 2
 
fig 1
demonstrates detected respiratory pathogens in oropharyngeal samples collected from all 964 adult patients given as absolute numbers per month and percentage overall distribution major responsible pathogens causative of respiratory disease were influenza a h1n1 and human rhinovirus both overall contributing in 16 of the patient samples that had been tested diagnosis of infection with influenza a h1n1 virus peaked in october corresponding prevalence 30 human rhinovirus infection showed its peak in august and september average corresponding prevalence 20 furthermore in december rsv prevalence reached 7 equaling the influenza a h1n1 prevalence in that month of particular last note is that infections with influenza b and legionella species were not seen at all two concurrent pathogens were demonstrated in 18 individuals of which 5 suffered from at least one comorbid condition the following double infections were seen influenza a h1n1 with human rhinovirus n  8 influenza a h1n1 with parainfluenza virus n  2 influenza a h1n1 with adenovirus n  2 influenza a h1n1 with human metapneumovirus n  1 influenza a h1n1 with human coronavirus n  1 parainfluenza virus with c pneumoniae n  1 rsv with human rhinovirus n  1 human rhinovirus with human metapneumovirus n  1 and human rhinovirus with human coronavirus n  1 clinical characteristics of patients with the two most frequently detected pathogens ie influenza a h1n1 and human rhinovirus and of those without any detected pathogens are summarized in table 3
 influenza a h1n1-positive patients compared with patients in whom we did not detect any pathogen reported more fever 385 c 65 versus 32 p  0001 showed significantly worse vital parameters and suffered more from most general flu complaints in patients with rt-pcr confirmed human rhinovirus infection less statistically significant differences when compared again with patients in whom we did not detect any pathogen were seen when comparing influenza a h1n1 cases with human rhinovirus cases a history of fever 385 c was reported more frequently by h1n1-positive cases 65 versus 34 p  0001 and those patients suffered more cough less rhinorrea more myalgia and more subjective chills than those infected with rhinovirus 
table 1 explains the influenza case definitions that were used for this study in general no statistically significant and relevant differences between the different criteria sets were demonstrated for each individual performance characteristic fig 2
therefore shows the performance characteristics ie sensitivity specificity positive predictive value and negative predictive value of only the ghor case definition which was used in our outpatient practice overall performance characteristics are shown as well as performance characteristics in augustseptember period of relatively low incidence of pandemic flu and octobernovember period of relatively high incidence of pandemic flu and also for patients with and without having been referred by their general practitioner gp overall sensitivity and specificity were 64 and 71 respectively the positive predictive value was 35 and the negative predictive value 89 statistically significant differences in positive and negative predictive values were seen within all criteria sets when comparing the period augustseptember with the period octobernovember with regard to the ghor case definition positive predictive value increased from 17 to 53 and negative predictive value decreased from 94 to 81 additional statistically significant differences were seen within criteria sets when comparing patients that had been referred by their gp with patients who visited the outpatient clinic without having been referred by their gp for all criteria sets sensitivity was significantly higher for gp referrals than self-referrals 80 versus 51 in fig 2 specificity for the ghor case definition showed a borderline significant lower value of 62 among gp referrals compared with 73 among self-referrals for the other case definitions the lower specificity that was demonstrated among gp referrals did reach true statistical significance p  005 finally besides fever and cough stepwise logistic regression analysis did not result in the discovery of any additional statistically significant and clinically relevant predictor variables oseltamivir therapy was initiated according to national guidelines in 23 patients 13 with confirmed influenza a infection either h1n1 subtype or non-specified and in 38 patients 5 without confirmed influenza a infection treatment with oseltamivir was discontinued mostly within 24 h in all of the 38 influenza a negative patients antibiotics were prescribed on average in 4 of all patients visiting the outpatient clinic no statistically significant difference in antibiotics prescription rate was demonstrated between groups based on rt-pcr result hospitalization for complicated infection was seen in 7 adult patients four patients had to be hospitalized because of a complicated course of infection with the pandemic h1n1-virus for two of these patients admission to the intensive care unit was required because of respiratory insufficiency and the need for mechanical ventilation the other three adults were hospitalized for other diagnoses than viral respiratory infection bronchial carcinoma colonic peri-diverticulitis and community acquired bacterial pneumonia no influenza-related deaths occurred during the entire study period this observational study describes interesting epidemiological findings in a population of 964 symptomatic adults visiting an influenza outpatient clinic during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic from august 12 until december 31 2009 influenza a h1n1 and human rhinovirus were the major pathogens responsible for respiratory disease among our patients both having been detected in 16 of the tested throat swab samples overall any respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 41 of tested patient samples infections with influenza b and legionella species were not observed at all double infections were seen in 18 patients these findings are reasonably comparable to a published report describing prevalence rates of respiratory viruses that were identified annually from 19671981 in tecumseh michigan10 11 in contrast due to the pandemic nature of the influenza a outbreak last year we observed a much higher number of cases with a confirmed influenza a diagnosis than from previous influenza seasons that were observed in the tecumseh studies the incidence of confirmed h1n1-positive cases over the course of time however does correspond fairly well with numbers reported during the past 2009 h1n1 pandemic by sentinel stations for influenza surveillance in the netherlands and europe21 22
 during the course of the pandemic different pathogens were dominating the etiologic picture of upper airway infection at different periods in august and september human rhinovirus infection peaked among symptomatic patients with a corresponding 20 of throat swab samples having tested positive in those months novel swine-origin influenza a h1n1 virus infection encountered its highest peak prevalence of 30 in the month october rsv a less frequently seen viral cause of airway disease in adults did reach a 7 prevalence rate in december the consecutive outbreaks of human rhinovirus influenza a h1n1 and rsv followed its usual pattern unlike postulations from french investigators the interaction between the pandemic flu and rhinoviruses did not cause a delay in the circulation of respiratory syncytial viruses in our population15
 clinical features of the 157 cases of 2009 pandemic influenza a h1n1 were different from cases that had not been diagnosed with any respiratory viral infection a history of fever was reported twice as much by the h1n1-positive cases most flu-signs and -symptoms were reported significantly more often and vital parameters were slightly but significantly worse than in the cases in which no respiratory virus could be demonstrated when comparing the h1n1-positive cases with patients with human rhinovirus infection less statistically significant differences were seen but on average the flu patient could be regarded as being sicker than the common cold patient our study is the first to compare clinical features of patients in an outpatient setting in relation to different pathogens that have been detected during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic a chinese observational study described clinical features of 426 persons infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza a h1n1 virus using thermal scanners installed at airports and ports of entry to china to include travelers and subsequently their close contacts6 furthermore a report from the united states summarized clinical findings from hospitalized patients only with 2009 h1n1 influenza infection23
 in the netherlands with a population size of approximately 165 million people the pandemic followed a relatively mild course until the end of december 2009 a total of 2156 hospitalizations of cases with laboratory confirmed influenza a h1n1 were reported of which 10 required intensive care and in total 53 patients had died in our population the low number of h1n1-related hospitalizations and the fact that only two adults had to be admitted to the icu because of respiratory insufficiency all confirmed the mild course of the pandemic an important finding from our study is that treatment with oseltamivir could be discontinued in 38 of 61 patients after the test results had become available and turned negative for influenza virus these adults had they not been tested by a throat swab and rt-pcr would have been treated for an unnecessarily long time with the antiviral drug and although clinically probably not very serious subjected to an unnecessary risk of adverse effects24
 four different case definitions for influenza-like illness were evaluated the corresponding criteria sets were derived from the world health organization who the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc the united kingdom health protecting agency hpa and the dutch organization of medical assistance for accidents and disasters ghor overall performance characteristics were rather poor and similar for the different criteria sets positive predictive value increased and negative predictive value decreased when comparing the lower-prevalence period augustseptember with the higher-prevalence period octobernovember this finding is not surprising since the predictive value is determined by the prevalence of disease in the population being tested25 further statistically significant differences were seen within criteria sets when comparing patients that had been referred by their gp with patients that visited the outpatient clinic without having been referred for all criteria sets sensitivity was significantly higher for gp referrals than self-referrals and specificity was significantly lower this could be explained by some kind of selection bias ie general practitioners referring those patients who were more ill and therefore might meet case definition criteria more easily in the daily practice of our influenza outpatient clinic we needed a case definition with a high sensitivity since missing influenza infection might have had important consequences with regard to uncontrolled spread of the virus and the risk for a complicated course of the infection if treatment would not have been initiated unfortunately neither the ghor case definition that has been used by us nor the other case definitions that were studied have been very helpful in that regard even though a maximum positive predictive value of 53 which was seen in october and november at the peak of the epidemic is still rather useless when wishing to confirm the diagnosis being sought a maximum negative predictive value of 90 among patients that had been referred by their gp might be of quite some value to our practicing clinicians who also want to be confident that a negative case definition rules out infection with influenza virus in a report evaluating clinical case definitions in france during the 19951996 influenza epidemic 12 case definitions were associated with positive predictive values of 2740 and negative predictive values of 809119 these findings are comparable to findings from our population limitations of this observational study should be mentioned first a selection bias of so-called worried well mostly self-referred patients is very likely to have influenced our results national surveillances however have demonstrated comparable low rates of hospitalization and icu admission another limitation is that we restricted the rt-pcr analyses to 8 viral and 3 bacterial pathogens although we have been detecting the most common pathogens during a normal influenza season we might have missed some notable causative bacterial organisms like streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae sputum and blood samples have been collected from few adults for bacterial cultures in our microbiology laboratory none did result in the detection of any bacterial pathogens in conclusion from august through december 2009 influenza a h1n1 and human rhinovirus were the major pathogens responsible for respiratory disease in a population of 964 symptomatic adult outpatients the clinical presentation of influenza cases was significantly more serious when compared to rhinovirus cases or cases that tested negative for any respiratory pathogen overall viewed from an outpatient setting we can conclude that the 2009 h1n1 pandemic in amsterdam followed a mild course test characteristics of 4 different clinical case definitions seemed comparable but rather useless with the exception of a relatively high negative predictive value that might be of value in clinical practice when ruling out a diagnosis of influenza infection is of importance to the practicing clinician none none  an introduction to covid-19 simon fong james nilanjan dey jyotismita chaki   a novel coronavirus cov named 2019-ncov or 2019 novel coronavirus or covid-19 by the world health organization who is in charge of the current outbreak of pneumonia that began at the beginning of december 2019 near in wuhan city hubei province china 14 covid-19 is a pathogenic virus from the phylogenetic analysis carried out with obtainable full genome sequences bats occur to be the covid-19 virus reservoir but the intermediate hosts has not been detected till now though three major areas of work already are ongoing in china to advise our awareness of the pathogenic origin of the outbreak these include early inquiries of cases with symptoms occurring near in wuhan during december 2019 ecological sampling from the huanan wholesale seafood market as well as other area markets and the collection of detailed reports of the point of origin and type of wildlife species marketed on the huanan market and the destination of those animals after the market has been closed 58 coronaviruses mostly cause gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections and are inherently categorized into four major types gammacoronavirus deltacoronavirus betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus 911 the first two types mainly infect birds while the last two mostly infect mammals six types of human covs have been formally recognized these comprise hcovhku1 hcov-oc43 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which is the type of the betacoronavirus hcov229e and hcov-nl63 which are the member of the alphacoronavirus coronaviruses did not draw global concern until the 2003 sars pandemic 1214 preceded by the 2012 mers 1517 and most recently by the covid-19 outbreaks sars-cov and mers-cov are known to be extremely pathogenic and spread from bats to palm civets or dromedary camels and eventually to humans covid-19 is spread by dust particles and fomites while close unsafe touch between the infector and the infected individual airborne distribution has not been recorded for covid-19 and is not known to be a significant transmission engine based on empirical evidence although it can be imagined if such aerosol-generating practices are carried out in medical facilities faecal spreading has been seen in certain patients and the active virus has been reported in a small number of clinical studies 1820 furthermore the faecal-oral route does not seem to be a covid-19 transmission engine its function and relevance for covid-19 need to be identified for about 1873858 laboratory-confirmed cases recorded as of 2nd week of april 2020 the maximum number of cases 778 was between 30 and 69 years of age among the recorded cases 216 are farmers or employees by profession 511 are male and 770 are hubei however there are already many concerns regarding the latest coronavirus although it seems to be transferred to humans by animals it is important to recognize individual animals and other sources the path of transmission the incubation cycle and the features of the susceptible community and the survival rate nonetheless very little clinical knowledge on covid-19 disease is currently accessible and details on age span the animal origin of the virus incubation time outbreak curve viral spectroscopy dissemination pathogenesis autopsy observations and any clinical responses to antivirals are lacking among the serious cases influenza or seasonal flu occurs globally every yearusually between december and february it is impossible to determine the number of reports per year because it is not a reportable infection so no need to be recorded to municipality so often patients with minor symptoms do not go to a physician recent figures placed the rate of case fatality at 01 2123 there are approximately 35 million reports of serious influenza a year and about 250000500000 deaths globally in most developed nations the majority of deaths arise in persons over 65 years of age moreover it is unsafe for pregnant mothers children under 59 months of age and individuals with serious illnesses the annual vaccination eliminates infection and severe risks in most developing countries but is nevertheless a recognized yet uncomfortable aspect of the season in contrast to the seasonal influenza coronavirus is not so common has led to fewer cases till now has a higher rate of case fatality and has no antidote several cases of bird flu have existed over the years with the most severe in 2013 and 2016 this is usually from two separate strainsh5n1 and h7n9 2426 the h7n9 outbreak in 2016 accounted for one-third of all confirmed human cases but remained confined relative to both coronavirus and other pandemicsoutbreak cases after the first outbreak about 1233 laboratory-confirmed reports of bird flu have occurred the disease has a rate of case fatality of 2040 although the percentage is very high the blowout from individual to individual is restricted which in effect has minimized the number of related deaths it is also impossible to monitor as birds do not necessarily expire from sickness in contrast to the bird flu coronavirus becomes more common travels more quickly through human to human interaction has an inferior cardiothoracic ratio resulting in further total fatalities and spread from the initial source the ebola epidemic of 2013 was primarily centred in 10 nations including sierra leone guinea and liberia have the greatest effects but the extremely high case fatality rate of 40 has created this as a significant problem for health professionals nationwide 2729 around 2013 and 2016 there were about 28646 suspicious incidents and about 11323 fatalities although these are expected to be overlooked those who survived from the original epidemic may still become sick months or even years later because the infection may stay inactive for prolonged periods thankfully a vaccination was launched in december 2016 and is perceived to be effective in contrast to the ebola coronavirus is more common globally has caused in fewer fatalities has a lesser case fatality rate has no reported problems during treatment and after recovery does not have an appropriate vaccination camel flu is a misnomerthough camels have mers antibodies and may have been included in the transmission of the disease it was originally transmitted to humans through bats 3032 like ebola it infected only a limited number of nations ie about 27 but about 858 fatalities from about 2494 laboratory-confirmed reports suggested that it was a significant threat if no steps were taken in place to control it in contrast to the camel flu coronavirus is more common globally has occurred more fatalities has a lesser case fatality rate and spreads more easily among humans swine flu is the same form of influenza that wiped 17 of the world population in 1918 this was deemed a pandemic again in june 2009 an approximately-21 of the global population infected by this 3335 thankfully the case fatality rate is substantially lower than in the last pandemic with 0105 of events ending in death about 18500 of these fatalities have been laboratory-confirmed but statistics range as high as 151700575400 worldwide 5080 of severe occurrences have been reported in individuals with chronic illnesses like asthma obesity cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in contrast to the swine flu coronavirus is not so common has caused fewer fatalities has more case fatality rate has a longer growth time and less impact on young people sars was discovered in 2003 as it spread from bats to humans resulted in about 774 fatalities by may there were eventually about 8100 reports across 17 countries with a 15 case fatality rate the number is estimated to be closer to 96 as confirmed cases are counted with 09 cardiothoracic ratio for people aged 2029 rising to 28 for people aged 7079 similar to coronavirus sars had bad results for males than females in all age categories 3638 coronavirus is more common relative to sars which ended in more overall fatalities lower case fatality rate the even higher case fatality rate in older ages and poorer results for males the hong kong flu pandemic erupted on 13 july 1968 with 14 million deaths globally by 1969 it was one of the greatest flu pandemics of the twentieth century but thankfully the case fatality rate was smaller than the epidemic of 1918 resulting in fewer fatalities overall that may have been attributed to the fact that citizens had generated immunity owing to a previous epidemic in 1957 and to better medical treatment 39 in contrast to the hong kong flu coronavirus is not so common has caused in fewer fatalities and has a higher case fatality rate the 1918 spanish flu pandemic was one of the greatest occurrences of recorded history during the first year of the pandemic lifespan in the us dropped by 12 years with more civilians killed than hivaids in 24 h 4042 regardless of the name the epidemic did not necessarily arise in spain wartime censors in germany the united states the united kingdom and france blocked news of the disease but spain did not creating the misleading perception that more cases and fatalities had occurred relative to its neighbours this strain of h1n1 eventually affected more than 500 million men or 27 of the worlds population at the moment and had deaths of between 40 and 50 million at the end of 1920 17 of the worlds people had expired of this illness including an exceptionally high death rate for young adults aged between 20 and 40 years in contrast to the spanish flu coronavirus is not so common has caused in fewer fatalities has a higher case fatality rate is more harmful to older ages and is less risky for individuals aged 2040 years common cold is the most common illness impacting peopletypically a person suffers from 23 colds each year and the average kid will catch 68 during the similar time span although there are more than 200 cold-associated virus types infections are uncommon and fatalities are very rare and typically arise mainly in extremely old extremely young or immunosuppressed cases 43 44 in contrast to the common cold coronavirus is not so prevalent causes more fatalities has more case fatality rate is less infectious and is less likely to impact small children as covid-19 started to propagate across the globe the outbreak contributed to a significant change in the broad technology platforms where they once declined to engage in the affairs of their systems except though the possible danger to public safety became obvious the advent of a novel coronavirus placed them in a different interventionist way of thought big tech firms and social media are taking concrete steps to guide users to relevant credible details on the virus 4548 and some of the measures theyre doing proactively below are a few of them facebook started adding a box in the news feed that led users to the centers for disease control website regarding covid-19 it reflects a significant departure from the companys normal strategy of placing items in the news feed the purpose of the update after all is personalizationfacebook tries to give the posts youre going to care about whether it is because youre connected with a person or like a post in the virus package facebook has placed a remarkable algorithmic thumb on the scale potentially pushing millions of people to accurate authenticated knowledge from a reputable source similar initiatives have been adopted by twitter searching for covid-19 will carry you to a page highlighting the latest reports from public health groups and credible national news outlets the search also allows for common misspellings twitter has stated that although russian-style initiatives to cause discontent by large-scale intelligence operations have not yet been observed a zero-tolerance approach to network exploitation and all other attempts to exploit their service at this crucial juncture will be expected the problem has the attention of the organization it also offers promotional support to public service agencies and other non-profit groups google has made a step in making it better for those who choose to operate or research from home offering specialized streaming services to all paying g suite customers google also confirmed that free access to advanced hangouts meet apps will be rolled out to both g suite and g suite for education clients worldwide through 1st july it ensures that companies can hold meetings of up to 250 people broadcast live to up to about 100000 users within a single network and archive and export meetings to google drive usually google pays an additional 13 per person per month for these services in comparison to g suites enterprise membership which adds up to a total of about 25 per client each month microsoft took a similar move introducing the software chat device to help public health and protection in the coronavirus epidemic which enables collaborative collaboration via video and text messaging theres an aspect of self-interest in this tech firms are offering out their goods free of charge during periods of emergency for the same purpose as newspapers are reducing their paywalls its nice to draw more paying consumers pinterest which has introduced much of the anti-misinformation strategies that facebook and twitter are already embracing is now restricting the search results for coronavirus covid-19 and similar words for internationally recognized health organizations google-owned youtube traditionally the most conspiratorial website has recently introduced a connection to the world health organization virus epidemic page to the top of the search results in the early days of the epidemic buzzfeed found famous coronavirus conspiratorial videos on youtubeespecially in india where one explain with a false interpretation of the sources of the disease racketeered 13 million views before youtube deleted it yet in the united states conspiratorial posts regarding the illness have failed to gain only 1 million views thats not to suggest that misinformation doesnt propagate on digital platformsjust as it travels through the broader internet even though interaction with friends and relatives when theres a site that appears to be under-performing in the global epidemic its facebook-owned whatsapp where the washington post reported a torrent of disinformation in places like nigeria indonesia peru pakistan and ireland given the encrypted existence of the app it is difficult to measure the severity of the problem misinformation is also spread in whatsapp communities where participation is restricted to about 250 individuals knowledge of one category may be readily exchanged with another however there is a considerable amount of complexity of rotating several groups to peddle affected healing remedies or propagate false rumours

 the first person believed to have become sick because of the latest virus was near in wuhan on 1 december 2019 a formal warning of the epidemic was released on 31 december the world health organization was informed of the epidemic on the same day through 7 january the chinese government addressed the avoidance and regulation of covid-19 a curfew was declared on 23 january to prohibit flying in and out of wuhan private usage of cars has been banned in the region chinese new year 25 january festivities have been cancelled in many locations 50 on 26 january the communist party and the government adopted more steps to contain the covid-19 epidemic including safety warnings for travellers and improvements to national holidays the leading party has agreed to prolong the spring festival holiday to control the outbreak universities and schools across the world have already been locked down many steps have been taken by the hong kong and macau governments in particular concerning schools and colleges remote job initiatives have been placed in effect in many regions of china several immigration limits have been enforced certain counties and cities outside hubei also implemented travel limits public transit has been changed and museums in china have been partially removed some experts challenged the quality of the number of cases announced by the chinese government which constantly modified the way coronavirus cases were recorded italy a member state of the european union and a popular tourist attraction entered the list of coronavirus-affected nations on 30 january when two positive cases in covid-19 were identified among chinese tourists italy has the largest number of coronavirus infections both in europe and outside of china 51 infections originally limited to northern italy gradually spread to all other areas many other nations in asia europe and the americas have tracked their local cases to italy several italian travellers were even infected with coronavirus-positive in foreign nations late in italy the most impacted coronavirus cities and counties are lombardia accompanied by veneto emilia-romagna marche and piedmonte milan the second most populated city in italy is situated in lombardy other regions in italy with coronavirus comprised campania toscana liguria lazio sicilia friuli venezia giulia umbria puglia trento abruzzo calabria molise valle daosta sardegna bolzano and basilicata italy ranks 19th of the top 30 nations getting high-risk coronavirus airline passengers in china as per worldpops provisional study of the spread of covid-19 the italian state has taken steps like the inspection and termination of large cultural activities during the early days of the coronavirus epidemic and has gradually declared the closing of educational establishments and airport hygienedisinfection initiatives the italian national institute of health suggested social distancing and agreed that the broader community of the countrys elderly is a problem in the meantime several other nations including the us have recommended that travel to italy should be avoided temporarily unless necessary the italian government has declared the closing quarantine of the impacted areas in the northern region of the nation so as not to spread to the rest of the world italy has declared the immediate suspension of all to-and-fro air travel with china following coronavirus discovery by a chinese tourist to italy italian airlines like ryan air have begun introducing protective steps and have begun calling for the declaration forms to be submitted by passengers flying to poland slovakia and lithuania the italian government first declined to permit fans to compete in sporting activities until early april to prevent the potential transmission of coronavirus the step ensured players of health and stopped event cancellations because of coronavirus fears two days of the declaration the government cancelled all athletic activities owing to the emergence of the outbreak asking for an emergency sports activities in veneto lombardy and emilia-romagna which recorded coronavirus-positive infections were confirmed to be temporarily suspended schools and colleges in italy have also been forced to shut down iran announced the first recorded cases of sars-cov-2 infection on 19 february when as per the medical education and ministry of health two persons died later that day the ministry of islamic culture and guidance has declared the cancellation of all concerts and other cultural activities for one week the medical education and ministry of health has also declared the closing of universities higher education colleges and schools in many cities and regions the department of sports and culture has taken action to suspend athletic activities including football matches 52 on 2 march 2020 the government revealed plans to train about 300000 troops and volunteers to fight the outbreak of the epidemic and also send robots and water cannons to clean the cities the state also developed an initiative and a webpage to counter the epidemic on 9 march 2020 nearly 70000 inmates were immediately released from jail owing to the epidemic presumably to prevent the further dissemination of the disease inside jails the revolutionary guards declared a campaign on 13 march 2020 to clear highways stores and public areas in iran president hassan rouhani stated on 26 february 2020 that there were no arrangements to quarantine areas impacted by the epidemic and only persons should be quarantined the temples of shia in qom stayed open to pilgrims on 20 january south korea announced its first occurrence there was a large rise in cases on 20 february possibly due to the meeting in daegu of a progressive faith community recognized as the shincheonji church of christ any citizens believed that the hospital was propagating the disease as of 22 february 1261 of the 9336 members of the church registered symptoms a petition was distributed calling for the abolition of the church more than 2000 verified cases were registered on 28 february increasing to 3150 on 29 february 53 several educational establishments have been partially closing down including hundreds of kindergartens in daegu and many primary schools in seoul as of 18 february several south korean colleges had confirmed intentions to delay the launch of the spring semester that included 155 institutions deciding to postpone the start of the semester by two weeks until 16 march and 22 institutions deciding to delay the start of the semester by one week until 9 march also on 23 february 2020 all primary schools kindergartens middle schools and secondary schools were declared to postpone the start of the semester from 2 march to 9 march south koreas economy is expected to expand by 19 down from 21 the state has given 1367 billion won funding to local councils the state has also coordinated the purchase of masks and other sanitary supplies entertainment company sm entertainment is confirmed to have contributed five hundred million won in attempts to fight the disease in the kpop industry the widespread dissemination of coronavirus within south korea has contributed to the cancellation or postponement of concerts and other programmes for kpop activities inside and outside south korea for instance circumstances such as the cancellation of the remaining asian dates and the european leg for the seventeens ode to you tour on 9 february 2020 and the cancellation of all seoul dates for the bts soul tour map as of 15 march a maximum of 136 countries and regions provided entry restrictions andor expired visas for passengers from south korea the overall reported cases of coronavirus rose significantly in france on 12 march the areas with reported cases include paris amiens bordeaux and eastern haute-savoie the first coronaviral death happened in france on 15 february marking it the first death in europe the second death of a 60-year-old french national in paris was announced on 26 february 54 on february 28 fashion designer agns b not to be mistaken with agns buzyn cancelled fashion shows at the paris fashion week expected to continue until 3 march on a subsequent day the paris half-marathon planned for sunday 1 march with 44000 entrants was postponed as one of a series of steps declared by health minister olivier vran on 13 march the ligue de football professional disbanded ligue 1 and ligue 2 frances tier two professional divisions permanently due to safety threats germany has a popular regional pandemic strategy detailing the roles and activities of the health care system participants in the case of a significant outbreak epidemic surveillance is carried out by the federal government like the robert koch center and by the german governments the german states have their preparations for an outbreak the regional strategy for the treatment of the current coronavirus epidemic was expanded by march 2020 four primary goals are contained in this plan 1 to minimize mortality and morbidity 2 to guarantee the safety of sick persons 3 to protect vital health services and 4 to offer concise and reliable reports to decision-makers the media and the public 55 the programme has three phases that may potentially overlap 1 isolation situation of individual cases and clusters 2 safety situation of further dissemination of pathogens and suspected causes of infection 3 prevention situation of widespread infection so far germany has not set up border controls or common health condition tests at airports instead while at the isolation stage-health officials are concentrating on recognizing contact individuals that are subject to specific quarantine and are tracked and checked specific quarantine is regulated by municipal health authorities by doing so the officials are seeking to hold the chains of infection small contributing to decreased clusters at the safety stage the policy should shift to prevent susceptible individuals from being harmed by direct action by the end of the day the prevention process should aim to prevent cycles of acute treatment to retain emergency facilities the very first case of coronavirus in the united states was identified in washington on 21 january 2020 by an individual who flew to wuhan and returned to the united states the second case was recorded in illinois by another individual who had travelled to wuhan some of the regions with reported novel coronavirus infections in the us are california arizona connecticut illinois texas wisconsin and washington 56 as the epidemic increased requests for domestic air travel decreased dramatically by 4 march us carriers like united airlines and jetblue airways started growing their domestic flight schedules providing generous unpaid leave to workers and suspending recruits a significant number of universities and colleges cancelled classes and reopened dormitories in response to the epidemic like cornell university harvard university and the university of south carolina on 3 march 2020 the federal reserve reduced its goal interest rate from 175 to 125 the biggest emergency rate cut following the 2008 global financial crash in combat the effect of the recession on the american economy in february 2020 us businesses including apple inc and microsoft started to reduce sales projections due to supply chain delays in china caused by the covid-19 the pandemic together with the subsequent financial market collapse also contributed to greater criticism of the crisis in the united states researchers disagree about when a recession is likely to take effect with others suggesting that it is not unavoidable while some claim that the world might already be in recession on 3 march federal reserve chairman jerome powell reported a 05 50 basis point interest rate cut from the coronavirus in the context of the evolving threats to economic growth when social distance penetrated the national lexicon disaster response officials promoted the cancellation of broad events to slow down the risk of infection technical conferences like e3 2020 apple incs worldwide developers conference wwdc google io facebook f8 and cloud next and microsofts mvp conference have been either having replaced or cancelled in-person events with internet streaming events on february 29 the american physical society postponed its annual march gathering planned for march 26 in denver colorado even though most of the more than 11000 physicist attendees already had arrived and engaged in the pre-conference day activities on march 6 the annual south to southwest sxsw seminar and festival planned to take place from march 1322 in austin texas was postponed after the city council announced a local disaster and forced conferences to be shut down for the first time in 34 years four of north americas major professional sports leaguesthe national hockey league nhl national basketball association nba major league soccer mls and major league baseball mlb jointly declared on march 9 that they would all limit the media access to player accommodations such as locker rooms to control probable exposure covid-19 pandemic has become a common international concern different countries are donating funds to fight against it 5760 some of them are mentioned here china has allocated about 11048 billion yuan 1593 billion in coronavirus-related funding foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said that iran has requested the international monetary fund imf of about 5 billion in emergency funding to help to tackle the coronavirus epidemic that has struck the islamic republic hard president donald trump approved the emergency supplementary budget bill to support the us response to a novel coronavirus epidemic the budget plan would include about 83 billion in discretionary funding to local health authorities to promote vaccine research for production trump originally requested just about 2 billion to combat the epidemic but congress quadrupled the number in its version of the bill mr trump formally announced a national emergency that he claimed it will give states and territories access to up to about 50 billion in federal funding to tackle the spread of the coronavirus outbreak california politicians approved a plan to donate about 1 billion on the states emergency medical responses as it readies hospitals to fight an expected attack of patients because of the covid-19 pandemic the plans drawn up rapidly in reaction to the dramatic rise in reported cases of the virus would include the requisite funds to establish two new hospitals in california with the assumption that the state may not have the resources to take care of the rise in patients the bill calls for an immediate response of about 500 million from the state general fund with an additional about 500 million possible if requested india committed about 10 million to the covid-19 emergency fund and said it was setting up a rapid response team of physicians for the south asian association for regional cooperation saarc countries south korea unveiled an economic stimulus package of about 117 trillion won 98 billion to soften the effects of the biggest coronavirus epidemic outside china as attempts to curb the disease exacerbate supply shortages and drain demand of the 117 trillion won expected about 32 trillion won would cover up the budget shortfall while an additional fiscal infusion of about 85 trillion won an estimated 103 trillion won in government bonds will be sold this year to fund the extra expenditure about 23 trillion won will be distributed to medical establishments and would support quarantine operations with another 30 trillion won heading to small and medium-sized companies unable to pay salaries to their employees and child care supports the swedish parliament announced a set of initiatives costing more than 300 billion swedish crowns 3094 billion to help the economy in the view of the coronavirus pandemic the plan contained steps like the central government paying the entire expense of the companys sick leave during april and may and also the high cost of compulsory redundancies owing to the crisis in consideration of the developing scenario an updating of this strategy is planned to take place before the end of march and will recognize considerably greater funding demands for the country response rd and who itself the biggest risk of coronavirus is the level of spreading thats why policymakers are introducing steps like quarantines around the world because they cant adequately monitor local outbreaks one of the simplest measures to identify ill patients through the study of cctv images that are still around us and to locate and separate individuals that have serious signs of the disease and who have touched and disinfected the related surfaces smartphone applications are often used to keep a watch on peoples activities and to assess whether or not they have come in touch with an infected human many of the signs such as temperature or heartbeat are very essential to overlook and rely entirely on the visual image that may be misleading however of course we cant prevent someone from checking their blood pressure heart or temperature also several advances in computer vision can predict pulse and blood pressure based on facial skin examination besides there are several advances in computer vision that can predict pulse and blood pressure based on facial skin examination access to public records has contributed to the development of dashboards that constantly track the virus several companies are designing large data dashboards face recognition and infrared temperature monitoring technologies have been mounted in all major cities chinese ai companies including hanwang technology and sensetime have reported having established a special facial recognition system that can correctly identify people even though they are covered measurements like pulse are much more natural and easier to obtain from tracking gadgets like activity trackers and smartwatches that nearly everybody has already some work suggests that the study of cardiac activity and its variations from the standard will reveal early signs of influenza and in this case coronavirus apart from public screening peoples knowledge and self-assessment may also be used to track their health if you can check your temperature and pulse every day and monitor your coughs time-to-time you can even submit that to your record if the symptoms are too serious either an algorithm or a doctor remotely may prescribe a person to stay home take several other preventive measures or recommend a visit from the doctor al jazeera announced that china mobile had sent text messages to state media departments telling them about the citizens who had been affected the communications contained all the specifics of the persons travel history tencent runs wechat and via it citizens can use free online health consultation services chatbots have already become important connectivity platforms for transport and tourism service providers to keep passengers up-to-date with the current transport protocols and disturbances there are several people who post their health diary with total strangers via facebook or twitter such data becomes helpful for more general research about how far the epidemic has progressed for consumer knowledge we may even evaluate the social network group to attempt to predict what specific networks are at risk of being viral canadian company bluedot analyses far more than just social network data for instance global activities of more than four billion passengers on international flights per year animal human and insect population data satellite environment data and relevant knowledge from health professionals and journalists across 100000 news posts per day covering 65 languages this strategy was so successful that the corporation was able to alert clients about coronavirus until the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention notified the public covid-19 has brought up another healthcare issue today it will not scale when the number of patients increases exponentially actually stressed doctors are always doing worse and the rate of false-negative diagnosis remains very high machine learning therapies dont get bored and scale simply by growing computing forces baidu the chinese internet company has made the lineatrfold algorithm accessible to the outbreak-fighting teams according to the mit technology review unlike hiv ebola and influenza covid-19 has just one strand of rna and it can mutate easily the algorithm is also simpler than other algorithms that help to determine the nature of the virus baidu has also developed software to efficiently track large populations it has also developed an ai-powered infrared device that can detect a difference in the body temperature of a human this is currently being used in beijings qinghe railway station to classify possibly contaminated travellers where up to 200 individuals may be checked in one minute without affecting traffic movement reports the mit review singapore-based veredus laboratories a supplier of revolutionary molecular diagnostic tools has currently announced the launch of the verecov detector package a compact lab-on-chip device able to detect mers-cov sars-cov and covid-19 ie wuhan coronavirus in a single study the verecov identification package is focused on verechip technology a lab-on-chip device that incorporates two important molecular biological systems polymerase chain reaction pcr and a microarray which will be able to classify and distinguish within 2 h mers-cov sars-cov and covid-19 with high precision and responsiveness this is not just the medical activities of healthcare facilities that are being charged but also the corporate and financial departments when they cope with the increase in patients ant financials blockchain technology helps speed-up the collection of reports and decreases the number of face-to-face encounters with patients and medical personnel companies like the israeli company sonovia are aiming to provide healthcare systems and others with face masks manufactured from their anti-pathogenic anti-bacterial cloth that depends on metal-oxide nanoparticles aside from identifying and stopping the transmission of pathogens the need to develop vaccinations on a scale is also needed one of the crucial things to make that possible is to consider the origin and essence of the virus googles deepmind with their expertise in protein folding research has rendered a jump in identifying the protein structure of the virus and making it open-source benevolentai uses ai technologies to develop medicines that will combat the most dangerous diseases in the world and is also working to promote attempts to cure coronavirus the first time the organization has based its product on infectious diseases within weeks of the epidemic it used its analytical capability to recommend new medicines that might be beneficial robots are not vulnerable to the infection and they are used to conduct other activities like cooking meals in hospitals doubling up as waiters in hotels spraying disinfectants and washing selling rice and hand sanitizers robots are on the front lines all over to deter coronavirus spread robots also conduct diagnostics and thermal imaging in several hospitals shenzhen-based firm multicopter uses robotics to move surgical samples uvd robots from blue ocean robotics use ultraviolet light to destroy viruses and bacteria separately in china pudu technology has introduced its robots which are usually used in the cooking industry to more than 40 hospitals throughout the region according to the reuters article a tiny robot named little peanut is distributing food to passengers who have been on a flight from singapore to hangzhou china and are presently being quarantined in a hotel using its advanced and vast public service monitoring network the chinese government has collaborated with software companies alibaba and tencent to establish a colour-coded health ranking scheme that monitors millions of citizens every day the mobile device was first introduced in hangzhou with the cooperation of alibaba this applies three colours to peoplered green or yellowbased on their transportation and medical records tencent also developed related applications in the manufacturing centre of shenzhen the decision of whether an individual will be quarantined or permitted in public spaces is dependent on the colour code citizens will sign into the system using pay wallet systems such as alibabas alipay and ants wallet just those citizens who have been issued a green colour code will be permitted to use the qr code in public spaces at metro stations workplaces and other public areas checkpoints are in most public areas where the body temperature and the code of individual are tested this programme is being used by more than 200 chinese communities and will eventually be expanded nationwide in some of the seriously infected regions where people remain at risk of contracting the infection drones are used to rescue one of the easiest and quickest ways to bring emergency supplies where they need to go while on an epidemic of disease is by drone transportation drones carry all surgical instruments and patient samples this saves time improves the pace of distribution and reduces the chance of contamination of medical samples drones often operate qr code placards that can be checked to record health records there are also agricultural drones distributing disinfectants in the farmland drones operated by facial recognition are often used to warn people not to leave their homes and to chide them for not using face masks terra drone uses its unmanned drones to move patient samples and vaccination content at reduced risk between the xinchang county disease control center and the peoples hospital drones are often used to monitor public areas document non-compliance with quarantine laws and thermal imaging at a period of considerable uncertainty to medical professionals and the danger to people-to-people communication automated vehicles are proving to be of tremendous benefit in the transport of vital products such as medications and foodstuffs apollo the baidu autonomous vehicle project has joined hands with the neolix self-driving company to distribute food and supplies to a big hospital in beijing baidu apollo has also provided its micro-car packages and automated cloud driving systems accessible free of charge to virus-fighting organizations idriverplus a chinese self-driving organization that runs electrical street cleaning vehicles is also part of the project the companys signature trucks are used to clean hospitals this chapter provides an introduction to the coronavirus outbreak covid-19 a brief history of this virus along with the symptoms are reported in this chapter then the comparison between covid-19 and other plagues like seasonal influenza bird flu h5n1 and h7n9 ebola epidemic camel flu mers swine flu h1n1 severe acute respiratory syndrome hong kong flu h3n2 spanish flu and the common cold are included in this chapter reviews of online portal and social media like facebook twitter google microsoft pinterest youtube and whatsapp concerning covid-19 are reported in this chapter also the preventive measures and policies enforced by who and different countries such as china italy iran south korea france germany and the united states for covid-19 are included in this chapter emergency funding provided by different countries to fight the covid-19 is mentioned in this chapter lastly artificial intelligence data science and technological solutions like public health surveillance remote biosignal measurement iot and wearables chatbots and communication social media and open data automated diagnostics drug development research robotics colour coding drones and autonomous vehicles are included in this chapter  emerging and reemerging virus diseases of vertebrates bwj mahy brian mahy wj marc van regenmortel hv   it became apparent during the last two decades of the twentieth century that new infectious diseases were increasingly being recognized in the human and animal populations this led to the establishment of a formal committee of the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences usa who reported on their deliberations in 1992 in a report edited by joshua lederberg and richard shope this was followed 10 years later by a second report edited by mark smolinski margaret hamburg and joshua lederberg which appeared in 2003 among the factors they cited as contributing to emergence were microbial adaptation and change human susceptibility to infection climate and weather changing ecosystems economic development and land use human demographics and behavior technology and industry international travel and commerce breakdown of public health measures poverty and social inequality war and famine lack of political will and finally intent to harm the advent of highly specific molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction pcr in the early 1980s permitted the detection and grouping of viruses on the basis of genome nucleotide sequence analysis and in several respects these techniques have replaced serological analyses for the characterization of viruses although it is still important to isolate viruses in cell culture for their complete characterization it is now possible directly to detect viruses in diseased tissues by pcr then by sequencing the amplicon to determine whether a new virus has emerged to cause the disease in fact many viruses which do not readily grow in cell culture can only be differentiated by sequence analysis the papillomaviruses are an example their study was very difficult until the advent of sequence analysis which now has revealed more than 100 types in humans and many more in animals and birds for differentiation three virus genes e6 e7 and l1 are sequenced and if the combined sequence of these three genes differs by more than 10 from known papillomaviruses the virus is considered to be a new type other viruses which have not been grown in cell culture include many caliciviruses and the ubiquitous anelloviruses such as torque-teno tt virus which can be detected and sequenced in the blood of most humans and many other vertebrate species hepatitis c virus was originally described as non-a non-b hepatitis virus because of the severe disease it caused but the virus would not grow in cell culture and eventually was detected in blood known to be infected with the virus by reverse transcription of the rna present using random primers then expressing the resultant dna in the bacteriophage lambda gt 11 thousands of clones were screened using patient blood as a source of antibody before positive clones were detected which then allowed the development of enzyme immunoassays that could detect the virus in blood and so were used to screen blood destined for transfusion saving millions of lives worldwide once the complete genome of hepatitis c virus was sequenced it became apparent that there are many different genotypes circulating in the world with different pathogenic properties nucleotide sequence analysis has also been extremely useful in tracing the origins of viruses for example when hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by a bunyavirus of rodents sin nombre virus was initially detected in 1993 in the four corners region of western usa it was found that rodents inside a house where people had been infected carried a virus identical in sequence to virus isolated from human cases however rodents caught at various distances from the house had increasingly variable genome rna sequences providing strong evidence that these rodents deer mice peromyscus maniculatus were the source of the infection subsequently more than 30 other hantaviruses some of which also cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans were isolated from rodents throughout north and south america each new virus seems to be associated with a different genetic variant of rodent host and all rodents that carry the virus belong to the subfamily sigmodontinae unique to the american continent a particularly powerful tool for the initial recognition of an emerging virus is the application of immunohistochemistry to diseased tissues provided a comprehensive collection of antibodies is available the particular virus or related group of viruses can often be detected for example when hendra virus first appeared in 1995 in australia causing the death of a horse trainer and 14 of his horses antibody against the virus was sent to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc then in 1999 cdc was asked to investigate a newly emerged epidemic that had appeared in malaysia killing more the 100 people and causing disease in many pigs initially it was suspected to be caused by a virus related to japanese encephalitis virus but a virus was isolated from the pigs that replicated in vero cells and reacted in an immunofluorescence test against the hendra virus antiserum this could subsequently be used on patient tissues to study the pathogenesis of the disease and after comparison of the genome sequences of hendra virus and nipah virus they were found to be closely related and are now classified in the genus henipavirus of the paramyxoviridae finally molecular methods can be used to detect new emerging viruses in the absence of disease in the host in 2001 allander and colleagues searched for rna viruses in human respiratory secretions using random primer pcr and discovered a hitherto unknown parvovirus with a sequence related to the bovine and canine parvoviruses which are grouped together in the genus bocavirus the new virus was called human bocavirus and many research groups worldwide have now confirmed the presence of the virus particularly in pediatric samples although it is still not certain how important this virus is in causing morbidity and mortality their method also amplified a human coronavirus from the respiratory samples and when sequenced this turned out to be hku1 a recently emerged coronavirus detected by scientists at hong kong university it is possible that a systematic search of human samples using such molecular techniques might reveal more hitherto unknown human viruses in some cases the emerging viruses themselves have contributed to other viruses emerging and reemerging in the population this is especially true of human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids which rapidly spread following its emergence in the early 1980s to infect more than 40 million people worldwide by the end of the twentieth century because of its severe effects on the immune system the virus leads to numerous other infections in the hiv-infected population for example picobirnaviruses that had been detected in fecal samples from chickens and rabbits were difficult to detect in human fecal samples until a cohort of men with aids was examined and in these humans picobirnavirus was detected for the first time some rare diseases have become common in persons with aids for example the human polyomavirus known as jc virus can cause the rare brain disorder known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml normally the virus remains dormant in the kidney but in hiv-infected individuals the hiv-encoded transactivator tat acts as a transactivator of jcv leading to pml which progresses to death within 4 months after infection other important virus infections which emerge in aids patients are human herpesviruses cytomegalovirus herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 varicella-zoster virus and human herspesvirus 8 which causes kaposis sarcoma hiv is mainly spread through sexual activity between an infected and a noninfected person and is most common in those who indulge in high-risk sexual behavior with multiple partners it can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected blood and is common in persons who indulge in intravenous drug use particularly when needles syringes or equipment used to prepare drugs for injection are shared it is therefore an example of a virus disease which is dependent on risky human behavior for its maintenance in the human population the ability of such new infections to spread in the population has been greatly enhanced by population growth and ease of movement as a result of rapid air travel a dramatic recent example of this was the appearance of the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in late 2002 which spread by air travel from a single infected chinese physician who infected 12 persons in a hong kong hotel these infected persons then traveled by air and spread the infection to more than 8000 individuals worldwide 10 of whom died the virus then apparently receded from the human population in july 2003 only recently was it discovered that the sars coronavirus has a natural reservoir in chinese horseshoe bats rhinolophus sinicus some other species such as himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs from which the virus has been isolated may serve as amplification hosts following the recognition of the human coronavirus sars research on coronaviruses intensified and this led to the discovery in 2004 of two previously unrecognized human viruses one found by hong kong university called hku1 virus and another reported almost simultaneously from the netherlands called nl63 and from yale university called new haven coronavirus the latter viruses probably represent two isolates of the same virus species they are clearly associated with lower respiratory tract infection in children but initially it was claimed that new haven coronavirus was also associated with kawasaki disease in children this intriguing claim was rapidly investigated and refuted by several different groups in japan taiwan and elsewhere and the cause of kawasaki disease which has features resembling a virus infection remains unknown a majority of recent emerging virus diseases have been zoonoses ie diseases transmitted from animals to humans under natural conditions some of the more important of these include hiv-1 which was transmitted to humans from chimpanzees in central africa around 1931 and hiv-2 transmitted from sooty mangabeys to humans in west africa around 1940 other important recent examples are the viruses of the genus henipavirus hendra virus was first recognized through a disease outbreak in some horse stables in hendra queensland australia when 14 horses and their trainer died from pulmonary disease with hemorrhagic manifestations in 1994 the reservoir of the virus was found to be in large fruit-eating bats pteropus spp and one year later a horse farmer 600 miles away in mackay queensland died of encephalitis from the same virus then in 1999 a related virus was discovered in malaysia following a major outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs and neurological disease in humans in their close contact more than 100 humans died and in a successful effort to control the disease 11 million pigs were slaughtered the causative virus was isolated from a fatal human case that had lived in nipah river village and so was named nipah virus hendra and nipah viruses are clearly members of the family paramyxoviridae but have been placed in a separate genus as their rna genome is about 19 kb in length larger than that of any other paramyxovirus nipah virus like hendra virus was found to have a reservoir in pteropus bats and has since been identified in fatal human disease outbreaks in india in 2003 and bangladesh in 2004 other new viruses which apparently have a reservoir in fruit bats include menangle virus a new paramyxovirus which emerged in a commercial piggery near sydney australia to cause stillbirths and abortion in pigs menangle virus also caused disease in two workers in the piggery a new virus related to menangle virus emerged during an investigation of urine samples from pteropid bats collected on tioman island off the coast of malaysia in 2001 and was named tioman virus during the same investigation a new orthoreovirus was isolated from pteropus hypomelanus in 1999 and called pulau virus and more recently a related orthoreovirus called melaka virus was isolated from a human case of acute respiratory disease in melaka malaysia serological studies of sera collected from human volunteers on tioman island showed that 13 had antibodies against both pulau and malaka viruses another important group of zoonotic diseases are rodent-borne and caused by members of the genus hantavirus of the family bunyaviridae these viruses first emerged during the korean war of 195052 when thousands of un troops developed a mysterious disease with fever headache hemorrhage and renal failure with a fatality rate of 510 it was more than a quarter of a century before the causative virus was isolated from field mice in korea and named hantaan virus the cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs in humans then in 1993 a new hantavirus emerged in the four corners region of southwestern usa as the cause of a severe acute respiratory disease syndrome with a fatality rate close to 40 and named sin nombre virus this virus was shown to be transmitted to humans by inhalation of virus present in the urine feces or saliva of deer mice peromyscus maniculatus it seems likely that this disease had existed for many years and was only recognized in 1993 because of a clustering of human cases as a result of a regional upsurge in the rodent population resulting from climatic conditions causing increased availability of rodent food fortunately in most of these infections humans appear to be a dead-end host and transmission between humans does not occur except with the andes virus in south america rodent-borne viruses of the family arenaviridae also cause a number of serious zoonotic diseases in humans the old world arenaviruses such as lassa fever virus have been known for some time but still cause thousands of fatal hemorrhagic fever cases every year in west africa however new world arenaviruses such as junin virus causing argentinian hemorrhagic fever and machupo virus causing bolivian hemorrhagic fever have long been recognized in south america recently new arenaviruses have emerged probably as a result of deforestation which results in rodents seeking shelter in human habitation and brings them into closer contact with people these viruses include guanarito virus that causes venezuelan hemorrhagic fever with 36 mortality rate from confirmed cases and sabia virus isolated in 1990 that causes brazilian hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate including two laboratory acquired cases rabies is a zoonotic disease of great antiquity that has mainly been associated with carnivores such as dogs the virus is excreted in the saliva of infected animals and following infection it moves through the nervous system to attack the brain causing aggressive behavior which results in the animal biting humans and animals with which it comes into contact and thereby spreading the virus infection fortunately due to early work by louis pasteur a vaccine was developed that protects humans or other animals from infection and can also be given immediately post exposure and the domestic dog population in the developed world is vaccinated and does not pose a risk to humans however in some developing countries it is not uncommon for a rabid dog to bite and infect more than 25 people before it can be put down and worldwide there are still some 30 000 human rabies deaths per year using molecular sequencing techniques it is now possible to distinguish the genotypes of rabies viruses associated with different species of host as the virus has become adapted through frequent transmission between members of the same host species in the usa there are six recognized terrestrial animal genotypes in raccoons in eastern states skunks in north-central states skunks in south-central states coyotes in southern texas red foxes in alaska gray foxes in arizona and several genotypes associated with particular species of bat in fact most fatal cases of human rabies in the usa can now be traced to bats which are often not detected when the person is bitten so rabies is not suspected and vaccination is not undertaken until the disease has taken hold many important virus diseases are spread by arthropods and exposure to new arthropods and the viruses they carry is critical to the emergence of new virus diseases dengue hemorrhagic fever is caused by dengue virus which is transmitted mainly by the asian mosquito aedes albopictus and dengue fever is one of the most rapidly emerging diseases in tropical regions of the world there are four serotypes of dengue virus and it seems that consecutive infections with two antigenic types can lead to the more serious disease of dengue hemorrhagic fever with shock syndrome which if untreated can result in up to 50 mortality unfortunately through the importation of vehicle tires containing water from korea the asian mosquito was introduced into the usa and is now present in several regions of the southern states it can act as a vector not only for dengue virus but also for california encephalitis virus in europe the emergence of two important animal diseases has occurred through the movement of arthropod vectors into the iberian peninsula african horse sickness virus causes a disease that can be fatal to horses mules and donkeys and is transmitted by nocturnal biting flies of the genus culicoides these were introduced inadvertently into spain and the disease is now endemic around madrid and regions to the south african swine fever virus is transmitted by ticks of the genus ornithodorus and it causes a fatal disease resembling classical swine fever in domestic pigs it first emerged in portugal and spain in 1957 france in 1964 italy in 1967 and cuba in 1971 through slaughter of infected animals the disease was eradicated from europe except sardinia by 1995 the most recent dramatic example of the movement of a virus vector is provided by west nile virus a flavivirus first isolated in uganda in 1937 this virus uses birds as a reservoir host and is transmitted from birds to humans and other vertebrates by mosquitoes in 1999 cases of encephalitis in new york were found to have been caused by a strain of west nile virus that was phylogenetically similar to a virus isolated from geese in israel at the same time many birds especially corvids began dying in new york state since the introduction in 1999 west nile virus has become well established throughout the usa and moved north into canada and south into the caribbean and into mexico it is not known how the virus moved from israel to the usa but the most reasonable explanation is that it was carried in an infected mosquito or possibly an infected bird in the hold of an aircraft transmission by an infected human seems less likely since the titer of virus in human blood is usually too low for efficient mosquito transmission it is clear nevertheless that once it arrived in north america west nile virus found an extremely favorable environment with abundant avian and arthropod hosts that facilitated its spread throughout the american continent the emergence of new viruses is likely to continue as viruses evolve and find new ecological niches in the human and animal population it is noticeable that most newly recognized viruses have been rna viruses perhaps since rna evolves at a faster rate than dna for which host cells have developed efficient proofreading enzymes it will be important in the future to detect new viruses before they can emerge to cause disease in the population the sars epidemic provides an excellent example before the epidemic only two human coronaviruses were known human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 despite the fact that serious coronavirus diseases were well known in other vertebrates such as feline infectious peritonitis and avian infectious bronchitis virus it was not until the sars epidemic that research on human coronaviruses led to the discovery of three new human coronaviruses  sars hku1 and nl63new haven there are other genera of viruses that cause serious disease in animals but have not been adequately investigated in humans an example is the genus arterivirus which has members causing serious disease in horses and pigs but has not been reported at all in humans this could be a worthwhile area for future investigation another critical factor in the future control of emerging viruses is better vector control when mosquito control was conducted using ddt dengue fever virus was virtually eliminated from the americas in the 1970s but environmental concerns led to the widespread banning of the use of ddt so that since the 1980s there has been a considerable expansion of dengue fever in south america with the appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever there for the first time there is a real need to improve mosquito control measures to control this disease although there are prospects for a dengue virus vaccine this is so far not available finally one of the most important viruses that continue to emerge in different antigenic forms is influenza virus the main reservoir of influenza viruses is in birds and over the past century several pandemics of influenza have emerged the most serious of which was in 1918 pandemic strains usually arise by a process of antigenic shift where one of the genes encoding the hemagglutinin andor the neuraminidase of influenza virus is replaced by one from birds new pandemics occurred in 1918 h1n1 subtype 1957 h2n2 subtype and 1968 h3n2 subtype since 1968 there have been no new pandemics but it is widely expected that another will occur at the time of writing there is worldwide concern that a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 subtype which has caused some human infections and deaths in persons in close contact with infected birds might mutate or recombine to generate a virus which would be highly transmissible in the human population plans are being developed in many countries and by the who to try to prepare for such an event by generating possible vaccines against such a virus and stockpiling antiviral drugs

  stalking new vaccines methods that target the stems of viral proteins could put universal vaccines within reach carrie arnold   palese has spent nearly four decades working to develop a universal influenza vaccine that would replace the annual immunizations required against flu each year scientists have to create an updated version of the seasonal flu vaccine because these vaccines target the hemagglutinin head which accumulates mutations as it passes in an endless chain from person to person the stalk however is less variable and palese has believed for decades that targeting this part of the protein could form the basis of a universal flu vaccine that doesnt need to be updated every year in his vision a universal flu vaccine would elicit antibodies that react against the hemagglutinin stalks of many different strains of influenza thus neutralizing a wide range of strains his first experiments toward developing a hemagglutinin-stalk-based vaccine in 1983 tried to answer two initial questions could a vaccine stimulate the production of anti-stalk antibodies in mice and could these antibodies provide protection against flu palese knew the immune system has a hard time generating antibodies against the stalk because the head is physically in the way rendering the stalk invisible a vaccine with headless hemagglutinin proteins would get around this issue his initial attempt didnt pan out as hed hoped the proteins palese and colleagues made were too unstable yet palese still believed the approach was sound2 although no one knew whether humans could even be stimulated to produce antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk in 2009 palese got a second chance to test his approach that year a new strain of h1n1 influenza emerged out of mexico and spread around the world the pandemic swine flu virus appeared even as other seasonal h1n1 flu strains continued to circulate the arrival of the swine flu pandemic provided a perfect way for palese to test whether humans could naturally produce antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk although seasonal and swine flu strains were both h1n1 viruses the hemagglutinin heads on these viruses were so different that antibodies generated against the seasonal flu strains didnt protect against swine flu even though the stalks were broadly similar over the next year however the seasonal h1n1 flu disappeared as the pandemic strain became dominant palese believed that antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk played a major role in this switch mouse studies supported this hypothesis as exposure to different strains of influenza triggered the production of anti-stalk antibodies other researchers had identified a potential segment of the hemagglutinin stalk where human antibodies might bind3 in work published in pnas palese synthesized chimeric hemagglutinin proteins to show that infection with pandemic h1n1 after exposure to seasonal h1n1 influenza boosted the production of hemagglutinin stalk antibodies4 since the seasonal h1n1 had faded in importance palese knew that the anti-stalk antibodies were powerful enough to protect against later h1n1 infection with these results palese finally had enough data suggesting his approach would work and he made another attempt at building a headless hemagglutinin universal influenza vaccine in a 2010 paper5 he created a synthetic protein consisting of just the hemagglutinin stalk of an h2 influenza viruscirculating seasonal flu viruses had subsequently switched to h2n3 influenzathat protected mice against a broader range of flu viruses than the seasonal vaccine and also against death from disease together with krammer the pair have continued to refine their approach in 2016 they engineered a harmless chimeric virus that in mice elicited stalk-specific antibodies able to target a broader range of influenza strains than the synthetic headless hemagglutinin vaccine6 by making these strange beasts we could show that they could redirect the immune system toward conserved regions of the virus palese says other groups of scientists have been trying slightly different approaches to making a universal flu vaccine the eu-funded multinational flutcore project combines input from academic scientists and pharmaceutical companies to synthesize noninfectious virus-like particles in yeast that incorporate several influenza antigens including ones from the hemagglutinin stalk initial studies showed that the flutcore approach protects mice from a range of influenza viruses7 and the group is currently raising money for clinical trials meanwhile the pharmaceutical startup biondvax based in ness ziona israel has just completed phase 2b clinical trials for its multimeric-001 universal influenza vaccine the vaccine consists of a single protein built from nine different small protein components including parts of the hemagglutinin stalk that stimulate the production of antibodies and other protective reactions from the immune system coaxing the human body to produce antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk however is only the first step in the very long road to bringing a universal flu vaccine to market no stalk-based influenza vaccines are in use and getting any of these candidates ready for the clinic will be a long and expensive process krammer says it will take years to prove an influenza vaccine protects against a wide variety of strains this combined with the high safety of the seasonal vaccines will make the final stages of trials challenging to say you have a true universal vaccine youll have to wait until a pandemic hits krammer says which could take decades as palese began making progress on a stalk-based vaccine for influenza biochemist jason mclellan watched with interest from his lab at dartmouth college mclellan specializes in coronaviruses a large group of respiratory pathogens that includes the viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers as in influenza spike proteins stud the coronavirus membrane as in influenza the stalk of the spike protein changes far more slowly than the fast-evolving head it got mclellan thinking that he might be able to try a similar approach to create stalk-based coronavirus vaccines the stalk of the spike protein in coronaviruses is much larger than the hemagglutinin stalk in influenza and this larger stalk gives the immune system more target points against which to generate antibodies mclellan needed to find the parts of the coronavirus stalk that stimulate production of the most protective antibodies to make a better vaccine using monoclonal antibodies from individuals who had survived sars or mers mclellan and virologist mark denison of vanderbilt university identified the parts of the coronavirus spike protein most likely to elicit an immune response the researchers then turned to a new technique that enabled them to flash freeze different viral particles in an array of orientations bombard the particles with electrons and then use supercomputers to reconstruct their 3d shape down to a resolution of four angstroms the technique known as single-molecule cryo-electron microscopy revealed the detailed shape of the stalk of the coronavirus spike protein which mclellan could then use as a guide to build a protein subunit vaccine but as with the early headless hemagglutinin vaccines attempted by palese decades ago just lopping off the head of the spike protein and using the stalk alone yielded a protein that was too unstable for a vaccine so the researchers returned to their 3d diagram to start tweaking individual amino acids to create a mers coronavirus vaccine that would have enough stability to elicit a strong immune response in august mclellan and colleagues published a paper outlining the construction of a stable engineered spike glycoprotein from mers coronavirus8 although the team has yet to show whether it protects against coronavirus infection different coronaviruses have many similarities in the spike glycoprotein stem which gives mclellan an advantage in designing vaccines for other coronaviruses theres a huge reservoir of coronaviruses that are waiting to emerge he points out and a stalk-based coronavirus vaccine may even protect against viruses that have yet to make the leap to humans thanks to the similarities in the stalks of the coronavirus spike proteins the design of a stalk-based vaccine for hiv however has stalled despite years of effort owing in part to the viruss staggeringly high mutation rate although virologists speak of the stalk of the hiv envelope protein env being conserved thats only relative to other parts of hiv says julie overbaugh an immunologist at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle compared to other viral proteins the env stalk is not very conserved she says despite the mutability of hiv infected individuals often create broadly neutralizing antibodies that can temporarily hold the virus in check analysis of these antibodies from thousands of hiv-infected individuals revealed five targets for broadly neutralizing antibodies two of which were segments of the env stalk following this discovery scientists developed a vaccine that targeted the v3 loop a portion of which lay in the env stalk this attempt fizzled out after they failed to show adequate hiv protection in animal models current hiv vaccines in development use env stalk antigens as only one part of a broader strategy according to dennis burton a vaccinologist at the scripps research institute an hiv vaccine will probably look a lot different than vaccines were used to burton says currently vaccine boosters consist of the same injection as the initial shot if burton and others have their way an hiv vaccine will likely require multiple shots with slightly different components each time to persuade the immune system to recognize not just a small number of strains but thousands or tens of thousands of them despite the many challenges facing the development of stalk-based vaccines and antivirals researchers remain convinced that this strategy will eventually pay off the advantage of this approachthe ability to target a wider range of viruses with less chance of the virus mutating and thereby making the vaccine ineffectivewill ultimately outweigh the time and expense of getting such therapeutics ready for human use although a universal flu vaccine is closest to market it has yet to complete lengthy phase 3 trials whatever the final result the process of creating these vaccines has helped to open researchers eyes to the tremendous complexity of interactions between viruses and the human immune system denison says the work has already changed scientists thoughts on the importance of targeting parts of proteins like the stalk that provide structure as well as bind to receptors im really excited about this approach he says pointing out that many viral proteins have been overlooked as vaccine targets because they dont bind receptors work on stalk-based vaccines and antivirals may provide an approach that denison calls broadly applicable to a wide variety of viruses  etiology and clinical characteristics of influenza-like illness ili in outpatients in beijing june 2010 to may 2011 xiaohua yang yao yao meifang chen xia yang yandi xie yafen liu xiuying zhao yan gao lai wei benjamin cowling j   influenza virus is a seasonal acute respiratory infection and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in adults every winter 1 similar to most other countries the peak influenza season in china is associated with higher health care utilization 2 in china weekly cases of influenza-like illness ili in acute-care settings throughout the country are reported to the chinese national influenza centercnic and are mainly attributed to influenza virus predominantly influenza a virus flu-a and influenza b virus flu-b 3 4 in addition to the influenza viruses other respiratory viruses can also cause ili symptoms in adults such as human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv human parainfluenza viruses hpiv including parainfluenza virus type 4 5 rhinovirus adenovirus human coronaviruses and human metapneumovirus 6 thus multiple respiratory viruses may circulate among adults and cause influenza symptoms 5 there is inconsistency about whether certain symptoms can be used to distinguish specific infections and it is generally accepted that there are no symptoms specific to any viral infection some studies have attempted to identify signs or symptoms specifically associated with influenza virus or other viruses 7 8 but no definitive conclusions have been drawn ili data such as ili rate and ili count can to some extent reflect influenza activity and ili attack rates may be higher among adults during pandemics 9 in china ili data from larger hospitals can deliver valuable information that could be used for monitoring the onset of an epidemic 3 peking university peoples hospital pkuph an affiliated and teaching hospital of peking university is a nonprofit health care institution that provides an exceptionally caring environment for patients and families and extends care to patients of any nationality pkuph receives approximately 2000000 outpatient cases annually and patients from areas beyond beijing mainly northern china account for forty percent of this figure the infectious diseases department of pkuph is a national influenza surveillance sentinel unit some studies have focused on changes in ili when ph1n1 is present however few studies have reported on whether there have been changes in viral etiology and distribution as well as clinical and epidemiological characteristics of ili following a ph1n1 pandemic in this study we focused on the etiology and epidemiological characteristics of adults with ili symptoms after the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic in beijing this research study did not involve any health-related patient interventions the study was conducted in accordance with the principles and guidelines expressed in the declaration of helsinki and was approved as less than minimal risk research by the research ethics committee at pkuph written consent forms were not required and approved information sheets were used instead of consent forms detailed information was given to all patients and once informed consent had been received swab samples were collected and the data analyzed anonymously a human influenza-like illness ili case was clinically defined as a sudden onset of fever 38c cough andor sore throat of less than three days duration and no laboratory-confirmed evidence of another etiology 3 10 ili cases were defined as flu-a-positive ili-cases when the rt-pcr results from throat swab samples were positive for influenza a virus a co-infection was diagnosed when more than one virus tested positive on rt-pcr the study population included adults 16 years who sought medical attention in the fever outpatient service of pkuph a national influenza surveillance sentinel unit between june 2010 and may 2011 data was collected at the time of medical consultation using a case report form for each adult patient who met the ili-case definition criteria data collected included demography clinical observations such as symptoms chronic medical conditions treatment temperature and laboratory test results for rt-pcr-positive patients we additionally used telephone interviews to determine treatment co-morbidity vaccination status and duration of fever all variables and analyzed data are shown in

from confirmed cases tested by rt-pcr is shown in figure 1 influenza viruses flu were the predominant viral etiology comprising 805 237 of the total specimens of the confirmed cases between june 2010 and may 2011 in beijing almost all of these flu-positive specimens were flu-a cases which accounted for 970 conversely two influenza b virus-positive samples were identified among the samples all other viruses were present at a frequency less than 3 hrv and adv in three cases individual 11 of 279 hrcv in two cases 07 and hrsv in one case 04 hmpv flu-c and hpiv were not detected even thought the primers were designed to detect these strains in addition seven samples 25 of the total number of specimens tested positive for more than one virus or were co-infections hrsv-a and hrv in two cases oc43 and flu-a in one case hrv and flu-a in one case hrsv-a and flu-a in one case and a combination of hrsv-a hrv and flu-a in two cases the identity of each virus in these co-infections was confirmed by amplification with primers specific for each virus four of the eighteen patients aged 60 years or greater were positive for influenza a virus for all detected h1n1-positive samples no viral co-infections were observed among the 279 swabs 190 681 of 279 samples were subtyped for 2009 influenza a ph1n1 by the beijing cdc the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza by influenza typing is shown in figure 1 of the 190 ili case-patients tested the positive rates for 2009 influenza a and influenza ah3 were 58 11190 and 47 9190 respectively influenza ah3 was only observed between july and december 2010 and was then replaced by ph1n1 pandemic influenza a h1n1 only tested positive in december 2010 and january and february 2011 according to the chinese national influenza centercnic influenza a h3n2 viruses were the predominant viral etiological factors from june to early january in north china and from late january the 2009 influenza aph1n1 was the most prevalent followed by h3n2 4 few influenza b viruses 17 were observed during the same period in north china 4 a decrease in the number of patients seeking medical attention was observed in 2010 figure 2 in 2010 the overall level of outpatient consultations was less than that of 2009 particularly between may and december from may 2009 when ph1n1 emerged in beijing 11 the capacity of the outpatient service of the infectious diseases department of pkuph increased rapidly the peak in numbers attending the outpatient department occurred in november 2009 from then the outpatient volume declined reaching normal levels in the third month of 2010 the numbers of outpatients remained relatively stable in 2010 the volume again increased during november and december 2010 and peaked in january 2011 in addition a significant reduction in the percentage of outpatient consultations for ili was detected during 20102011 in north china figure 3 during the 2009 pandemic the highest weekly ili rate was 121 cases per 100 consultations in week 44 of 2009 figure 3 the ili rate was relatively stable based on data available from the weekly ili surveillance system of north china in 2010 the percentage of patient visits for ili peaked at 50 in late january 2011 rt-pcr is considered to be one of the most sensitive and specific tests for the diagnosis of influenza 12 in addition multiplex pcr methods can detect a panel of respiratory viruses or co-infections simultaneously 13 in this study pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from ili case-patients who strictly complied with chinese cdc standards 3 the general population in beijing china has been exposed to the novel pandemic h1n1 influenza virus since mid may 2009 11 according to the chinese cdc as of may 2011 136869 confirmed cases and 875 deaths from pandemic influenza h1n1 2009 have been reported nationwide in mainland china 4 14 in this study approximately 294 of the samples were positive for at least one virus which is consistent with the results of other studies in which between 0927 4 15 and 44 16 of reported samples were positive our research suggests that flu-a was the predominant viral pathogen among ili patients in beijing from august 2010 to may 2011 which was similar to that of 2009 2008 and 2006 but different to 2007 3 4 17 18 almost all positive samples demonstrated flu-a strains while few flu-b strains were detected this result differs from that reported from the united states which demonstrated that 26 of the positive specimens were influenza b viruses 19 this discrepancy may in part reflect the epidemic of influenza a virus in north china in 20102011 it is possible that flu-b may not have caused ili symptoms severe enough for the sufferer to seek medical attention it is also possible that flu-b was not circulating in this geographical area during this time according to the cnic influenza b virus-positive rate was about 16 in north china from june 2010 to may 2011 4 the percentage of tests that were positive for influenza which included flu-a and flu-b was 237 which was lower than the same period in 2009 4 17 flu strains based on our data accounted for approximately 80 of the rt-pcr positive cases and in august september and october 2010 and mar 2011 all infections were caused by flu-a alone the incidence of flu-positive specimens was high this may reflect the possibility that our sample collection was biased towards patients exhibiting ili which is a clinical or symptomatic definition of influenza to identify potential influenza cases in other word influenza-like illness case-definition make influenza viruses as the virus most commonly detected 5 18 20 21 a study of human-to-swine transmission of pandemic influenza a virus concluded that the human ili case definition has a high specificity and a low sensitivity for flu-a 22 influenza viruses usually account for a much greater proportion of positive specimens of influenza-like illness in adults than other respiratory viruses during the peak seasons 23 a total of 7 samples 85 of the total number of rt-pcr positive cases revealed the presence of co-infections in five flu-a-positive samples viral co-infections were observed including one co-infection with hrcv in july one with hrv in november one with hrsv-a and one with hrsv-a and hrv in january and one with hrsv-a and hrv in february a population challenged by multiple infectious agents may result in an epidemic and restructure of various viruses 24 rates of ili are an indicator of trends for influenza pandemics 25 beijing is located in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere where influenza typically peaks seasonally once a year and beijing experience one peak of influenza activity and the peak occurred during decemberjanuary next year before 2009 3 26 27 but ahead to november in 2009 17 26 that the peaks in ili and the increase in acute respiratory infections ari are due to influenza is supported by the seasonal pattern of high-probability ili the low level of respiratory syncytial virus infections and laboratory results in the influenza season 23 28 29 during the 201011 influenza season a seasonal pattern in ili activity was observed and influenza activity peaked in late january 2011 in beijing compared with the previous pandemic year 2009 lower outpatient numbers were observed during 201011figure 2 overall the rates of influenza-like illnesses in outpatients were lower during the 20102011 season than during the 200910 pandemic influenza season figure 3 as a result of the requirement for fever in our definition of ili our calculated incidence may underestimate the true incidence of ili in the cohort our study shows that the positive rate of influenza virus was consistent with changes in the ili rate during the same period more than 70 of ili-case patients were infected with p-h1n1 between june 2009 and january 2010 4 compared to the previous year the age of flu-a patients ranged from 18 to 61 years with a mean age of 367 years which is older than the age of 2009 ili-case patients mean age was 234 years 11 in 197 706 specimens no viral etiology was identified or the virus was not detected this may reflect the fact that only viruses known to cause respiratory symptoms were tested and therefore the remainder may have been caused by other respiratory viruses or by other micro-organisms which could also have been additional pathogens in the positive specimens 5 it is also possible that some viruses could not be detected due to low levels of shedding in this study we attempted to identify symptoms associated with influenza a infections however it is widely known that a clinical diagnosis of influenza is not straightforward and it is difficult to find symptoms or combination of symptoms specific for influenza 20 30 we found that cough was significantly associated with influenza a 2 p0001 this is consistent with the results of boivin of ohmit and of monto who reported that cough and a fever38c were associated with a positive pcr test in the influenza population when influenza was prevalent within the community 7 31 32 our specimens were collected during the influenza season in beijing and the cough appears to be specific for influenza in this cohort this is also consistent with the view of call et al who believe that both fever and cough are more specific for influenza among elderly individuals when influenza virus is circulating in an area 30 we did not find any statistically significant difference in the occurrence of fever temperature 39c between the flu-a-positive group and the flu-a-negative group 2 p005 a study that involved all age groups demonstrated that muscle and joint pain and headache were associated with influenza 20 however we did not find any statistically significant differences in the occurrence of muscle and joint pain and headache between the flu-a-positive group and the flu-a-negative group 2 p005 this study has limitations no testing for other etiologies of acute respiratory illness was performed as is generally known respiratory viruses bacteria and other micro-organisms can cause respiratory illness with influenza-like symptoms 5 without doubt other micro-organisms could have been additional pathogens in the positive specimens in conclusion ph1n1 did not affect typical influenza seasonal peaks although flu-a remained the predominant virus in beijing in 2010 symptomatically cough was associated with flu-a infection the positive rate of influenza virus was consistent with changes in the ili rate during the same period and there was a significant reduction in the incidence of ili in 2010 compared to 2009 the findings of this study may facilitate the clinical discrimination of influenza a virus infection as well as providing data and distribution information for virologic surveillance of influenza  phages bearing affinity peptides

worldwide threatening the cattle production and causing substantial economic losses group a bovine rotavirus brv is a causative agent of ncd 1 rotavirus belongs to the family of reoviridae and is a non-enveloped virus its genome is enclosed in three concentric layers and is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded rna which encode six structural proteins vp1 to 4 and vp6 to 7 and five nonstructural proteins nsp1 to 5 2 3 according to the antigenic and genetic variations in the vp6 region rotavirus can be divided into seven groups designated ag group a brv the major viral pathogen for ncd can further be differentiated into 23 g- glycoprotein and 32 p- protease sensitive protein types based on the vp7 and vp4 antigens respectively 4 sporadic outbreaks of brv in china have been reported recently 5 although the clinical course following rotavirus infection is typically short virus can be detected in faeces for up to 3 weeks post-infection 6 some diagnostic procedures such as viral culture rt-pcr and serology have been proved to be useful for detection of the pathogens nevertheless the world health organization recommends the use of enzyme immunoassays for the diagnosis of rotavirus infections 7 phage random peptide library is composed of a pool of billions of heterologous peptides expressed in the n terminus of the capsid protein of filamentous bacteriophages 8 phage random peptide library based phage display is well-developed technology to identify specific ligands of a target protein by a biopanning process this technology can be applied in many fields such as antibody engineering 9 drug discovery and manufacture 10 pathogen diagnosis 11 and immunogen development 12 the current study was initiated to identify potential ligands to brv using phage display technology by utilizing the phages bearing the ligands we established a phage-based elisa the specificity feasibility and suitability of the novel approach were compared to a commonly used

ph 22 at room temperature for 30 min the eluate neutralized with 15 l 1 m tris-hcl ph 91 was harvested followed by amplification and titration in escherichia coli er2738 the second and third rounds of panning were done by similar panning processes with the exception of gradually increased concentration of tween 20 05 volvol in tbst in the fourth round of panning the coated viruses were replaced by

above the od492 values were determined at least three independent experiments were repeated statistical significance was evaluated using the t-test the p001 and was considered statistically highly significant the negative-positive cutoff value was set by the average od ratio of 100 field negative samples and 100 positive samples by phage-based elisa a negative-positive threshold for each assay was determined using the microsoft excel spreadsheet which was generated twenty negative samples and twenty positive samples were included in the repeatability analysis for intra-assay within-plate repeatability three replicates of the same sample were performed in the same plate for interassay between-run repeatability three replicates of each sample were run in different plates on different occasions mean od ratio standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv of three replicates of each test were analyzed the sensitivity of phagebased elisa was compared with qpcr to determine the minimum quantity for the virus detection briefly brv at a concentration of 1 mgml was 10-fold serially diluted from 101 to 106 in dmem one aliquot of each dilution was used for the phage-based elisa assay and the another aliquot was used for qpcr for phage-based elisa the brv were coated into elisa plates overnight at 4c then the wells were blocked with 5 skimmed milk for 4 h at room temperature thereafter the selected phages and phage complex from the phage display library control phage diluted in pbs at a final concentration of 151012 was used as primary antibody and added onto the wells

each sample was analyzed in duplicate in the qpcr the ge was determined using a standard curve the mean and standard deviation were calculated the detection limit was calculated to be 10 cdna copies per reaction receiver operating characteristic roc analysis and spearman test were run using spss 170 to analyze the correlation between ge in qpcr and corresponding od values in the phage-based elisa in the past immunoglobulins have been used to treat rotavirus diarrhea nevertheless application of immunoglobulins is relatively expensive and their side-effects are uncertain 14 it is also reported that compounds isolated from the roots of g uralensis may be potent anti-rotavirus agents in vivo
15 however their antiviral effects have not been evaluated clinically in vaccination although progress has been made in the development of live attenuated oral vaccines improved vaccines are still needed particularly in developing countries due to the unsatisfactory effect of those vaccines 16 at present effective diagnostic tests for screening viruses are important for prevention of brv phage display technology is a good approach for ligand identification of targets and phage-displayed peptides from combinatorial libraries that interacting with hepatitis b virus adenovirus type 2 andes virus sin nombre virus hantaan virus avian h5n1 virus and coronavirus have been selected 1721 in this study we used the brv as an immobilized target followed by biopanning process using a 12-mer phage display peptide library to select ligands to this virus because the viruses were harvested from the cells we performed a subtract panning to decrease potential reaction background additionally we gradually increased concentration of tween 20 to improve the specificity of biopanning the results showed that the titer of the eluted phages was increased gradually data not shown after the last panning twelve phage clones that were able to bind to brv were identified by elisa in contrast the control phages had a negligible binding ability to this virus figure 1 after amplification of the selected phages their genomes were extracted and the genes encoding the peptides expressed on the surfaces of the recombinant phages were amplified by pcr three deduced peptide sequences 12 amino acids in length from the selected phages were identified table 1 phages bearing peptides hvhpplrphsdk ypthhahttpvr or hatnhlptphnr were named phages hv yp and ha respectively the sequence data has been deposited in the genbank and their accession numbers will be provided once available to our knowledge this is the first report regarding the peptide sequences that can bind to the brv further experiments will be focused on analyzing the role of the peptidesmotifs in the infection mechanism of brv we then used the phages bearing the specific affinity peptides to brv to develop a phage-mediated diagnostic assay to brv it is clearly important to distinguish brv from other viruses that might cause multiple infection therefore the selected phages were analyzed for their specificities in recognizing brv and a panel of selected viruses as shown in figure 2 the three identified phages were capable of recognizing brv specifically rather than other control viruses p001 in contrast the control phage complex from the phage library had a negligible reaction with these viruses used in this study as amplification of phage is relatively cheap the specific phages identified in this study may be specific and inexpensive assay reagents for detection of brv further tests are needed to analyze the utility of the phage-mediated elisa in detection of brv from clinical samples a cutoff point for each assay was determined so that dsn and dsp were maximized while the sum of false negative and false positive results was minimized the od at 492 nm for negative sample of yp hv and ha ranged from 0041 to 0153 the averaged yp hv and ha od of 60 negative sample in the elisa was 0129611012645 and 012784 yielding a suitable cut-off od value of 01509820147325 and 0148613 mean3sd and indicated that 99 of the negative sample have yp hv and ha od values below 015 the positive threshold was set at 015 and all 60 positive samples had yp hv and ha od values above 015 the repeatability test was done by comparing od ratios of triplicate results from each field stool sample tested in the same plate intra-assay repeatability or in different plates at different times inter-assay repeatabilitythe intra-assay cv of yp hv and ha for 20 positive samples ranged from 068 to 279 with a median value of 132 171 and 179 while those of negative samples ranged from 457 to 2194 with a median value of 756 821 and 894 the inter-assay cv of yp hv and ha for positive samples was between 031 and 201 with a median value of 124 141 and 179 whereas the cv for negative samples was between 137 and 674 with a median value of 225 307 and 282 these data showed that the newly developed phage-based elisa was repeatable and had a relatively low variation to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the phage-mediated elisa the qpcr analysis on brv detection was set as the reference for comparison of the phagebased elisa results figure 3 furthermore the correlation between phagebased elisa and qpcr was evaluated by determining the area under the roc-curve auc as shown in figure 4 the roc-analysis was very high and comparable auc-values exceeding 09 using either the results of yp hv or ha as one matrix the roc-curve of yp hv and ha was 0923 0914 and 0921 respectively as high values close to 1 of the roc-curve represent a highly accurate test the phage-mediated elisa is a rather sensitive diagnostic approach for brv the dependency between ge of qpcr and od extinction values of the established elisa was analyzed using spearmans rank test for the spearman test spearmans rho of yp hv and ha was 0710 0695 and 0707 respectively p001 this result indicates that a stronger correlation between ge in qpcr and od in phagebased elisa in conclusion in this study we for the first time identified the potential ligands to brv the phages bearing the peptides to brv had potential as good diagnostic reagents for development of a novel and sensitive phage-mediated elisa to detect brv  answering the initial 20 questions on covid-19 january-february 2020 igor rudan   the history of the genus homo and the dozen human species we know of today through archaeological excavation was determined by the fight against infectious diseases it is likely that the species that are no longer around today are largely extinct due to the spread of infectious diseases 1 we should be happy that we no longer live in the times of great epidemics and pandemics that once decimated our species a huge number of people died during their childhood or youth 1 the most severe mediaeval infections killed up to every third person before the discovery of the microscope people could not even know why it was happening to them no one thought that tiny invisible living microbes could cause these diseases people assumed that some heavenly punishment for their sins had come upon them we should therefore be grateful that we are living in the age of this advancement of science and medicine 1 since 1940 many bacterial diseases have begun to be controlled by antibiotics and since 1960 many viral and bacterial diseases have had vaccines developed for them 1 unfortunately we do not have a vaccine for all infectious diseases as we see in the example of this pandemic new viruses continue to transfer from other species to us because history has not ended with the advent of our generation instead it just continues but this pandemic certainly does not look like it will decimate us it could have because this is already the seventh coronavirus to try to make itself at home within the human population 2 it is trying to adapt to us and use us as its reservoir specifically we exist together with this virus on a small blue-brown planet in a vast dark universe we share it with tens of millions of other species they all strive to barely survive more than 99of all species that have ever existed on earth have failed to survive to this day 1 that is why viruses constantly transfer themselves to new species and thus expand their reservoirs they must choose the winning species because they cannot reproduce on their own their survival depends on the survival of the species that is their reservoir 3 humans are currently an interesting potential viral reservoir we are expanding rapidly in population size  from about a billion-and-a-half individuals we have grown to about seven-and-a-half-billion in the last 130 years alone 1 in doing so we are conquering new territories clearing forests draining wetlands hunting for pleasure and reducing overall biodiversity 1 this is making it increasingly difficult for others to survive while there are more and more of us fortunately for us all the first four human-adapted coronaviruses were merely the cause of common colds 2 no-one considered the four of them a serious threat to public health sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle eastern acute respiratory syndrome were a real surprise for scientists and experts these were further respiratory viruses from the coronavirus family the fifth and sixth that managed to infect humans surprisingly instead of colds they were able to cause very severe fatal pneumonia 2 in addition the death rate among those infected with both diseases was truly frightening sars killed one-in-ten infected while mers killed one-in-three both could have caused a horrible amount of human deaths if they spread to the worlds entire population 2 the coronavirus that caused sars had its reservoir in bats which hibernate in caves in winter this is the time of the year when hardly anyone hunts or consumes bats however sars managed to infect an animal from the cat family a civet from a civet it was then also contracted by a man a farmer in guangdong province in late 2002 sars then spread to more than twenty countries and infected more than 8000 people with every tenth infected person dying from the disease it was the fifth human coronavirus but it was the first to kill humans 2 ten years later in 2012 the mers coronavirus appeared in saudi arabia it was passed on to humans from the camels in the desert it has also spread to more than twenty countries infecting about 2500 people and every third infected person died 2 so both sars and mers had a really scary case-fatality rate the advent of mers showed us that sars was not an isolated incident with a coronavirus that we could just forget about but that coronaviruses have become the most significant potential biological threat to our species if sars or mers had spread around the world and infected billions of people they would have caused a catastrophe unlike any other in the modern history of humans in those two cases we were actually very lucky essentially an entirely new virus that tries to transfer over to the human species can spread among humans in three basic ways each of these three ways informs our strategies for epidemic surveillance and dealing with the epidemic once the virus enters the human body it begins to multiply in the kind of specialised cells that it has the ability to bind to in the case of coronaviruses these are the cells of the respiratory system the virus multiplies in them by hacking their cellular genetic code and using their machinery to build its own proteins 2 this multiplication of the virus eventually destroys the infected cells that is the reason for the eventual development of the symptoms that are characteristic of respiratory infections such as a sore throat and cough in the first mode of the spread the virus will jump from the infected person to unaffected people only after the onset of those symptoms such an epidemic is the easiest to control and contain that is because the sick person is soon confined to bed and no longer leaves home therefore the virus can mainly spread to their household members this also makes it relatively easy to identify everyone who was in contact with the person after the onset of symptoms those people can then be placed in isolation quite easily we were fortunate that both sars and mers spread to other people only after the onset of the symptoms of the disease this is why we were able to suppress the epidemics by isolating those infected and all their contacts after the onset of the symptoms this is quite likely the most important reason why sars and mers did not manage to kill remarkably large number of people 2 it is much more difficult to contain an epidemic if the virus spreads from infected to healthy people during the period of the so-called incubation this period lasts from the entry of the virus into the body until the onset of the first symptoms 3 in such case infected persons can transmit the virus by contact to a significantly larger number of people in the days before they get any symptoms that seems to be the situation with this new covid-19 pandemic but even then it is at least possible for every new patient to determine from whom they contracted the infection namely all newly diagnosed cases had to meet an existing and known case in the past this allows epidemiologists to follow the entire chain of movement of the virus from person to person due to this favourable circumstance intensive isolation measures of all those who were in contact with those already infected can significantly slow down the spread of the virus this was done in wuhan that is why test-trace-isolate as the first line of defence and quarantines as the ultimate response both represent a justified containment strategy when people are infectious for others during incubation period both approaches will slow down and contain the epidemic if applied properly a nightmare scenario for any epidemiologist however is a third possibility for the virus to spread in such a variant people become infected and transmit the virus but they themselves never show any symptoms scientists are currently looking for such possible spreads of contagion with this new covid-19 pandemic that is the reason why such possible persons are occasionally mentioned in the media in high-profile articles namely because of such infected people cases are beginning to emerge among the population that cannot be linked to any of the already infected people when people are circulating in the population without symptoms but passing the virus on to others it is very difficult for epidemiologists to do anything to prevent it from spreading among all humans such an epidemic has the potential to spread over time mainly due to such transmitters or carriers who show no symptoms when something has happened six times within a system that is as complex as the earths ecosystem then it is no surprise that it would also happen for the seventh time another coronavirus is now trying to make itself at home in the human species in this case the primary reservoirs were probably bats again we know this because the genetic sequence of this new coronavirus coincides with that found in hibernating bats in about 96 percent 4 this time instead of a civet a smaller mammal or bird has probably served as coronavirus so-called transitional reservoir it is possible that it was a pangolin because in one of them a coronavirus that matched to the human form by as much as 99 of the sequence was found although this is not completely definite either 5 sequence matching is not the only important factor when it comes to viral jump from animals to humans what is also important is how many individuals in the species that serve as a transitional reservoir are infected and how often the species comes into contact with humans sometimes these factors are more important so they can bridge the gap of 2-3 of the difference in genome sequence because pangolins are a protected species and cannot be eaten thus in the chinese province of hubei in the city of wuhan which has a population of eleven million at around the end of 2019 the number of patients with an unusual and very dangerous type of pneumonia began to increase many of them had in common that they visited a particular fish market it was soon discovered that this infectious disease was spreading very quickly each infected person managed to further infect as many as two to three people such a degree of infectivity is quite high and leads to rapid growth of the epidemic we had the misfortune that the disease caused by the 7th coronavirus  covid-19  apparently manages to spread even during the incubation period possibly even by touch this incubation period lasts about five days on average it would be very tricky if it lasted longer because the novel coronavirus would then have more time to spread from an already infected person to others however an incubation period of up to two weeks is not entirely unusual even rare cases who had incubation period of up to four weeks seem to be possible during some of this time the infected person can spread the virus before the onset of their first symptoms if there are infected people who do not develop symptoms it will be really difficult to contain this pandemic until we develop a vaccine in conclusion infectivity ie the ability to move from the infected to the uninfected seems to be significantly higher in covid-19 than it was with sars and mers as a trade-off we now know that the covid-19 case-fatality rate is significantly lower than that of sars and mers in order to answer this rather complicated question it must first be said that nowadays the registered number of infected persons and the number of deaths can be monitored online 6 when the number of deaths was divided by the confirmed and registered number of infected people at the beginning of the pandemic a figure of about 2 would be obtained 6 from this alone one could apparently conclude that  given that this is an entirely new coronavirus and nobody is immune to it  it will necessarily spread throughout the world and infect us all if it kills 2 percent of all people then it follows that out of a total of 75 billion people about 150 million will necessarily die it is difficult for anyone who is not a specialist in this field to understand how such an outcome can now be prevented because a vaccine against this virus does not yet exist nor do medicines the question of the case-fatality rate among those infected with covid-19 exposed a general lack of epidemiological knowledge among the general public and in the media from the very beginning of this pandemic there were people who claimed that the new coronavirus was a disease milder than even the flu but also those who believed it was significantly more dangerous in recent days this issue has finally caught the attention of all the worlds media as the world health organisation reported that about 34 of those infected with coronavirus have died 7 that sounded terrifying to the media and the public but then the president of the usa mr donald trump also made a public statement saying the number released by the who was wrong he said that hed talked to people who knew something about it and that his impression was that the number was certainly below 1 if not significantly less 8 in my guest appearance on sunday at 2 an influential croatian tv programme on march 1st i made an estimate of the case-fatality rate of 05-1 allowing for the possibility that it could even be smaller 9 namely at this point we do not properly distinguish infection-fatality rate from case-fatality rate so once that insights into seroprevalence become available they may even bring this estimate further down however both president trump and who are actually right each in their own way which shows best how difficult it is for many people to keep track of what is really going on because of their lack of knowledge of the epidemiology in the beginning of every epidemic of a new virus the virus has to jump over from animals to humans and then from humans to humans that can be quite difficult therefore the virus will be more likely to successfully infect those with a weakened immune system who will find it more difficult to reject it because of this the first patients are often people who are either older or already have some underlying illnesses that make them more vulnerable they end up in a hospital where at that point no one suspects that pneumonia that they are experiencing may have an epidemic potential then they infect other hospital patients and some health care professionals the latter can then spread the disease to other patients in the hospital  mainly to those most susceptible such as those ailing or immunocompromised treated for serious illnesses or the elderly this is the reason why the case-fatality rate among all covid-19 patients was initially very high in wuhan and later in italy many people died of covid-19 infections in hospitals and they were mostly very old and sick people 10 in the meantime the virus has started to spread among the general population  in the community and outside of hospitals it has infected many people who are otherwise healthy and had a much better immune response a large number of these people would have thought that they had a cold or the flu and perhaps even a more severe flu they were just resting at home and letting those respiratory infections run their course considering that it was flu season in wuhan at the time of the outbreak and the media reported that a strange epidemic was causing many deaths in wuhans hospitals it is quite likely that many wuhan residents who were infected with the coronavirus stayed home and treated themselves few people would choose to go to the hospital to test whether their flu-like symptoms were caused by the novel coronavirus when a deadly epidemic was spreading there only the few who have struggled with fevers and symptoms for more than eight or nine days sought help from wuhan hospitals in china there is typically no primary health care and family medicine as we know it but there are large hospitals in their huge cities where patients report directly that is the most likely explanation as to why the case-fatality rate among patients at wuhan hospitals at the beginning of the epidemic was so frighteningly high it is not the epidemic seemed even more dangerous at first as it created a great deal of pressure on hospital intensive care units which were unprepared for this infection as a result all severely ill patients could not receive intensive care this further increased the case-fatality rate at the beginning of the epidemic that is why the chinese have started building the two new hospitals they wanted to ensure a sufficient capacity to provide intensive care also they needed to move all those infected with covid-19 away from other seriously ill people who were sick from other diseases and at the highest risk of dying if they became infected based on this it should be understood that the total number of those infected with covid-19 in wuhan could have been much higher than what was confirmed by their health statistics specifically only those with coronaviruses who were eventually admitted to the hospital were confirmed to be infected and were tested for the new virus there they are by no means representative of all those infected with the new coronavirus in wuhan therefore the early estimates of case-fatality rates in wuhan cannot be extrapolated even to all those with confirmed coronavirus infection in wuhan let alone would they be representative of the entire population of wuhan for those reasons it is wrong to look at the number of deaths and the number of confirmed infected cases and divide those two numbers and draw any conclusions 11 if all the reported deaths are divided by the total number of people with confirmed infection then both the numerator and the denominator are wrong when it comes to calculating the actual case-fatality rate even deaths in the numerator would be wrong this is because we monitor the confirmed infected and those who have died in real time a great many infected people have not even had a chance to either recover or die so the number of deaths in the numerator is an underestimate some of the people who are presently in intensive care are expected to die in several days weeks maybe even months this is why the number of deaths that corresponds to the number presently infected will inevitably increase over time therefore some future number of deaths as the numerator will increasingly correspond to the current number of registered infected persons as the denominator as a result the case-fatality rate of deaths among those with confirmed infection will then no longer be 2 or 3 percent but it may increase quite considerably over time  perhaps to 6-7 percent or even more therefore to simply say that about 34 of those confirmed to have been infected so far have died is not really wrong in itself which is what the world health organisation did but it missed explaining that this case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is quite unrepresentative of the mortality rate among all those who were infected 11 the true rate should be much lower it would not surprise me as an epidemiologist if it is up to ten times smaller perhaps even more 11 depending on the actual true number of infected people which should be used as a denominator this could ultimately make covid-19 a less deadly disease even than the common flu given that the virus is new and unknown this is a key question unfortunately the possibility that this virus is quite different from other known viruses must also be allowed it may be that the case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is only 3 to 5 times higher than the infection-fatality rate ie the number of deaths among all infected people so it may not be ten or thirty times higher as many epidemiologists would expect the only thing we can be reasonably sure of is that the number of confirmed infected people was not equal to the number of all infected people in wuhan the current global totals of confirmed infected and fatalities for covid-19 are still largely determined by what happened in wuhan at the beginning of the epidemic this is because about two-thirds of cases worldwide still originate in wuhan to this day 6 that is why i have already explained on sunday at 2 tv programme that the case-fatality rate among those who were confirmed to be infected is not so important it is only a subset of the patients with the most severe symptoms we need to find out what is the case-fatality rate among all infected people however no one can know that at this time because a random sample of at least 100 000 wuhan residents would need to be tested for this then the presence of antibodies against coronaviruses should be detected this is how we measure seroprevalence 3 this would allow us to estimate the number of people in wuhan who got over the infection with the novel coronavirus without ever seeing a doctor so far no one has conducted these studies because the health system was preoccupied with diagnosing and treating the epidemic of covid-19 in hospitals and struggled with it it is now understood that during some days of the wuhan outbreak there were not enough tests for all those who reported to hospitals with symptoms however additional lines of evidence are beginning to emerge the first is the report of an international panel of experts who visited china 12 they looked at the cases across china that were reported after february the 1st at this point the identification of those infected was significantly improved also hospitals were better prepared for the epidemic case-fatality rate of all cases that came under health surveillance and were tested dropped to about 07 12 for anyone who may remain skeptical of chinas data the first reports have recently been provided by south korean authorities that country has really led by example in proactively testing people seeking out all those infected and their contacts isolating them and treating them in their analyses to date case-fatality rate of all infected people has been slightly above 06 13 both of those estimates could still increase albeit not substantially if they also included those who will likely die over time and are currently counted as infected still at such a low case-fatality rate there should not be many additional deaths in fact it is more likely that many infected people remained undiagnosed and that the case-fatality rate is actually even lower 11 another interesting recent new source is the study of more than 1000 hospitalized covid-19 patients who were followed up until the very end of the infection this sample has been collected from more than 500 chinese hospitals and the result was published recently in a leading medical journal 14 this analysis quoted their overall case-fatality rate to be about 14 however it did not include all those infected again but rather those who requested hospital treatment 14 therefore it should still be possible that the infection-fatality rate is at least two to three times smaller among all those who were infected with the novel coronavirus thus it appears that data from very different and increasingly reliable sources are starting to converge to the values which i predicted on sunday at 2 tv show on march 1st ie 05-1 because of all of the above president of the usa donald trump was most likely right to say that this number should be closer to 1 and that he believes that it could even be well below 1 8 everything we know about epidemiology and previous pandemics gives us hope that this should be the case the virus will not succeed in infecting everyone for a number of reasons our first line of defence consists of anti-epidemic measures all those who are experiencing symptoms and may be infected are being tested all their contacts are also tested for the presence of the virus then covid-19 patients and all their contacts are being isolated 15 these measures will significantly slow down the spread of the infectious disease and buy us time it is of utmost importance that the number of patients with covid-19 does not increase too quickly when the new cases emerge more slowly the staff of national health care systems will be able to provide quality care to all patients for the more severe cases they will also offer intensive care in the absence of these measures there would be an exponential increase in the number of infected people this number would soon outgrow the capacity of the health system many people within countries are also protected by their geographical dispersion ie many people live in smaller towns and settlements a large number of them will probably never be exposed to an infected person furthermore as people become infected develop covid-19 and then get well they should become immune to the virus as a result there will be fewer people the virus can still infect at some point the number of susceptible persons that infected people can spread coronavirus to will decrease substantially at some point each infected person will on average pass the virus to less than one susceptible person in time this will eventually limit and stop the epidemic that is the reason we vaccinate even if the virus infects some unvaccinated people it will have very few options for further spread vaccinated people will already be immune to the virus and their bodies will react vigorously if the virus tries to enter 16 many processes in nature are self-limiting in a similar way  forest fires stock market crashes and epidemics furthermore the case-fatality rate should not be directly applicable to the entire population of a country to estimate the possible death toll the first reason is that the virus mainly endangers the elderly whose case-fatality rates are much higher young people and children rarely get unwell and their death rates are much much lower this is why age and sex structure of the population can diminish the potential of the virus to cause a very high number of covid-19 casualties if the population is reasonably young 11 the situation should be taken seriously and people should be cautious but there is no reason to be overly afraid there is especially no reason to panic many people are afraid of this pandemic because they probably think that we are in a completely unfamiliar situation so anything could happen but it is unlikely that much could happen for which science could not find explanations and answers and the epidemiological services could not respond in a timely manner it is unwise for a serious scientist to try to predict the spread of a completely new and unknown virus to the entire human population in the world let alone to predict more specific outcomes still we have in recent weeks collected enough information about the new covid-19 virus for at least some predictions if the new coronavirus spreads across any country over time and manages to circumvent the many prevention measures in place the application of anti-epidemic measures should still limit its casualties to make them at least roughly comparable to the deaths from flu or road accidents in the same period this means that some healthy caution is advisable this caution is reasonable as long as it is on the same level as the fear you may feel when sitting in a car and preparing for a longer trip or when you hear on the news that a more severe form of influenza has arrived but many are wondering why the novel coronavirus attracts such a level of media attention this is because flu has been a well-known disease for decades it comes back every year and we have experience with its manifestations among many millions of patients worldwide we know how to develop vaccines against flu in advance of its season 16 we have even started to produce the first somewhat effective drugs and offer them on the market 17 unlike the flu the new coronavirus is unknown to us we should remain cautious so that we do not get unpleasantly surprised at the same time the most vulnerable among us who are already seriously ill or very old are not vaccinated as is the case with the flu this is why the new disease covid-19 can kill more easily this question has constantly been being raised since the beginning because many are looking at various figures without a deeper understanding of their background and are comparing the incomparable first of all the general public underestimates how serious and dangerous and serious the flu actually is  especially for the most vulnerable the elderly and those who are already ill globally influenza causes between 250 000 and 650 000 deaths annually depending on the strain of the circulating virus 18 different strains can cause milder or more severe symptoms and the virus mutates each year however we try to protect those most vulnerable before the flu season begins by vaccinating them therefore the number of deaths from influenza is reduced by preventive health intervention ie vaccination this cannot be done with the spread of covid-19 this is the first reason why the flu seems less dangerous than covid-19 however it may not be much less dangerous inherently especially during seasons when flu is more severe it is just that we protect the most vulnerable in addition flu vaccinations make it more difficult for it to spread among the population because there are fewer options for it to transfer to the uninfected due to the slower spread new cases emerge more slowly and the health care system has time to deal with them properly especially if they require intensive care another reason is that the number of deaths directly from the flu is several times lower than the number of deaths that are indirectly caused by the flu influenza is often not cited as a direct cause in statistics on the causes of death if it has merely led to the exacerbation of some of the long-present chronic underlying disease these chronic diseases are then cited as the primary cause of death rather than influenza therefore the actual role of influenza in annual mortality is often significantly underestimated it can be several times higher when the causes of death are reclassified at the end of each year based on the increase in deaths from chronic diseases during the flu season the third reason for caution in comparing covid-19 and flu is that we have a much better idea of the total number of people truly infected with the flu than we do about the novel coronavirus this is because influenza is a disease that is typically managed within primary care after which patients are referred to home care only the most serious cases of flu are referred to hospital there is an obligation to report the total number of people infected with influenza in the population to the central registry as well as for sick leave this makes the denominator for case-fatality rate of influenza better known to us than we can estimate it for the novel coronavirus covid-19 has so far been diagnosed and treated exclusively in hospitals where severe cases clustered the early estimates of case-fatality rates for covid-19 included patients suffering from hospital outbreaks which affected the elderly the sick and the immunocompromised this is why those case-fatality rates are hardly comparable to a spread that would occur in the general population from all of this it should be concluded that case-fatality rates from influenza as another very dangerous viral disease have been mathematically reduced compared to the current reports of case-fatality rates for coronaviruses for the three reasons i mentioned the first is because we vaccinate those most vulnerable to the flu the second is that health statistics do not assign the majority of flu deaths to influenza but rather to the exacerbations of pre-existing underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes malignant tumours and others the third is that the denominator we use to calculate case-fatality rates from influenza is much closer to the actual number of those infected while the denominator for coronavirus is not yet known with sufficient certainty from their experience with other respiratory viruses epidemiologists know that all events in hospitals will dramatically over-represent the most vulnerable this is why those case-fatality rates should by no means be applied to the general population however lay members of the public cannot have a good sense of these nuances that is why it is best to avoid comparisons between case-fatality rates for the flu and for the novel coronavirus until we learn more on the seroprevalence of the latter the general public underestimates the risk of influenza for the three reasons mentioned above they are also likely to overestimate the risk of the new coronavirus due to its intense media focus if influenza infections and deaths were monitored in the same way each year the public would realise how dangerous the flu really is and how reasonable it is to be vaccinated against it therefore it still does not seem possible to me at least at this stage of the pandemic to decisively state which of the two diseases is inherently more dangerous to human beings or which will eventually cause more human deaths in 2020 flu will cause fewer deaths because the most vulnerable will be vaccinated and health statistics will not properly attribute many indirect deaths to flu which really caused them covid-19 in turn will cause fewer deaths due to epidemiological surveillance the prevention of its spread and possible strict quarantine it may also have seasonal characteristics and simply disappear with the arrival of late spring when we have no other means of defending ourselves against the new virus all we can really do is retreat indoors and prevent the virus from jumping from infected to healthy individuals too quickly people generally do not have an intuitive sense of exponential growth if each newly infected person infects just one more person each day the number of newly infected people will increase from 2 to 16 during the early phase which does not seem like a big increase a little later it will jump to 1024 infected people from 128 over the next three days and that does not sound so terrible either but there will also come four days in which the number of newly infected people will increase from 100 000 to 800 000 when china realised that the covid-19 epidemic was out of control and that it already entered this explosive phase the authorities immediately cut off wuhan and then fifteen other cities from the rest of the country in addition the authorities ordered that the population within these cut-off areas stay in their apartments and not leave it was an unprecedented measure in human history  tens of millions of people were quarantined for weeks everything stopped 12 however this measure produced excellent results and china could keep its death toll below 5000 although the epidemic caught them unprepared and the virus spread to all chinese provinces a recent report from the world health organisations commission made up of 25 international experts visiting china concluded the following chinas bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic faced with an unknown virus china has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history 12 this may be because on these large ships people are mostly older one should look very closely at the age and gender structure of passengers which would tell us more about the final outcome it is also quite possible that a mutated version of the virus which is somewhat more dangerous could have entered such a pocket such isolated groups can always emerge and the disease may actually run a more severe course there this is possible but not very likely also this case-fatality rate should not be extrapolated to the entire country for the same reason once the virus begins to spread through the entire human species it will continue to mutate it will try to adapt to humans as quickly as possible according to previous epidemiological experiences many of those mutations should make it less dangerous for human health as this would lead to a better adaptation however some random mutations could make it more dangerous to us this is why we need to be on our guard until we get better acquainted with the virus and the pandemic is over it is unlikely that the novel coronavirus will mutate to become significantly more dangerous than it is now but we will only be able to assert that with certainty when the pandemic is over these are very difficult questions to answer until we get more quality data from both countries in principle it is possible that the first entry of the virus into a new country may be through an infected person in whom the virus has mutated into a more severe form if all further cases arise from that mutant then the situation in those countries may initially seem more difficult than elsewhere in population genetics this development is known as the so-called founder effect 19 however patterns of spread and case-fatality rates in both countries may also have many different explanations the reason why the death toll among infected people in italy appears to be very high is because the disease is spreading in small-town hospitals and elderly care homes which were completely unprepared for the epidemic the elderly and infirm are at much greater risk of dying if they become infected case-fatality rates in hospital outbreaks where older sick and immunocompromised people are affected will be much higher than those in the community among younger and healthy people among the first several hundred deaths in italy almost all people were over 60 years of age and had underlying illnesses 20 that is why the case-fatality rate seems so high there but it is not representative of the entire population a harsh flu season would probably have done similar damage if people had not been vaccinated against it but it is also possible that there are many more cases in the population than previously thought because the virus has been spreading for a long time in iran however the situation is unclear so far the most likely explanation too is that there are already significantly more cases of infection among the population than it was thought initially if covid-19 proves to be significantly more dangerous than seasonal influenza then one million deaths worldwide could indeed be expected perhaps significantly more unfortunately such a scenario is still possible in principle with a virus that is new and unknown to us for a variety of reasons because of this all experts in the field including myself are constantly urging people to take caution but without the unnecessary panic in which scenarios could the situation become much more difficult first most epidemiologists based on their experience with previous epidemics and pandemics expect the covid-19 case-fatality rate to fall below 1 when the total death toll is divided by a better estimate of the total number of infected people however the virus is new so it is possible in principle for this specific virus that the number of infected individuals who are not confirmed through testing may not be as large as epidemiologists would expect this would come as a surprise to science and would indicate a different nature of this virus the new coronavirus causing covid-19 is somewhat similar to that caused by sars the sars pathogen however had a much higher case-fatality rate if the total population infected by the novel coronavirus is found to be higher than the registered infected population by only two or three times and not by eg ten times or more then the case-fatality rate of those infected with covid-19 could be significantly higher than the flu combined with the lack of an available vaccine in such a case it would lead to a significantly higher number of deaths than the flu however such an occurrence should still be prevented by measures of isolation of the patients and their contacts as well as by quarantines which are not applied in the case of flu we also hope that with the winter ending and the new seasons arriving seasonality would slow down or completely hinder the further spread of the virus furthermore the virus could spread to infected people in some of its more dangerous forms as well as in milder forms previous experiences with epidemics have shown that mutation into milder forms is more likely but mutation into more dangerous forms or those that are more easily spread is not impossible either 3 in some countries such a variant would increase the case-fatality rate locally compared to other countries or accelerate infection this would put their health systems in a really difficult situation as intensive care units would soon become overburdened with poorer care available case-fatality rate of all those infected would increase further with the likely collapse of part of the health system it is also a very tricky scenario in which many health care professionals would become infected over time in providing care to patients which would make the situation worse therefore currently perhaps the most important citizens of any country are health care professionals who work in hospitals for infectious diseases especially in their intensive care units they should be protected not only from work overload but also from coronavirus infection by their patients with the increasing number of infected people with severe forms of disease the demand for quality intensive care respirators and ecmo devices for extracorporeal oxygen enrichment will become the bottleneck of the health care system the same is true for healthy and well rested doctors and nurses in these wards those parts of the health system should be amplified and further strengthened before they come under increased pressure the worst-case scenario imaginable right now is the entry of some more dangerous mutated version of coronavirus into one of the very poor countries in the world with a dysfunctional health system such countries cannot implement satisfactory quality epidemiological surveillance measures then a more dangerous version of the virus would likely infect a larger percentage of the countrys population relatively quickly panic would ensue probably also a black market for the transport of migrants to other countries then a more severe variant of covid-19 would start to expand uncontrollably and in a whole new way in the event of any of these unfavourable developments all of which are unfortunately possible though not likely an entirely new protection strategy would be required each country will have its own approach when the death toll in each of the affected countries begins to rise so much as to cause fear among the population people will become increasingly willing to undertake much stricter epidemiological measures in such a case an increasing number of countries will resort to a solution that has proven effective in wuhan  ie declaring large very strict quarantines it is essential to buy time in such quarantines so that health systems do not become overburdened we should then anticipate the end of winter and hope that there would be evidence of possible seasonality of this virus it may then begin to spread in a weakened manner or disappear altogether at least until next winter there are at least several reasons for optimism first of all epidemiological surveillance and first lines of defence are currently in place throughout the european union if they work well in most countries it is possible that their outbreaks will be controlled and would not enter a phase of exponential growth in the number of infected cases in the most favourable scenario with this retention this novel coronavirus would show seasonality then it would gradually disappear from circulation among humans with changes in nature characteristic of late spring and summer 3 however this is the most favourable scenario in which the final death toll would be much lower than that already caused by the flu this year however if the front line of defence and epidemiological surveillance is broken through by the virus then governments will resort to strict measures to ban assemblies and organise quarantines as the chinese did several models done in recent weeks indicate that strict quarantine should completely suppress the spread of this coronavirus within up to three months 21 this is exactly what we have already seen in china that is why it seems that one great positive lesson of this pandemic is that humanity today would be able to survive even more dangerous infectious diseases than covid-19 with strict quarantine in which people would remain until scientists developed vaccines in this unusual situation this answer has been revealed to us all finally the tireless work of numerous scientists currently testing over a hundred drugs against this virus as well as at least eleven experimental vaccines should be noted 22 it is not impossible that some existing medicines may show some effect and be repurposed to treat covid-19 also vaccines should become available over time in this unusual situation emergence of an effective drug or a vaccine could make a sudden and important difference we should try to find something good in all the bad things that seem to be happening many people may finally realise how dangerous flu is more of them may start getting vaccinated against it each year the flu kills between 250 000 and 650 000 people worldwide 18 in china which is one-sixth of the worlds population the death toll from covid-19 could be stopped below 5000 by the wuhan quarantine if all other countries could implement anti-epidemic measures like china then the death toll from covid -19 could be at most six times higher ie up to 30 000 that would be ten times fewer deaths than the total number of deaths caused annually by seasonal influenza unfortunately many countries will not be able to follow chinas example closely and will have uncontrolled outbreaks if the warmer season does not stop the spread of the virus furthermore if the virus continues to spread throughout 2020 it will demonstrate in a very cruel way how well the leadership and public health systems of individual countries function it will be possible to produce performance charts for each country in controlling this new infectious disease given the population size and age structure these will be very important lessons to learn in preparation for a future pandemic which could be even more dangerous additionally viruses generally spread by contact this means that it is good to be reminded that hands should be regularly and properly washed during epidemics and touching surfaces that many people touch should be avoided knobs handrails atms shaking hands should also be avoided and we should keep at least two steps away from people who have symptoms of respiratory infections it is also advisable to regularly ventilate all living quarters it is also helpful to strengthen personal immunity with sufficient sleep exercise and good nutrition we all hope at this point march 7 2020 that there would be very few i explained why it is no surprise that after the previous six coronaviruses the seventh has now also managed to infect humans nor is its spread rate a surprise as there are both more and less infectious respiratory viruses 3 it would be somewhat surprising for epidemiologists if the total number of infected people in the population was not significantly higher than the number of registered infected people in such occurrence case-fatality rate would indeed become significantly higher than that of the flu we should continue to await the information of well-conducted studies on this key question perhaps the biggest surprises so far have been related to the clinical course of covid-19 rather than its epidemiology for now clinicians in china have reported that registered infected people report to the hospital rather late on average after as many as 9-12 days of home care 23 this may reflect their fear of being admitted to the hospital during an epidemic but it may also be an interesting feature of an illness with slow development in comparison to other respiratory infections furthermore fever does not appear to always accompany other symptoms of the disease in the first few days making it difficult to identify possibly contagious cases by controlling peoples temperatures 23 the media has also reported on the possible return of the virus after suffering from the infection in some cases 24 for now it is hard to know how common these cases are and how many exceptions there are it is often wise to rest well after many viral respiratory infections to allow the body to recover after the infection has ended it is unknown whether this infection can return if the immune system has not completely removed the virus from the body but with all new and unknown viruses such surprises are possible so one should be careful until the pandemic is over in all the answers provided in this editorial i endeavoured to convey the most likely scientific explanations for the abundant information that is published about covid-19 in the domestic and international media over time some of the likely scientific explanations may need to be modified in the light of new information one should not forget that this is a new and unknown virus therefore surprises and deviations from the expected scenarios are in principle possible that is why i emphasise that caution is needed but not panic the community of scientists and health experts will continue to closely monitor the further development of the pandemic obviously we need to prepare for a very serious flu-like illness against which no-one will be able to be vaccinated against for quite a while therefore elderly people and those with underlying illnesses should be extremely careful because the infection is the most dangerous for them having gained our first knowledge of covid-19 we now need to concentrate on preventing the spread of the virus and buying time until the arrival of warmer days then we might be lucky enough to see the virus slowly disappearing due to seasonality unfortunately we cannot know that right now from everything written here it should be understood that all measures of active searching and the isolation of affected patients and their contacts are justified these also include bans on gathering together larger groups of people as well as possible quarantine if the epidemic starts to elude epidemiological control particularly older people should be looked after because the probability of a bad outcome increases significantly with age in addition those with heart disease diabetes or undergoing cancer treatment should take special care  ribavirin a drug active against many viruses with multiple effects on virus replication and propagation molecular basis of ribavirin resistance stphanie beaucourt marco vignuzzi   ribavirin rbv is a synthetic guanosine analog with a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity it is clinically effective against several viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus 1 several hemorrhagic fever viruses 2 3 4 and hcv when combined with pegylated interferon- 5 moreover it is effective against a large panel of rna and dna virus infections in vitro summarized in table 1
 nevertheless the mechanisms of action of ribavirin are still under scrutiny appearing to differ depending on the virus in question and the cell line used for study of the proposed mechanisms two indirectly affect the virus one of them is based on the inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase impdh by ribavirin-5-monophosphate which leads to the depletion of intracellular gtp pools the second one proposed postulates that unphosphorylated rbv has immunomodulatory effects on antiviral cellular responses enhancing the t-helper type 1 over type 2 responses or upregulating the interferon-stimulated response element in addition three direct mechanisms have been proposed first by inhibition of the viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp through direct interaction with ribavirin-5-triphosphate second by interfering with rna capping activity although this has not been extensively studied or demonstrated in recent years and third by increasing viral mutation rates through the misincorporation of rbv into the genome leading to population extinction 6 here we will review recent studies on rbv effects on viral replication and propagation in vitro and in vivo and the molecular basis of ribavirin resistance although rbv has enough antiviral benefit against some viruses to warrant its clinical use despite its in vivo mechanisms remaining unclear it is possible that this lack of knowledge results in suboptimal targeting and efficacy the standard treatment against non-genotype 1 hcv until the recent emergence of small molecule direct acting antivirals has been a combination of pegylated interferon- and rbv although neither drug seems to have direct effects on the virus in this regard rbv enhances the pstat4 and ifn- response of natural killer cells to ifn- stimulation 20 by assessing rbv physiological levels in mono-infected and hiv co-infected patients one study correlated lower response rates of hiv-infected patients with lower rbv bioavailability 21 interestingly this combined therapy was surprisingly effective against disseminated human papillomavirus infection in a patient having previously undergone treatment for psoriasis 22 in hiv-hcv co-infected patients 23 as well as in a patient with acquired aplastic anemia 24 in hcv infected patients undergoing rbv monotherapy only a moderate and transient antiviral effect is observed a lack of clear and direct inhibitorymutagenic effects of rbv on hcv in vivo is thought to be a question of physiological concentrations of the drug or an issue of sampling the wrong compartment blood versus liver however in recent studies rbv was found to induce significantly more g-to-a and c-to-u transitions a genetic signature that is indicative of ribavirin-induced mutagenesis 25 26 whether the effect is sufficiently strong to be of benefit is not yet determined for other clinical infections rbv monotherapy remains the treatment of choice for example in transplant patients treated for hepatitis e infection rbv therapy ensures a sustained virologic response in most patients as a first-line or as a second and prolonged therapy 27 it is also a well-tolerated option to treat respiratory syncytial virus infections in immunocompromised patients 28 as the only antiviral treatment against crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever it appears to be beneficial when administrated early with decreased severity and fatality rates 29 in a preliminary study combination treatment was also shown to be effective against rhinovirus rv in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia who are more susceptible to rv infections 30 to explore an intervention strategy for the recently identified  coronavirus isolate hcov-emc2012 treatment of rhesus macaques with rbv alone reduced virus replication in combination with interferon-2b treatment was even more effective and permitted lower doses that are in line with clinical use 31 finally rbv was shown to have protective potential against lethal hantavirus pulmonary syndrome after intranasal exposure of hamsters to andes virus where the presence of live virus was reduced or abolished in serum 32 a number of rbv resistant variants have been either generated or isolated within the picornaviridae family all mapping to the rdrp and for many of them resistance was accompanied by increased fidelity table 2
 the first ribavirin-resistant poliovirus variant contained g64s in the rdrp 33 which led to the generation of four other rbv-resistant variants at this amino acid position g64a lv and t 34 these variants resist the effects of several mutagens through increased replication fidelity mutations similar to those in poliovirus g64r and g64t were generated in human enterovirus 71 hev71 that confer resistance to rbv and increased fidelity 35 recently a fmdv mutagen-resistant rdrp variant was isolated using another mutagenic compound 5-fluorouracil 5-fu this r84h variant is also resistant to rbv and to a third mutagen 5-azacytidine azc as would be expected of high fidelity viruses 36 a naturally occurring rdrp variant a372v of coxsackie virus b3 is also resistant to these three mutagens through increased fidelity 37 yet another high fidelity hev71 rdrp variant l123f was selected under rbv passage 38 within the togaviridae family the polymerase mutant c483y of chikungunya virus was isolated using mutagenic passaging in rbv and 5-fu 39 which demonstrates higher replication fidelity for hcv ribavirin resistant mutations in the ns5a protein were first described using a replicon system 40 more recently resistant populations were isolated by serially passaging j6jfh1 virus in rbv which present dozens of mutations throughout the genome that could be responsible including in the rdrp but the precise determinant is not known 41 in a later study they confirmed that this population is also resistant to 5-fu supporting increased fidelity as the mechanism behind its resistance 42 in some cases however the precise mechanisms of resistance remain unclear and fidelity may or may not be involved in the orthomyxoviridae an influenza a virus variant d27n in the pb1 catalytic subunit of the viral replicase was isolated that displays higher activity than wild type virus in the presence of rbv as well as of an inhibitor of purine biosynthesis methotrexate 7 the authors suggest that this residue is involved in nucleotide recognition but whether resistance results from increased fidelity or from increased processivity remains to be determined recently another ribavirin-resistant fmdv polymerase variant a38v and a mutant carrying four rdrp amino acid substitutions called damm were isolated but do not tolerate 5-fu or azc treatment 43 these variants have rbv-specific resistance profiles similar to the first rbv-resistant fmdv polymerase variant m296i 44 45 suggesting that increased fidelity is not the basis of their resistance whereas rbv resistant variants have been widely reported and are more readily isolated by mutagen screening some rbv sensitive variants have also been recently isolated or generated a dozen variants in different residue positions of coxsackie virus b3 polymerase and several variants of the same rdrp residue of chikungunya and sindbis virus are more sensitive to base analog mutagens because of their reduced polymerase fidelity further confirming the mutagenic affect of rbv on rna viruses 37 46 47 in the case of coronaviruses cov a hyper-sensitive exon-mutant has generated interesting data in recent years given that coronaviruses have the largest rna genomes they would expectedly be hyper-sensitive to rna mutagens such as rbv however this did not seem to be the case following the discovery of a potential 3-to-5 exoribonuclease exon proofreading activity of the nsp14 48 it was hypothesized that deletion of this activity would result in rbv sensitivity this hypothesis was validated using murine hepatitis virus mhv and sars-cov exon-mutants treated with rbv or 5-fu 49 in the last few years in vitro studies on rbv have sought to identify which mechanisms are most contributing to the observed antiviral effect it appears that in many cases this pleiotropic compound is simply being true to its pleiotropic nature a significant recent advance and complication toward this goal is the variability observed between cell types and tissues in rbv uptake and metabolism that could impact the efficacy of a drug being administered with one mechanism in mind while another mechanism is ultimately at work future research requires a better validation of these mechanisms depending on the cell system used especially in the case of hcv the most important goal is to determine how ribavirin treatment affects the virus in vivo to more properly tailor treatments and identify alternative compounds with similar effects currently the use of animal models to bridge laboratory and clinical studies are relatively scarce additionally the recently isolated rbv-resistant and sensitive variants represent new tools to improve the efficacy of current mutagenic compounds and to identify new compounds with previously unknown antiviral mutagenic activity for example the isolation of the same coxsackie virus b3 rdrp variant a372v in two independent screens for rna mutagen and amiloride resistance led to the discovery of a previously unknown indirect mutagenic activity for the latter class of compounds 37 this is especially relevant in this era of combination therapies where drugs with different modes of action are needed whether they are inhibitors or mutagens papers of particular interest published within the period of review have been highlighted as of special interest of outstanding interest

viruses including the seasonality of the viruses in the northern uae for over 2 years we collected both upper and lower respiratory specimens for the analysis from all the patients who visited the sheikh khalifa specialty hospital sksh with acute respiratory illness between november 2015 and february 2018 physicians were frequently encouraged throughout the year via sms and emails to perform viral realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rrtpcr tests to diagnose suspected acute ari cases an ari was defined as the simultaneous occurrence of at least one respiratory symptom or sign cough purulent sputum sore throat nasal congestion rhinorrhea dyspnea wheezing or injected tonsils and at least one of the following systemic symptoms fever chills myalgia or malaise enrolled cases were categorized into three age groups pediatric under 15 years of age adult 15 to 64 years of age elderly at least 65 years of age and several variables were collected on clinical characteristics including sex age and hospital admission status if a patient was found to have the same virus two times separately within 3 weeks then the infection was defined as a continuation of the previous episode of illness a multiplex rrtpcr kit anyplex rv16 seegene seoul south korea was used to detect respiratory viruses the rrtpcr test targeted human adenovirus hadv flu a and b respiratory syncytial virus rsv human parainfluenza viruses hpiv 1 to 4 human rhinovirus hrv human metapneumovirus hmpv human enterovirus hev human coronavirus hcov229e covnl63 covoc43 and human bocavirus hbov additional rrtpcr testing was performed to identify the subtypes of flu a using a commercial kit allplex respiratory panel 1 seegene seoul south korea with the capability to differentiate flu a virus subtypes ah1n1 ah3n2 and ah1n1pdm09 and rsv a and b viruses we used the edwards harmonic technique method to measure the peaktolow ratio15 16 the edwards technique is a geometrical model which is an approach that fits a sine curve to a time series of frequencies by the use of ordinary regression methods the peaktolow ratio was interpreted as a measure of relative risk that compares the month with the highest incidence peak with the month with the lowest incidence low or trough15 the positivity rates for respiratory viruses during the discrete peak and low periods were compared using a direct method 2test to analyze statistical significance17 we applied the chisquared 2 test and fishers exact test to paired nominal data student t test was applied to analyze the means of continuous data a twosided alpha level of 005 defined statistical significance all comparative statistical analyses were conducted using spss version 180 software spss inc chicago il informed consent was waived as our study did not include any intervention that could change clinical decisions or the clinical courses of patients the institutional review board of sksh and research ethical committee of ministry of health in dubai granted ethical and regulatory approval this study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards noted in the declaration of helsinki and its later amendments in total 1362 respiratory samples were taken from 733 538 male and 629 462 female patients of these patients 1346 988 visited the emergency department and 16 12 visited the outpatient department the numbers of cases in the pediatric adult and elderly groups were 198 145 718 527 and 446 328 respectively table 1 the median age was 50 years 95 confidence interval ci 4070 400 years 95 ci 380410 and 770 years 95 ci 750780 for the pediatric adult and elderly groups a nasopharyngeal swab was the most frequently used method for specimen collection 1316 specimens 966 a total of 46 specimens were taken by sputum collection and bronchoalveolar lavage a total of 386 285 patients with ari were admitted regardless of whether the presence of any respiratory virus had been confirmed the elderly group showed a higher overall admission rate than the other two groups 198446 444 cases in the elderly group vs 190916 207 cases in the other groups p  001 the overall positivity rate for respiratory viruses was 372 5071362 there was no significant difference in the positivity rate between men and women 277733 378 vs 230629 366 respectively p  065 the positivity rate in the pediatric group 102198 515 was higher than that in the adult 291718 405 p  0007 and elderly 114446 256 p  001 groups among the viruspositive cases the admission rate was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the other two age groups 35114 307 positive cases vs 34393 87 positive cases p  001 however the admission rate did not differ significantly between viruspositive cases in the pediatric and adult groups 9102 88 vs 25291 86 p  094 the positivity rate for flu was 200 2731362 flu was the most commonly detected virus among all of the respiratory viruses 273507 538 detected viruses table 1 the incidences of ah3n2 and ah1n1pdm2009 flu subtypes were 414 113273 and 260 71273 whereas the incidence of flu b was 289 79273 subtyping was not performed in 18 cases of flu a in november 2015 flu was the most frequently detected respiratory virus in hospitalized viruspositive patients 3169 449 the admission rate of patients who had flu infections was 114 31273 the admission rate of the ah1n1pdm09 subgroup was higher than that of the ah3n2 subgroup 1163 175 cases vs 7105 67 cases p  0039 hrv was the secondmost commonly detected virus 146507 288 cases the positivity rate for hrv did not differ between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients 2069 290 cases vs 126438 288 cases p  097 nearly 8 40507 79 of positive cases were coinfected with two different viruses table 2 hrv and flu were most frequently detected together in coinfection cases n  9 none of the patients were coinfected with three or more viruses the pediatric group showed the highest rate of coinfection 15102 147 both the number of specimens and the positivity rate of all respiratory viruses increased in the winter season figure 1 the positivity rates were highest in december and lowest in september lowest in 2016 and august lowest in 2017 of each year the flu positivity rate showed two peaks which occurred in august and december figure 2 ah3n2 was the most common subtype of flu and was detected throughout the year the peaktolow ratio of all respiratory viruses was 174 95 ci 133227 and showed significant seasonality p  001 table 3 the number of flu and hrv cases was large enough to evaluate the associated seasonality the peaktolow ratio of flu was 226 95 ci 152335 and it had significant seasonality p  001 hrv was detected yearround and showed no significant seasonality the peaktolow ratio of hrv was 144 95 ci 100234 which was insignificant p  022 ari is highly prevalent and is responsible for a high burden of disease in many countries respiratory viral infection is the most common cause of ari and predicting the timing of peak respiratory virus activity is important for improving disease control in this study the overall positivity rate of respiratory viruses and the incidence of each virus by age group were similar to those reported by previous studies describing the epidemiology of respiratory viruses6 7 9 18 several studies have reported that men are more susceptible to viral infection and have more vigorous immune and behavioral responses19 20 21 however there was no difference in the positivity rate or the incidence of ari by sex in our study the higher positivity rate of respiratory viruses in the pediatric group was compatible with that reported in other studies9 22
 of the 1362 patients included in our study 388 285 with ari were admitted for further management our data showed a lower admission rate for viruspositive than virusnegative patients 136 vs 373 implying a better prognosis for virusrelated aris than that for aris of other etiologies as noted in several previous studies23 24 the higher admission rate in the elderly group is also in agreement with that reported by earlier studies2 24 25
 flu was the most common respiratory virus in all age groups and the positivity rate was 200 which is similar to previous data reported from studies in oman14 26 ah3n2 was the most common subtype detected throughout the year the high incidence of flu and ah3n2 may be related to the severe symptoms characteristic of these infections which increase the likelihood of patients visiting the emergency department many studies have reported that ari symptoms are more likely to be experienced by individuals infected with flu than by those infected with other respiratory viruses in addition ah3n2 infections are more severe than ah1n1 or b infections27 28 flu vaccination could have influenced the incidence of flu and its subtypes in the present study however regional information on flu vaccination is not available in the uae in this study hrv was the secondmost commonly detected respiratory in all age groups this finding is in agreement with other studies29 30 good accessibility of patients with common cold to emergency department might explain the higher incidence of hrv in the uae however the incidence of hrv could have been overestimated many patients tested positive for hrv at the emergency department but actually had bacterial coinfections and their more severe symptoms could have been attributable to the bacterial infections or combined comorbidities like asthma rsv is known as the leading cause of ari1 9 31 however the incidence of rsv among positive cases in our study was lower than that reported in other publications31 32 it is possible that the incidence of rsv was underestimated in the current study because comparatively small numbers of infants and young children were included the hot and dry climate of the uae could also be a possible explanation for the low incidence of rsv in this region rsv is more common during the rainy season in tropical and subtropical areas and is reported to have a low survival rate at high temperatures32 33
 small numbers of hcov hadv hmpv hbov hev and hpiv cases were sporadically detected in our study reports suggest that because of the mildness of symptoms and the selflimiting nature of these infections patients may not seek medical care and this may lead to an underestimation of the incidence of infection7 34 however our data suggest that in the uae like in other temperate countries a diverse set of respiratory viruses contribute to the ari cases that compel patients to visit medical facilities because of their severity because we have reported the incidence of such severe infections we believe that the data in this study will be of value to medical institutions in the uae among the viruspositive cases in our study the coinfection rate was 79 overall and 147 in the pediatric group these are compatible with the values mentioned in previous reports9 however several similarly designed studies showed higher rates of coinfection from 132425 particularly in young children7 22 35 hrv was the most common virus to be found in cases of coinfection with other viruses in our study this finding was in agreement with that reported in the literature9 30 coinfection with flu and hrv was common in our study although other studies have reported a negative association between the two viruses5 36 flu and hrv may have been detected in coinfected patients more frequently because the incidence of both viruses was higher than that of the other respiratory viruses in this study a characteristic semiseasonality pattern on respiratory viral infection rates was observed in our study flu was the main contributing organism to the seasonal pattern the subtypes ah1n1pdm09 and flu b contributed predominantly to the winter peak low temperatures and low specific humidity during the winter season in the uae may be the cause of the peak in the number of flu cases in the winter12 in addition to the major peak in the winter a small peak in august was also observed for flu semiseasonal pattern which parallels the patterns reported from temperate and tropical countries in the northern hemisphere5 8 12 most of the respiratory viral infections including flu are more common in the winter in temperate countries8 however flu and rsv infections tend to show annual peaks in association with the rainy season in the tropical area8 33 37 in subtropical areas previous studies have observed that respiratory viruses including flu peaked in the coldest months in temperate areas38 39 the uae is located in a subtropical area and does not have a rainy season thus we expected a peak of flu in the winter season as is common in other subtropical areas12 however flu in the uae showed a twopeaks semiseasonal pattern which has also been observed in some other regions located at similar latitudes taiwan and nepal8 the majority of the population of the uae is exposed to a dry airconditioned environment for most of the day especially during the summer season because outside temperatures range from 39 to 45c despite this relatively controlled environment the summer peak of flu in the uae could be explained by prolonged effective contact rates because of the increased indoor activity and lowered relative humidity which have been reported to be related to the incidence of viral illnesses40 41 this finding implies the potential necessity for sustained flu vaccination campaigns and repeated vaccinations to reduce the severity of flu infections especially for highrisk individuals nationwide data are required to confirm the semiseasonal pattern of flu in the uae42 43
 our study was subject to some limitations first this was a single center study with relatively small sample size moreover the decision of whether to collect a sample from the patient for viral testing was at the physicians discretion physicians in the emergency department may have preferred to perform a rapid influenza antigen test rather than to conduct a multiplex rrtpcr test which requires a longer time to produce results hence the incidence of respiratory viruses may have been underestimated because of the low sensitivity of the rapid antigen test and because viruses other than the flu may not have been identified even if present in the samples25 44 second our results may not be generalizable to the entire population of the uae because most of the study specimens were taken from patients in the northern emirates in addition our study could have underestimated the degree of seasonality in the uae because the seasonality of viral infections tends to be more apparent when analyses include mild cases that require minimal conservative care for example outpatient care in the primary clinic45
 to our knowledge this is the first study to describe the rrtpcrbased seasonal pattern of respiratory viruses related to ari in the uae moreover the high sensitivity of the detection method enabled the collection of more reliable epidemiologic data to date very few studies have provided such data for the middleeastern region the seasonality of flu was similar to that observed in temperate countries and was also consistent with a semiseasonal pattern of incidence this knowledge can serve as baseline data for more expansive future surveillance studies of respiratory viruses in the uae and in the middleeastern region the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests  chapter 14 bird flu  in the politically sensitive year of 1997 hong kong experienced an outbreak of avian flu when the deadly h5n1 virus unprecedentedly jumped the species barrier from chickens and infected human beings hong kong decided to slaughter over a million chickens and the virus was stopped in its tracks in 2003 hong kong was the epicenter of the sars pandemic which originated in guangdong province the faculty of medicine played key roles in both instances with its microbiology department successfully identifying a novel coronavirus as being responsible for sars hong kong learned from its experience and took action to combat the emergence of new infectious diseases such vigilance paid off in 2009 when swine flu swept the world and in 2013 when a novel avian flu h7n9 emerged in china on may 9 1997 a three-year-old boy lam hoi-ka fell ill he had a sore throat and a fever when he hadnt recovered after five days he was taken to queen elizabeth hospital where he died on may 21 the cause of death was noted as acute respiratory failure liver and kidney failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in effect his blood had curdled 3  all the preparations to entrench medical autonomy in hong kong after the british departure did little to help the freshly minted hong kong special administrative region deal with the first medical emergency in the post-colonial period an outbreak of what was widely called the bird flu which for the first time saw the virus jump the species barrier to infect human beings sickening 18 people of whom six died an inordinately high mortality rate of 33 hong kong gained the distinction of being the only place where this event which scientists had thought could not happen actually happened it was previously thought that avian influenza viruses could not directly attack humans requiring a mammalian intermediary such as a pig wherein host adaptation or genetic reassortment could take place before a virus capable of infecting humans would emerge that was thought to have been the pattern of previous pandemics such as the asian flu of 1957 and the hong kong flu of 1968 which together claimed more than 15 million human lives as for the great flu of 1918 which infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide-about a third of the worlds population at the time-and killed 20-50 million people-there is still no agreement on its origins although the us surgeon general alluded to an asian origin saying some writers who have studied the question believe that the epidemic came from the orient 1 in march 1997 the first signs of trouble in hong kong appeared when chickens on a yuen long farm started to die then those on a second farm started dying and a third with about 7000 birds succumbing to influenza 2 although farmers were concerned health authorities were not too worried because the virus from which the chickens suffered was never known to cross the species barrier and infect humans that is not until two months later to coordinate and to articulate to the public what is going on fukuda said meet public expectations and marshal all scientific expertise you need make sure agriculture was involved dr margaret chan was clearly overseeing everything 19 shortridge himself felt subsequent events justified the cull the last human case of h5n1 disease was recognized the day before the commencement of the slaughter on 29 december vindicating the controversial slaughter policy he wrote it is reasonable to believe that this intervention prevented an incipient pandemic progressing to an actual pandemic and thus a pandemic was averted the h5n197 virus was possibly one or two mutational events from achieving pandemicity however as with all measures that successfully prevent an adverse outcome there is no definite way of proving their efficacy 20 the unusual clinical severity and high mortality of infected patients in the outbreak of avian influenza h5n1 in hong kong was first reported in the lancet in february 1998 by yuen kwok-yung ky yuen of hong kong universitys department of microbiology he was the lead writer whose co-authors included kf shortridge and malik peiris 21 yuen had attended to h5n1 patients and devised a rapid diagnostic test known as rt-pcr used in testing the respiratory secretions from these patients this was the first time that the test was used for rapid diagnosis of such patients in a clinical setting he also analyzed the case notes of 12 patients ranging in age from 1 to 60 whether avian viruses can infect human beings directly or need to reassort in an intermediate host eg pigs is a matter of debate he wrote adding until recently a purely avian virus had not been isolated from people with respiratory disease although conjunctivitis caused by an avian h7 virus has been reported while decisions regarding the slaughter of chickens were made by the government the university played a major role this was known to the outside world as well thus the following year when thailand announced the winner of the prince mahidol award for outstanding achievements in medicine and public health the award was shared jointly by margaret chan the director of health and professor shortridge in the aftermath of the 1997 events tight surveillance of the live poultry retail markets revealed that the highly pathogenic h5n197 virus was no longer detected however the precursor viruses remained including the h5n1-like virus in the guangdong goose identified in 1996 and other viruses in quails live chickens continued to be sold in hong kong but the government after 1997 instituted a policy of central slaughter of geese and ducks for three years hong kongs retail markets remained free of the h5n1 virus 22 but in 2001 the h5n1 virus was back on april 11 the government announced that it had isolated goose96-like h5n1 virus from a chicken cage in the poultry stall of a market but suggested that this mild type of virus would not pose a major threat to public health however the surveillance program of the university detected a new strain of h5n1 virus and the sample was confirmed by the world health organization as having the potential to be highly pathogenic 23 the viruses were initially detected in apparently healthy chickens but not long afterward the chickens began dying in one market after another although there were no human victims professor ky yuen who had been chair of infectious diseases since 1999 and was a member of the consultation committee of the health and welfare bureau held detailed discussions with lily yam secretary for environment and food on measures to deal with the outbreak fig 142  he fully supported her decision to make a pre-emptive move and slaughter more than a million chickens ducks and geese to prevent further reassortments possibly into pathogens that can threaten people the influenza research team established after the h5n1 outbreak in 1997 was led by professor shortridge and included dr malik peiris and dr guan yi as well as ten local research assistants all of whom worked closely with the government to identify new influenza viruses and stop them before they could infect humans the team also cooperated with the world health organization the us national institute of health and other international health bodies 24 yam explained that the slaughter was ordered to avoid the possibility no matter how remote of this particular strain combining to form a new strain that may affect human beings ky yuen proposed a monthly rest day for retail markets when all unsold poultry would be killed and the markets cleaned left empty for the day then restocked the following day the measure was adopted by the government shortridge and his colleagues found that virus isolation rates were significantly lower following the rest day the pre-emptive depopulation decision halted the continuing reassortment of viruses within the poultry population and prevented the emergence of any that could attack humans in 2002 another incident occurred that confirmed the rapid adaptation of the h5n1 virus in early january a new subset of h5n1-like viruses was detected in the retail markets they were isolated from dead chickens subsequently a series of reports were received of chicken farms found to be infected as well as in chicken stalls in retail markets the farms were quarantined and depopulated a total of 950000 chickens were slaughtered with the cooperation of vigilant operators of chicken farms disease recognition can take place earlier before the chickens went to market as shortridge observed it was now possible to have a higher level of baseline preparedness for the next influenza pandemic 25 at the end of 2002 unknown to anyone in hong kong another deadly virus was circulating in neighboring guangdong province propagating a disease that had no name but which was preliminarily dubbed atypical pneumonia in china and later renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars by the world health organization the first cases emerged in foshan city in mid-november it spread within the province to heyuan and zhongshan it was difficult to know what was going on in the mainland especially where a sensitive issue like the emergence of a new disease was concerned no announcements were made either by beijing or by local authorities in guangdong province however the controlled media did at times publish articles from which some information could be gleaned thus guangdong newspapers in early january 2003 published a handful of articles denying the existence of any epidemic but by doing so enhanced speculation of a deadly new disease on january 4 an article appeared in heyuan daily headlined epidemic is only a rumor in guangzhou news express ran an article no reason to worry on january 10 and heyuan back to normal on january 14 26 such articles were meant to reassure the public that the situation was under control and that there was nothing to worry about but the articles themselves were not that reassuring thus the heyuan daily article described panic buying of drugs with long lines at pharmacies it said that the terrifying rumor of a serious infectious disease had resulted in a rush to purchase certain antiviral tonics this irrational purchasing has driven prices of these drugs to ridiculous levels a tonic that usually costs 10 yuan now costs 450 yuan antibiotics have also become more expensive the price rising to 30 yuan yet no matter the price as of 9 pm these medicines were sold out at most pharmacies until yesterday morning there were long lines waiting to buy these drugs with customers purchasing up to 10 boxes each the article also revealed that parents were keeping their children at home rather than sending them to kindergarten in the central kindergarten two classes contained a total of 20 kids less than half the usual attendance the article said kindergarten officials said they had also heard the rumors of a disease but didnt believe it but just in case they added they had prepared a cold elixir tea to ward off any sickness so even teachers who didnt believe the rumors were taking precautions as for the disease itself the article had this to say peoples hospital of heyuan received two patients from zijin hospital on the fifteenth of last month the patients were transferred to shenzhen and guangzhou specialists from hospitals in guangzhou were sent to heyuan to help in the treatment the hospital director said that after the meeting of provincial experts it was proven that the disease is a very common disease atypical pneumonia this disease is not infectious and is caused by changing weather the symptoms are high fever coughing and spots in the lungs this disease is not similar to any communicable disease identified by the government so there has been no reason to report it to provincial authorities so it seemed that heyuan was not able to look after its own patients and had to send them to other cities and had to seek help from specialists in guangzhou also while saying that the disease is very common the article seemingly contradicted itself by saying this disease is not similar to any communicable disease identified by the government there was a mysterious illness about not just a rumor a team of health experts had been sent to heyuan in mid-december and on january 2 2003 these health personnel diagnosed the disease as an infection caused by a certain virus 27 guangzhou is fighting an unknown virus the mainland media reported 28 on january 27 the guangdong health department received a top secret document from a government health committee however because no one with sufficient security clearance was there the document which contained information about a new pneumonia-like illness spreading in the region lay unread for three days eventually a bulletin was sent to hospitals across the province but by then many health workers were on vacation because of holidays to celebrate the chinese new year which fell on saturday february 1 29 the chinese public and the rest of the world was kept in ignorance under chinese law any occurrence of infectious diseases should be classified as a state secret before they are announced by the ministry of health or organs authorized by the ministry that is to say until the government made the information public any doctor or journalist who disclosed information on the disease was liable to prosecution for leaking state secrets 30 on february 8 reports about a deadly flu began to be sent via text messages on mobile phones in guangzhou in the evening words like bird flu and anthrax started to appear on some local internet sites 31 day two major guangzhou newspapers the nanfang daily and the yangcheng wanbao carried short news reports about a mysterious illness that had hit the hospitals in guangzhou 32 the next day february 9 a delegation of experts from the ministry of health and the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc led by the vice minister of health and the deputy director-general of health went to guangdong 33 on february 10 a circular appeared in the local media that acknowledged the presence of the disease and listed some preventive measures including improving ventilation using vinegar fumes to disinfect the air and washing hands frequently responding to the advice residents in guangzhou and other cities cleared pharmacy shelves of antibiotics and flu medication in some cities even white vinegar was sold out the panic spread quickly in guangdong and was also felt in other provinces 34 the information blackout imposed by the mainland meant that the health authorities in hong kong were kept in ignorance of what was going on in neighboring guangdong it wasnt until february 10 2003 when six newspapers in hong kong carried reports on the atypical pneumonia outbreak that hong kongs director of health dr margaret chan and secretary for health welfare and food dr yeoh eng-kiong became aware of the epidemic next door it was also on february 10 that the who country office in beijing received an email message describing a strange contagious disease that had already left more than 100 people dead in guangdong province in the space of one week 35 the global public health intelligence network of the who also picked up media reports of an unusual epidemic of fatal pneumonia-like illness in guangdong february 10 was the first working day for many people after the weeklong chinese new year holiday on that day the who representative in china dr henk bekedam received reports about an alarming outbreak in guangdong province the son of a former who staff member sent an email to alan schnur the communicable disease team leader of who china am wondering if you would have information on the strange contagious disease similar to pneumonia with invalidating effect on lung which has already left more than 100 people dead in  guangdong province in the space of one week the outbreak is not allowed to be made known to the public via the media but people are already aware of it through hospital workers and there is a panic attitude currently where people are emptying 32 pharmaceutical stocks of any medicine they think may protect them 36 mr schnur forwarded the email at once to the ministry of health and sought information he added that the american embassy had passed on a similar rumor about a strange disease that was causing bleeding and many deaths in guangzhou once the hong kong government learned from the newspapers about this health crisis it attempted to obtain additional information aware that previous waves of diseases such as the global pandemics of 1957 and 1968 had entered hong kong from guangdong province before spreading into the rest of the world the department of health tried to telephone health officials in guangdong to find out what exactly the position was but it failed to reach anyone in authority when dr ek yeoh asked dr chan about the outbreak in guangdong she told him about the departments failure to obtain any response to its enquiries he then asked her to contact the ministry of health in beijing since this was the established channel of communication between hong kong and the chinese government where infectious diseases were concerned  fig 143  it turned out that under the policy of one country two systems only the central government was supposed to communicate with hong kong and not the provincial government in guangdong dr chan then successfully contacted the director general of the department of international cooperation of the ministry of health by telephone and expressed concern about the reported epidemic in guangdong the director general promised to look into the matter the following morning the guangzhou city government held a press conference at which the director of the bureau of health huang jiongjie explained the situation in the provincial capital director huang said that towards the end of 2002 atypical pneumonia cases were reported in certain parts of guangdong province to date he said more than a hundred cases had been reported in guangzhou with many of the patients being healthcare workers there had been two deaths despite its quick onset he said the risk of fatality is low there was he said no need to panic in the afternoon the guangdong provincial government held its own press conference health officials reported a total of 305 atypical pneumonia cases in the province with five deaths but they too spoke reassuringly about how the situation was under control although they acknowledged that there were no effective drugs to treat the disease and that the outbreak was only tentatively contained 37 a third of the cases were health workers who contracted the disease while caring for patients that same information that there had been about 300 cases and five deaths in guangdong province as a result of an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome was also passed on to the who by the chinese ministry of health professor yuen kwok-yung head of the microbiology department had kept his ear to the ground to find out what was going on in hong kongs neighborhood unlike the government which did not bother to monitor what appeared in guangdong newspapers professor yuen also known as ky was very concerned about the increasing reports in the media about unusual outbreaks of mysterious diseases university of hong kong researchers were ahead of the government which was oblivious to what hints had appeared in the mainland press they too sought additional information but they unlike government officials had the necessary contacts as professor yuen subsequently explained to the legislative council select committee set up to look into the governments handling of the disease the microbiology department convened a meeting attended by four persons ky yuen the head of department professor malik peiris dr guan yi and dr bj zheng at the meeting guan yi expressed his concern that the atypical pneumonia outbreak in guangdong might be linked with h5n1 influenza as had happened in hong kong in 1997 fig 144  he proposed a more in-depth field investigation to ascertain the infectious agents responsible for the outbreak by conducting a foray into guangzhou to find out what was actually going on and if possible to bring back specimens from patients suffering from this mysterious ailment for analysis in hong kong the consensus at that meeting was that dr guan and dr zheng should try to contact authorities in guangzhou to facilitate the investigation 38 fig 145 as peiris said we knew the disease was going to come over to hong kong so it was vital to learn as much as possible before it arrived 39 guan and zheng were both from the mainland and knew its culture and its people so when a mysterious disease was reported in guangdong it was natural that they were the ones to plunge deep into the heart of the infected areas and to shine a light into the dark corners they left the following day february 11 peiriss role was to supervise the virological investigations into the patient specimens he would also liaise with researchers in other countries yuen himself focused on hong kong ever since the avian flu outbreak in hong kong the department of microbiology had conducted frequent exchanges with mainland doctors and scholars when this mysterious new disease emerged researchers both in hong kong and the mainland suspected that it was again some form of bird flu during their visit dr guan and dr zheng met professor ns zhong  or zhong nanshan a prominent educator and researcher who was head of the respiratory research center at the first affiliated hospital guangzhou medical college dr zheng knew him personally so it wasnt difficult to arrange to discuss the atypical pneumonia situation with him dr zhong who had received his early training in beijing medical university and had done advanced work at st bartholomews hospital in london and the university of edinburgh medical school was in charge of the management of atypical pneumonia cases at his hospital  fig 146  during their visit dr zhong told the two hong kong researchers that the atypical pneumonia outbreak might be caused by flu-like viral infection because all routine laboratory examinations for infectious agents were negative he suggested collaboration between his institution and the university of hong kong and agreed to provide specimens from patients with atypical pneumonia for viral isolation and identification 40 while strictly speaking this could be interpreted as a violation of chinas state secrets laws it also could be labeled an academic exchange between health specialists in the mainland and hong kong obtaining the specimens was in itself risky since it meant direct physical contact with patients suffering from the mysterious disease in the hospital of the guangzhou institute of respiratory diseases the two hong kong doctors wearing full protective gear walked amid the patients all in critical condition accompanied by a nurse some sense of what happened is provided by this account she the nurse elevated the back of the mans bed removed his oxygen mask and ordered him to open his mouth tentatively reaching a wooden stick with a q-tip-like bulb at the end into the oral cavity the nurse dabbed at the patients tongue twice removed the swab and handed it to guan yi he broke the top of the stick and dropped the swab into a vial of medium he didnt say anything but he could already see that this wasnt going to work in order for it to be an effective screening he would need mucus and phlegm from further down the patients throat as well as some nasal aspiration the nurse was too frightened to gather anything but the faintest of saliva samples 41 guan yi decided to take over and so at the next station he asked the nurse to step aside as he held a female patient up ordering her to open her mouth and then began slapping her back gently to encourage her to expectorate mucus this time the swab was pressed so far down the patients throat that when guan removed it it was coated with a satisfactory blob of mucus that glistened under the white lights he managed to take twelve swabs each of which he sealed in a vial of suspension medium so that they appeared almost like miniature moth cocoons preserved in formaldehyde so the specimens were obtained and brought back to the microbiology department to be analyzed by malik peiris and his associate chan kwok-hung   or kh chan in fact dr zhong subsequently said that samples were not given out to other researchers simply because they didnt ask 42 professor yuen kept the hong kong government informed of his departments activities through telephone calls to director of health margaret chan the microbiologist told her about the investigation into the possible infecting agent responsible for the atypical pneumonia outbreaks in guangdong and of the visit to guangzhou by two members of his department and their return with specimens he also conveyed to her his concern that large numbers of healthcare workers were being infected so the university and the government were in close contact from the earliest days 43 munity acquired pneumonia all hospitals were required to report such cases nineteen cases were identified in february hong kong university researchers tried to isolate the virus causing the outbreak in guangdong they were the only ones in hong kong with specimens but then they hit a stone wall the specimens brought back were inoculated into chicken embryo and other cell lines after several days various viruses were isolated including the h3n2 influenza virus a virus that causes the common cold and one that causes respiratory infections called metapneumovirus but there was nothing that was identifiable as the pathogen responsible for the guangdong outbreak because bird flu especially of the h5n1 variety was the chief suspect attempts to cultivate the specimens used cell lines set up for this purpose but they failed a predisposition to suspect avian flu was totally natural after all on february 19 hong kong reported to the world health organization another outbreak of h5n1 when the avian flu virus was detected in a nine-year-old boy whose family had been visiting fujian province when he fell ill his father had died two days previously from an infection with the same virus and his sister had died in fujian earlier in the month but was not tested for the virus the who too saw a possible link between avian influenza and the outbreak in guangdong however by mid-february malik peiris was thinking of testing for other virus groups but was hobbled by the limited resources of his modest virology lab he made enquiries with overseas colleagues regarding techniques for picking up other virus groups such as coronaviruses hantaviruses and adenoviruses 44 meanwhile guan yi and bj zheng continued to travel to guangzhou to collect additional samples from patients but it wasnt long before it became unnecessary to travel to guangdong to look for the virus the virus had come to hong kong the date it happened can be pinpointed on february 21 dr liu jianlun a 64-yearold professor of nephrology from a teaching hospital in guangzhou arrived in hong kong and checked into the metropole hotel dr liu had contact with patients suffering from atypical pneumonia and then developed a fever and cold which was treated by antibiotics though he still felt unwell he decided to go ahead with his hong kong trip on february 21 to take part in the wedding of his nephew after arriving in hong kong dr liu and his wife had lunch with his sister and brother-in-law in a restaurant near the mong kok railway station it was their son who was getting married then he went shopping in central with his brother-in-law and had dinner in his home before going to the metropole hotel in kowloon to spend the night 45 the next morning february 22 a saturday he walked into the accident and emergency department of kwong wah hospital which was close to his hotel he told hospital staff that he had been in contact with patients suspected to have atypical pneumonia during february 11-13 and had developed flu-like symptoms with sharp chest pain on february 15 chest x-rays had showed left lower zone haziness he said he treated himself with antibiotics levofloxacin and penicillin and improved he said he had fully recovered before leaving for hong kong but in hong kong his fever came back and he had shortness of breath 46 the accident and emergency department realized this was a serious case and requested an immediate transfer to an intensive care unit dr watt chi-leung  icu director was aware of reports of an epidemic in the mainland and put dr liu in isolation he also instructed icu staff to put on n95 surgical masks gloves and gowns when caring for this patient 47 dr watt also asked icu staff to take tamiflu as a precautionary measure 48 on february 24 there was an unexpected telephone call from guangzhou fig 147  at the hospital they went over in considerable detail with hospital doctors the clinical history examination findings case notes computer records chest x-rays laboratory results and infection control measures relating to the patient so the faculty of medicine was involved in the treatment of the very first sars patient from mainland china who became known as patient zero an extremely infectious patient who brought sars to hong kong and from hong kong the disease rapidly spread around the world it is believed that dr liu infected 16 other guests in the hotel and through them something like 4000 people in various countries became infected in less than four months as a result of travel by these hotel guests 50 this showed how rapidly a disease can spread in the twenty-first century as long as the disease was bottled up in china its impact was limited to 46 report on a sars patient from guangzhou who was admitted to kwong wah hospital sc2 paper no a80 47 one country but as soon as it spilled over into hong kong a hub of international air travel it quickly spread around the world professor yuen himself participated in the treatment of the liu case he initiated a course of ribavirin a broad-spectrum viral agent which is effective against respiratory hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever viruses 51 despite all efforts dr liu died on march 4 ten days after he sought treatment at kwong wah hospital by then his brother-in-law yp chan had been admitted to kwong wah for exactly the same condition as professor yuen said the illness of the brother-in-law was a turning point since another family member had been infected by the same mysterious illness we had he said a real crisis on our hands 52 time was pressing on march 12 the world health organization issued a global alert about cases of atypical pneumonia it recommended that patients with atypical pneumonia who may be related to these outbreaks be isolated with barrier nursing techniques at the same time who also recommended that any suspect cases be reported to national health authorities three days later it issued a rare emergency travel advisory calling the disease a worldwide health threat it also gave the mystery ailment a name severe acute respiratory syndrome sars for the special administrative region it was an unfortunate choice of names tarnishing the image of hong kong at best and at worst suggesting that the disease and hong kong were somehow synonymous hong kong suggested a name change to the who but eventually gave up such efforts on march 16 who released a list of affected areas with local transmission of sars hong kong was on that list however as far as the who was concerned sars was not named after hong kong indeed the world health body in describing the new disease said it was first recognized in late february 2003 in hanoi vietnam with the sars epidemics arrival in hong kong the universitys department of community medicine became closely involved professor anthony j hedley the chair professor of community medicine since 1988 had focused on issues such as smoking air pollution and other noninfectious health problems sars of course was quite different with its rate of infection and case fatality rate yet unknown hedley turned to imperial college london for help in an email to roy m anderson the head of the department of infectious disease epidemiology he acknowledged that his department didnt have much experience in this area i know your work hedley said could i persuade you to get interested in sars could you come over and visit us 53  fig 148  anderson needed little persuasion he had already been asked by david heymann deputy director of the world health organization to be a member of its sars emergency committee his department had a lot of experience dealing with past epidemics ranging from aids to foot-and-mouth to influenza as it was heymann had asked anderson to join him on a trip to beijing to talk to the chinese authorities about sharing data on how the epidemic started what progress there was and control measures soon anderson was on a plane bound for hong kong beijing came next in hong kong hedley arranged for anderson to meet his colleagues including gabriel leung who established and directed the universitys infectious disease epidemiology group and dr margaret chan the director of health together they worked out a protocol for capturing data analyzing the data and some public health interventions so the department was collaborating with both imperial college and with the hong kong government the department anderson said played an important role in helping the hong kong government construct additional databases of cases their contacts and basic demographic and epidemiological data from the midpoint of the epidemic onwards 54 more trips followed for anderson and members of his team soon imperial college and hku scholars were writing papers together one early paper whose principal researchers were anderson and christl a donnelly also of imperial college was somewhat controversial asserting that the case fatality rate was significantly higher than health authorities had thought possibly up to 55 in people 60 and above and 132 in younger people as the new york times reported this was the first major epidemiological study of the disease 55 the papers authors included seven imperial college experts seven specialists from the department of community medicine of the university of hong kong two from the hong kong department of health two from the hong kong hospital authority and one from the chinese university of hong kong they explained that estimating fatality rates by simply dividing the current cumulative number of deaths by the current cumulative number of hospital admissions was not satisfactory because among patients still recorded as being in hospital it is impossible to ascertain who will eventually die or be discharged 56 because of the public health importance of the article the lancet posted it online on may 7 2003 more than two weeks before it appeared in the journal itself the imperial college-hong kong university collaboration continued after the re-emergence of sars in mainland china in 2004 in a paper where anderson was the principal author the group reviewed the understanding of the epidemiology transmission dynamics and control of the aetiological agent of sars it concluded that the low transmissibility of the virus combined with the onset of peak infectiousness following the onset of clinical symptoms of disease transpired to make 54 ibid simple public health measures such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts very effective in the control of the sars epidemic 57 if the time from infection to symptoms is about two days and the time from infection to peak infectiousness is also two days then by the time a patient reports to a physician its too late to quarantine him because transmission has already occurred anderson explained but with sars the incubation period from infection to first fever is five days the time from infection to peak infectiousness is about 18 days so you had a long interval and if you isolated or quarantined that patient you could stop transmission dead 58 that he said was essentially what was done since roman times with ships arriving at ports and sailors were put in quarantine until they were certain that they were not transmitting anything obnoxious from their travels anderson observed that the department of community medicine which was subsequently absorbed into the school of public health had been transformed by the sars experience what sars did he said was to shift its attention a little bit more to infectious diseases and infectious diseases epidemiology is slightly different-it involves transmission dynamics it involves contact tracing we have a primary case you had to understand who that person has had contact with so it has influenced the way the people thought about infectious diseases and how best to study them speaking of his own institution anderson said we are a very quantitative group with a high computational mathematical and statistical capability so we probably switched them on a little bit towards more quantitative side of understanding transmission and control the paper on the epidemic case fatality rate he said may well have been one of the departments first infectious disease epidemiology papers which was followed by many more when you deal with noninfectious diseases you can take your time he observed epidemics happen quickly and when they start to take off they grow exponentially the sars epidemic had a doubling time of about five to seven days so things were moving very very quickly a very large number of staff in the department was switching from their normal research interest to thinking how to combat and study sars this transformation he said was successful some very high quality work has been coming out of there in the last 13 years he said which has had a very substantial influence internationally as soon as the emergency travel advisory was issued in mid-march the who set up a network of scientists from 11 laboratories around the world to try to identify the causal agent and develop a diagnostic test similar to a network for influenza set up by klaus stohr the laboratories were in canada france germany japan the 57 netherlands singapore the united kingdom the united states and of course hong kong all were approached by telephone during the weekend of march 15-16 and all agreed to participate and to observe the whos ground rules the purpose of the network was to unite laboratories with different methods and capacities to rapidly fulfill all postulates for establishing a virus as the cause of the disease scientists agreed to share results in real time via a secure website and discuss findings in daily conferences 59 as klaus stohr wrote laboratories in the influenza network ruled out all influenza virus strains and other known causes of pneumonia from samples taken in hanoi singapore and hong kong sars looked increasingly like a new disease 60 of the 11 laboratories three were in hong kong these belonged to the hong kong government the university of hong kong and the chinese university of hong kong at hong kong university the team included medical technologist chan kwok-hung pathologist john nicholls and leo poon lit-man the hong kong university virology lab was the smallest with only about six people easily dwarfed by the governments virology lab not to say the us cdcs lab where hundreds of people worked in other words the odds were stacked against maliks team in the race to identify the sars virus dr chan set up cell lines for the testing of specimens dr poon helped develop molecular diagnostic tools for fishing out unknown pathogens and dr nicholls fig 149  used electron microscopy to help identify viruses ky yuen did pcr tests on the positive cell culture with cytopathic effect to exclude the presence or contamination by any bacteria that may cause atypical pneumonia including chlamydia and mycoplasma the situation in hong kong was worsening by march 18 111 hospital workers and relatives of what authorities believed to be the index patient were diagnosed with atypical pneumonia now renamed sars most were in the prince of wales hospital the teaching hospital of the chinese university of hong kong and four were in intensive care of the 111 cases 44 were doctors nurses and other hospital personnel at the prince of wales hospital where hong kongs major outbreak began on march 8 61 concern heightened in late march when a major outbreak of sars erupted in amoy gardens a high-rise housing estate actually even before the prince of wales hospital breakout on march 8 malik was actively looking at the possibility of the villain of the piece being a coronavirus among other possibilities in an email on that day to a colleague in the united kingdom he asked for information on coronavirus control material to be used in molecular detection assays 62 disappointingly the colleague knew no one in the uk who was actively working on coronaviruses very from a sars patient the chinese university of hong kong also found paramyxovirus-like particles in respiratory samples china was not part of the network but on march 19 who received a letter from chinas ministry of health announcing that chlamydia was found by electron microscopy in five sars patients actually as early as february 19 the ministry of health had said to the who it is almost ascertained that the causal agent for the atypical pneumonia outbreak in guangdong is chlamydia 63 this was based on the work of hong tao a senior microbiologist at chinas center for disease control and prevention 64 he had announced that the causative agent was chlamydia and because of his standing the ministry of health accepted his finding and maintained that the causal agent for sars had already been identified the microbiology department at hong kong university had had a head start with specimens brought back to hong kong at the risk of their lives by guan yi and bj zheng but after attempting to culture about 50 specimens it was still unable to identify the virus involved of course there was no guarantee that any of the specimens brought back from guangzhou contained the pathogen in question where the index patient dr liu was concerned no bacteria virus fungus or parasite could be found in his respiratory secretions blood or other body fluids as ky yuen acknowledged basically we failed to save him and also failed to make a microbiological diagnosis 65 but the infection of dr lius brother-in-law presented another opportunity here was a patient who was suffering from exactly the same disease the researchers wanted lung tissue from the new patient which they acknowledged was an extremely invasive surgical procedure to perform on a sick patient but after consideration by dr andrew wong chief of service in medicine at kwong wah the operation was performed and the lung tissue sent to queen mary hospital for microbiological analysis 66 this time at least the microbiological team knew for sure that the specimen had come from a patient with the mystery disease with the failure of previous attempts almost all the team members realized that there was now a need to try other cell lines as ky yuen wrote in a joint article with malik peiris our colleague dr chan kwok-hung was encouraged to try as many new cells lines animal cells as medium for viral culture as possible beyond the standard four or five that were normally used what we needed next were luck and lots of patience 67 63 sars how a global epidemic was stopped 2006 64 abraham twenty-first century plague 123-24 65 yuen and peiris facing the unknowns of sars in hong kong 176 66 ibid 67 ibid 179 dr chan decided to use a cell line of fetal kidney cells from rhesus monkeys it was rarely used except to grow hepatitis a virus but it had also proved useful in growing a range of respiratory viruses 68 this was done on march 13 two days later there was a visible reaction as the cells appeared to be dying that is to say there was a virus taking over this was confirmed through multiple tests that eliminated the possibility of contamination the use of this cell line frhk-4 was probably the most important decision in the discovery of the pathogen behind sars yuen and peiris wrote the lung tissue of mr chan yp the brother--in-law of the index patient was inoculated into this cell line for viral culture together with other specimens from patients with pneumonia associated with recent travel to guangdong miraculously significant changes were observed in this cell line 69 but was the virus that was killing the cells the sars virus that is was it the cause of the disease or did it just happen to be present to determine this the hong kong university team tested their virus against blood serum samples from patients at different stages of the disease from early onset to the late stages the test results confirmed their suspicions as peiris said we had the virus growing well it was reacting in the expected way to early and late serum samples we were quite sure this was the virus causing sars 70 by march 21 peiris was ready to share his findings with researchers around the world that day he had missed the daily conference call linking sars researchers globally but in an email late that night peiris indicated that hong kong university had isolated an agent from two patients with sars the agent was isolated in continuous rhesus monkey kidney cells it had a cytopathogenic effect that is to say it caused structural changes in host cells which indicated the growth of a virus in conclusion malik wrote we are confident that the agent in the cell cultures are associated with the sars syndrome the identification of this agent is under way 71 klaus sthr of the who subsequently published a paper on the multicenter collaboration to investigate the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome in which he recalled malik peiris report on the agent that had been cultured in rhesus monkey kidney cells in addition in an immunofluorescence assay of virus-infected cells done in a blinded trial sera from sars patients had rising antibody titres to the new virus isolate he wrote by contrast sera from blood donors taken long before the disease emerged in hong kong had no antibody to this virus furthermore virus-like particles in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrance were seen in thin electron microscopic sections from infected cells stohr concluded these findings proved to be the turning point in the search for the sars causative agent  the day after he informed the who network of researchers malik peiris held a press conference in hong kong and reported that the university had identified a virus associated with sars but that his team did not yet know what kind of virus they were dealing with what we have here is a new i think it is quite a tricky disease and a tricky virus peiris said it is quite important for us to study this in detail before we can come to a conclusion the south china morning post headline proclaimed genetists link tricky virus to pneumonia outbreak 73 four days later peiris held another press conference and identified the virus as a coronavirus so called because of the crown-like spikes on its surface the hong kong university virologist said that his team had completed the genetic sequencing of the virus isolated from hong kong patients it is not one of the two known human coronaviruses and not even any animal coronavirus professor peiris said we are dealing with a type of virus which we have never come across before 74  fig 1410  the hong kong university discovery was the culmination of a worldwide race to uncover the agent that causes sars scientists all over the world had been working around the clock and those at the university of hong kong had succeeded at being the first to identity the elusive culprit this was a real triumph subsequently confirmed by the who the centers for diseases control and prevention in the us also announced the discovery of a coronavirus without mentioning hong kongs breakthrough apparently unaware that it had occurred it issued a press release announcing that a previously unrecognized virus from the coronavirus family is the leading hypothesis for the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome 75 however the who took it upon itself to set the record straight dr david heymann whos executive director for communicable diseases said at a press briefing just so youre clear the virus was first found in hong kong first identified in hong kong and then it was identified at cdc and now its been identified by all the other laboratories 76 also just as hong kong university publicized its breakthrough before the cdcs announcement so the university was able to get its scientific discovery into print first with the publication of a paper in the online lancet on april 8 2003 coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome the success was very much the result of a group effort as the list of authors shows with malik peiris as the lead writer ky yuen as the last writer and others including guan yi leo poon john nicholls and kh chan in between 77 in the same issue lancet published a commentary that said in todays lancet joseph peiris and colleagues provide strong evidence that sars is associated with a novel coronavirus that has not been previously identified in human beings or animals and begin the process of eliminating the many unknowns from this new syndrome  one of the strengths of their report and an important means of establishing causality is their analysis of specimens from control patients none of the 40 respiratory secretions from patients with other respiratory diseases contained the coronavirus rna and none of 200 serum samples from blood donors had serum antibody to this new coronavirus these findings significantly strengthen the tentative aetiological association reported by other investigators from the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta and from toronto who have also isolated a novel coronavirus from patients with sars 78 two days later the cdc article appeared in the online edition of the new england journal of medicine a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome 79 the universitys lead over the cdc with incomparably greater resources was clear paradoxically it emerged later that chinese scientists on the mainland may well have been the first to identify the sars coronavirus this apparently happened in mid-march 2003 even before the world health organization had issued a global alert scientists with the chinese academy of military medical sciences had discovered a new virus in samples from patients in guangdong province the virus they had noticed had a distinctive halo of spikes that put it in a family not known to kill humans the coronaviruses the magazine science reported in july 2003 by which time the world health organization had declared all countries sars-free by the first week of march the group had tentative evidence that the new virus might indeed be linked to the epidemic the problem as is frequently the case in china was politics since the highly respected senior microbiologist hong tao had made the pronouncement in february that chlamydia was responsible for the mystery ailment the ministry of health had accepted this view and the official chinese establishment would accept no other view so the academys microbiologists kept their mouths firmly shut these scientists were the first ever to see the sars virus klaus stohr of the who said after visiting the academy and we had no idea 80 just like the outbreak in guangdong when chinese patients and medical workers lacked information because of the communist partys penchant for secrecy china was a victim of its own policies this time of obstinately sticking to a position just because someone in a position of authority had made a pronouncement the discovery of the sars coronavirus was a huge step forward in the war against the deadly disease but by no means did it mark the end of the war in fact things were to get much worse before they got better the hong kong director of health made sars a statutorily notifiable disease by revising the quarantine and prevention of disease ordinance so as to provide the legal basis for mandating close contacts of sars patients to report daily to one of four medical centers all secondary and primary schools and preschools were temporarily suspended the rolling stones canceled their concert scheduled for march 28 and 29 on april 2 the world health organization issued the most stringent travel advisory in its 55-year history it recommended that persons travelling to hong kong and guangdong province consider postponing all but essential travel until further notice once the sars virus was grown in the laboratory and identified it became possible to decode its genome and identify its genetic makeup it also was possible to identify it in the body tests could be carried out to see what effect potential treatments had for example in response to demand for an antiviral cure for sars various drugs were tested in one test the clinical response of patients with sars to a combination of lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin was examined and compared with patients treated with ribavirin only who served as historical controls the treatment was found to be significantly more effective than that provided in the historical control group 81 just about this time hong kong received a rare visit from a chinese leader premier wen jiabao visited the city in mid-2003 the first national leader to do so since the devastation of sars the premier went to the university of hong kong and praised its role in the battle against the killer disease the premier met the key figures involved the head of microbiology professor ky yuen the chief of virology professor malik peiris and virologist at the department of microbiology dr guan yi the premier was briefed by professor yuen on how despite limited resources the university was able to track down the agent of sars while dr guan explained how animal viruses were discovered 82 within weeks of the discovery of the sars coronavirus the viral genome had been completely sequenced with hong kong university coming third in that race following researchers in canada and the united states the sequencing showed a virus that had begun life in an animal before it mutated and began to infect people animal-or animals-carried the virus that mutated and was able to infect people in order to prevent a recurrence of sars it was important that an answer be found to this question in the case of avian flu chickens and ducks were the culprits were domestic animals also responsible for sars professor zhong nanshan had reported that one of the earliest sars cases in heyuan was a chef who had come into regular contact with several types of live caged animals used as exotic game food 83 because of this guan yi and bj zheng who led the effort to identify the animal host of the sars virus focused their attention on wild animals recently captured and marketed for culinary purposes while malik peiris and his people were toiling in their labs guan yi was busy testing animals being sold in wet markets in guangdong to see what viruses they harbored on may 23 2003 the results of a joint study by research teams in hong kong and shenzhen of wild animals taken from a market in southern china were released the study detected coronaviruses closely related genetically to the sars coronavirus in two of the animal species tested-the masked palm civet and the raccoon dog the study also found that a chinese ferret badger elicited antibodies against the sars-cov 84 the study provided for the first time an indication that the sars virus exists outside a human host sequencing of viruses isolated from these animals demonstrated that with the exception of a small additional sequence the viruses are identical with the human sars virus it said information on the potential role of animals in the transmission of sars is important to overall understanding of sars at present no evidence exists to suggest that these wild animal species play a significant role in the epidemiology of sars outbreaks however it cannot be ruled out that these animals might have been a source of human infection the wild animals sold at markets are traditionally considered delicacies and are available throughout southern china the study reported largely because of the findings of this joint study conducted with the shenzhen centers for disease control the guangdong government temporarily banned the sale of civet cats and closed down wildlife markets but the ban was lifted a few months later after another mainland team challenged the findings and after the war on sars was believed to have been won nevertheless guan yi and bj zheng persevered conducting further researches in guangdongs live-animal retail markets animals were held one per cage in small wire cages they reported about one shenzhen market the animals sampled included seven wild and one domestic animal species they originated from different regions of southern china and had been kept in separate storehouses before arrival to the market the animals remained in the markets for a variable period of time and each stall holder had only a few animals of a given species animals from different stalls within the market were sampled nasal and fecal samples were collected with swabs and stored in medium 199 with bovine serum albumin and antibiotics where possible blood samples were collected for serology 85 sampling was carried out in shenzhen from the end of october and in guangzhou from early december 2003 altogether 179 wild animals were sampled between october 2003 and january 2004 by guan and his team of these 52 were positive for sars-cov-like virus with palm civets found to be the most often infected 86 they discovered that the recent sars-cov sequences from wild animal specimens collected from southern china from october 2003 to january 2004 are much more like the human sars-cov sequences from may 2003 this indicates that the sars covs present in wild animals in southern china are heterogeneous are continuing to evolve and have also acquired mutations making them potentially infectious for humans as it turned out because of guan yis efforts not only was an animal link to the sars virus uncovered but another sars outbreak in guangdong was narrowly averted on december 27 2003 a suspected human case of sars was reported in guangzhou and the patient was quarantined the center of disease control and prevention of guangdong confirmed the case as sars the viral genomic sequence from this new sars case was almost identical to that from palm civets suggesting that the human patient might have acquired the infection from palm civets or other wild animals in the wet markets in guangdong 87 so great was the danger of another sars outbreak in guangdong among the human population that guan yi decided to appeal directly to the powers that be as the year 2004 began he sat down and wrote a letter to chinas hong kong and macau affairs office copies of which were also sent to the ministry of health and chinas centers for disease control with winter coming the wildlife markets have reopened providing the perfect conditions for another outbreak of sars he wrote he listed his findings on the civet cat as a major carrier of the sars coronavirus as well as the fact that other wild animals too carry the virus he enclosed four pages of genetic sequences taken from civets the letter was hand delivered on january 2 88 the very next day he was invited to guangzhou to make his case in front of the most eminent scientists in the province including professor zhong nanshan and clinicians who had treated patients during the sars outbreak the previous year while they were speaking the amino-acid sequences of the human patient recover- ing from sars in a guangzhou hospital were sent to hong kong for sequencing in an hour the results were in the sars patients virus sequences were almost identical to that of the virus sequences of the palm civets that is to say the virus in the wild animal markets had somehow infected a human the group decided then and there to contact the provincial governor and recommend a cull of all civet cats professor zhong telephoned governor huang huahua recommending the slaughtering of all civet cats in the markets 89 the order to carry out the slaughter was given on january 5 2004 involving an estimated total of 10000 civet cats at a news conference in hong kong the day the order was issued dr zhong joined hong kong university microbiologists to announce that they had jointly completed a detailed study of sars-like viruses in civet cats together with a genetic analysis of viral samples taken from a 32-year-old man in guangzhou who was suspected to have sars 90 ky yuen said that while research the previous spring had shown that the sars virus that infected more than 8000 people around the world was genetically very similar to a virus in civet cats new research shows that the virus in civet cats has mutated to form a new sublineage of the virus he said that a genetic sequencing of samples from the infected man in guangzhou had found that the main spike of protein was exactly identical down to the last amino acid to the new sublineage of the virus found in civet cats professor zhong warned that civet cat feces could dry up and become windblown dust that would raise a risk of airborne infection he said the feces carry extremely high concentrations of the virus which can still be detected even when the feces are diluted as much as one billion times professor yuens conviction of the role of civet cats in the transmission of the sars virus to humans was reflected in testimony he gave in early january 2004 to the legislative council select committee set up to inquire into the handling of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak by the government and the hospital authority at one point legislator chan kwok-keung  asked about the origin of the virus and this exchange took place legislator professor yuen i want to ask just now you said virus came from some came from hospitals some came from the community in reality did the virus originate from the community or from hospitals professor yuen this virus if your question is how did the thing get here you would never get an answer by way of example we currently believe that the most important source is civet cats but in reality we cannot be 100 certain unless in the same second we can give all animals in the world a one-off examination then we can be very certain based on the evidence we have at the moment it mainly started from wild animals the guangdong culling operation of civet cats began on january 7 and the last case of sars appeared on january 9 after that no new cases of sars emerged despite the chinese new year which as usual saw large numbers of people traveling as they returned home for the holidays thus the january 2004 cull in guangdong like that of december 1997 in hong kong must be deemed a success in averting a pandemic however farmers of civet cats suffered economic disaster researchers found that civets on farms were largely free from the virus though those in overcrowded retail markets where civets are put in close proximity with other species are often infected this raised the question whether the civet cat was the main conduit for sars or whether it was infected by another animal which was the real reservoir of the virus professor yuen decided to turn his attention to other animal species in the wilderness that may be carriers of similar viruses not everyone was as enthusiastic as yuen in his efforts to gather evidence that might in effect exonerate the civet cat after so much publicity had gone into slaughtering civet cats in guangdong but yuen persevered doing his research in hong kong screening for coronaviruses in wild animals within the territory in this he was successful he found that the chinese horseshoe bat was the natural reservoir of sars coronavirus-like viruses so the bats might well have infected civet cats possibly via yet a third animal 91 the public health implication was that animals such as bats should not be mixed together with other species in wildlife markets as was the case before 2003 the microbiology department did not stop there it went on to sample animals for novel viruses and by 2017 had identified 60 novel animal viruses most of them were named after hong kong or after hong kong university such as the bat coronavirus hku4 found in lesser bamboo bat and the bat coronavirus hku5 found in the japanese pipistrellus bat not much notice was taken of these novel viruses but after the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome both were mentioned in a paper about a man who died in saudi arabia a previously unknown coronavirus was isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man who presented with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure with fatal outcome in saudi arabia began an article in the new england journal of medicine in 2012 the virus called hcov-emc later mers-cov replicated readily in cell culture producing cytopathic effects of rounding detachment and syncytium formation the virus represents a novel betacoronavirus species the closest known relatives are bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 92 thus hong kong university identified novel animal coronaviruses prior to the emergence of this highly fatal infection in the middle east and subsequently korea hong kong paid a high price for sars with more than 1700 people laid low by the disease with 299 deaths in 2004 the government awarded professor yuen a silver bauhinia star for his discovery of the coronavirus that causes sars professor yuen modestly said the award was recognition for all members of his team the award has helped boost the morale of my team he said my colleagues including malik peiris and guan yi put a great deal of effort into tracing the source of the sars virus to civet cats there are many more people who have made a lot of contribution 93 the university gave all three men-professor yuen professor peiris and dr guan-the special research achievement award in recognition of the teams groundbreaking discovery of the coronavirus responsible for the ourbreak of sars 94 one interesting achievement of his team professor yuen said was that at one stage it collected the highest number of flu strains in the world but he added with his customary modesty by now the beijing and the harbin group should have superseded us already 95 quite aptly members of the entire team of scientists were called heroes of the sars wars by bloomberg asia also has the global scientific community to thank for quickly mobilizing to understand the mysterious new virus bloomberg his identification of the chinese horseshoe bat as the natural host for the virus fig 1411  malik peiris too received a wealth of awards reflecting his international outreach the honors bestowed on him came from overseas including the united kingdom where in 2006 he was elected a fellow of the royal society of london the highest scientific honor in the commonwealth the following year he was awarded the chevalier de la legion dhonneur by france as well as the mahathir science award by malaysia for the role he played in the discovery of the aetiological agent of sars recognition from the hong kong government came in 2008 when he received the silver bauhinia star for outstanding achievements in the field of virology and pathology in particular his contribution to the prevention and control of infectious diseases 98 today all three men are listed among the worlds most frequently cited researchers in the field of microbiology that is to say they are among the top 1 of researchers in their field internationally in 2015 thomson reuters listed professors yuen peiris guan and poon among the worlds most influential scientific minds fig 1412  so the microbiologists achieved recognition both within the university and from society at large in hong kong and internationally in 1997 we only had 42 or 43 people ky yuen recalled now microbiology has over a hundred people at the same time the school of public health has well over 330 staff so yuen said you can see the power of money as a result we can do much more research and we have much better output 99 without the title of state key laboratory yuen said they would never have received this money the people working on microbiology today include both those in the department itself and in the public health school while both the department and the school do virology and pathogenesis the department works more on clinical diagnosis and treatment while the school focuses more on epidemiology they share the teaching load for medical students ky yuen was promoted to chair professor in 1999 malik peiris moved up from senior lecturer to become professor and after sars to chair professor guan yi has risen from a research assistant professor when he first joined the university to professor to co-director of the state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases and professor of virology in january 2015 he was promoted to chair professor such growth in personnel plus internal promotions would not have been possible without greatly increased funding the designation of state key laboratory in mainland china would ordinarily come with substantial funding but because the university is in hong kong it cannot directly receive such funds from beijing from 2005 when the title was granted until 2011 it could only apply for limited funding within the mainland which had to be spent on collaborative projects with mainland researchers however beginning in 2011 the hong kong government started to provide funding to the state key laboratory through what is now its innovation and technology bureau to the tune of 5 million a year this was a highly appreciated windfall and with this additional funding the department has grown much faster in recent years the physical laboratory at the university has also been upgraded laboratories are graded by biosafety levels measuring the biocontainment precautions required to isolate dangerous biological agents in an enclosed facility ranging from 1 to 4 at the time of sars the laboratory was at a biosafety level of p2 and in 2007 it was upgraded to a p3 yuen thinks it may never become a p4 -the kind of lab where all the researchers wear astronaut suits because they are working on something very dangerous like ebola in the aftermath of such traumatic events as the h5n1 outbreak of 1997 followed by sars six years later hong kong learned that vigilance was vital the government was determined that whenever the next health challenge arose it wouldnt be unprepared in june 2004 hong kong set up the center for health protection chp using the centers for disease control and prevention in the united states as a model creation of the center was recommended by the sars expert committee appointed by chief executive tung chee-hwa the government also earmarked a one-off grant of 500 million to support research into emerging infectious diseases while 50 million was to support infectious disease research in the mainland the bulk that is 450 million was directed to support local investigator-initiated research and commissioned projects through the creation of the research fund for the control of infectious diseases the aim of the fund was to encourage facilitate and support research on the prevention treatment and control of infectious diseases this was superseded in 2011 with the creation of the health and medical research fund with the injection of an additional 1 billion on a down-to-earth level the government took steps to ward off or at least mitigate the return of avian flu retail markets for live poultry came under close supervision rest days were introduced during which retail markets for live poultry were closed and thoroughly cleaned tests showed that viruses were dramatically reduced after a rest day live chickens were no longer imported from mainland china those taken to market came from local farms and any chickens not sold at the end of the day were not returned to the farms but slaughtered so that viruses could not be introduced-or reintroduced-onto farms from retail markets the university of hong kong too responded to the new situation in 2004 it approved a proposal to establish a school of public health which was formally inaugurated in 2009 the university was invited to submit proposals for research related to basic laboratory epidemiological and public health research in emerging infectious diseases the university was asked to participate because of its pioneering work in discovering the sars-coronavirus its outstanding work on avian influenza a h5n1 research and surveillance and its track record of peer-reviewed publications especially in journals with high impact factors 100 the university submitted a proposal research preparedness for emerging and potentially reemerging infectious diseases in hong kong as a result 30 million was approved for it to undertake a five-year portfolio of basic laboratory epidemiology and public health research as well as upgrade its bio-safety level 3 laboratory with enhancement for animal experimentation it was just as well that hong kong was consolidating its infectious disease and virology expertise and facilities after sars because another storm was brewing in march 2009 there was an outbreak of flu in a town called la gloria in veracruz mexico it affected 60 of the towns population and killed three children it was believed to be the common flu between 14th and 17th april specimens collected from two children with flu in california usa were shown to have a strain of swine flu called h1n1 on april 24 the world health organization issued a disease outbreak notice confirming the infection of a number of people in mexico and the united states by swine influenza a h1n1 viruses not previously detected in pigs or humans the 24th was a friday and malik heard the news friday night he gathered the flu team for a meeting the next day when they discussed what steps to take a priority was to set up diagnostic tests for detecting the virus when it arrived in hong kong as it inevitably would they had the sequence of the virus provided by the us cdc but for such molecular detection tests a positive control virus is needed to establish that the test is working properly the new pandemic h1n1 virus was not available in hong kong but a decade-long surveillance of swine influenza viruses provided a source within which to search and indeed a virus close enough to serve as the positive control was found the next question was to understand the origins of the virus it was decided to start genetic sequencing of the many hundreds of swine influenza viruses available from this surveillance effort by april 27 jose angel cordova the minister of health for mexico was reporting that 1614 cases had been detected 103 people had died and an additional 400 were in hospital these were alarming statistics on april 26 the us declared a public health emergency and the following day the world health organization raised its pandemic alert to level 4 with 6 being the highest on may 1 hong kong confirmed its first case of swine flu a mexican national who had arrived via shanghai and stayed at the metropark hotel it was the first reported case in asia and the hong kong government responded with the seriousness that it warranted the alertness level was raised to emergency with the example of dr liu jianlun-the guangdong doctor who stayed overnight in the metropole hotel and infected more than a dozen other guests and visitors-seared into its collective memory hong kong was not going to take any chances while the 25-year-old mexican patient was treated in isolation in hospital the metropark hotel was quarantined and its roughly 200 guests kept in confinement for a week despite their protestations other interventionst measures learned during sars included the closure of schools-primary schools kindergartens and special schools initially for two weeks and then extended to the summer holidays historically speaking hong kong had been identified with influenza research for decades the 1968 pandemic after all was named hong kong flu after having first been identified in the city then the bird flu saga of 1997 and sars in 2003 put hong kong on the front lines of emerging disease outbreaks as a result hong kong has invested heavily in infrastructure in preparation for future epidemics and pandemics explained one paper commenting on the territorys public health research response to the 2009 outbreak there has also been substantial investment in research infrastructure essential to guide evidence-based policy locally as well as internationally 101 thus prepared even before the first case was reported in hong kong it operated under containment efforts including entry screening at airports ports and border crossings hospital isolation of cases tracing and quarantine of contacts and routine antiviral prophylaxis on 26 april hong kong raised its alertness level from alert to serious just one step away from emergency the next day the world health organization too raised its alertness level dr keiji fukuda whos assistant director-general explained that the increase in pandemic alert level was in response to the outbreak of swine flu that had originated in mexico but that it did not mean that a pandemic was inevitable 102 hong kong also made swine flu a notifiable disease a step it learned from its sars experience actually we had a number of research grants for pandemic preparedness recalls professor benjamin j cowling head of epidemiology biostatics in the school of public health this allowed us to scale up for research into the pandemic so when the pandemic actually came here we did a number of studies which were the envy of most other places in the world 103 fig 1413  a crucial question was how effective were these various measures at warding off the arrival of swine flu verifying its severity and preventing or deterring its spread entry screening cowling and his colleagues determined could delay local transmission for one to two weeks a delay of one to two weeks could be useful if the additional time permits more comprehensive planning and preparation for a local pandemic or shortens the time required for other pandemic mitigation measures such as schools closures to be sustained they wrote however the benefits of local screening should be balanced against the considerable resources required to implement screening 104 still when the virus reached hong kong it spread rapidly within five months 50 of children in hong kong were infected 105 fortunately it was not as severe as initially feared but the speed with which it spread was astounding if it had been really virulent there could have been a global catastrophe while the disease emerged first in north america by may 11 it had spread to 30 countries causing the world health organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6 hong kong knew that it would not be spared only the previous year the government had created the post of under secretary for food and health with professor gabriel leung as the first occupant of the post when h1n1 emerged he mobilized his former colleagues at the university to respond fig 1414  in the us the situation was worsening a health alert was issued to doctors who were warned of a new strain of swine flu that was a combination of swine avian and human influenza that had not been seen before the national broadcasting corporation nbc seeking expert views on the situation was able to contact professor guan yi who was at that time in india helping to set up a poultry influenza surveillance network he was at the bombay airport when nbc managed to reach him to ask for urgent comment on the spread of swine flu to humans guan yis immediate response was that it was not easy to detect this kind of virus after all the h1n1 virus was already in humans as a human virus guan yi went to work immediately after returning to hong kong he told his team we need to find out how this virus was generated and where the virus came from they had an advantage in that hong kong was probably the only place in the world where there had been close surveillance and sampling of swine for over a decade as part of its anti-influenza program guan yi who had written his doctoral thesis on swine flu had accumulated data on the subject while a student in the 1990s under ken shortridge who himself had data going back to the 1970s so while the rest of the world was short on information regarding swine hong kong was data rich guan yi and his associates set to work on the unique data available to them according to guan the bulk of the analysis was done in one intensive week of work from april 26 to may 2 with help from andrew rambaut an evolution scientist with the institute of evolutionary biology at the university of edinburgh they were able to understand the evolutionary pathway of this virus 106 here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the s-oiv epidemic the paper explains we show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak while surveillance and sampling had been taking place in asia this was not true of north america and as a result there was a long period of unsampled ancestry before the s-oiv outbreak suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans furthermore it said the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans 107 the paper was submitted to the journal nature for publication on 24 may 2009 it was accepted 4 june and was published online 11 june 2009 the timing was fortuitous june 11 was the day when dr margaret chan director-general of the world health organization announced the raising of the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to phase 6 the highest level the world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic she declared somberly 108 this means that on may 24 when the paper was submitted even before the world knew what was happening-in the words of guan yi-i provided critical information to the world with the university of hong kong catching the attention of the world the universitys virologists were keen to study this novel virus which was spread not by birds but by pigs a study of the lineage of the h1n12009 viruses showed that three major lineages of swine h1 influenza viruses had been prevalent in pigs in surveys conducted in hong kong over the past 10 years the h1n1 flu virus was a triple reassortant combining the classical swine h1n1 the european avian-like h1n1 and triple-reassortant h1n2 trig viruses and while the virus had jumped from pigs into humans actually this had happened more than once after circulating in humans for some time they jumped back to pigs and tried to reassort with other pig virus reported professor leo poon a diagnostic expert in identifying viruses that was quite interesting because it highlights the pig as a major reservoir or intermediate host 109 a paper published in the prestigious science journal co-authored by leo poon guan yi malik peiris and others concluded the 2009 pandemic although mild and apparently contained at present could undergo further reassortment in swine and gain virulence it is therefore important that surveillance in swine is greatly heightened and that all eight gene segments are genetically characterized so that such reassortment events are rapidly identified 110 observations made over 14 years of pigs in a hong kong abattoir were able to show that all major lineages of swine viruses of north american or european origin were present in chinese pigs from different provinces shipped to hong kong for slaughter although pigs unlike birds dont fly they are exported from one country to another often for breeding purposes so although the 2009 epidemic did not emerge in china but in mexico analysis of pigs in china was able to show how the mixing of viruses was occurring 111 peiris and his colleagues argued that similar events probably had also occurred undetected in mexico indeed they were right but it took another 5 years to find these viruses in mexico so great was hong kongs input that in 2010-11 it contributed half of all the known swine influenza genetic data in the world the diversity of genetic variants found in the studies by the hong kong group also allowed them to understand the genetic determinants that allowed a human transmissible virus to emerge from these precursor swine viruses 112 according to cowling when there is a new influenza virus the three immediate priorities of public health officials are to determine first how quickly it spreads between people how severe the infections are and what the options are for controlling it that is what can be done and the potential for success of such efforts the research that we did here covered all three of those important areas he said whereas other research groups or government ministries are usually unable to do that another project that cowling and his team did was a comparison of the h1n1 virus and seasonal influenza viruses in community settings fortuitously cowling was in the midst of doing household transmission studies when h1n1 struck he identified patients with flu in the clinics of general practitioners then requested permission to test members of the household when the epidemic arrived he continued this work the information that he was able to gather turned into a very important paper 113 for one thing there is very little research data on the comparative epidemiology and virology of the pandemic 2009 influenza a h1n1 virus and co-circulating seasonal influenza a viruses in community settings cowling and his team recruited 348 index patients with acute respiratory illness from 14 outpatient clinics in hong kong in july and august 2009 they then followed household members of 99 patients who tested positive for influenza a virus on rapid diagnostic testing and collected nasal and throat swabs from all household members at three home visits within 7 days for testing they were able to conclude that pandemic 2009 h1n1 virus has characteristics that are broadly similar to those of seasonal influenza a viruses in terms of rates of viral shedding clinical illness and transmissibility in the household setting the household transmission studies allowed detailed inferences on the transmissibility of ph1n1 as well as the mild clinical profile of cases in the community a review of hong kongs public health research response to the 2009 pandemic concluded household studies have the unique advantage of a natural setting that allows comparisons of transmission characteristics and the effects of host viral and environmental factors on transmission 114 one study by cowling and his team was to establish the transmissibility and virulence of the pandemic strain information that was a priority for national and international health authorities in 2009 115 patient data on all laboratory-confirmed pandemic h1n1 cases reported between may 1 and november 15 2009 were collected by the hospital authority and the center for health protection during that period h1n1 infection was a reportable disease so the data collected was likely to be comprehensive the information included demographic date on age and sex clinical information including illness-onset date laboratory-confirmation date and hospital-admission date the researchers found that the estimated reproduction number of pandemic h1n1 appeared to be lower in hong kong than in other countries the hospital admission rate in hong kong was high due to broader admission criteria with young children and pregnant women routinely admitted for testing and investigation 116 while the overall number of severe hospital cases was not high professor ky yuen found that for severe cases the viral load in the respiratory tract didnt decrease rapidly despite oseltamivir treatment this led him and his associates to try another method they selected mildly infected patients with a high level of neu-tralizing antibody and used the convalescent plasma of these patients to treat those severely ill yuen found that the treatment of severe a influenza h1n1 within 5 days of symptom onset was associated with a lower viral load and reduced mortality 117 the mortality in severely ill patients treated by convalescent plasma was 20 whereas those treated by tamiflu alone was 548 118 dr joseph t wu of the school of public health led a study on the infection attack rate and the infection-hospitalization probability from data provided daily by the hospital authority and the department of health from which he could construct an epidemic curve describing how fast the disease was spreading in hong kong the hospital authority gave us the number of confirmed infections and hospitalizations each day dr wu explained and so data can easily be obtained on the severity of the h1n1 infections 119 wu also approached research on the infection attack rate and severity from a different angle working together with the hong kong red cross researchers tested 14766 blood samples from blood donors during the period when the virus was active they discovered that almost half of all schoolage children in hong kong were infected during the first wave however because the symptoms were mild few of them went to hospital paradoxically a much smaller percentage of older adults aged 50-59 years were infected but a much higher percentage went to hospital if it wasnt for the serological tests such a phenomenon may have gone undetected and the disease may have been thought to be one that primarily attacked older people 120 wu and his team also measured the impact of school closures on the mitigation of the h1n1 pandemic they concluded that the closure of secondary schools for the summer vacation was associated with substantially lower transmission across age groups and estimated that reporting of cases declined to 52 of its initial rate through the second half of june by comparison attack rates in previous epidemics have generally been highest in younger children and this was true in mexico and chicago this finding they reported intuitively implies that closures were effective in preventing infections in this age group 121  fig 1415  the data generated by the university was shared with the government and the who giving them real-time situation awareness of the pandemic even before the relevant papers were published so impressive was hong kongs performance that at the second global influenza seroepidemiology expert meeting sponsored by the european center for disease prevention and control in 2011 in stockholm the chairman angus nicoll speaking on sustainability of serological surveillance cited two options routine annual surveys such as those conducted by israel norway and poland or fast ad hoc quality research a la hong kong at one point he said in the next pandemic maybe all of us should subcontract our epidemiology work to hong kong 122 at the end of march 2013 a new virus was detected in china first a father in shanghai became ill of severe pneumonia and died then two sons also developed quite severe pneumonia this was scarily reminiscent of the sars epidemic a decade previously while they tested negative for sars it turned out that they had influenza but a hitherto unknown kind of flu h7n9 the chinese authorities responded quickly by establishing a joint multi-sectoral coordination mechanism initiating several investigations notifying the world health organization sharing viruses with whos influenza collaborating centers and other laboratories and mounting effective counter measures such as closure of live poultry markets in some locations subsequently who undertook a six-day joint mission to china 123 malik peiris was part of the mission live bird markets were an immediate suspect even though some people refused to believe that the virus came from chickens shanghai closed all live bird markets and human infections disappeared that made it quite clear that the retail poultry market was the cause china cdc did a lot of work but encountered opposition from those involved in the poultry trade and in agriculture because the poultry didnt sicken farmers werent too concerned about whether they were infected or not and while closing live markets was effective in combating the virus it was also extremely costly a joint assessment was made by experts from china and the who what we found is the virus is located in lots of different parts of china recalls fukuda who was assistant director-general for health security of the who at the time we also found that the risks of getting infected appeared to be similar to h5n1 some kind of contact with infected markets with poultry markets we also saw that when cities took control measures close down markets clean up markets you could reduce the infection 124 it was malik said like the h5 story all over again difference is that h7 is even more dangerous than h5 because it was able to infect humans more easily and because it caused no illness in birds-that is it was a virus able to spread silently in poultry since 2013 h7n9 has continued to be present in china and in fact there was an upsurge in 2017 however according to fukuda we dont see major changes in the virus or that its more transmissible based on what we know both in 2013 and now it is a reflection of an increase in infection in birds and increased contact between humans and infected birds 125 fukuda is quick to compliment researchers in the school of public health now his colleagues such as malik guan yi and leo poon and ben cowling this group he said has continued to operate at a very high level the university here has such a strong research team and they have collaborators in china in 2009 when swine flu was first reported guan yi was traveling in india on march 31 2013 when china reported to the world health organization the detection of three cases of human infection with a novel influenza a h7n9 virus he was again traveling but this time he was on holiday with his family in guilin china the country where the outbreak was occurring his immediate thought turned to the recent reports of thousands of dead pigs found floating in the huangpu river in shanghai which had been dumped in the water by farmers it crossed his mind that the dead pigs and sick humans might be connected after returning to hong kong guan tested samples of the virus on various animals including pigs and concluded that the h7n9 virus did not kill the pigs that was one less thing to worry about but the main concern was the infectivity and transmissibility of this new virus a group of scholars from the university of hong kong and from shantou university plus international and mainland chinese experts published an article in science magazine 126 these scholars conducted experiments on ferrets which are considered the primary mammalian model for human influenza while healthy ferrets inoculated with the virus displayed a brief fever one or two days after inoculation with robust sneezing and nasal discharge and three ferrets placed in direct contact with the inoculated group displayed similar symptoms only one of three airborne-exposed ferrets displayed such symptoms suggesting that transmission by air was much less efficient though the paper was formally published 12 july 2013 it was submitted april 30 accepted may 20 and published online may 23 we were guan yi said the first team in the whole world to publish such a paper to define virus infectivity and transmissibility 127 another paper in the lancet showed that h7n9 was much more efficient at infecting the human 125 bronchus than h5n1 so that the chance of getting infected and potentially transmitting it to others was higher 128 still the question was where did this new virus come from the answer like that for h5n1 was poultry china has the largest poultry population in the world guan yi observes domestic duck is the natural host of influenza virus and 70 of domestic ducks in the world are in china likewise 90 of domestic geese are in china at the time it wasnt clear which animal was the host to the virus so guan and his key associate huachen zhu also known as maria sampled all major poultry from markets we pinpointed chicken as the source guan said surprisingly the virus was in the respiratory tract not the digestive tract some people zhu and guan said offered the pigeon as a possible suspect because the pigeon population is relatively small and the economic impact of its obliteration would be less damaging but they showed beyond doubt that the chicken was the culprit while the paper did not appear until the 10 october 2013 issue of nature-and even the online edition wasnt published until 21 august it was submitted on may 22 less than two months after the discovery of h7n9 and at a time when chinas ministry of agriculture was arguing strongly that chickens were not the source again a group of experts including guan yi was able to show how the h7n9 virus emerged from wild bird and chicken viruses preliminary analyses suggest that the virus is a reassortant of h7 n9 and h9n2 avian influenza viruses and carries some amino acids associated with mammalian receptor binding raising concerns of a new pandemic they wrote in nature in an article submitted on may 22 2013 however neither the source populations of the h7n9 outbreak lineage nor the conditions for its genesis are fully known 129 they went on here we show that h7 viruses probably transferred from domestic duck to chicken populations in china on at least two independent occasions we show that the h7 viruses subsequently reassorted with enzootic h9n2 viruses to generate the h7n9 outbreak lineage field surveillance was conducted in wenzhou in zhejiang province rizhao in shandong province and in shenzhen in guangdong province according to the authors previous analyses suggested that the n9 gene of the h7n9 outbreak lineage was derived from wild bird viruses in europe and korea however their data showed that for this gene more closely related h11n9 and h2n9 viruses were found in migratory wild birds in hong kong in 2010-11 the authors concluded domestic ducks seem to act as key intermediate hosts by influenza viruses from migratory birds by facilitating the generation of different combinations of h7 and n9 or n7 subtype viruses and by transmitting these viruses to chickens after transmission reassortment with enzootic h9n2 viruses formed the current h7n9 or h7n7 viruses seen in chickens this probably led to outbreaks in chickens resulting in the rapid spread of the novel reassortant h7n9 lineage through live poultry markets lpms which then became the source of human infections the cessation of human infections after the closure of lpms after a precedent set during the hong kong h5n1 bird flu incident in 1997 strongly supports this proposition so the virus went from wild birds to domestic ducks to chickens before infecting humans the authors reported the discovery of an h7n7 virus in chickens that has the ability to infect mammals experimentally this they said suggests that h7 viruses may pose threats beyond the current outbreak the continuing prevalence of h7 viruses in poultry could lead to the generation of highly pathogenic variants and further sporadic human infections with a continued risk of the virus acquiring human-to-human transmissibility they warned another paper produced with high input by maria zhu appeared in june 2015 in nature again it was on the dissemination divergence and establishment of h7n9 viruses in china the authors showed that since h7n9 was first reported in march 2013 the virus had spread from eastern to southern china and had become persistent in chickens moreover repeated introduction of viruses from zhejiang to other provinces and the presence of h7n9 viruses at live poultry markets had fueled the recurrence of human infections the rapid expansion of the geographical distribution and genetic diversity of the h7n9 viruses poses a direct challenge to current disease control systems the authors reported our results also suggest that h7n9 viruses have become enzootic in china and may spread beyond the region following the pattern previously observed with h5n1 and h9n2 viruses 130 while the article appeared in print in june 2015 it was submitted more than eight months before on 30 september 2014 papers such as the nature article marked a major advance in human knowledge of the h7n9 virus his group guan said had contributed at least 65 of the data on the h7n9 influenza virus in genbank the database produced and maintained by the national center for biotechnology information as part of the international nucleotide sequence database collaboration it is certainly a tribute to hong kong both to the government and to researchers in academia that while h7n9 is now endemic in mainland china there has to date not been a single local case in hong kong how was hong kong able to keep h7n9 at bay the answer lies in the interventions to reduce zoonotic and pandemic risks 131 one important step is the closure of live poultry markets such closures stopped h7n9 outbreaks in the mainland but they were costly to the poultry industry the closure of wholesale and retail markets in shanghai hangzhou huzhou and nanjing in 2013 is believed to have cost the poultry industry about us8 billion 132 but there are also steps that can be taken short of shutting down the markets steps that had proven effective in hong kong such as rest days when the markets are closed for a thorough cleaning and banning of live poultry being kept overnight in live poultry markets separation of live ducks and geese from chickens can also reduce the risk of intermingling of different forms of viruses one problem in countering the h7n9 virus is that the industry has little incentive to take any steps to detect its presence since the virus doesnt sicken birds only its human hosts another measure taken by hong kong is a ban on holding poultry overnight in live poultry markets this way incoming chickens are not in the market for long enough to be newly infected and in turn infect other birds other steps include the removal of fecal matter drinking water and poultry feed because viruses survive longer in water than on surfaces cages too need to be cleaned regularly and should be made of materials easily cleaned such as plastic not wood or bamboo such measures proven to work in hong kong can usefully be adopted elsewhere such as in mainland china or vietnam because the scene of action of the h7n9 virus was initially not in hong kong the hong kong research teams established collaborations in the hot spots in china ky yuen and his collaborator professor honglin chen flew to see their mainland collaborators to get clinical data from infected patients the virus strain for full length sequencing tissues from dead patients and most importantly virus strains from the wet market poultry the first paper on h7n9 proving the link between human cases of h7n9 virus and poultry h7n9 virus in the markets was published in the lancet 133 yuen and his team in another paper showed that normal blood donors dont have anti-h7n9 antibodies whereas more than 6 of 396 poultry workers were antibody positive to h7n9 this further confirmed the link between h7n9 in humans and h7n9 in poultry 134 a review article was published in the lancet comparing h5n1 bird flu in hong kong in 1997 and h7n9 in shanghai 16 years later crossing the species barrier from bird to human was previously unknown to medical history the paper was called the emergence of influenza a h7n9 in human beings 16 years after influenza a h5n1 a tale of two cities 135 as the authors noted hong kong and shanghai are located along the avian migratory route at the pearl river delta and yangtze river delta they ended with the observation why h7n9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than h5n1 is still unclear malik peiris and hui-ling yen went to shanghai and worked with researchers there on studying patients with h7n9 disease in a collaborative paper in lancet they reported the emergence of oseltamivir resistance in some patients that was associated with treatment failure and poor clinical outcome 136  the h7n9 outbreak also saw the beginning of much closer collaboration between the university of hong kong and the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc actually the two institutions had collaborated previously for example on a study of hand foot and mouth disease in china during the 2008-2012 period 137 shortly after the chinese government announced the emergence of the new h7n9 avian flu disease hongjie yu director of the china cdcs division for infectious diseases contacted dean gabriel leung on his cell phone to discuss the situation the dean immediately flew to beijing with a group of about ten hong kong university specialists including ben cowling and joe wu and stayed there for about a month to take part in making an initial risk assessment on how easily the virus spread its severity control measures the characteristics of the virus and so on after a month the two sides published a series of papers led by gabriel leung as senior author in which scholars from both sides participated from 2013 to 2017 the h7n9 outbreaks came in annual waves and specialists from the china cdc and hku studied each one closely one article published by the lancet online on june 24 2013 with hongjie yu as the lead writer was an assessment of clinical severity of human infection with avian influenza a h7n9 virus 138 it concluded that human infections with avian influenza a h7n9 virus seem to be less serious than has been previously reported it also said that many mild cases may already have occurred thus lowering the mortality rate even more another article published by lancet online the same day had ben cowling as the lead writer it compared the epidemiology of human infec-tions with h7n9 and h5n1 in china 139 the fatality rate on admission to hospital was 36 for h7n9 and 70 for h5n1 meaning that there was a lower death rate among the older h7n9 sufferers than for the younger victims of h5n1 the authors acknowledged that the difference in susceptibility to serious illness with the two different viruses remained unexplained they also collaborated anew on hand foot and mouth disease writing a joint paper that provided scientific evidence to support the chinese governments policy of vaccination 140 a later paper was on hepatitis a and hepatitis e in china 141 the collaboration between hku and china cdc went so well that a memorandum for cooperation by the two sides was signed on august 15 2013 providing for such cooperation to continue for the next 5 years the purpose was to improve and enhance the capacity of understanding surveillance and control of infectious diseases in china as well as to develop training programs for people from both sides the two parties agreed that their collaboration would include research projects on infectious diseases reviewing and evaluation of the infectious disease surveillance in china and seasonal influenza and avian influenza h7n9 and h5n1 142 hongjie yu director of china cdcs division for infectious diseases confirmed that hku experts such as gabriel leung ben cowling and joseph wu were very helpful to china cdc in the study of emerging infectious diseases with potential pandemic threat and risk assessment he said we have already set up a collaborative platform in this field and definitely will be working closely together to monitor the current outbreaks of emerging infections diseases eids like avian influenza h5n6 h7n9 etc and to respond to future eids as well 143 the surgeon general of the united states william stewart is frequently quoted as having said in 1967 the time has come to close the book on infectious diseases we have basically wiped out infections in the united states whether he said it or not is now immaterial the fact is that infectious diseases have not been wiped out and the world needs to be ever alert to new threats as for what constitutes modern outbreaks keiji fukuda has an intriguing observation fig 1416  modern outbreaks are not disease he said in textbooks you read about disease modern outbreaks are combinations of disease and anxiety disruption when you have something like sars there is a huge amount of anxiety in beijing there was a day when there was virtually no car traffic at all the entire city was at a standstill-that was not disease that was fear of the disease 144 he continued i think if we look back in history in the 1918 epidemic we can see where fear and actual disease are commensurate 40-50 million people died around the world like black plague in the middle ages but with sars and bird flu were not talking about millions of people dying and yet were talking about that level of fear almost paralysis managing the disease aspect is relatively easier than managing the fear aspect despite books and movies about existential threats to the human species experts are guardedly optimistic when speaking of whether future influenza pandemics are inevitable dr peter palese a flu expert at the mount sinai school of medicine points out that human flus can infect people who inhale only one to ten virus particles but it takes 100000 to a million particles of an h5 bird flu to infect a human thats why people who live under chickens in markets in asia get it and we dont get it on fifth avenue dr palese said 145 more than a decade ago ken shortridge pointed out that hong kong had stopped the h5n1 virus in its tracks three times through surveillance surveillance surveillance i have no idea if h5n1 will cause a pandemic he said we cant be certain at all 146 he did warn that h5n1 was in a smoldering phase of evolution similar to that undergone by the 1918 virus before the influenza pandemic broke out but he traced the root of the problem to people not birds saying the industrialization of poultry is the nub of this problem we have unnaturally brought to our doorstep pandemic-capable viruses we have given them the opportunity to infect and destroy huge numbers of birds and  jump into the human race he went on something is not right human population has exploded we are impinging on the realms of the animals more and more taking their habitats for ourselves forcing animals into ever more artificial environments and existences so hong kong has a need to remain vigilant not only for itself but for the world besides infectious disease expertise has undergone a major transformation in the last two decades when bird flu struck hong kong in 1997 the territory was dependent on external expertise to cope with that disease over the intervening years researchers at hong kong university have become leading global experts in their own right the lessons of bird flu and sars have been well and truly learned hong kong has grown and matured through those difficult days its research-based control efforts benefit the nation and the global community as angus nicoll has observed hong kong does fast as well as high quality research and does excellent epidemiological work from which the rest of the world can benefit 144 interview with fukuda 145   hantavirus rna in saliva from patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome lisa pettersson jonas klingstrm jonas hardestam ke lundkvist clas ahlm magnus evander   saliva was collected from puuv-infected patients who were hospitalized from january through may 2007 at the department of infectious diseases at ume university hospital ume sweden samples were obtained from patients with typical clinical symptoms of acute ne which were verified by detection of puuv-specific immunoglobulin ig m in serum a puuv-specific real-time rt-pcr or both the collection was random with no consideration of time of the day or food intake the samples were only collected on 1 occasion during each patients hospitalization by asking the patient to spit in a single-use plastic mug the saliva was then removed with a syringe 5 ml becton dickinson franklin lakes nj usa and put in sterile plastic test tubes nunc roskilde denmark the samples were immediately stored at

the sequencing reaction the pcr fragment was purified by using a qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen and precipitated in ethanol assembly analysis and alignment of sequences were performed by using geneious basic 306 wwwgeneiouscom and blast wwwncbinlmnihgovblast we collected saliva 29 days after onset of symptoms from 14 hospitalized ne patients to determine whether hantaviruses were present in human saliva all patients were positive for puuv rna in plasma by a real-time rt-pcr and 13 patients had puuv-specific igm antibodies in serum table we then analyzed the saliva by real-time rt-pcr for the presence and levels of viral rna saliva samples from 10 of 14 patients were positive for puuv rna range 1530121323 puuv rna copiesml demonstrating that viral rna could be detected in saliva during disease table furthermore we detected no inhibition of real-time rt-pcr in saliva or plasma when we analyzed our patient samples by using an internal positive control data not shown all patients were also igg positive in serum with varying titers to study in more detail whether the rna we detected in saliva was truly specific we sequenced regions of rt-pcr products sequencing of amplification products from saliva and plasma from 3 ne patientspatient 1 genbank accession nos eu337014 and eu337015 patient 2 genbank accession nos eu177629 and eu177630 and patient 4 genbank accession nos eu337016 and eu337017demonstrated a puuv s-segment sequence that was identical for each salivaplasma pair data not shown when we compared the sequences for patients 1 and 4 we found 24 mismatches in the 292-nt s-segment sequence which clearly demonstrated that they were derived from different strains figure the observed nucleotide mismatches did not result in different amino acid sequences the sequence from patient 2 was from another s-segment region all puuv sequences from the ne patients were most closely related to puuv strains from the disease-endemic region in northern sweden and grouped with the northern branch of puuv strains 1920 all 14 ne patients required hospital care and displayed the symptoms of ne all survived and none had to be treated by dialysis seven patients had respiratory symptoms including cough dyspnea or both in 2 of the patients with respiratory symptoms a chest radiograph revealed infiltrates data not shown the 2 patients with the highest levels of viral rna in saliva had dyspnea patient 1 and cough and lung infiltrates patient 2 table all patients with respiratory symptoms except 1 patient 12 had puuv rna in their saliva this investigation showed that hantavirus rna could be detected in saliva from hfrs patients we found puuv rna with varying puuv genome copy numbers in the saliva of most of the 14 hospitalized ne patients previously we have shown that puuv rna in plasma decreases with time in the individual patient 18 and although we did not study this finding puuv in saliva likely would display similar kinetics puuv viremia is thought to persist for 57 days but in our study 1 patient had puuv in both saliva and plasma 9 days after onset of symptoms furthermore we recently detected puuv rna in plasma 16 days after first appearance of disease 18 it would also be interesting to study whether nonhospitalized patients with milder symptoms also had puuv rna in their saliva we do not know if puuv rna in saliva could originate from puuv viremia but the puuv rna detected in saliva was likely produced in salivary glands or through coughing recently andv antigen was found in secretory cells of the salivary glands of human patients 21 in our study 7 of the patients had respiratory symptoms and virus shedding in saliva is known to occur for several respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus 2223 symptoms in the upper respiratory tract are also often present in ne 224 which makes our finding of puuv in saliva credible one may argue that ne the hfrs endemic in northern and central europe is a different entity than hcps caused by sin nombre hantavirus and andv and that the finding of viral rna in saliva from ne patients is a pure coincidence however ne in scandinavia shows several common characteristics with hcps in the americas for example pulmonary involvement and respiratory symptoms are common in ne in addition radiologic examinationdetectable infiltrates decreased pulmonary function and a local inflammatory response in the lungs have previously been demonstrated 2528 could hantaviruses in human saliva be infectious and initiate infection today the only hantavirus suggested to be transmitted between humans is andv 813 by using sophisticated epidemiologic data ferres et al showed that the risk for hcps caused by andv was higher among sex partners of the index case than among other household contacts 13 these investigators suggested that andv needs close person-to-person contact such as sexual relations or deep kissing to be transmitted between humans 13 our finding of hantavirus in saliva support the conclusion that hantavirus infection could be transmitted between humans through saliva such as during kissing or coughing however we do not know at this stage whether the hantavirus rna in saliva detected in our study is infectious when we tried to infect bank voles with human puuv rnapositive saliva no seroconversion was found after 21 days j hardestam et al unpub data furthermore we have not been successful in isolating puuv from saliva specimens by infecting vero e6 cells clinical isolates of hantaviruses do not grow readily on cell lines and mutations of the noncoding regions were shown to be needed for the puuv strain kazan originally isolated from bank voles to grow in vero e6 cells 29 the only human puuv isolate from sweden puuv strain umehu adapted to growth in vero e6 cells was isolated with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocytes from an ne patient and puuv antigen was not detected until 6 months after infection of vero e6 cells 30 how long after onset of disease viral hantavirus rna is present in saliva and whether saliva contains neutralizing antibodies need to be studied further even though andv-specific iga antibodies have been detected in saliva in patients with acute hcps from 5 to 31 days after onset of symptoms 31 detecting hantavirus-specific antibodies in human saliva may be useful for diagnostics and detecting viral rna in saliva could be used as a tool to study hantavirus epidemiology andv rna was shown to be present in human peripheral blood cells for 5 to 15 days before the onset of symptoms 13 and puuv rna was detected in plasma from cynomolgus macaques 4 days before symptoms appeared 32 studies are needed to determine whether the same is true for saliva in animal models if this was the case the hantavirus in antibody-free saliva could have a rather high infectious potential on the other hand saliva has antimicrobial functions 33 and has been shown to inhibit certain viruses such as hiv-1 34 influenza a virus 35 and herpes simplex virus type 1 17 however saliva does not inhibit epstein-barr virus 14 and adenovirus 34 so far little is known regarding the effect of human saliva on hantavirus infectivity but results of experiments we have performed indicate that human saliva could reduce at least part of the infectivity in vitro j hardestam et al unpub data apparently hantaviruses in rodent saliva are infectious but whether the composition of rodent and human saliva differs is not known further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind hantavirus transmission between the natural rodent hosts and humans after finding puuv rna in saliva from ne patients we searched for evidence of possible person-to-person transmission of puuv when the ne patients were followed-up 12 months later we discovered several clusters of household members with ne symptoms however none had severe enough disease to require physician care and no samples were collected for laboratory diagnosis furthermore during the large ne outbreak in early 2007 there was a very high incidence 313100000 of ne in the region where our university hospital is situated 36 since all patients lived in this area we cannot exclude inhalation of rodent excreta as the main or only transmission route although it remains to be clearly shown our results support the hypothesis that person-to-person transmission may occur by this route     included more exhaustive data for specific clades such as the lasiocarpa and acanthophora clades bohs 2004 levin  al 2005  a goal of the current study is to increase taxon sampling for many of the large groups underrepresented in levin  al 2006 with an emphasis on new world species our phylogenetic analysis targets species from sections that have not previously been studied such as sect polytrichum whalen child and samples more intensively from three clades that were previously underrepresented in molecular studies the torva micracantha and erythrotrichum clades these groups have unclear limits and species compositions that have varied in previous classifications in nees 1999 classification these three clades account for 82 of the 185 species 44 of the new world spiny solanums additionally our phylogenetic analysis samples from geographic areas that have been underrepresented including brazil and the caribbean and specifically targets species in sect polytrichum and sect persicariae dunal that are endemic to these areas in this paper we also aim to increase resolution and support of clades within the spiny solanums by using a longer and more variable chloroplast marker trnt-f in place of trns-g used in levin  als 2006 study comparisons of large scale phylogenies within the genus solanum show that trnt-f is nearly twice the length and contains almost twice the number of parsimony-informative characters than trns-g levin  al 2005 levin  al  2006 weese  bohs 2007  we compare our phylogenetic results with previous morphological classifications and where possible identify morphological characters associated with each clade taxon sampling -this study sampled 102 taxa from the leptostemonum clade these represent 44 of the 112 species 39 of the clade sampled in levin  al 2006  we sampled 58 additional species of spiny solanums from groups that were not well represented in levin  al 2006  selected species from clades that levin  al 2006 sampled extensively or that are the focus of other studies were included only to show their higher-level relationships these groups include the lasiocarpa clade bohs 2004  the acanthophora clade levin  al 2005  the androceras clade stern  al 2010  and the old world clade martine  al 2006 l bohs  al unpub data  focal groups of this study include the torva micracantha and erythrotrichum clades the spiny species s polygamum vahl was placed within the leptostemonum clade in levin  al 2006 but was not resolved within any of the major clades it was excluded from this study because its sequences were divergent for all sampled markers making unambiguous alignment difficult spiny solanums in the s wendlandii and s nemorense species groups that have been shown to lie outside of the leptostemonum clade levin  al 2006 were also included non-spiny solanum species in the geminata s argentinum s pseudocapsicum s arboreum brevantherum s abutiloides and s cordovense cyphomandra s betaceum s diploconos s glaucophyllum morelloid s ptychanthum and dulcamaroid s dulcamara clades sensu bohs 2005 and weese  bohs 2007 were included as outgroups and the tree was rooted using s laciniatum a member of the

parsimony analyses were performed on each dataset separately and on the combined dataset using paup v40b10 swofford 2002  all characters were weighted equally in analyses that implemented tree bisection and reconnection tbr branch swapping with 1000 heuristic random-addition replicates each limited to 1000000 swaps per replicate gaps were treated as missing data bootstrapping bs felsenstein

tbr branch-swapping multrees off and gaps treated as missing data prior to bayesian analyses a general model of nucleotide evolution was selected for both the separate and the combined datasets using the akaike information criterion identified in modeltest v37 posada  crandall 1998  mrbayes v31 huelsenbeck  ronquist 2001  was used to analyze each of the separate and combined datasets for each analysis five million generations were run using eight markov chains each initiated from a random tree and sampled every 1000 generations each of the analyses reached a standard deviation below 001 between the chains and all parameters from each analysis were visualized graphically to determine the trees discarded as burn-in prior to achieving stationarity the bayesian analysis reached stationarity and the first 500000 generations were eliminated as burn-in in all analyses phylogenetic analyses -the parsimony strict consensus and bayesian majority-rule consensus trees of all data sets differed only in the degree of resolution with bayesian tree topologies more resolved than parsimony trees table 1  clades with low posterior probabilities pp typically those below 090 pp but occasionally those with up to 10 pp in bayesian analyses were often collapsed in parsimony strict consensus trees descriptive statistics for individual and combined genes are provided table 1  more nodes were strongly supported by combining the data than were obtained in any of the separate analyses topological conflicts -in parsimony analyses each dna sequence region consistently identified the same major well-supported clades comprising identical species groups but relationships among major clades were often not strongly supported bs  90 or were unresolved and thus cannot be considered conflicting under wiens 1998 criteria the bayesian analyses of individual datasets gave some conflicting nodes cutoff at  095 pp however posterior probabilities are known to be inflated relative to bootstrap values cummings  al 2003 erixon  al 2003 simmons  al 2004  our discussion will be based on the parsimony strict consensus tree of the combined dataset which is a conservative hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships fig 1  the parsimony strict consensus trees for the individual markers figs s1-s3 are presented in the electronic supplement higher level phylogenetic relationships -the leptostemonum clade emerges as monophyletic and strongly supported 100 bs 10 pp its overall topology is similar to that of levin  al 2006 but our increased taxon sampling and the use of the more informative trnt-f marker has given a more resolved backbone and more strongly supported nodes our results support the exclusion of the s wendlandii and s nemorense species groups from the leptostemonum clade as proposed by levin  al 2006  these taxa were traditionally placed in solanum subg leptostemonum because they have prickles however the absence of stellate hairs as well as molecular data support their exclusion from the leptostemonum clade with respect to the relationships among the major groups in the leptostemonum clade phylogenetic results place the gardneri clade as sister to the erythrotrichum  thomasiifolium clades 99 bs 10 pp this clade in turn is sister to the remainder of the sampled members of the leptostemonum clade which form a monophyletic group with strong support 94 bs 10 pp within this latter clade the acanthophora and lasiocarpa clades are sister to each other 85 bs 10 pp the androcerascrinitum clade is weakly supported 63 bs 10 pp and is weakly supported as sister to the sisymbriifolium clade 61 bs 10 pp the old world clade is weakly supported as sister to the elaeagnifolium clade 62 bs 10 pp these two clades plus the new world species s hieronymi form a strongly supported monophyletic group 99 bs 10 pp the relationships among the torva micracantha carolinense asterophorum and bahamense clades remain unclear these groups along with three species unassigned to the 14 major clades s campechiense s crotonoides and s multispinum form a large but unsupported polytomy sectional level relationships -the leptostemonum clade is comprised of 14 large well-supported clades 63-100 bs all 10 pp which largely correspond to those of levin  al 2006  there are four taxa that remain unassigned to the 14 clades s campechiense s crotonoides s hieronymi and s multispinum arrows fig 1  table 2 provides a summary of the recognized clades with their bootstrap and posterior probability support values and compares the clade species

nemorense and s wendlandii species groups that are not members of the leptostemonum clade are labeled whereas non-spiny outgroups are not labeled the abbreviations sa and tx for s elaeagnifolium refer to specimens from south america and texas respectively our increased taxon sampling and the use of the more phylogenetically informative trnt-f gene region have led to a more resolved phylogenetic tree than that of levin  al 2006  we recognize 14 major clades in the spiny solanums these clades remain informally named as further re-circumscriptions of sections within the leptostemonum clade should await exhaustive clade by clade studies to avoid further confusion of infrageneric taxonomy we provide descriptions of the major clades below with details of their geographical distribution morphological characters and when possible estimates of expected species numbers provisional species lists for these clades can be found on the solanaceae source webpage www solanaceaesourceorg of particular importance in this study is the division of the robustum clade of levin  al 2006 into the erythrotrichum thomasiifolium and gardneri clades their study suggested two strongly supported clades within the robustum clade one containing s accrescens s robustum and s stagnale and the other containing s agrarium s stenandrum and s microphyllum our increased sampling confirms the presence of two well-supported clades within the robustum clade as suggested by levin  al 2006  here denoted as the erythrotrichum and gardneri clades sampling of taxa not included in levin  al 2006 indicates the presence of a third clade the thomasiifolium clade our study also strengthens the sister relationship of the acanthophora and lasiocarpa clades that was weakly supported in levin  al 2006  finally our study suggests that the androcerascrinitum clade is sister to the sisymbriifolium clade while these results help to clarify the relationships within the leptostemonum clade there remains a largely unresolved group that involves many of the most speciose clades table 2  summary of the 14 clades recognized here with support values the species composition of each clade is compared with whalens

torvum species group and nees 1999 sect torva nees which are concordant in circumscription and contain approximately 45 species the torva clade is consistent with whalen and nees concepts but also includes s poinsettiifolium and s subinerme whalen 1984 placed s subinerme in his s subinerme species group and did not treat s poinsettiifolium nee 1999 placed the two species together in sect micracantha dunal members of the torva clade are scandent to erect shrubs or small trees with usually branched inflorescences straight or occasionally recurved spines stellate corollas with narrow triangular lobes and often abundant interpetalar tissue and small to medium-sized leathery berries with mucilaginous pulp the torva clade is found throughout the neotropics but is most diverse in the andes and is characteristic of secondary vegetation and grazed land with some species most notably s torvum being noxious weeds in the old world solanum poinsettiifolium and s subinerme have recurved prickles simple inflorescences and curved buds and anthers leading whalen 1984 and nee 1999 to exclude them from the s torvum species group and sect torva respectively though both authors noted their probable affinities with these groups these species have narrowly triangular corolla lobes and leathery mucilaginous berries typical of the torva clade and are clearly placed within it on the basis of molecular data within the torva clade there is little bootstrap support for many of the higher-level nodes however many of the sister species relationships are strongly supported clarification of the relationships in this group will undoubtedly require the use of more molecular markers micracantha clade - nee 1999 placed 19 species within sect micracantha we sampled 13 of these species and 9 of these fall within the micracantha clade corresponding to nees 1999 subsection 1 series 1 and 3 and subsection 3 in contrast whalen 1984 included 11 species in his s lanceifolium species group and accounting for changes in nomenclature we sampled all of these the species composition of the micracantha clade recovered in our analysis is more similar to whalens 1984 concept of the group with the inclusion of s jamaicense which he left as an unplaced species both classifications focused on the fact that the plants climb via recurved prickles however as noted below these characteristics appear to have evolved multiple times the micracantha clade is native to the neotropics ranging from south florida through the caribbean and central america and tropical south america to bolivia members of the clade are typically found in disturbed habitats including river banks swamps and forest gaps they have convergent traits with other groups in the leptostemonum clade including a viny habit and recurved prickles found in some species of the torva clade s subinerme s poinsettiifolium the crinitum clade s coriaceum and s sendtnerianum and the thomasiifolium clade s paraibanum s rupincola despite this convergence members of this clade are always vines or scandent shrubs with unbranched inflorescences strictly recurved spines and deeply stellate corollas with strap-shaped lobes and very little interpetalar tissue a revision of the micracantha clade along with further phylogenetic study using additional molecular markers is clarifying the relationships within this group s stern unpub data  carolinense clade -the composition of the carolinense clade is similar to that of levin  al 2006  with the addition of s juvenale and s moxosense it is composed of small rhizomatous erect or prostrate plants with abundant needlelike prickles usually densely spiny calyces except in s moxosense an andromonoecious reproductive system and small to medium-sized green to yellow mottled fruits the group has a disjunct geographic range with s carolinense native to the southeastern united states and the other members native to arid areas of paraguay argentina and bolivia whalen 1984 placed the south american species s aridum as the synonym s conditum cv morton s juvenale and s comptum in his s multispinum species group but kept the north american s carolinense as unplaced nee 1999 placed s aridum s juvenale s comptum and s carolinense in his sect melongena mill dunal subsect lathyrocarpum g don however he also included s hasslerianum which our analysis places in the sisymbriifolium clade and s mortonii which our analysis places in the elaeagnifolium clade neither classification included s moxosense a bolivian species described more recently nee  al 2006  solanum hieronymi and s multispinum were placed with members of the carolinense clade in nees 1999 sect melongena and whalens 1984 s multispinum group due to their similarities in habitat distribution and morphology with species of this clade however our results are similar to those of levin  al 2006 indicating that neither s hieronymi nor s multispinum are supported as members of the carolinense clade discussed below asterophorum clade -the two representatives of the asterophorum clade have not previously been included in phylogenetic studies the species in this clade are native to northeastern s asterophorum and southeastern brazil s piluliferum and characterized by pronounced zig-zag stems with paired and unequal leaves small leaf-opposed inflorescences and accrescent fruiting calyces the strong support for s asterophorum and s piluliferum as sister taxa corresponds to whalens 1984 s asterophorum species group which contained only these two species nee 1999 did not treat s piluliferum but these data refute his placement of s asterophorum in sect polytrichum as our molecular data place s polytrichum in the gardneri clade bahamense clade -similar to the results of levin  al 2006  the two species in the bahamense clade s bahamense and s ensifolium previously referred to as s drymophilum oe schulz are strongly supported as a monophyletic group these species are found in the caribbean and a detailed study of the bahamense species group has shown that it contains an additional species s polyacanthos lam native to hispaniola strickland-constable  al 2010  although there are striking morphological differences within this group most notably in the diminutive leaves flowers and fruits of s polyacanthos these species are united by their scattered needle-like prickles deeply stellate corollas small juicy red or black fruits on strongly recurved fruiting pedicels and the presence of stellate hairs on the adaxial surface of the anthers an unusual characteristic within the spiny solanums whalen 1984 strickland-constable  al 2010  whalens 1984 s bahamense species group contained six species native to the west indies including s bahamense s ensifolium and s polyacanthos the other three species he included are now regarded as synonyms of s bahamense or s ensifolium strickland-constable  al 2010  nee 1999 treated s ensifolium as a synonym of s bahamense and placed it in sect persicariae along with 14 other species aside from s bahamense our analysis sampled six of the species of this section and placed them in at least two different clades our results indicate s gardneri s microphyllum s schomburghii and s tetramerum are part of the gardneri clade s buddleifolium is in the thomasiifolium clade and s crotonoides is unassigned among the 14 clades elaeagnifolium clade -the elaeagnifolium clade is the same as that of levin  al 2006 with the addition of s mortonii that they did not sample members of this clade are rhizomatous herbs with dense almost felt-like pubescence purple corollas and somewhat accrescent fruiting calyces species of the elaeagnifolium clade show pronounced floral dimorphism s elaeagnifolium s mortonii and s hindsianum have flowers that are actinomorphic or nearly so whereas those of s tridynamum are zygomorphic with three long lower and two short upper stamens in the staminate flowers bohs  al 2007  solanum hindsianum and s tridynamum have an unusual fruit type that is erect dry and circumsessile or irregularly dehiscent with the seeds dispersed passively by wind or rain action lester  symon 1989 knapp 2002  members of this clade share morphological characteristics with the carolinense clade such as needle-like spines small to medium-sized yellow or greenish fruits and an andromonoecious reproductive system in those species that have been studied including s elaeagnifolium martine  al 2009  s mortonii hunziker 1979  and s tridynamum bohs  al 2007  this morphological convergence is likely due to the clades inhabiting similar arid habitats in north and south america like the carolinense clade the elaeagnifolium clade has a large geographical disjunction with some members found in the united states and mexico s hindsianum s tridynamum others in south america s mortonii and with s elaeagnifolium found in both areas whalen 1984 placed s elaeagnifolium in the s ellipticum species group and s tridynamum in the s vespertilio species group however these groups both contained species from the old and new world and are clearly not monophyletic since nearly all of the old world spiny solanums form a clade see below whalen left s hindisanum unplaced and did not treat s mortonii nee 1999 placed the members of the elaeagnifolium clade in sect melongena subsect lathyrocarpum however this subsection also contained species that our results place in different clades such as s aridum s comptum and s juvenale carolinense clade s hasslerianum sisymbriifolium clade and s hieronymi and s multispinum which are unassigned to any of the 14 clades old world clade -the four representatives of the old world clade included here are from africa asia and australia and form part of a much larger strongly supported monophyletic group that includes the majority of old world spiny solanums levin  al 2006 weese  bohs 2007  this clade represents a large radiation with a wide range of phenotypes no single or combination of morphological characters appears to define this group the main feature defining this clade is its geographical location as very few species of old world spiny solanums fall outside of the old world clade a few notable exceptions such as s torvum of the torva clade are introductions from the new world whereas a few taxa such as s lasiocarpum and s repandum of the lasiocarpa clade apparently represent independent radiations into the old world from new world ancestors detailed study of the old world spiny solanums is underway and will help to clarify relationships within this clade m vorontsova  al unpub data l bohs  al unpub data  androcerascrinitum clade -species placed in whalens 1984 s rostratum species group and nees 1999 sect androceras nutt whalen s citrullifolium s

urticans s wrightii s crinitum s lycocarpum  our data also support the inclusion of the amazonian s coriaceum and s sendtnerianum as well as the mexican s mitlense in the androcerascrinitum clade while whalen 1984 did not treat either s coriaceum or s sendtnerianum nee 1999 placed these species in sect micracantha based on their viny habit however other morphological characters including large flowers and fruits with swellings on the fruiting calyx support the relationship of these taxa with sect crinitum whalen 1984 left s mitlense as an unplaced taxon but suggested it might be related to the s torvum species group whereas nee 1999 tentatively placed it within sect crinitum also suggesting that it might be a derived member of sect torva these placements were likely due to the disjunct distribution of s mitlense in mexico where many species of sect torva are common whereas the other species in sect crinitum are restricted to south america the morphological characters of s mitlense including habit and flower fruit and seed size are all typical of sect crinitum f farruggia unpub data although the parsimony strict consensus tree fig 1 did not resolve the crinitum group as monophyletic the bayesian analysis of our dataset not shown resulted in a monophyletic androceras clade sister to a monophyletic crinitum clade however the latter had low support 070 pp a more detailed study of sect androceras stern  al 2010 showed that the section is monophyletic and sister to a monophyletic sect crinitum which includes s mitlense and s sendtnerianum s coriaceum was not sampled this difference in our parsimony analysis and the result of stern  al 2010 is likely due to the exhaustive sampling from sect androceras in the latter study whereas here only three placeholder taxa were included from the approximately 12 species in the section solanum sect crinitum is under further morphological and molecular study f farruggia unpub data to examine its monophyly and the phylogenetic relationships among its component species sections androceras and crinitum have distinct morphologies and geographic ranges and it is expected that further studies with broader taxonomic sampling and additional molecular markers will support each as a monophyletic group members of sect androceras are among the most recognizable of the spiny solanums because of their distinctive zygomorphic heterantherous enantiostylous flowers dry fruits with a persistent prickly and accrescent calyx and their primarily north temperate distribution stern  al 2010  this contrasts with sect crinitum which is composed of large shrubs trees or woody vines with some of the largest flowers and fruits in the genus members of sect crinitum also have unique swellings on the fruiting calyx fruits that oxidize black when cut open and a center of diversity in tropical south america sisymbriifolium clade -the sisymbriifolium clade contains two species s sisymbriifolium and s hasslerianum that have not previously been placed together both are found in paraguay and northern argentina but s sisymbriifolium also has a broader distribution through the andes into northern south america these species are robust herbs or small shrubs with deeply pinnately lobed leaves and spiny accrescent fruiting calyces whalen 1984 left s sisymbriifolium unplaced and he included s hasslerianum in the s polytrichum species group along with s hexandrum s polytrichum s stagnale and s urticans that were sampled here our results show that the latter four species belong to three different clades and none appear closely related to s hasslerianum nee 1999 placed s sisymbriifolium and s hasslerianum in separate subsections within his sect melongena each associated with species that emerge in other clades in the molecular phylogenies evidently these placements were based on convergent morphological characters and do not reflect phylogenetic relatedness acanthophora and lasiocarpa clades -the acanthophora clade largely corresponds to whalens 1984 s mammosum species group and nees 1999 sect acanthophora dunal which was monographed by nee 1979  levin  al 2005 showed that s agrarium and s stenandrum which had traditionally been placed in sect acanthophora clearly do not belong within this group our data support this exclusion but otherwise support the traditional circumscription of sect acanthophora the lasiocarpa clade corresponds to the s quitoense species group of whalen 1984 and nees 1999 sect lasiocarpa dunal darcy which was taxonomically revised by whalen  al 1981  bohs 2004 and our data both support the monophyly of the lasiocarpa clade the acanthophora and lasiocarpa clades are both native to the neotropics with a few species in the lasiocarpa clade including s ferox l s lasiocarpum and s repandum g forst and perhaps one species of the acanthophora clade s aculeatissimum jacq native in the old world bohs 2004 levin  al 2005  the acanthophora clade includes some of the most vicious examples of the spiny solanums with needle-like prickles found throughout the plant and the unusual feature of exclusively simple hairs on the upper leaf surfaces in most species nee 1979  the lasiocarpa clade can be distinguished by its large shallowly lobed leaves unbranched infloresences and typically large fruits covered with stellate hairs whalen  al 1981  we chose to sample a few representative species from each clade because they were well-sampled in levin  al 2006  building on phylogenetic work by bohs 2004 on the lasiocarpa clade and levin  al 2005 for the acanthophora clade these clades were found to be sister to each other in levin  al 2006  but with low support 64 bs our analysis strongly supports the lasiocarpa clade as sister to the acanthophora clade 85 bs 10 pp we included two additional species not previously sampled s vaillantii and an undescribed brazilian species which our data place in the acanthophora clade whalen 1984 and nee 1999 placed s vaillantii in their s mammosum species group and sect acanthophora respectively these groups correspond to our acanthophora clade the undescribed species matches the description given for solanum sp 1 in mentz  oliveira 2004 and a named but unpublished species included in nee 1979  it is from southeastern brazil and has morphological characters that are typical of the acanthophora clade including needle-like prickles and simple hairs on the upper leaf surfaces erythrotrichum clade -the erythrotrichum clade is distinguished from other spiny solanum groups by its plurifoliate sympodial units the presence of recurved prickles a ferruginous to reddish tomentum with stellate-glandular trichomes an andromonoecious reproductive system and pubescent fruits with large seeds agra 2008  there appear to be three centers of diversity for this group central america northeastern brazil and the andes of peru and ecuador as defined here the erythrotrichum clade is morphologically homogeneous and largely congruent with nees 1999 sect erythrotrichum whalen child which included s accrescens s megalonyx s paludosum and s robustum and whalens 1984 s erythrotrichum species group which included s accrescens s decompositiflorum s decorum s megalonyx and s robustum whalen 1984 did not include s paludosum s reflexiflorum and s rhytidoandrum in his treatment while nee 1999  did not treat s decorum s decompositiflorum s reflexiflorum and s rhytidoandrum in more recent treatments agra 2004  2008 listed all of these species as members of sect erythrotrichum except s reflexiflorum which she left as a species of uncertain placement however s robustum was not included in her revision of sect erythrotrichum agra 2004 or her key to the section agra 2008 the erythrotrichum clade also includes s absconditum and s jabrense that were described by agra 2004 agra   2008 after the publications of whalen 1984 and nee 1999 and considered by her to belong to sect erythrotrichum levin  al 2006 sampled three species from the erythrotrichum clade s accrescens s robustum s stagnale and found them to form a well-supported monophyletic group included within their robustum clade our increased sampling now encompassing 9 of the 22 species included in sect erythrotrichum by agra 2008 reveals that they all form a wellsupported monophyletic group that also includes s hexandrum s reflexiflorum s robustum and s stagnale that agra 2008 did not treat solanum hexandrum and s stagnale have not been included in sect erythrotrichum by previous authors whalen 1984 and nee 1999 included both species in the s polytrichum species group and sect polytrichum respectively agra 2007 included s hexandrum in sect polytrichum but left s stagnale unplaced according to our results these species clearly belong to the erythrotrichum clade within the erythrotrichum clade s hexandrum s robustum and s stagnale form a monophyletic group but with poor bootstrap support the three species are morphologically similar with large decurrent leaf blades and accrescent fruiting calyces solanum reflexiflorum was not treated by whalen 1984 or nee 1999  and agra 2007 left it unplaced this species endemic to the state of bahia brazil has reduced infloresences small flowers with reflexed calyx lobes and glabrous fruits but is evidently a member of the erythrotrichum clade according to molecular data thomasiifolium clade -the thomasiifolium clade is difficult to define morphologically as it contains two seemingly distinct groups both found in eastern brazil these include the shrubby to scandent s thomasiifolium and s buddleifolium and the vines s paraibanum and s rupincola all have plurifoliate sympodial units and pale lilac to blue or violet flowers with somewhat coriaceous corollas the latter two climb using recurved prickles and have large densely pubescent fruits with large seeds the shrubs s thomasiifolium and s buddleifolium have straight spines and smaller glabrous fruits with smaller seeds the thomasiifolium clade includes species from whalens 1984 s polytrichum species group s rupincola taxa he left unplaced s buddleifolium s thomasiifolium and s paraibanum which was described after his conspectus was published agra 1992  nee 1999 placed s buddleifolium in sect persicariae s paraibanum in sect micracantha and did not treat s rupincola he tentatively placed s thomasiifolium in both sections erythrotrichum and persicariae because it shares morphological characteristics of both sections we have chosen to separate the thomasiifolium clade from its sister group the erythrotrichum clade due to its moderate support as a monophyletic and morphologically distinct group this clade is in need of more morphological and molecular study and additional field work and further study may show that it should be broken into two or more discrete clades gardneri clade -members of the gardneri clade are native from eastern to central brazil s agrarium s gardneri s polytrichum s stenandrum or the caribbean s microphyllum s schomburghii s tetramerum with one species from northern peru s talarense defining the gardneri clade morphologically is difficult possible uniting characteristics include a slender-stemmed herbaceous to shrubby habit straight often needle-like prickles small leaves in many species short laterally directed inflorescences somewhat accrescent fruiting calyces and preferences for arid habitats species in the gardneri clade come from multiple groups of previous classifications whalen 1984 left s gardneri s microphyllum and s tetramerum as the synonym s aquartia dunal as unplaced species although he noted that the latter two were probably related to each other he placed s polytrichum in the s polytrichum species group s stenandrum and s agrarium in the s mammosum species group and did not treat s schomburghii or s talarense nee 1999 also placed the species in disparate groups with s gardneri s microphyllum s schomburghii and s tetramerum as s aculeatum jacq oe schulz in sect persicariae s polytrichum in sect polytrichum and s stenandrum s agrarium and s talarense in sect acanthophora the gardneri clade also includes an undescribed species from brazil extensive sampling of whalens 1984 s mammosum species group and nees 1999 sect acanthophora by levin  al 2005 revealed that s stenandrum and s agrarium lie outside the acanthophora clade despite the presence of mainly simple hairs on the adaxial leaf surfaces a hallmark of the group levin  al 2006 obtained this same result in their broader study of the spiny solanums s stenandrum and s agrarium did not belong to the acanthophora clade but instead formed a well-supported group with s microphyllum that was included as part of their robustum clade with our increased taxonomic sampling we now recognize three clades the erythrotrichum thomasiifolium and gardneri clades within the robustum clade of levin  al 2006  solanum stenandrum and s agrarium are morphologically similar to s talarense from northern peru and an undescribed species from the planalto of central brazil all share exclusively or predominantly simple and often glandular pubescence on the adaxial leaf surfaces small leaves and few-flowered inflorescences with white or greenish yellow corollas all except s stenandrum have a largely prostrate growth habit and all four species are adapted to arid habitats the remaining species of the gardneri clade are a somewhat heterogeneous assemblage two species s microphyllum and s tetramerum have similar morphologies including densely pubescent reduced leaves likely due to their similar habitats in xeric areas of the caribbean solanum schomburghii and s gardneri have similar appearances due to their dense white stellate hairs and very long tapering anthers finally s polytrichum is very distinctive due to its long bristly pubescence and the prickly calyces that nearly completely cover the fruit more sampling from eastern brazil and the caribbean will improve our phylogenetic understanding of the gardneri clade however current results are sufficient to state that neither sect polytrichum nor sect persicariae as circumscribed by nee 1999 are monophyletic taxa unassigned among the 14 clades -despite broader sampling four taxa s campechiense s crotonoides s hieronymi and s multispinum remain unassigned among the 14 clades recognized here these are all taxa that also were unplaced in levin  al 2006  solanum campechiense a species from marshy areas of central america the caribbean and northeastern south america continues to be an enigmatic species its sequences are highly divergent and it has distinctive morphological characteristics including a sprawling habit abundant straight prickles deeply lobed leaves and green yellow or purplish fruits surrounded by accrescent spiny calyces both nee 1999 and whalen 1984 suggested a relationship between s campechiense and s sisymbriifolium but this relationship is not supported by our data solanum crotonoides is known only from montane forests of hispaniola and is unusual in the spiny solanums in its dioecious reproductive system and strongly discolorous leaves due to almost lepidote pubescence on the abaxial surfaces nee 1999 placed s crotonoides in sect persicariae which is clearly not monophyletic see discussion under gardneri clade whalen 1984 placed s crotonoides in the s crotonoides species group along with three other species from the caribbean none of which were sampled in this study sampling these and other caribbean species is key for understanding its phylogenetic affinities as in levin  al 2006  s hieronymi is supported as sister to the elaeagnifolium  old world clades it is found in argentina bolivia and paraguay and has morphological similarities with the elaeagnifolium clade including a rhizomatous herbaceous habit needle-like spines and a densely spiny accrescent calyx finally s multispinum also remains unplaced it is found in argentina paraguay and adjacent regions of brazil and is a small rhizomatous herb with abundant needle-like prickles an andromonoecious reproductive system and mottled yellowgreen fruits its morphology and distribution point to it being related to members of the carolinense clade however molecular data are at present inconclusive as to its relationships steps to a systematic revision of the spiny solanums -a major contribution of this study is the identification of 14 major well-supported clades within the spiny solanums using many new world taxa sampled here for the first time in many cases these clades are defined by unique morphological features and or geographical ranges future studies are underway to resolve some of the remaining polytomies and ambiguously placed taxa using newly developed cosii markers wu  al 2006 rodriguez  al 2009 and additional chloroplast markers shaw  al 2007 miller  al 2009  further taxonomic sampling particularly from brazilian and caribbean species is likely to identify new clades within the spiny solanums and clarify relationships within the asterophorum gardneri thomasiifolium and erythrotrichum clades more detailed studies of specific clades particularly the old world clade and s crinitum species group are in progress using much greater sampling density than that reported here these molecular analyses in concert with morphological studies should lead us in the near future to a detailed understanding of evolutionary relationships in the large complex and widely distributed

menichella cristina russo   influenza is one of the most common respiratory infectious diseases and is responsible for between 3 and 5 million cases of severe influenza illness each year 1 the influenza viruses are members of the orthomyxoviridae family and contain a single-stranded rna genome that is distributed in eight separate segments there are three types of influenza viruses a b and c 2 that have different structural arrangements of internal nucleoprotein and matrix protein antigens the segmented genome may be responsible for the development of pandemic strains whereas mutations aminoacid substitutions may be responsible for the development of influenza epidemics 3 influenza typically results in mild-to-moderate illness in healthy individuals however disease severity tends to increase in children the elderly and individuals with chronic medical conditions pulmonary cardiovascular liver renal and neurological diseases or immunosuppression children are more susceptible to infection 4 with annual incidence rates up to 30  5 in particular children under 5 years of age are more susceptible to contracting influenza since they are an immunologically nave population 6 moreover they can also be considered the primary transmitters of influenza in the community 7 8 and shed virus at higher viral titers and for a longer period than adults 9 community based surveillance programs have found that the h3n2 subtype is detected more frequently in adults while h1n1 and influenza b viruses are detected more often in children 10 after the beginning of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic

flua 3362 were female and 2962 male while for the flub patients 2571 were female and 4671 male p  0320 all patients involved were between 0 and 16 years old the highest number of cases of fluah1n1 was observed in children less than 1 year of age the flub byamagata1688 lineage was most prevalent in children ranging from 3 to 6 years old infections with the less prevalent flua h3n2 and flub bvictoria0287 strains were homogeneously distributed across the different age groups fig 1 there were no significant differences by one-way anova analysis between the flua and flub patients in terms

 fever was the most common symptom in flu positive patients in patients with flub a fever 38 c range 37379 c was significantly more frequent than flua p  0019 and patients affected by flua had a significantly higher frequency of respiratory simptoms p  0034 than patients with flub apnea was equally distributed in flua and flub patients no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of laryngitis pharyngitis bronchitis bronchiolitis bronchopneumonia pneumonia or pertussis twenty five patients presented with neoplasiahematological malignancies or a severe underlying disease such as chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems metabolic diseases and neurological disorders that were clustered in congenital and genetic disorders table 1 in patients suffering from underlying diseases flua infection was more prevalent than flub p  0044 the normal concentration of crp in healthy human serum ranges from 0 to 050 mgdl in the flu patients the mean crp value was 171  254 for flua patients and 114  172 for flub patients a value  050 was obtained in 45  of flua cases and in 46  of flub information related to the department where patients were admitted is shown in table 1 patients accessed the hospital through the emergency unit in 337  of flua and 663  of flub cases p  0017 the median of length of stay was 5 days range 059 for flua and 3 days range 0116 for flub community acquired influenza infections were equally distributed between the flua and flub patients while among nosocomial infections flub was responsible for 909  versus 91  of flua p  0039 there were no significant differences observed in the frequency of co-infections between the different types of flu among the 62 patients infected with flua 18 2903  co-infections with other respiratory pathogens were detected 13 of which were co-infections with respiratory viruses and 5 were with bacteria in 71 patients infected with influenza b 11 155  co-infections were detected 7 of which were co-infections with viruses and 4 were with bacteria there were no co-infections detected in patients with the bvictoria0287 lineage the respiratory pathogens responsible for the co-infections are listed in table 2
 the distribution of influenza cases during the 20122013 season is shown in fig 2 the peak incidence of positive cases was between the 5th and 11th week of 2013 the highest incidence occurred for flua and b in the 7th and 8th week respectively corresponding to the middle of february fig 3 the first flua case was detected at the end of november 2012 and started circulating earlier than flub which was first detected at the end of december 2012

 in this study a comparison of the clinical features presented in children admitted to our hospital resulted positive for flua and b infections was analyzed bambino ges childrens hospital is a reference pediatric centre for the care and treatment of children coming from central and southern italy flub was slightly more prevalent 5338  than flua 4662  in the study population this is consistent with the 20122013 ecdc surveillance report that reported a similar proportion of seasonal flua and b in europe however flua peaked and declined slightly before flub and the highest infection frequency was evident during the winter season our data show a similar seasonal trend for flua and b however in contrast to the data reported by the ecdc the circulation of flua ended later than flub our results were consistent too with the prevalence of fluah1n1 34  fluah3n2 5  and flub 58  in italy during the 20122013 flu season reported to influnet a sentinel surveillance system for influenza 17 influnet also reported 3  of flua cases that were not subtyped however these data reflect the whole population and our data are concerned with only pediatric patients the results of laboratory testing and clinical findings were compared for flua and flub patients to investigate clinical differences between the groups no consistent differences were observed in the clinical presentation of patients by subtype viral according to results of studies about the clinical characteristics of patients positive for influenza a and b 18 males seemed to be more susceptible to contracting flu compared to females and specifically flub this is concordant with previous studies in which the greater humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of females to viral antigens was demonstrated to play an important role in determining the gender variability in viral infections and in females being beneficial against infectious diseases 19 with regard to the age distribution flua was more common in children less than 1 year old where they can cause more severe infections confirming previous studies 20 21 and flub was more common in school age children moreover length of stay in children with flua was significantly higher than those infected with flub being the median 5 days range 059 for flua and 3 days range 0116 for flub specifically this long hospital stay 59 and 116 days was for flua in a patient with complications due to tracheostomy procedure while for flub a nosocomial infection occurred in a oncoematological patient this finding is unsual since that in a previuos study children with influenza b in comparison with those infected by ah1n1 influenza virus had significantly higher hospitalization rates p  005 20 is possible to speculate that the longer hospitalization for flua patients be correlated to the major cases with fever 38 c and respiratory simptoms no significant differences were observed in crp levels between flua and b patients and a similar frequency of patients with elevated crp was detected in both flua and b fever was confirmed as a major influenza symptom 21 22 a similar number of flua and flub patients presented with a temperature 38 however flub patients were significantly more likely to have a fever 38 c than flua patients in contrast respiratory symptoms were mainly detected in flua patients table 1 pre-existing diseases condition the clinical expression of influenza resulting in a greater number of these children developing lower respiratory tract infection 23 we found that flu patients with underlying malignancies such as lymphoma leukemia solid tumor or tubulopathy were more susceptible to flub infection in agreement with data previously reported 24 in contrast patients with congenital diseases hypoplastic left heart syndrome neuromotor disorder swyer james syndrome epilepsy cerebral palsy laryngotracheal cleft or immune deficiency and genetic preexisting conditions cystic fibrosis sickle-cell anemia trisomy of chromosome 10 or niemann pick disease were more susceptible to flua infection this is probably related to flua patients younger than those with flub in our study 12133 902  of flu infections were hospital acquired with flub being the principal etiological agent responsible patients that contracted nosocomial infections were mainly immunosuppressed and admitted through the iifu 8 cases flub followed by the pediatrics 2 cases flub and 1 flua and surgery 1 case flua units numerous examples of nosocomial flu outbreaks have been reported in long-term care facilities for the elderly experimental evidences supports the fact that humans generate infectious particles in both respiratory droplets and aerosols and that their generation is enhanced during influenza illness 25 moreover children who do not have or minimal immunity against influenza viruses and immunocompromised individuals who can shed virus for long periods of time at high titers have already been pinpointed as good transmitters in comparison to healthy adults however it is unclear why flub in comparison to flua should cause a more severe infection in the group of immunosuppressed and moreover in the population object of the study the number of patients with malignancies is low and it is difficult to establish if the difference is really significant in our study there were no significant differences between co-infections with viral or bacterial pathogens in flua and b patients all of the co-infections investigated were in children with a mean age less than 5 years one death was reported in a flua patient affected by quadriplegia and chronic respiratory failure it is possible that flua could have been responsible for further impeding the patients ability to breathe there were some limitations in this study being a retrospective study it was not possible to collect more clinical data as well as the information about the vaccination history of patients that tested positive for flua and b in addition this was a single-center study and only one year was analysed our study was primarily focused on the clinical presentation of flua and flub infections to provide additional information concerning the clinical presentation of pediatric influenza no outcomes due to other respiratory viruses were evaluated further studies that describe how co infections with other viruses impact flu infections could be useful to our knowledge there is limited published data regarding the clinical differences between seasonal flua and b in pediatrics after the 2009 pandemics the main findings from our study confirm that although fever is a major component of influenza a and b presentation respiratory symptoms were more severe and the length of the hospital stay was longer for flua patients than flub patients concluding that the increasing of flub in the season 20122013 was without any dramatic change in clinical manifestation although some studies have reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain diarrhea and vomiting to be more common with flub infection 26 this was not the case in this study the different viral types and subtypes should be routinely identifed by diagnostic laboratory to best address clinicians to appropiate therapeutic measures in summary our results suggest that the clinical features correlated to different flu viruses and to the relevant subtypes should be taken into consideration by health authorities to implement prevention strategies with the aim to reduce the number of sick subjects the prevalence of hospitalization and the circulation of flu  emerging and reemerging virus diseases of vertebrates bwj mahy   it became apparent during the last two decades of the twentieth century that new infectious diseases were increasingly being recognized in the human and animal populations this led to the establishment of a formal committee of the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences usa who reported on their deliberations in 1992 in a report edited by joshua lederberg and richard shope this was followed 10 years later by a second report edited by mark smolinski margaret hamburg and joshua lederberg which appeared in 2003 among the factors they cited as contributing to emergence were microbial adaptation and change human susceptibility to infection climate and weather changing ecosystems economic development and land use human demographics and behavior technology and industry international travel and commerce breakdown of public health measures poverty and social inequality war and famine lack of political will and finally intent to harm the advent of highly specific molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction pcr in the early 1980s permitted the detection and grouping of viruses on the basis of genome nucleotide sequence analysis and in several respects these techniques have replaced serological analyses for the characterization of viruses although it is still important to isolate viruses in cell culture for their complete characterization it is now possible directly to detect viruses in diseased tissues by pcr then by sequencing the amplicon to determine whether a new virus has emerged to cause the disease in fact many viruses which do not readily grow in cell culture can only be differentiated by sequence analysis the papillomaviruses are an example their study was very difficult until the advent of sequence analysis which now has revealed more than 100 types in humans and many more in animals and birds for differentiation three virus genes e6 e7 and l1 are sequenced and if the combined sequence of these three genes differs by more than 10 from known papillomaviruses the virus is considered to be a new type other viruses which have not been grown in cell culture include many caliciviruses and the ubiquitous anelloviruses such as torque-teno tt virus which can be detected and sequenced in the blood of most humans and many other vertebrate species hepatitis c virus was originally described as non-a non-b hepatitis virus because of the severe disease it caused but the virus would not grow in cell culture and eventually was detected in blood known to be infected with the virus by reverse transcription of the rna present using random primers then expressing the resultant dna in the bacteriophage lambda gt 11 thousands of clones were screened using patient blood as a source of antibody before positive clones were detected which then allowed the development of enzyme immunoassays that could detect the virus in blood and so were used to screen blood destined for transfusion saving millions of lives worldwide once the complete genome of hepatitis c virus was sequenced it became apparent that there are many different genotypes circulating in the world with different pathogenic properties nucleotide sequence analysis has also been extremely useful in tracing the origins of viruses for example when hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by a bunyavirus of rodents sin nombre virus was initially detected in 1993 in the four corners region of western usa it was found that rodents inside a house where people had been infected carried a virus identical in sequence to virus isolated from human cases however rodents caught at various distances from the house had increasingly variable genome rna sequences providing strong evidence that these rodents deer mice peromyscus maniculatus were the source of the infection subsequently more than 30 other hantaviruses some of which also cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans were isolated from rodents throughout north and south america each new virus seems to be associated with a different genetic variant of rodent host and all rodents that carry the virus belong to the subfamily sigmodontinae unique to the american continent a particularly powerful tool for the initial recognition of an emerging virus is the application of immunohistochemistry to diseased tissues provided a comprehensive collection of antibodies is available the particular virus or related group of viruses can often be detected for example when hendra virus first appeared in 1995 in australia causing the death of a horse trainer and 14 of his horses antibody against the virus was sent to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc then in 1999 cdc was asked to investigate a newly emerged epidemic that had appeared in malaysia killing more the 100 people and causing disease in many pigs initially it was suspected to be caused by a virus related to japanese encephalitis virus but a virus was isolated from the pigs that replicated in vero cells and reacted in an immunofluorescence test against the hendra virus antiserum this could subsequently be used on patient tissues to study the pathogenesis of the disease and after comparison of the genome sequences of hendra virus and nipah virus they were found to be closely related and are now classified in the genus henipavirus of the paramyxoviridae finally molecular methods can be used to detect new emerging viruses in the absence of disease in the host in 2001 allander and colleagues searched for rna viruses in human respiratory secretions using random primer pcr and discovered a hitherto unknown parvovirus with a sequence related to the bovine and canine parvoviruses which are grouped together in the genus bocavirus the new virus was called human bocavirus and many research groups worldwide have now confirmed the presence of the virus particularly in pediatric samples although it is still not certain how important this virus is in causing morbidity and mortality their method also amplified a human coronavirus from the respiratory samples and when sequenced this turned out to be hku1 a recently emerged coronavirus detected by scientists at hong kong university it is possible that a systematic search of human samples using such molecular techniques might reveal more hitherto unknown human viruses in some cases the emerging viruses themselves have contributed to other viruses emerging and reemerging in the population this is especially true of human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids which rapidly spread following its emergence in the early 1980s to infect more than 40 million people worldwide by the end of the twentieth century because of its severe effects on the immune system the virus leads to numerous other infections in the hiv-infected population for example picobirnaviruses that had been detected in fecal samples from chickens and rabbits were difficult to detect in human fecal samples until a cohort of men with aids was examined and in these humans picobirnavirus was detected for the first time some rare diseases have become common in persons with aids for example the human polyomavirus known as jc virus can cause the rare brain disorder known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml normally the virus remains dormant in the kidney but in hiv-infected individuals the hiv-encoded transactivator tat acts as a transactivator of jcv leading to pml which progresses to death within 4 months after infection other important virus infections which emerge in aids patients are human herpesviruses cytomegalovirus herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 varicella-zoster virus and human herspesvirus 8 which causes kaposis sarcoma hiv is mainly spread through sexual activity between an infected and a noninfected person and is most common in those who indulge in high-risk sexual behavior with multiple partners it can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected blood and is common in persons who indulge in intravenous drug use particularly when needles syringes or equipment used to prepare drugs for injection are shared it is therefore an example of a virus disease which is dependent on risky human behavior for its maintenance in the human population the ability of such new infections to spread in the population has been greatly enhanced by population growth and ease of movement as a result of rapid air travel a dramatic recent example of this was the appearance of the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in late 2002 which spread by air travel from a single infected chinese physician who infected 12 persons in a hong kong hotel these infected persons then traveled by air and spread the infection to more than 8000 individuals worldwide 10 of whom died the virus then apparently receded from the human population in july 2003 only recently was it discovered that the sars coronavirus has a natural reservoir in chinese horseshoe bats rhinolophus sinicus some other species such as himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs from which the virus has been isolated may serve as amplification hosts following the recognition of the human coronavirus sars research on coronaviruses intensified and this led to the discovery in 2004 of two previously unrecognized human viruses one found by hong kong university called hku1 virus and another reported almost simultaneously from the netherlands called nl63 and from yale university called new haven coronavirus the latter viruses probably represent two isolates of the same virus species they are clearly associated with lower respiratory tract infection in children but initially it was claimed that new haven coronavirus was also associated with kawasaki disease in children this intriguing claim was rapidly investigated and refuted by several different groups in japan taiwan and elsewhere and the cause of kawasaki disease which has features resembling a virus infection remains unknown in 2012 another novel human coronavirus was isolated from sputum from a fatal case of severe respiratory disease in the arabian peninsula the virus now called middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has since been detected in more than 187 patients with respiratory disease 97 of whom died in november 2013the mnistry of health in saudi arabia was notified of case of mers-cov infectionin a 43 year-old male patient who had cared for ill dromedary camels in his herd of 9 animals starting in early october the patient was confirmed with mers-coronavirus by real-time pcr and limited sequencing found the mers-coronavirus in three of the dromedary camels other studies have detected mers-coronavirus-infected dromedary camels in several other regions in saudi arabiabut it remains unclear whether camels are an important source of the virus fror transmission to humans and whether bats also play a role as was the case with the sars-coronavirus a majority of recent emerging virus diseases have been zoonoses ie diseases transmitted from animals to humans under natural conditions some of the more important of these include hiv-1 which was transmitted to humans from chimpanzees in central africa around 1931 and hiv-2 transmitted from sooty mangabeys to humans in west africa around 1940 other important recent examples are the viruses of the genus henipavirus hendra virus was first recognized through a disease outbreak in some horse stables in hendra queensland australia when 14 horses and their trainer died from pulmonary disease with hemorrhagic manifestations in 1994 the reservoir of the virus was found to be in large fruit-eating bats pteropus spp and one year later a horse farmer 600 miles away in mackay queensland died of encephalitis from the same virus then in 1999 a related virus was discovered in malaysia following a major outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs and neurological disease in humans in their close contact more than 100 humans died and in a successful effort to control the disease 11 million pigs were slaughtered the causative virus was isolated from a fatal human case that had lived in nipah river village and so was named nipah virus hendra and nipah viruses are clearly members of the family paramyxoviridae but have been placed in a separate genus as their rna genome is about 19 kb in length larger than that of any other paramyxovirus nipah virus like hendra virus was found to have a reservoir in pteropus bats and has since been identified in fatal human disease outbreaks in india in 2003 and bangladesh in 2004 other new viruses which apparently have a reservoir in fruit bats include menangle virus a new paramyxovirus which emerged in a commercial piggery near sydney australia to cause stillbirths and abortion in pigs menangle virus also caused disease in two workers in the piggery a new virus related to menangle virus emerged during an investigation of urine samples from pteropid bats collected on tioman island off the coast of malaysia in 2001 and was named tioman virus during the same investigation a new orthoreovirus was isolated from pteropus hypomelanus in 1999 and called pulau virus and more recently a related orthoreovirus called melaka virus was isolated from a human case of acute respiratory disease in melaka malaysia serological studies of sera collected from human volunteers on tioman island showed that 13 had antibodies against both pulau and malaka viruses another important group of zoonotic diseases are rodent-borne and caused by members of the genus hantavirus of the family bunyaviridae these viruses first emerged during the korean war of 195052 when thousands of un troops developed a mysterious disease with fever headache hemorrhage and renal failure with a fatality rate of 510 it was more than a quarter of a century before the causative virus was isolated from field mice in korea and named hantaan virus the cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs in humans then in 1993 a new hantavirus emerged in the four corners region of southwestern usa as the cause of a severe acute respiratory disease syndrome with a fatality rate close to 40 and named sin nombre virus this virus was shown to be transmitted to humans by inhalation of virus present in the urine feces or saliva of deer mice peromyscus maniculatus it seems likely that this disease had existed for many years and was only recognized in 1993 because of a clustering of human cases as a result of a regional upsurge in the rodent population resulting from climatic conditions causing increased availability of rodent food fortunately in most of these infections humans appear to be a dead-end host and transmission between humans does not occur except with the andes virus in south america rodent-borne viruses of the family arenaviridae also cause a number of serious zoonotic diseases in humans the old world arenaviruses such as lassa fever virus have been known for some time but still cause thousands of fatal hemorrhagic fever cases every year in west africa however new world arenaviruses such as junin virus causing argentinian hemorrhagic fever and machupo virus causing bolivian hemorrhagic fever have long been recognized in south america recently new arenaviruses have emerged probably as a result of deforestation which results in rodents seeking shelter in human habitation and brings them into closer contact with people these viruses include guanarito virus that causes venezuelan hemorrhagic fever with 36 mortality rate from confirmed cases and sabia virus isolated in 1990 that causes brazilian hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate including two laboratory acquired cases rabies is a zoonotic disease of great antiquity that has mainly been associated with carnivores such as dogs the virus is excreted in the saliva of infected animals and following infection it moves through the nervous system to attack the brain causing aggressive behavior which results in the animal biting humans and animals with which it comes into contact and thereby spreading the virus infection fortunately due to early work by louis pasteur a vaccine was developed that protects humans or other animals from infection and can also be given immediately post exposure and the domestic dog population in the developed world is vaccinated and does not pose a risk to humans however in some developing countries it is not uncommon for a rabid dog to bite and infect more than 25 people before it can be put down and worldwide there are still some 30 000 human rabies deaths per year using molecular sequencing techniques it is now possible to distinguish the genotypes of rabies viruses associated with different species of host as the virus has become adapted through frequent transmission between members of the same host species in the usa there are six recognized terrestrial animal genotypes in raccoons in eastern states skunks in north-central states skunks in south-central states coyotes in southern texas red foxes in alaska gray foxes in arizona and several genotypes associated with particular species of bat in fact most fatal cases of human rabies in the usa can now be traced to bats which are often not detected when the person is bitten so rabies is not suspected and vaccination is not undertaken until the disease has taken hold many important virus diseases are spread by arthropods and exposure to new arthropods and the viruses they carry is critical to the emergence of new virus diseases dengue hemorrhagic fever is caused by dengue virus which is transmitted mainly by the asian mosquito aedes albopictus and dengue fever is one of the most rapidly emerging diseases in tropical regions of the world there are four serotypes of dengue virus and it seems that consecutive infections with two antigenic types can lead to the more serious disease of dengue hemorrhagic fever with shock syndrome which if untreated can result in up to 50 mortality unfortunately through the importation of vehicle tires containing water from korea the asian mosquito was introduced into the usa and is now present in several regions of the southern states it can act as a vector not only for dengue virus but also for california encephalitis virus in europe the emergence of two important animal diseases has occurred through the movement of arthropod vectors into the iberian peninsula african horse sickness virus causes a disease that can be fatal to horses mules and donkeys and is transmitted by nocturnal biting flies of the genus culicoides these were introduced inadvertently into spain and the disease is now endemic around madrid and regions to the south african swine fever virus is transmitted by ticks of the genus ornithodorus and it causes a fatal disease resembling classical swine fever in domestic pigs it first emerged in portugal and spain in 1957 france in 1964 italy in 1967 and cuba in 1971 through slaughter of infected animals the disease was eradicated from europe except sardinia by 1995 the most recent dramatic example of the movement of a virus vector is provided by west nile virus a flavivirus first isolated in uganda in 1937 this virus uses birds as a reservoir host and is transmitted from birds to humans and other vertebrates by mosquitoes in 1999 cases of encephalitis in new york were found to have been caused by a strain of west nile virus that was phylogenetically similar to a virus isolated from geese in israel at the same time many birds especially corvids began dying in new york state since the introduction in 1999 west nile virus has become well established throughout the usa and moved north into canada and south into the caribbean and into mexico it is not known how the virus moved from israel to the usa but the most reasonable explanation is that it was carried in an infected mosquito or possibly an infected bird in the hold of an aircraft transmission by an infected human seems less likely since the titer of virus in human blood is usually too low for efficient mosquito transmission it is clear nevertheless that once it arrived in north america west nile virus found an extremely favorable environment with abundant avian and arthropod hosts that facilitated its spread throughout the american continent the emergence of new viruses is likely to continue as viruses evolve and find new ecological niches in the human and animal population it is noticeable that most newly recognized viruses have been rna viruses perhaps since rna evolves at a faster rate than dna for which host cells have developed efficient proofreading enzymes it will be important in the future to detect new viruses before they can emerge to cause disease in the population the sars epidemic provides an excellent example before the epidemic only two human coronaviruses were known human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 despite the fact that serious coronavirus diseases were well known in other vertebrates such as feline infectious peritonitis and avian infectious bronchitis virus it was not until the sars epidemic that research on human coronaviruses led to the discovery of three new human coronaviruses  sars hku1 and nl63new haven there are other genera of viruses that cause serious disease in animals but have not been adequately investigated in humans an example is the genus arterivirus which has members causing serious disease in horses and pigs but has not been reported at all in humans this could be a worthwhile area for future investigation another critical factor in the future control of emerging viruses is better vector control when mosquito control was conducted using ddt dengue fever virus was virtually eliminated from the americas in the 1970s but environmental concerns led to the widespread banning of the use of ddt so that since the 1980s there has been a considerable expansion of dengue fever in south america with the appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever there for the first time there is a real need to improve mosquito control measures to control this disease although there are prospects for a dengue virus vaccine this is so far not available in 2014 a new outbreak of ebola virus occurred in west africa causing several thousand deaths in liberia and sierra leone the ebola virus first emerged as the causative agent of viral hemorrhagic fever in two outbreaks occurring almost simultaneously along the ebola river in the democratic republic of congo in 1976 there were some 318 human cases in this episode with a mortality rate of 88 since that time a number of smaller outbreaks of ebola hemorrhagic fever affecting humans and monkeys were reported from west africa but although most infections have been associated with hunting and handling of great apes the actual origin of the virus has never been ascertained it is clear hat transmission of the virus requires close contact with an infected individual and does not involve airborne transmission ebola virions are usually long filamentous sometimes branched forms with a uniform diameter of about 80 nm and varying in length up to 14000 nm from which they are called filoviruses belonging to the family filoviridae finally one of the most important viruses that continue to emerge in different antigenic forms is influenza virus the main reservoir of influenza viruses is in birds and over the past century several pandemics of influenza have emerged the most serious of which was in 1918 pandemic strains usually arise by a process of antigenic shift where one of the genes encoding the hemagglutinin andor the neuraminidase of influenza virus is replaced by one from birds new pandemics occurred in 1918 h1n1 subtype 1957 h2n2 subtype and 1968 h3n2 subtype since 1968 there have been no new pandemics but it is widely expected that another will occur at the time of writing there is worldwide concern that a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 subtype which has caused some human infections and deaths in persons in close contact with infected birds might mutate or recombine to generate a virus which would be highly transmissible in the human population plans are being developed in many countries and by the who to try to prepare for such an event by generating possible vaccines against such a virus and stockpiling antiviral drugs  comments on epirank modeling bidirectional disease spread in asymmetric commuting networks for analyzing emerging coronavirus epidemic patterns wei chien benny chin chung-yuan huang  huang et al 1 used their epirank algorithm which emphasizes forward-and-backward commuter flow between homes and workplaces to analyze the distribution patterns of two infectious diseases in taiwan the 2009-h1n1 influenza virus and the widespread emergence of the 2000-2008 type 71 enterovirus ev as this article was being prepared the spreading mechanism of the novel coronavirus disease now designated as covid-19 had yet to be identified but according to the american centers for disease control its spreading mechanism and patterns are likely more similar to influenza than to other coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-1 or middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov to consider potential covid-19 spatial patterns we applied epirank to the 2003 sars outbreak in north taiwan for comparison with h1n1 and ev sars was found to be less contagious than h1n1 or ev but with a significantly higher fatality rate the characteristics of these diseases determined their specific spatial spreading patterns as reflected in the different effects of forward and backward commuting movement our motivation is to highlight these differences and to illustrate epirank spatial patterns for the 2003 sars outbreak for comparison with epirank-determined distributions for the h1n1 and ev outbreaks our results indicate that the daytime parameter ie forward movement effect range was slightly higher 05-055 for the sars outbreak than for either the influenza 04-05 or ev 03-05 outbreaks suggesting that the forward-and-backward movements of individuals between residential and core urban areas with concentrated populations were equally important regarding the spread of sars while covid-19 might resemble either sars or h1n1 in terms of spatial spreading its daytime parameter is likely somewhere in-between with backward movement being dominant similar to h1n1 or with forward and backward movement being equally important similar to sars building on huang et als paper we present an estimated risk distribution pattern for the taipei metropolitan area for a daytime parameter of 055  the virological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have high degrees of similarity with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 79 identity and 2012 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov approximately 50 identity 2  however in mid-february 2020 the covid-19 spreading mechanism and spatial epidemiology were both believed to be more similar to influenza and other respiratory infections in terms of primary transmission method-respiratory droplets 3  infected patients can be asymptomatic or express a broad range mild to severe of covid-19 symptoms 4  similar to influenza covid-19 carriers can transmit the disease whether or not they show symptoms-a characteristic of special concern to epidemiologists public health specialists and government officials 5 6  the worst-case scenario is that this asymptomatic transmission characteristic can result in an international covid-19 pandemic that would be as difficult to control as the 2003 sars outbreak and prior influenza pandemics 7  huang et al 1 created the epirank algorithm to investigate the spreading of diseases via inter-city commuting networks epirank integrates the effects of transmission via the forward and backward movements of commuters its primary assumption is that initial carriers move the virus from homes to workplaces forward infect other commuters using public transportation as well as coworkers and susceptible individuals during their daily activities and then infect others during the return commute and family members in their homes epirank calculations use a daytime parameter to capture the effect of forward and backward movement and a damping factor to capture diffusion proportions according to commuting network characteristics rather than random transmission their study focused on the 2009 h1n1 influenza a outbreak and the spatial distribution of the 2000-2008 type 71 enterovirus ev both in taiwan their results revealed optimum daytime values between 03 pearsons r and 05 spearmans rho for flu cases and between 04 pearsons r and 05 spearmans rho for ev cases daytime values below 05 were viewed as evidence of a stronger backward movement effect on the spreading of flu and ev cases our motivation for this paper is to expand huang et als epirank analysis 1 to the 2003 sars outbreak in taipei in order to offer a reference for other sars-like diseases covid-19 is similar to sars in terms of virology and although it may be more similar to influenza in terms of its spatial spreading mechanism we believe that providing epirank results for sars in addition to the flu and ev cases covered in huang et als original paper can support future covid-19 intervention decisions in our earlier study we used data for the taipei metropolitan area tma to test the sensitivity of the epirank daytime parameter and damping factor when assessing risk distribution associated with commuting flow our intention in this paper is to provide additional insights into spatial pattern differences among the 2003 sars outbreak 2009 h1n1 outbreak and ev cases recorded between 2000 and 2008 a total of 347 sars cases were confirmed in taiwan in 2003 with 81 282 occurring in three urban centers in the northern part of the country taipei new taipei city and keelung 8  for the present analysis we focused on the 48 townships located within or surrounding those three centers in this section we will describe our sensitivity analysis involving the daytime parameter and damping factor for investigating the effects of morning and evening commutes on the spread of sars and then discuss the effects of spreading via commuting networks as opposed to random infectivity we will then draw and explain two sarsepirank distribution maps reflecting optimized parameters the sensitivity analysis results shown in figs 1a and b respectively present pearsons and spearman correlation data for the actual distribution of sars cases and epirank-predicted distributions based on different ranges of values for damping factors x-axis and daytime parameters y-axis they reveal significant correlations between the two when the daytime parameter was set to 05 or 055 and the damping factor set to 1 as in huang et als experiments 1  we only considered a uniform probability distribution for the external factor-that is all nodes had the same probability of coming into contact with a contagious individual accordingly a damping factor of 1 means that disease transmission was more dependent on network structure than a uniform distribution a daytime parameter approaching 055 indicates that the effects of both forward and backward movements were essentially equal in terms of disease diffusion with forward movement only slightly more important  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

effect possible explanations for the higher sars daytime parameter 05 that we observed in the present study include a higher fatality rate smaller number of patients effects of public health policies and a slightly lower basic reproduction number r 0  in taiwan sars had a much higher fatality rate than flu 13 9 versus 0001 10  and therefore attracted greater media and research attention over a shorter time period the fatality rate triggered a rapid government response in the form of several policy decisions involving large amounts of resources aimed at controlling the disease these policies resulted in a much lower overall number of sars patients compared to flu patients r 0  defined as the expected number of cases caused by a single infected patient is used to describe the spreading capabilities of diseases the r 0 values associated with the h1n1 virus in taiwan were 116 during the first phase and 187 during the second 11  the sars r 0 was measured as 154 12 -in other words the 2009 h1n1 influenza strain was more contagious than sars patients infected with h1n1 could carry disease pathogens with few or no discernable symptoms increasing the potential to infect susceptible individuals-especially coworkers and family members however when they showed signs of the disease they were more likely to stay at home and treat themselves during the sars outbreak individuals who exhibited even the faintest symptoms were immediately sent to hospitals for treatment which mitigated the spreading potential this difference explains at least in part why the backward movement was more important for influenza than for sars we used headtail-breaks 13 to separate the 48 northern taiwan townships into four core-levels i ii iii and non-core core levels associated with the actual sars and epirank-predicted spatial distributions are shown in fig 3  sars cases were mostly concentrated in 1 core-i township and 5 core-ii townships near or just outside of southwest taipei fig 3a  the core-i township wanhua district had 44 cases 156 of all cases in the tma and each of the five core-ii townships 2 in taipei  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted april 24 2020  city had between 21 and 26 cases 74-92 we then fed distribution data into an optimized epirank with the daytime parameter set to 055 and damping factor to 10 fig 3b  the epirank results identified 5 core-i townships 52-69 of total epirank score 4 core-ii townships and 1 core-iii township later identified as the wanhua district 28 wanhua the epicenter of the 2003 sars outbreak in taiwan 14  had approximately 15 times more cases than the second highest township looking at the north taiwan commuting network neither human activity nor population density levels in wanhua were as high as in surrounding epirank-identified core-ii townships namely the daan district of taipei and the banqiao sanchong zhonghe and xinzhuang districts of new taipei city these five townships are major tma residential centers with large numbers of daily commuters to the taipei core accordingly they were identified as having the highest sars infection risks based on results from a commuting network analysis epirank was designed to serve as a useful tool for analyzing commuting flows-that is the daily forward and backward movements of individuals within regions since the covid-19 spreading mechanism and spatial diffusion process have yet to be firmly identified we returned to our earlier analysis of three events involving infective diseases in taiwan our results indicate daytime parameter values ie measures of the home-to-work movement effect on disease spreading of between 05 and 055 for the sars outbreak higher than those observed for the flu and ev scenarios both 05 even though sars and influenza are both respiratory illnesses they are distinctly different in terms of fatality rates and contagiousness with the second factor affecting the variation we observed in disease spreading patterns since the covid-19 epidemic is still emerging with rapidly evolving information regarding mortality and contagiousness it is not possible to accurately determine the effect of commuting on disease spread-that is whether it is similar to sars or flu for this project we applied epirank to the sars case for comparison with huang et als earlier work with influenza 1  some of the earliest analyses of covid-19 suggest that it is more similar to seasonal influenza than sars in terms of its spatial spreading mechanism if true the backward movement of individuals living in and close to the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak will likely exert more effects than their forward movement with greater likelihood of covid-19 spreading from workplaces and other city center locations to residential neighborhoods in the present study we observed equal effects of forward and backward movement daytime parameter  055 on the spatial distribution of estimated disease risk which resembles the situation for the 2003 sars outbreak in taiwan in our original study we discussed an estimated risk distribution 46  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted april 24 2020  with the largest possible backward movement effect daytime parameter  00 since epirank uses commuting network flow data it may be useful for identifying disease spreading patterns and high at-risk communities even when data are lacking for other epidemiological factors or important variables as more data become available for commuting flows in china in general and wuhan in particular epirank may have utility for analyzing actual and potential disease diffusion as well as for creating estimated risk distribution maps for early response and control purposes epirank might also be applied to other population flow networks for analyzing risk distribution involving routine patterns eg global flight networks since it was written using python 3 epirank can easily be applied to other scenarios and locations where commuting network flow data are available in our role as researchers specializing in network-based epidemiologic modelling and simulations we encourage the public to fully support all government-sponsored responses to and preventive measures against covid-19 as of this writing the outbreak has not yet resulted in any infection clusters in taiwan therefore now is the time to organize and prioritize disease prevention and medical treatment resources for frontline medical personnel epirank can serve as a reference tool for allocating limited resources to potential areas of infection in case a covid-19 outbreak does occur-that is epirank can be used to determine where resources should be concentrated based on epidemiologic and economic priorities the guiding goal is to fully contain a covid-19 outbreak in taiwan at the earliest possible stage all processed data and algorithm codes are available at httpsgithubcomwcchinepirank  politicizing the pandemic a schemata analysis of covid-19 news in two selected newspapers ali abbas haif   the broadcast and print media have a very big influence on public opinion and they are major channels for communication between decision makers and the public the power of the media stems from its influence on the crystallization of our thoughts thoughts serve like an engine which drives and controls our actions and behaviour the media have the ability to work day and night for the purpose of forming perceptions manipulations and changing convictions regardless of whether it is a positive or negative change acceptable or rejected beneficial or harmful beloved or hated the media play a crucial role in revolutions especially arab spring uprisings the war on terror and international security the media depend on conveying or transmitting news and creating a dialogue between governments and people and between different parties in a certain country or society the media have also played a crucial role in political campaigns peace and conflict studies the media therefore are the medium by which people can raise their concerns problems and needs to their governments the media have become a tool of pressure they can easily agitate the public opinion by raising specific as well as sensitive issues they can also agitate people by resorting to manipulation persuasion distortion and deception nelson 17 states thatbias is the predisposition for or against a particular point of view whenever the positions or interests of a portion of the audience are overlooked distorted or censored the problem of bias is found bias may result from unintentional or deliberate decisions on the part of media gatekeepers but nevertheless subjects audiences to a skewed reality potentially detrimental to their best interests 2 hofstetter and buss 9 illustrate that polemics about the word bias in ordinary language is basically slanted in other words bias presents something such as a news story in a way that favors a particular group or opinion bias interprets or presents someone or something in an ideological way for special interests bias also reports certain issues problems actors politicians and any other political event not as they really are bias is not free from lying distortion of and diffusing certain facts disagreement over basic values beliefs or mores mullainathan and shleifer 15 stress the fact that information can be manipulated by different ways ignoring or omitting information that is opposite to or inconsistent with the message of the news story finding information sources that can reinforce or strengthen the story ignoring neglecting and undermining information sources that are incompatible with the message or using misleading and deceitful language and images that support the story undoubtedly media bias news bias and manipulation of information cannot be achieved without the language language serves as a powerful tool by which media owners depend on in conveying their ideologies and manipulations 22 kolsto 12 argues that the media are politically controlled this political control has great impact over its response to any kind of crisis or event politicizing pandemics is not a new bad and negative issue which we as humans need to get rid of history proved that pandemics were politicized and used for ideological and political interests dangerous diseases such as the 1918 h1n1 flu aids ebola were politicized 1 6 20 21 in fact history does not repeat itself but it teaches us lessons and inspires us to response and act differently to current crises to get positive and good results of our negative previous ones sadly we have not learned a lesson from our previous and disastrous crises instead we stubbornly politicize and invest the current deadly covid-19 pandemic for political and ideological purposes scott 21 emphasizes that disease and responses to disease are always politicized and have always political consequences ebola virus is politicized just like other previous viruses covid-19 is a virus like other previous viruses such as plague 1918 flu asian flu cholera aids sars ebola zika sars and mers it is a virus and this is the law of nature instead of cooperating together to defeat such a deadly disease governments especially those in power are busy exchanging accusations zhao lijian the spokesperson of chinas ministry of foreign affairs accused the united states of america of spreading the pandemic in wuhan the epicenter of covid-19 outbreak 10 16 president trump responded by labeling the virus as chinese virus then his secretary of state mike pompeo called the virus as wuhan virus 14 exchanging accusations between china and us continues the us even asked to open an investigation which links the virus to wuhan labs page 18 emphasizes that politicizing the pandemic is hazardous to national health stigmatizing a nation or country for its supposed responsibility in a calamity does not produce a vaccine or medicine for the virus but rather complicates it when racism stereotypes hate speech and propaganda are combined with intense fear and terror from a disease more problems will definitely emerge the media and means of social communication can make the situation even harder than expected distorted and false information manipulation ideology conspiracy theory undocumented claims and inaccurate conclusions can spread quicker than the virus itself politicizing pandemics and broadcasting fear and hate speech will lead to the discrimination and stigmatization of others in a wrong thoughtless and bad way 6 politicizing diseases shaped and can shape public attitudes about immigration the chinese exclusion act was the first immigration law passed in 1882 due to disease threat and after decades of stereotyping chinese immigrants and believing that chinese carry diseases such as cholera and smallpox the law prevented chinese from immigrating to the united states the scott act of 1888 was introduced to heavily restrict and prevent chinese to immigrate to the us such laws and views hurt an entire community and at the same time they did not stop the spread of diseases the pandemic flu which was first identified in china during the end of 1950s was known as asian flu the other flu pandemic that was appeared in hong kong during the end of 1960s was called hong kong flu the 20092010 h1n1 flu which was first identified in the us was called swine flu media coverage of this flu emphasized that this flu might have come from mexico which again caused fears from immigrants 13 politicizing pandemics encourages ethnic and racial discrimination among different people societies and countries it creates political social and even health problems it also pushes people to indulge in hate speech and aggression therefore we should avoid disinformation distortion racial rhetoric slur expressions ideology manipulation and propaganda in other words we should work together to control the disease and overcome it in the end viruses do not know borders and do not distinguish between colors religions and creeds bukhari and xiaoyang 3 elucidate that van dijk put up the analysis of structures at various levels of description ranging from phonological morphological grammatical and semantic levels to higher levels such as coherence themes and topics related to different news stories and other whole schematic and rhetorical dimensions of texts yarlott et al 28 state thatdiscourse structure is a key aspect of all forms of text providing valuable information about the contents of a given span of text this is most obvious in academic legal and technical texts which are often clearly delineated into sections containing for example introductory background or explanatory material among othersthese type of texts are designed to make it easy to find specific information within them quickly news articles have a similarly helpful though implicit design they often provide a brief up-front summary of the important events relevant background information comments from both experts and the reporters and detailed descriptions of the main events events are often not presented in chronological order but rather structured by importance 25 drid 7 illustrates van dijks framework for the analysis of the discourse of news depends on two systematic ranks of structures global structures and local structures the global structures consist of two discourse structures namely macrostructures and superstructures the local structures include the microstructures zhang et al 29 state thatvan dijks study of news discourse has his peculiar feature he believes that discourse is a kind of social control power which represents the willpower of authority and reflects special power structure the people who control and spread discourse are news journalists writers artists and scholars these people are called symbolic elites the powerful people are entitled to control all kinds of discourse while common people are only able to control daily conversation the aim of van dijks study is to observe in what ways the powerful people implement express describe or conceal their ambition through context and discourse in particular he pays much attention to the role of ideology he had made amounts of media discourse surveys such as news report tv program and advertisement his purpose is to illustrate how western authorities control the form and content of discourse and further control the belief and ideology of society 200201 van dijks 2326 study news as discourse all of these studies give authors useful frameworks news schemata for analyzing any news story or report from any channel or newspaper the three discourse structures namely macrostructures superstructures and microstructures are crucial for the analysis of the selected news reports the macrostructure of discourse is thematic in other words macrostructure is the main subject or topic that is being discussed or described and on which the whole story is based on thematic analysis is concerned with the main theme or topic of a certain text topics and themes illustrate and uncover different social as well as psychological proportions of any text or news story 19 26 in news reports or stories the macrostructure is often expressed in the headline and the lead paragraph the superstructure is schematic it shows the main parts of a news story and the way it is arranged or organized the superstructures of a news story consist of three main parts they are introduction substance and conclusion the news story consists of an introduction represented by the first paragraph of the story a substance content the essence or the main story and a conclusion closing the last part the result or the outcome of a news story 2 26 the local structure of discourse is concerned with semantic syntactic stylistic and rhetorical aspects of a given text 2 it focuses on the selected lexical items words and sentences that are used to form a news story according to van dijk 26 a news story is not free from the following different aspects of meaning presuppositions implications inferences concealments euphemisms disclaiming denials blaming the victim negativization and in general the combined strategy of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation many of these semantic features involve various forms of implicitness or indirectness 177 all of such aspects of meaning within their hidden ideologies cannot be discovered without the help of the microstructure of discourse fig 1 van dijks 26 lists important questions that should be answered during the analysis of any text especially if the analysed text is a news storyhow is the topical information organized in the textwhat tends to be given prominence what information is presented first and what information lastwhich news schema categories are emphasized and why coronaviruses are a family of viruses that are found in animals and humans certain types cause illnesses in people some coronaviruses cause the common cold others cause diseases which are much more severe such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars both of which often lead to pneumonia on 30th january 2020 who declared the outbreak of covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern pheic 4 on 31 december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in wuhan hubei province china on 9 january 2020 chinas cdc reported a novel coronavirus as the main cause of this outbreak which is phylogenetically in the sars-cov clade the disease associated to it is now known as novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 8 most of the patients that are suffering from covid-19 are adults and old the main symptoms of the pandemic are fever dry cough and difficulties shortness in breathing 80 of covid-19 patients suffered from mild illness 14 experienced severe disease and 6 suffered from critical illness illness severity is associated with age over 60 s and other comorbid conditions 8 27 illustration of the ultrastructure of the covid-19 virus-cdcscience photo library 11 according to johns hopkins university and medicine 5 the pandemic has sickened more than six million and at least 369000 victims have died unfortunately numbers of infection and death are increasing in order to achieve the aim of the study it is important to give a clear description of the data that are used for the analysis the data are 4 news reports about coronavirus taken from two newspapers namely the new york times from the united sates and global times from china two news reports are analysed for each newspaper the study aims to show and prove how the virus has been used politically in the media the news reports are taken from the main websites of the selected news channels and newspapers the approach that is followed for the analysis is van dijks news schemata framework which is presented in detail in section two above the news reports are analysed according to the three main discourse structures namely the macrostructures superstructures and microstructures in terms of macrostructure the first report of the new york times has the following headline china clamps down on coronavirus coverage as cases surge undoubtedly headlines are crucial in showing the main themes or topics of a news story through the help of headlines one can understand what the stories are talking about starting with the first headline the phrasal verb clamps down means to stop or limit the activity of coronavirus outbreak the word surge means to move very quickly and suddenly in a particular direction one proposition that might emerge from this headline is that china is unable to stop the spread of the outbreak although china clamps down on coronavirus but it is moving and spreading faster another proposition which can be extracted is that chinas efforts to limit or stop the outbreak might not be real or effective in terms of superstructure the introduction of the first report presents the failure of the communist government to control the pandemic according to new york times the government cannot control the pandemic therefore it puts its efforts on the media to strengthen its propaganda of controlling the disease but the government control of the virus is just a narrative and a lie as the number of coronavirus infections in china continues to surge the communist government has clamped down on the news media and the internet signaling an effort to control the narrative about a crisis that has become a once-in-a-generation challenge for leaders in beijing the substance develops the first paragraph and gives more stories about the failure of the communist government in controlling the spread of the outbreak stories with more contextual details talk about the hundreds victims of the virus thousands of confirmed infections public frustration running across the country due to the governments weaknesses in controlling the pandemic and official media propaganda talks about virus relief efforts the government is presented negatively doing negative and irresponsible acts such as removing a range of articles talking about the shortcomings of the governments slow and weak response to the outbreak and reprimanding people who give factual cases of the illness the report emphasizes the lack of medical supplies and face mask production which are described as running short and in overdrive and shortage of testing kits the report also describes the government as weak relying on media to broadcast propaganda and positive stories on its efforts to contain the virus the conclusion ends with the scientists in china and their efforts to find a drug to stop the outbreak the microstructure deals with all the semantic syntactic lexical and rhetorical aspects of discourse and in this case a news report in terms of semantics more contextual details are devoted to the communist government and its inability to control the virus the report is full of propaganda fake positive stories regarding the government strength and potential in controlling the virus the number of the dead victims and confirmed cases the government propaganda its restrictions on media social media and freedom of speech are reported in details all of the stories that are related to the restrictions of internet platforms implicate and presuppose a totalitarian system of government in which a single authoritarian party controls state-owned means of production blaming the victim and division and contrast strategies are used clearly through the report the negative others representation is reported clearly through blaming the chinese government of shortcomings and restrictions in terms of syntax the structure of sentences illustrates the stories of the report clearly and coherently without any vagueness especially when the stories are related to the governments shortcomings in controlling the virus the number of the victims who lost their lives due to the pandemic and the confirmed new cases the new york times uses active voice and simple tenses in order to make events clear and deductive the news stories especially those that are related to the governments weaknesses and shortcomings in controlling the virus are written with complex sentences full of cohesive ties and conjunctions to describe the difficult and complex situation in china as supplies run short face mask production runs in overdrive the rapidly rising number of infections and deaths from the new virus has put renewed pressure on the senior leadership in china hospitals near the center of the epidemic have been overwhelmed and people with flulike symptoms have been turned away many cases have not been diagnosed because of a shortage of testing kits in terms of lexis all the report is negative and its language is critical criticizing the communist government and its inability to fight the virus negative words that carry strong connotations are used in the report words and phrases such as frustrations rigorously communism crisis fear shortcomings propaganda short shortage overdrive turned away forbidden blocked and gloom are clearly used in the report all of these words are used to negatively refer to the chinese government the prominent image of the chinese government is that of a communist-authoritarian one that uses its own ideologies and propaganda another image is that of deficient government incapable of controlling a virus and providing medical supplies and services to its people the prominent image of the chinese people is associated with frustration a deep chronic sense or state of insecurity and dissatisfaction arising from unsolved problems or unfulfilled needs in terms of rhetoric the phrase communist government has negative connotations it is associated with harshness and totalitarianism all the citizens should be totally subject to an absolute state authority in the report the communist government in china and its propaganda is highly emphasized propaganda is a symbol of manipulation control distortion half-truths or lies it is used to refer to the communist government in china repetition is used through the reports all the negative stories that are related to the shortcomings of the chinese government in controlling the pandemic and in providing medical services and peoples fears and frustrations due to the governments weaknesses are always repeated in the report in the second headline which is entitled coronavirus weakens chinas powerful propaganda machine the phrase chinas powerful propaganda machine is used to invite the reader to believe in the idea proposition that china is not really powerful and its power is just propaganda in the sense that it is unable to contain as well as overcome an unseen virus a very tiny and unseen virus manages to weaken its power another proposition can be emerged from this headline is that chinas power is just an illusion this illusion is made real by the official chinese media the superstructure of a news report looks on how the parts of the report namely the introduction the substance and the conclusion are arranged and which events are emphasized and given prominence the new york times gives more emphasis and prominence to the governments propaganda and totalitarianism the introduction comes under the title beijing is pushing tales of perseverance but many young people are openly questioning the communist partys message according to the new york times the perseverance of beijing is just a tale or fiction not an actual fact people in china do not believe or are frustrated with these fake tales of stability steadfastness and perseverance the substance again and again supports the introduction with different negative stories of failure rigidity and shortcomings the governments failure in controlling the virus is presented clearly in the reports beijing is tapping its old propaganda playbook as it battles the relentless coronavirus outbreak the problem for chinas leaders this time it isnt working so well in the new york times chinese government is always associated with rigidity hardness and severity it is a rigid system towards its people and medical staff it is also powerless unable to provide medical equipment and supplies the government was slow to disclose the threat of the coronavirus and worked to suppress the voices of those who tried to warn the country exhausted medical workers with faces lined from hours of wearing goggles and surgical masks women with shaved heads a gesture of devotion retirees who donate their life savings anonymously in government offices the conclusion ends with ms xia story whose weibo account has been suspended for 30 days for her epidemic-related posts and that she was determined to keep on speaking whatever censorship is the new york times finishes the report with a quotation for ms xia speak up as much as your courage allows she said in the end its better than saying nothing the microstructure uses semantic syntactic lexical and rhetorical tools to uncover hidden ideologies in news stories in terms of semantics the new york times again gives more contextual details to the governments propaganda that is used through its official media according to the new york times the government has gained nothing against the virus their achievements against the pandemic are just lies the report is full of stories related to the governments powerful propaganda as well as opposite stories related to the shortcomings and harsh-totalitarian treatment of medical staff consider this quotation beijing is tapping its old propaganda playbook as it battles the relentless coronavirus outbreak the biggest challenge to its legitimacy in decades state media is filling smartphones and airwaves with images and tales of unity and sacrifice aimed at uniting the people behind beijings rule it even briefly offered up cartoon mascots named jiangshan jiao and hongqi man characters meant to stir patriotic feelings among the young during the crisis blaming the victim and theme of negative other representation are clearly used in the report even the unity that state media call for is not meant to fight the pandemic but it is meant to unite the people behind beijing rule consider these quotations exhausted medical workers with faces lined from hours of wearing goggles and surgical masks women with shaved heads a gesture of devotion retirees who donate their life savings anonymously in government offices people are also angry about state media accounts of female medical workers who shave their heads although the idea of women shaving their heads has been repeated but the new york times does not mention the reason the purpose behind women shaving their heads remains vague division and contrast strategy also repeated in the report a contrast or comparison between the governments propaganda with its positive tales of unity and strength and the negative role of the government which is represented by its shortcomings and harsh treatment and censorship of people are mentioned repeatedly in the report in terms of syntax the structures of sentences are simple and clear anyone can understand the stories of the report especially those related to chinese propaganda negative and bad treatment of medical staff and women shortcomings of the government in controlling the outbreak and providing enough medical supplies all the basic elements of a good narrative are found in the report the report has orientation characterization and complication if we cant become a whistle-blower like li wenliang then lets be a person who can hear the whistle blowing yan lianke a novelist said in a lecture at hong kong university of science and technology in february the hot news sense of the perfect used in the new york times is remarkable the new york times uses perfect tense when it talks about sorrowful stories chinas propaganda spinners have some tough competition chinese people have seen images of a young woman crying mom mom as her mothers body was driven away theyve seen a woman banging a homemade gong from her balcony while begging for a hospital bed theyve seen an exhausted nurse breaking down and howling and they have all seen the face of li wenliang the doctor who tried to warn china about the very virus that killed him agency is used clearly in the report the new york times uses agency to highlight responsibility the government was slow to disclose the threat of the coronavirus and worked to suppress the voices of those who tried to warn the country beijing has intensified internet censorship in the past few weeks in terms of lexis the negative discourse or the image of negative other representation is clearly used in the report negative stories of the governments shortcomings in controlling the virus and in providing medical supplies and bad treatment of medical staff monitoring people suspending and deleting social accounts and posts that talk and provide information about the spread of the outbreak are clearly used in all the report the whole report is negative the new york times uses many negative words and phrases such as exhausted devotion problem criticizing harshly condemned lack scorn pressured funeral propaganda biggest challenges suppress young woman crying breaking down howling authoritarian government silencing faade of omnipotent government blatantly unbelievable angry confused people did not cheer intensified deleted suspended and tighter limits the prominent image of the chinese government is that of a totalitarian government with its people and medical staff another image of the chinese government is that it is always associated with shortage failure and deficiency the image of the people and medical workers are associated with confusion exhaustion fatigue and anger the image of women medical workers with shaved hair is associated with devotion and defeminization in terms of rhetoric the report is not free from metaphor that powerful tool that can be invested for ideological purposes chinas power is compared to a machine of propaganda this machine has been weakened by a very tiny virus the image of women with shaved hair is a symbol of devotion obedience and defeminization the new york times even questions whether shaving womens hair comes from complete satisfaction or under extreme pressure war metaphor is used in the sentence beijing is tapping its old propaganda playbook as it battles the relentless coronavirus outbreak beijing is compared to a force battling a relentless coronavirus outbreak this force is not fully equipped and arranged to fight such a heartless ruthless and dangerous enemy beijing is only equipped with false and exaggerated statements and ideas this cannot beat a dangerous enemy like corona and win the battle in terms of repetition governments propaganda has been repeated to emphasize that beijings power is just propaganda unable to fight a dangerous enemy like corona governments shortcomings in controlling the virus as well as providing medical supplies are also repeated many times in the report women with shaved hair are also repeated and it serves as a sign of devotion and obedience to the government the story of dr li wenliang and other people the first doctor who warned the people from the new novel coronavirus is repeated many times in the report as a sign to refer to the totalitarian system in china the crisis has exposed many people especially the young to troubling aspects of life under an authoritarian government in the silencing of people like dr li they see the danger in clamping down on free expression the repetition of cartoon mascots named jiangshan jiao lovely land the name of the girl comes from a line in a poem entitled snow by mao zedong how lovely is this land with her handsome male and hongqi man free spirited red flag his name also comes from a line in the poem according to the new york times the idea behind this carton is to broadcast tales of unity and sacrifice behind beijings rule in terms of macrostructure the first headline entitled us covid-19 numbers tip of iceberg is used to refer to the number of cases of coronavirus in the us the numbers are described as tip of iceberg according to global times the few numbers of covid-19 cases in the us are just tip of iceberg and that the huge mass of the iceberg will appear with the next coming days or weeks the headline implies the following proposition there is a much bigger iceberg beyond this small tip the superstructure of any discourse looks on how the events are arranged in terms of introduction substance and conclusion on one hand and what events are given more emphasis and prominent on the other the introduction illustrates that the us government and officials have harshly criticized chinas response to the coronavirus epidemic but then they have been caught under heavy fire for their response to the coronavirus outbreak in the country people are described as frustrated due to the rising numbers of new cases and the governments insufficient efforts to control the virus according to global times some americans have even dubbed the us governments response a national scandal that puts the fundamental interests of americans in jeopardy the substance obviously supports the introduction through giving many stories related to the governments slow response to the outbreak as well as the shortcomings in the healthcare system trumps administration is described as retarded and incompetence which has put many states in a state of emergency the us cdcs slow response is described as is politically driven totally ignoring the public interest testing in the us states is described as flawed the report also emphasized the fundamental contrast between chinas government responses to the outbreak with that of trumps administration china quickly responded adjusted measures to control the spread while the us response has now become shift-blame-tactics between the white house and us cdc some people in the us are described as worried about this new disease and its high contagiousness particularly as politicians are focused on campaigning for elections in november the conclusion ends with the importance of the chinese and us cooperation and the need for this cooperation as the two global powers can work together to overcome the outbreak the conclusion also emphasizes that the uss cdc should share information on developments in covid-19 and that it should provide regular reports to the world health organization in terms of microstructure the first microstructure strategy is semantics in terms of semantics more contextual details are given to trumps administration uss cdc weaknesses frustrated people and their worries due to the virus spread and insufficient american healthcare system the phrase tip of iceberg which is used to refer to the number of cases of covid-19 in the us implies that the numbers will increase with the next days the tip of iceberg presupposes that there will be an iceberg formed by people with covid-19 the sentence citizens are demanding full transparency from officials implies that the us officials are not giving the people accurate information regarding the number of people with covid-19 and the spread of the outbreak the sentence the uss cdc has stopped reporting the number of people tested for the novel coronavirus implies a sense of suspicion a feeling that something bad is likely or true the word some is mentioned 10 times in the report some is associated with vagueness sentences such as some have even dubbed the us governments response a national scandal that puts the fundamental interests of americans in jeopardy some projections came up with real numbers far higher than those reported are associated with an indefinite amount and unspecified number blaming the victim and contrast and division strategies are also used in the report the report is full of blaming blaming of the us insufficient responses and bungled efforts to control the virus the retarded response and incompetence of the trump administration the newspaper blames the us cdcs slow response describing it as politically driven and ignoring public interest division and contrast strategy is also used in the report global times compares between the sufficient response of the chinese government and the insufficient response of trumps administration to the outbreak in terms of syntax most of the stories of the report are written in the past simple tense the best tense for narrating stories the sentences are written clearly in active form passive voice is not used in the report global times also used the present perfect tense-the preferable tense for hot news events or stories trump administration has placed several states in a state of emergency cdc has stopped reporting the number of people tested for the novel coronavirus pneumonia most of the stories are supported by clear agency or characterization complication and orientation giving places and times consider this story robert murphy an infectious diseases professor in the us and executive director of the institute for global health at the northwestern university feinberg school of medicine told the global times in an email on wednesday that he agrees with those who say the cdc has been making the same mistakes as wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak which included narrow testing criteria slow testing speed and lack of testing capacity resulting in the delayed response in terms of lexis the prominent image of the us is associated with deficiency and insufficiency in providing testing kits and firm-decisive efforts to stop the pandemic spread the prominent image of people is associated with frustration wonder and worry about the disease citizens are also presented as powerful actors criticizing the countrys insufficient efforts to contain the virus politicians are busy with their election campaigns and do not want the disease to influence their polls the discourse of self and other is clearly used in the report the self discourse is always good and positive while the other discourse is always bad and negative china is represented as a positive country which is able to control the pandemic in contrast to the us the central government quickly stepped in and adjusted responding measures in contrast it has now become shift-blame-tactics between the white house and us cdc china is also described as a positive country ready to cooperate work together share responsibility and give advice consider this story wang guangfa a leading chinese respiratory expert at peking university first hospital in beijing urged the us cdc to share information on developments in the covid-19 outbreak in the us and take concrete steps to contain the spread of the virus with health departments of other major countries plagued by the virus and also provide regular reports to the world health organization in terms of rhetoric the phrase tip of iceberg is a metaphor meaning that there is a lot more of covid-19 cases than meets the eye in the sentence the us government and officials are caught under heavy fire for their response to the coronavirus outbreak in the country the heavy fire is a metaphor for fear rage and anger anger of the citizens due to the uss insufficient efforts repetition as an ideological rhetorical strategy is used to negatively represent the us the us government and trumps administration are repeated for their shortages in controlling the virus the uss cdc is repeated 18 times for its slowness and weaknesses in dealing with the pandemic people are repeated criticizing the governments slow response to the outbreak the image of fear and worry in people is also repeated in the report china is repeated positively giving advice and offering cooperation the second headline entitled us scrambles to tackle virus means that the us is unable to deal with a very tiny virus the headline is written in the present simple tense to make it more factual the verb scramble means to struggle with difficulty the us is struggling with a virus and this virus is not easy to deal with in terms of superstructure the introduction illustrates the factors that are hindering the white houses readiness for the virus the main two impediments are political factors and testing delay the introduction also puts more emphasis on western and american media which have harshly criticized chinas government response to the outbreak but it happened that the virus have crept to western countries due to their insufficient awareness and few control measures in place to check its spread the substance supports the introduction and gives many different stories on the causes that will jeopardize the virus-control work and undermine the fundamental interests of the american public such causes are finger-pointing partisan politics and presidential election in the report trump is described as having little understanding about the pandemic ill-preparation shortages of medical supplies flaws in the us healthcare system lack of consistent commitment and coordination unprofessional response lack of information transparency related to the disease and expensive american healthcare system are other causes which help increase the spread and the risk of the virus the report ends with a conditional conclusion that if the us fails to contain the viral spread it would be a heavy blow not only to the us itself but also to the worlds economic recovery the first microstructure strategy is semantics more stories supported by contextual details are given to the negative causes that allow the virus to spread in the us stories related to ill-preparation weaknesses in the political and administrative system and deficiencies in the uss cdc and healthcare system are the most prominent and emphasized stories in the whole report such negative stories are preferable and prominent the indefinite quantifier some is mentioned 6 times in the report although some is used to refer to indefinite number and amount it used in global times reports phrases such as some observers some raised questions some critics and some analysts are used in the report to give supports to the negative stories related to the shortcomings of the us government in dealing with the pandemic the quotation us president donald trump mistakenly described the patient who was a man in his 50 s as a wonderful women illustrates that global times always emphasizes confusion bewilderment and chaos in the us blaming the victim is clearly used in the report global times puts the blame on the us government under trumps administration and uss cdc for their shortages and ill-preparation regarding the spread of the outbreak in terms of syntax the report is clear and cohesive the sentence structure is presented clearly without vagueness active voice and agency are presented obviously in the report for no other purpose than to highlight the responsibility of the us government trump and uss cdc the newspaper does not use passive it seems that global times does not want to mitigate or hide the responsibility behind the spread of the virus in the us and the shortcomings and lack of medical supplies all such negative stories are highlighted and given more prominence in the report the report contains all the basic elements of a good narrative the report includes agency complications or different cohesive ties and conjunctions consider this quotation however us president donald trump mistakenly described the patient who was a man in his 50 s as a wonderful woman during a press conference while the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc later took the blame by claiming it mistakenly identified the patient as female in a briefing to trump and us vice president mike pence who is now overseeing the us federal governments response to the outbreak in terms of lexis the language of the report is negative full of negative stories and words powerful words and phrases with complex modifications and adjectives are widely used such as failure insufficient awareness few control measure finger-pointing partisan politics death ill-prepared cdcs faulty mass screenings highly possible shortages criticism flaws lack wrong loopholes lack of consistent commitment hasty and unprofessional response to the outbreak shortcomings failed raising fears overwhelmed problem slow response anxious the prominent image of the us and trump is associated with finger-pointing confusion lack of correct decisions loopholes shortcomings ill-preparation unprofessional and slow response to the outbreak the prominent image of people is associated with anxiety they are anxious as the facts are still unknown urging the us government to cope with the matter in a more responsible way in terms of rhetoric repetition is the most rhetorical device that is used in this report most of the negative stories are repeated in the report the uss government shortcomings in controlling the virus are repeated the uss cdc slow and unprofessional response to the disease is repeated the expensive american healthcare system is repeated peoples concerns about and criticism to the slow and weakness response of the government are also repeated undoubtedly data analysis proves that the pandemic which is known as covid-19 has been politicized and used ideologically in other words the two selected newspapers namely the new york times from the united states of america and global times from china politicized the pandemic to serve the interests and ideologies of the countries they represent both newspapers invested the three discourse structure namely macrostructure superstructure and microstructure ideologically in their reports the newspapers gave more emphasis and prominence to the negative stories related to the covid-19 new york times put more emphasis on the propaganda of the communist party in china its inability to control the spread of the outbreak its weaknesses in controlling the virus its shortcomings in providing medical supplies and its totalitarian treatment to the people and medical workers people are dissatisfied with the governments decisions and shortcomings global times also emphasized the negative stories related to covid-19 in the us the us government under trumps administration is weak and slow in its response to the virus the uss cdc is described as slow and unprofessional in its response to the outbreak negative stories related to the lack of testing kits and medical supplies are repeated and emphasized in the reports people are angry and anxious due to the governments slow response american expensive healthcare system and weaknesses are also repeated and given more prominence the article recommends that the whole world should work together for peace safety and security pandemics and epidemics do not know borders or china or united states such deadly diseases do not distinguish between a christian a jew a muslim or an atheist they also do not distinguish between an american asian or european therefore we should work together to save ourselves and the next coming generations  viral infection in adults with severe acute respiratory infection in colombia yuly remolina andrea mara ulloa mercedes hernn vargas liliana daz sandra gmez liliana alfredo saavedra edgar snchez jorge corts alberto oliver schildgen   acute respiratory infection is one of the main causes of hospitalization and death worldwide although identification of the aetiological agent is not achieved in a majority of cases instead the infections are treated empirically and often successfully with antimicrobial therapy nonetheless the roles of viruses in the aetiology of these infections are becoming clear especially after the 2009 pandemic of the new influenza a subtype h1n1 1 the presence of a virus does not imply either a more benign clinical course or that systemic inflammatory responses or complications will be absent 2 due to its implications for public health the efforts in reinforcing and improving the epidemiological surveillance of respiratory infections have increased under this initiative countries have developed surveillance systems by following cases of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections saris which are clinically diagnosed among patients with fever coughing or sore throat difficulty breathing and the need for hospitalization 3 the main aims of surveillance have been to provide information on circulating viruses and the susceptibility of influenza to available antivirals and also to promote and define vaccination needs in different populations the true impact of viral infections in the aetiology of acute respiratory disease requiring hospitalization is unknown 4 the aims of this study were to identify viral aetiologies in hospitalized adult patients with sari in bogot in 2012 and to describe the characteristics and clinical outcomes among these patients this study was performed in colombias capital city of bogot which is located in the andes in south america near the equator and 2600 metres above sea level a total of 7 tertiary care hospitals performing sentinel surveillance of sari during 2012 participated in the study such hospitals forwarded all respiratory samples from patients with sari to the district health department sari was defined as any respiratory infection with a possible viral andor bacterial origin requiring inpatient management and a clinical presentation of fever of less than 14 days after onset and higher than 38c shortness of breath cough hypoxia and systemic compromise systemic inflammatory response syndrome or organ failure depending on symptom severity 5 the samples were taken via nasopharyngeal aspiration or swab the samples were sent together with the required basic epidemiological data collection form through the epidemiological surveillance system sistema de vigilancia epidemiolgica nacionalsivigila samples were sent in a viral transport medium to the public health laboratory of the district health department where they were stored between 4 and 8c in refrigerators intended for this purpose this descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in bogot in 2012 to determine the prevalence of viruses in adult patients with sari of less than 15 days of evolution using a microarray technique the study also describes clinical characteristics and outcomes such as mortality the need for intensive care the use of mechanical ventilation and the length of hospital stay inclusion criteria consisted of patients over 18 years of age who provided a respiratory sample in 2012 at one of the hospitals performing sentinel surveillance patients with incomplete medical records from the sampling institution were excluded the

which was requested and obtained was kept at universidad nacional de colombia a total of 288 nasopharyngeal aspiration or swab samples were taken during 2012 from adult patients of the 7 hospitals the sample was randomly selected with the only inclusion criteria being patients older than 18 years of age with sari reported to the surveillance system during that year a sample size calculation found that 117 respiratory samples were needed for a prevalence of 25 with the poorest accepted result of 20 90 power and a 95 confidence level however because 150 molecular tests could be processed the sample was increased to 150 patients subsequently the medical records were reviewed and after the approval and authorisation of the research and ethics committee of each institution the information was gathered from each hospital a microarray diagnostic assay using clart pneumovir equipment by genomica madrid spain was used to identify the viruses involved 6 this assay detects and characterises viruses that most frequently cause respiratory symptoms in humans the following viruses were analysed respiratory syncytial virus rsv a and b influenza a h1n1 h3n2 2009 ah1n1 pdm b and c virus parainfluenza virus subtypes 1 2 3 4a and 4b metapneumovirus a and b adenovirus enterovirus rhinovirus coronavirus subtype 229e and bocavirus this kit amplifies specific fragments of the viral genome via a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction pcr or via a pcr with hybridisation detection using specific capture probes 7 the following variables were collected from the patients medical histories according to international definitions age gender and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd diabetes mellitus and heart failure the inclusion criteria took into account the systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs which was defined as a heart rate over 90 beats per minute a breathing rate of over 20 breaths per minute leukocytosis of over 12000 cells per millilitre or leukopenia of fewer than 4000 cells per millilitre and fever pneumonia among sari patients was diagnosed from radiological findings of consolidation or alveolar infiltrates the confusion urea respiratory rate and blood pressure curb-65 scores for pneumonia were applied using the criteria of age greater than or equal to 65 years impaired consciousness blood urea nitrogen bun over 20 mgdl breathing rate above 30 breaths per minute and a systolic arterial pressure under 90 mmhg or a diastolic pressure under 60 mmhg 8 additionally severe pneumonia was considered among patients complying with the following major and minor criteria of the american thoracic societyinfectious disease society of america atsidsa shock need for mechanical ventilation thrombocytopenia platelets under 100000 an arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio pao2fio2 ratio multilobar compromise impaired consciousness leukopenia under 4000 and bun over 20 mgdl 9 shock was also considered when the systolic arterial pressure was below 90 mmhg or when the diastolic arterial pressure was under 60 mmhg moderate oxygenation impairment was defined by a pao2fio2 below 220 mmhg and over 160 mmhg and severe oxygenation impairment was defined by an index less than or equal to 160 mmhg institutions that identified viral antigens following institutional protocols performed and interpreted these tests in their hospitals colonisation of the airway was defined as the presence of microorganisms in a gram test or in a culture of the airway gram tests and sputum cultures or other respiratory samples were performed based on clinical decisions made by the doctor from the institution a viral co-infection diagnosis was made when 2 or more different viruses were identified in the same sample the chi-square test and fishers exact test were used to compare categorical variables and the comparison of continuous variables was performed with either students t test or the mann-whitney u test on a case-by-case basis the variable analysis was performed using stata ver 110 and p values less than 005 were considered significant odds ratios or with corresponding 95

during the rainy season april to may and august to november most cases of metapneumovirus parainfluenza and rsv were seen only in the first semester specifically in april and may the two cases of coronavirus were identified in may fig 2 patients with and without viral detection did not differ in terms of comorbidity with the exception of the frequency of diabetes mellitus diabetes was detected

was diagnosed in 625 of patients without viral detection and 601 of patients with viral detection no significant differences were observed between the groups with and without viral detection with regards to sirs neutropenia during hospitalization or shock of the 22 patients with sari and a history of copd viruses were identified in 16 727 5 of whom had viral co-infections the viruses were distributed as follows 6 cases of bocavirus 4 of adenovirus 3 of influenza a 3 of parainfluenza 3 of rsv 2 of metapneumovirus 1 of coronavirus and 1 of rhinovirus of the 91 patients 13 were active smokers and 9 692 had a viral infection with bocavirus being the most frequently isolated 333 virus during hospitalization 33 patients 363 had blood cultures taken there were 3 positive cases 10 of the blood cultures these consisted of two cases of bacteraemia by streptococcus of the viridans group and one case by staphylococcus aureus sputum gram stains were performed in 22 patients 24 and these showed diverse flora of gram-positive cocci and bacilli or gram-negative coccobacilli in 15 cases 68 of those with positive gram stains positive sputum cultures were observed in 13 patients with the following viruses identified haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases streptococcus pneumoniae moraxella catarrhalis h parainfluenzae klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases each and s aureus bordetella pertussis stenotrophomonas maltophilia in one case each more than one microorganism was identified in 4 cases positive gram staining was more frequent among patients with copd 41 vs 188 p  003 and colonisation of the airways was also more frequent in these patients 318 colonisation vs 188 fishers exact test p003 bacterial colonisation was identified together with viral identification in 14 patients 153 with regards to complications pleural effusion developed in 125 of patients without viral identification and 19 of patients with viral identification closed thoracotomy was required in 42 of patients without viral identification and 32 of patients with viral identification inpatient infection was present in 83 and 32 of patients without and with viral identification respectively and underlying disease complications were found in 25 of patients without viral identification and 381 of patients with viral identification these differences were not statistically significant patients with chronic pneumopathy showed more complications in their underlying pathologies 773 vs 203 or 135 ci 95 35527 a total of 14 154 patients died however two cases included either an inadequate sample for pcr or no pcr amplification thus the outcome analysis was performed for 12 patients mortality was reported for 4 cases 167 in the group without viral identification and 8 cases 127 in the group with viral identification p  023 or 072 95 ci 017368 table 4 mechanical ventilation was required for 33 patients 363 this intervention was invasive in 24 264 patients non-invasive in 13 143 patients

average length of mechanical ventilation was 7 days with a minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 20 days thirty-nine 429 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit icu 3 had unsuitable samples or non-amplified pcr results 9 375 were from the group without an isolated virus and 27 429 were from the group with an isolated virus p  021 or 125 95 ci 043375 one case with viral identification was readmitted to the unit with an identification of influenza subtype ah1n1 the average length of icu stay was 84 days with a range between 1 and 21 days the group with an isolated virus had an average icu stay of 38 days with a range between 1 and 21 days and the group without an isolated virus had an average stay of 28 days with a range between 1 and 13 days p  005 the average hospital stay in the sari group was 99 days with a range between 1 and 45 days with average stays of 106 and 98 days for patients with and without a virus respectively p  06 among patients without a virus the hospital stay varied between 1 and 45 days while patients with a virus had hospital stays that varied between 1 and 28 days of the 8 patients from the viral infection group who died bocavirus was isolated in 5 influenza was isolated in 4 all cases of influenza a metapneumovirus was isolated in 3 and rsv was isolated in 1 of the patients with bocavirus isolation 192 died death occurred in 143 of those in whom influenza was identified 50 of those in whom metapneumovirus was identified and 20 of those in whom rsv was identified among patients with viral identification who died 5 625 had viral infections of 2 or more viruses p  17 or 24 95 ci 0461889 and fewer had only one virus detected no statistically significant differences were observed in the outcomes of the remaining patients with mixed viral infection which does not confirm higher morbidity in patients with more viruses isolated the diagnosis of acute respiratory infections is common and apparently easy to perform however the determination of the infections causal agent is more complex as current diagnostic tools are limited and rarely available in primary health care centres or even in hospitals in much of the world 10 the role of viruses and their prevalence is a matter of debate and discussion and findings vary worldwide the results from studies in new zealand spain and more recently in the united kingdom report prevalence rates of 28 11 18 12and 44 13 respectively in our study viruses were identified as the most frequent causal agents of sari requiring hospitalization in 2012 with most cases showing a high rate of viral co-infection a high degree of morbidity prolonged hospital stays and frequent needs for icu management and mechanical ventilation the definition of sari used in this study is of great utility from an epidemiological surveillance perspective which is known as syndrome surveillance or surveillance of syndromes 14 nonetheless the results reported here demonstrate its clinical relevance and potential utility in this field as it appears to identify potentially severe patients and those with high complication rates thus the definitions routine use should be considered during the performance of clinical duties furthermore current challenges in the epidemiological surveillance of viral respiratory tract infections include the early and fast identification of aetiological agents especially at the beginnings of outbreaks and the optimal and timely management of a large number of samples 14 our study suggests that molecular technology makes it possible to closely follow circulating viruses in these groups of patients in contrast to the epidemiological definition used the curb-65 index of pneumonia was not useful as only 10 26 scored for general hospitalization and none scored for icus using these criteria this finding contrasts with the high number of our patients who required icu care which agrees with findings in the literature that applied this scale in cases of viral pneumonia during the influenza a subtype h1n1 pandemic of 2009 these results demonstrate its low value for detecting either severity or the need for icu admission in patients with viral pneumonia 15 these findings represent a marked difference in severity stratification between influenza-related pneumonia and pneumonia caused by other aetiological agents indicating the importance of clinical judgement in this scenario 16 the application of these scales in non-influenza viral pneumonia has yet to be assessed moreover a recent multicentre study of adults with radiographically confirmed pneumonia has shown that viruses are now the most commonly identified pathogens human rhinovirus and influenza virus are more frequently found than streptococcus pneumoniae 17 together viruses represent a quarter of patients and more than half of the pathogens identified the mortality rate was relatively high for patients both with and without community-acquired pneumonia a study performed in the united states reported a low mortality rate in patients hospitalized for viral infection nonetheless bacterial co-infection increased both the morbidity and the mortality 18 this variable should be considered for our patients countries with marked seasons report a correlation of influenza with high mortality due to respiratory infections which is usually related to community-acquired pneumonia 19 this seasonal pattern of acute respiratory infections especially viral infections due to influenza is dependent on temperature humidity and host factors such as serum vitamin d levels 20 colombia is located in the tropics and thus lacks seasons however this study confirms that these infections especially those caused by influenza and rsv infections increase during the rainy season in countries at these latitudes 21 this pattern shows the importance of epidemiological surveillance especially during the seasons when viruses circulate because it may increase control and prevention strategies such as timely vaccinations techniques based on identifying nucleic acids such as those used in this study can obtain more rapid and precise results for diagnosing viral infections in order to provide appropriate and managed medical care 22 there is limited information on the diagnostic utility of these new tests a study by sultankulova et al compared viral isolation of influenza a with dna microarray technology reverse transcription pcr and real-time pcr 23 microarray technology showed a higher sensitivity 995 and similar specificity 985 to real-time pcr however another study with the same microarray kit used in this study showed a high specificity 100 and low sensitivity 52 in the clinical scenario of atypical pneumonia 24 a study in japan using near patient automated microarray technology showed not only a higher sensitivity and specificity compared to immunochromatographic antigen detection the gold standard used was virus isolation but also quicker results for children infected with influenza and rsv 25 a recent multicentre study in the united states using real-time pcr technology was able to precisely and reproducibly detect all adenovirus infections in a group of children and adults with respiratory infections which increased the possibility of establishing a clear diagnosis 26 taken together use of molecular technology for the diagnosis of viral infections can improve detection and identify the cases in which antibiotic use might be inadequate the use of antibiotics in acute respiratory infections is indiscriminate and excessive and according to worldwide literature is employed in more than half of all respiratory infections 27 this study determined that 90 of the cases are treated with antibiotics although most of the infections were viral in origin additional strategies such as the measurement of procalcitonin can identify patients who would not benefit from antibiotic therapy 28 this study has several limitations although it was multicentre in design the information was gathered from only one city in colombia one important limitation is that it is a retrospective study thus it was not possible to control viral and bacterial sampling and there was limited access to relevant data such as previous influenza or pneumococcal vaccination history or co-morbidity measurement the sample size was smaller than expected although the prevalence of viral infection was higher than expected together all of these limitations lead to difficulties in establishing significant comparisons among the groups and in appropriately assessing the impact of co-morbidity and bacterial co-infection in the outcomes especially in relation to the role of pneumococcus 29 other limitations include the difficulty of defining the actual roles of certain viruses such as bocavirus and rhinovirus in respiratory infection which are also detected in asymptomatic patients according to descriptions in the literature 4 the empirical use of antibiotics in most cases without using additional tools to confirm bacterial infection is also a limitation  specific interference shrna-expressing plasmids inhibit

hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs in eurasia due to old world hantavirus and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps in the americas due to new world hantavirus3 approximately 60 000100 000 hfrs cases are reported each year worldwide and the mortality rate can reach 1014 hantaviruses belong to the genus hantavirus of the bunyaviridae family and they are enveloped single-strand negative-sense tri-segmented rna viruses the viral genomes consist of large l medium m and small s segments that encode an rna-dependent rna polymerase and two envelope glycoproteins gn and gc and a nucleocapsid n protein variations in the m and s segments may influence the antigenicity and virulence of hantaviruses56 extensive efforts have been made in the search for effective preventative and treatment measures for hantavirus infections17 ribavirin is a broad-spectrum synthetic nucleoside analog that has been reported to effectively inhibit the replication of the hantaan virus htnv an old world hantavirus and andes virus andv a new world hantavirus in vitro and in vivo8 however there are currently no prophylactic vaccines or therapeutic antivirals for hantavirus infection that are approved by the fda therefore the exploration of novel treatment strategies for hantavirus infection is urgent and necessary rna interference rnai is a short double-strand rna induced-process that can target the mrna of a specific sequence for degradation910 post-transcriptional gene silencing can be mediated by endogenous micrornas mirnas exogenous small interfering rnas sirnas and short hairpin rnas shrnas rnai technology is recognized as a promising novel nucleic acid-based tool for use against various diseases including cancer infectious diseases and genetic disorders rnai reagents have also been reported to potently and specifically inhibit the replication of different viruses including hiv hbv11 hsv12 sar-cov13 influenza virus1415 coxsackievirus16 and others thus the development of rnais as possible antiviral agents for hantavirus infection is of considerable interest17 in the present study we examined the effects of shrnas on htnv replication using 4 shrnas that targeted different regions of the htnv genomic rna we further transfected the two most effective shrnas into the shrna expression vector psilencer-30-h1 and named the resultant vectors psilencer-s and psilencer-m the antiviral effect of psilencer-sm against htnv was ultimately evaluated in tissue culture and a mouse model vero-e6 cells were obtained from the china center for type culture collection cctcc and maintained in dmem supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs gibco carlsbad ca usa 01 l-glutamine 100 uml penicillin and streptomycin dmem containing 2 fbs was used to maintain the medium after viral infection the stocks of hantaan virus strain 76118 were obtained from the institute of virology of the chinese academy of preventive medicine beijing china and were propagated in vero-e6 cells htnv titration was performed regularly based on indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa as described previously18 the tcid50 was determined to be 10601 ml two individual targeting sites were selected for the s genbank accession number af187082 and m genes genbank accession number af276987 of htnv the design of the shrna sequences was performed according to methods referred to in the literature19 and involved the use of the web-based block-it rnai designer program httprnaidesignerthermofishercomrnaiexpress a blast search httpwwwncbinlmnihgovblast was performed to exclude the possible homologous sequences the sequences and positions of the shrnas are illustrated in table 1 the designed structure contained the following sequences 5-aa-sense strand sirna cttgcttc loop region and antisense strand sirna tatagtga t7-oligo promoter-3 the target gene is presented in table 1 a negative control was chosen to target positions 1023 to 1043 of leishmania crk1 the sequence of which was 5-aatcgggcagttgtttgagat-3 the dna template was synthesized by sangon biotech shanghai co ltd and the shrna was generated using the messagemuter shrna production kit qiagen as described previously12 the vero-e6 cells were grown in 24-well plates to 8090 confluence and transfected with specific or control shrna 60 nmoll with rnaifect transfection reagent qiagen germantown md usa at 24 h after transfection the cells were infected with 100 tcid50 htnv 76118 100 l per well and viral rna was detected by qrt-pcr at 24 or 48 hour post-infection hpi to determine the interference efficiency the viral titers were determined at 96 hpi the shrna s1 and shrna m2 were found to be the most effective shrnas in terms of the inhibition of htnv and were selected for use in the subsequent experiments synthesized oligonucleotides containing the s1 and m2 shrna sequences with bamh i or hind iii sequences at the 5 or 3 termini were designed as illustrated in table 2 according to the instructions of the manufacturer of rnai designer invitrogen carlsbad ca usa the two complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into the bamh ihind iii site of the psilencer-30-h1 vector after transformation clone pcr and enzyme digestion the identified shrna expression plasmids were sent for sequence analysis for further confirmation and were subsequently designated psilencer-s and psilencer-m one day before transfection the vero-e6 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 5104 cells per well the 80-90 confluent cells were then transfected with 025 05 1 2 or 4 g of the psilencer-s psilencer-m or psilencer 30 h1 as psilencer-blank vectors with lipofectamine 2000 invitrogen according to the manufacturers instruction the transfection efficiencies were according to gfp expression of the co-transfected plasmid pegfp-c1 after 24 hpi the cells were infected with 100 tcid5002 ml of htnv76118 at 1 2 3 5 7 and 9 day post-infection dpi antigen slides were prepared to detect the htnv protein expressions by ifa in other parallel experiments the cells from individual wells 2-g plasmid transfection groups were collected at 2 dpi for viral rna detection at 5 dpi the cultures were subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing followed by centrifugation at low speed 1000g and the supernatants were then serially diluted inoculated on the cells and finally titrated by ifa this study was approved by the ethics committee of wuhan university school of medicine all work with infected mice was performed in the animal biosafety level 3 absl-3 laboratory of the animal research center at wuhan university and was humanely conducted in compliance with the chinese animal protection act and the national research council criteria specific pathogen-free pregnant balbc mice were obtained from the animal research center of wuhan university suckling mice 2 d old were intracranially inoculated with 20 l htnv 76118 viral stock at 100 ld50 the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups 30 mice per group and intraperitoneally injected with 10 l of the plasmids psilencer-s psilencer-m or psilencer 30 h1 vectors at concentrations of 3 gl or 10 l pbs for the normal controls and viral controls at 1 and 3 dpi respectively the treatments were performed for the survival rate study n10 these mice were observed daily for 15 d following infection and the mortality rate and mean time to death mtd were estimated four mice from each group were sacrificed at 2 3 4 and 5 dpi and brain tissues were collected for viral rna detection by qrt-pcr at 8 dpi the brains lungs and kidneys were dissected from the sacrificed animals n4 and used for pathological examinations with he staining at the experimental point of 5 dpi the brains lungs and kidneys were harvested weighed and homogenized into a 10 weightvolume suspension in test medium the homogenates were frozen and thawed twice and centrifuged at 3000 rounds per minute for 10 min the virus titers were determined as described above at the experimental point of 2 dpi blood samples were collected and pooled for each group tnf- was detected in the sera with quantikine quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassays according to the manufacturers instructions total rnas were extracted from the cell or tissues using trizol reagents invitrogen usa following the manufacturers instructions first-strand cdna was synthesized by reverse transcription of 500 ng of total rna using random primers promega and m-mlv reverse transcriptase promega at 25 c for 10 min 37 c for 60 min 85 c for 5 min and 4 c for 4 min the amplification was performed using the following primer sets htnv forward 5-tctagttgtatccccatcgactg-3 htnv reverse 5-acatgcggaatacaattatggc-3 human gapdh forward

pgem-thuman gapdh and pgem-tmouse gapdh were stored in our laboratory and used to generate the standard curves the absolute quantification of the htnv viral gene was performed as previously described20 the data are presented as vrna copiesng of gapdh mrna ifa was performed to detect the hantavirus antigens in the infected vero-e6 cells as previously reported18 with monoclonal antibody a35 which targets the nucleocapsid protein 1200 dilution provided by the institute of virology chinese academy of preventive medicine beijing china or rabbit polyclonal antibody targeting glycoprotein g2 1100 dilution provided by prof john w huggins virology division united states army medical research institute of infectious disease after incubation fitc-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit igg sigma aldrich 1200 dilution secondary antibodies were used the cell cytoplasm was stained red with evans blue the images were collected using a fluorescence microscope nikon te2000 all of the data were analyzed with spss 170 software the data are expressed as the meansd for all experiments one-way anovas were used to assess the significance of the differences between the means p values below 005 were considered statistically significant shrnas were designed to specifically target the s and m genes of htnv the efficacies of the shrnas in the inhibition of htnv replication were evaluated by transfecting the vero-e6 cells with 60 nmoll of s1 s2 m1 and m2 shrnas followed by the infection of the cells with 100 tcid5002 ml of htnv76118 as illustrated in figure 1a and 1b the transfections of the 4 shrnas resulted in the inhibitions of viral rna transcription at 24 hpi of 657217 s1 56848 s2 551769 m1 and 64957 m2 p005 vs the virus group when the cells were treated with the shrnas at 48 hpi the efficiencies of viral gene inhibition were 9176229 s1 7828646 s2 687288 m1 and 9523625 m2 p005 vs virus group no protective effect was observed in the vero-e6 cells treated with shcrk for the yield-reduction assay culture samples were collected at 96 hpi and the titers were determined the inhibitory effects of the four shrnas against htnv replication were evaluated the four shrnas reduced the htnv yields by approximately 4 log10 s and 2 log10 m compared with the control figure 1c based on these results and the viral antigen expression results detected by ifa data not shown we concluded that the shrnas that targeted the s and m segments of the htnv gene were able to inhibit rna transcript and virus production in the htnv-infected cells and that shrna-s1 and shrna-m2 exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect against htnv thus shrna-s1 and shrna-m2 were further selected for insertion into the psilencer-30-h1 of the rnai vector and the resultant vectors were designated psilencer-s and psilencer-m the rnai psilencer-s and psilencer-m plasmids were constructed and their antiviral effects were further evaluated by detecting the viral protein synthesis and rna transcript and progeny virus titers in the htnv-infected cells the transfection efficiencies were evaluated according to the gfp expression of the co-transfected plasmid pegfp-c1 and reached approximately 7080 treatment with psilencer-s or psilencer-m at concentrations of 1 2 and 4 g significantly decreased viral the antigen expression in the htnv-infected vero-e6 cells at 3 dpi figure 2 the percentages of positive cells declined with increases in the dose of transfected rnai plasmids figure 2h and 2i only 1469178 of the cells were positive for nucleocapsid protein staining in the 2-g psilencer-s treatment group compared to 568321 in the psilencer-blank treatment group figure 2h similarly the corresponding glycoprotein g2 positive staining rates were 148241 and 5833624 in the 2-g psilencer-m treatment group figure 2i these results indicate that the 2-g plasmid transfection achieved the most effective inhibition of viral protein synthesis we further detected reductions of viral antigen expression in the htnv-infected vero-e6 cells treated with 2 g plasmid throughout the course of a 9-d infection the greatest inhibitory rates were noted at 3 dpi 76113 for psilencer-s and 78224 for psilencer-m figure 2j moreover the antiviral effect lasted at least 7 d 43534 for psilencer-s and 46732 for psilencer-m at 7 dpi the efficacies of the inhibitions of htnv replication by psilencer-s and psilencer-m were also evaluated by detecting viral rna transcription at 48 hpi following 2-g plasmid treatment as illustrated in figure 3a when the cells were treated with 2 g of the rnai plasmid the efficiencies of s and m gene inhibition reached 89234 and 92721 at 48 hpi respectively at 96 hpi the culture samples were harvested serially diluted and assayed to determine the viral titers as illustrated in figure 3b the two shrna expression plasmids reduced the htnv yields by approximately 2 log10 compared with the control figure 3b taken together these results indicate that psilencer-s and psilencer-m significantly reduced viral rna transcripts viral antigen synthesis and progeny virus production in the htnv-infected vero-e6 cells suckling mice were infected with htnv as described above and treated with psilencer-s or psilencer-m at 1 and 3 dpi respectively compared with the psilencer-blank group the psilencer-s- and psilencer-m-treated animals died later and exhibited reduced clinical signs including weight loss ruffled fur huddling tendencies paralysis of the hind legs and spasms all placebo-treated and psilencer-blank-treated mice died with an mtd of 9 d whereas the treatments with the rnai plasmids increased the survival rates and mtds figure 4a the rnai plasmid treatment increased the survival rate to 273 and the mtd to 1213 d p005 the rnai plasmid therapy resulted in significant reductions in the viral titers from the brain lung and kidney samples collected on 8 dpi figure 4b which were homogenized serially diluted and assayed to determine the viral titers by ifa no infectious viral particles were detected in the lungs kidneys or brains of the survivors at 15 dpi the dynamic viral loads in the brains were analyzed by qrt-pcr which indicated that psilencer-s and psilencer-m significantly decreased htnv gene expression on 2 3 and 4 dpi figure 4c and 4d four animals from each group were sacrificed at 8 dpi and the brains lungs and kidneys were collected for pathological examination as illustrated in figure 5 in the viral control group the lung sections displayed thickened alveolar walls interstitial lymphocyte and macrophage infiltrations and hemorrhages the brain tissues exhibited scattered hemorrhages congestion edema and focal necrosis the kidney exhibited focal renal interstitial hemorrhages and congestion both the psilencer-s and psilencer-m treatments decreased the severities of the viral lesions in the brain lung and kidney tissues htnv infection has emerged as one of the severest infectious diseases threatening global health and has a significant worldwide economic influence2 in the present study we demonstrated that vector-based shrnas targeting specific sequences in the s and m segments of htnv inhibited the expression and replication of htnv in vitro and in vivo our results provide a new therapeutic candidate for the treatment of htnv infections since the discovery of rnai synthetic sirna duplexes that generally consist of 2123 nucleotides with 2-nt 3 overhangs have been used to target viral rnas in a sequence-specific manner following transfection2122 however the application of sirnas has been limited by their short half-lives the high costs of synthetic sirnas and instability due to degradation by nucleases another method for inducing rnai is via the transfection of plasmids that express antiviral short-hairpin rnas shrnas and this method is also an efficient means of eliciting rnai in vivo1521 our results indicated that the shrna expression plasmids psilencer-s and psilencer-m potently inhibited htnv production in the cell lines at 72 hpi and even at 96 hpi in the newborn mice these results provide a basis for the further development of sirna expression plasmids for htnv infection prophylaxis and therapy with the exception of ribavirin no antiviral drugs for the treatment of hantavirus infection have been identified several members of the bunyaviridae family particularly htnv are sensitive to ribavirin8 we have reported that ribavirin can induce an up to 36-fold decrease in the vrna level in htnv infection at 4 dpi20 which is equivalent to the in vitro effects of psilencer-s and -m observed in our experiments with regard to the in vivo administration the rnai plasmid treatments increased the survival rate to 273 in a lethal htnv-infected suckling mouse model zhou et al reported that the np-specific sirna expression plasmid pbabe-np protected two of the eight mice 28 challenged with the lethal dose of avian influenza virus h5n1 that killed all of the control mice15 this result is similar to the antiviral effects of the other sirna expression plasmids against htnv observed in our in vivo experiments however we noticed that ribavirin has been reported to be capably of affording 100 protection against lethal andes virus infections in hamsters8 and also increases the survival rate to 818 in seov-infected suckling icr mice23 the explanation of these phenomena may be related to the delivery of sirna the shrna expression plasmid was distributed in the brain because the blood-brain barrier bbb of newborn mice is immature24 however as a nonviral vector the psilencer shrna expression vector does not readily cross the cellular membrane and is not stably introduced into the cells further studies are required to solve this problem which is frequently considered a hurdle for the development of sirna-based therapeutics25 to our knowledge this is the first report of the inhibition of hantavirus infection with an shrna thus this report enriches the antiviral spectrum of rnai therapy in recent years known and emerging viruses have posed increasingly serious threats to public health effective vaccines and antiviral drugs are not available for the majority of these viruses the transfection of shrna-encoding plasmids is probably best-suited for the treatment of acute viral infections particularly among people infected with virus strains that are resistant to conventional antivirals and in cases of severe or re-emergent disease however a number of barriers to medical application remain to be solved eg improvements in delivery strategies and the safety and stability of sirna and other issues yuan-yuan liu zhan-qiu yang and hai-rong xiong designed the research plan yuan-yuan liu liang-jun chen yan zhong meng-xin

taubenberger 1999 however there are two controversies regarding its origin the first one is whether the virus originated from mammalian iva reassortment or directly from an avian virus antonovics hood  baker 2006 gibbs  gibbs 2006 taubenberger 2006 vana  westover 2008 and the second one is whether homologous recombination shaped the formation of the virus gibbs et al 2001 worobey rambaut pybus  robertson 2002 based on a comparison analysis of the amino acid aa sequences of the viral proteins taubenberger et al 2005 found that some proteins have the characteristics of avian viruses and proposed that the virus was not a reassortant but an avian virus in origin however this interpretation was questioned by several other groups because some genes of the virus were obviously clustered into swine or human branches in iva phylogenetic trees antonovics et al 2006 gibbs  gibbs 2006 vana  westover 2008 therefore the virus is considered a reassortant from mammalian ivas smith et al 2009

pinto holsinger  lamb 1992 to clarify the origin of the spanish flu virus we redissected the phylogenetic history of the virus and found that its m segment was a mosaic recombined from human and avian influenza viruses showing that homologous recombination is truly linked with the most devastating pandemic in addition we also provided direct phylogenetic evidence for the avian origin of the virus

employing basic local alignment search tool blast reassortment between viruses of different species in these representative genomes was checked through comparing their sequence identity with ivas deposited in genbank httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgi based on sequence identity to the query segment the host species distribution of the top 100 sbjct viruses is shown in table s1 except for pb1 of achickenrostock451934 h7n1 that may be associated with human iva no other reassortment events were found in these representative viruses to dissect the phylogenetic history of the m segment of the spanish flu virus 23 viruses of different years from 1902 to 2012 and different species were selected information about these viruses was included in virus name the sequences of ivas were aligned with the muscle programme implemented in mega 6 tamura et al 2011 the phylogenetic histories of these viruses were inferred using the maximum likelihood ml or neighbourjoining nj methods based on the best substitution model selected by the model test programme in mega 6 tamura et al 2011 the robustness of each lineage was tested using the bootstrap method 1000 replicates and the monophylogenetic lineage with a bootstrap value 70 was considered robust recombination analysis was carried out as per our previous studies he et al 2012 2009 in brief to distinguish the recombinant similarity comparison of nucleotide sequences between the putative recombinants and their parents was performed using the sliding window method in the simplot programme lole et al 1999 the sequence with contradiction identity was considered to be a putative recombinant integrating the fishers exact test method we identified the putative breakpoints p  005 with the maximum chisquare value of information site a set of statistically incongruent phylogenetic trees were recommended as the goldstandard approach for confirming the presence of recombination boni jong doorn  holmes 2010 therefore the recombinants were finally determined through the incongruent phylogenetic histories of different regions delimited by the putative recombination breakpoints shimodairahasegawa test was implemented to prove whether phylogenetic trees estimated from different regions were significantly different employing the tree test programme httpaix1uottawacasarisbro in order to dissect the phylogenetic history of the m segment of the spanish flu virus 23 iva representatives including h1n1 human n  11 classical h1n1 swine n  2 mixture avian n  8 and h7n7 equine n  2 were used to infer the origin of the m segment of the virus according to the phylogenetic history constructed from the complete m segments of these viruses the spanish flu virus belongs to the same monophylogentic lineage as the human h1n1 viruses figure 1 using the horse flu viruses as the control group and the spanish flu virus as the query we compared the m sequence of the spanish flu virus with those of human and avian flu viruses and discovered the crossover site between human and avian viruses in the m segment of the spanish flu virus before the site the spanish flu virus had higher similarity with the human viruses otherwise it was more like the bird viruses figure 2a using the spanish flu virus as the query to compare the m segment polymorphic sites of human and avian flu viruses this contradiction in sequence similarity signal became clearer figure 2a interestingly bootscan analysis gave two putative breakpoints figure 2b these results suggested that the m segment of the spanish flu virus might be a recombinant from human and avian flu viruses then choosing one representative isolate of human avian and horse flu viruses figure 2b respectively we employed fishers exact test to analyze information sites so as to determine the robustness of the potential recombination breakpoints of the two putative breakpoints with maximum chisquare value the first one position 590 in the m1 orf was statistically significant p  005 whereas the second one position 894 was not because there were not enough information sites after it to further determine this recombination event we reconstructed the phylogenetic history of the m segment using different regions delimited by the putative breakpoints before the first breakpoint the spanish flu virus was clustered into the human h1n1 lineage with 100 bootstrap support figure 3a inside the two breakpoints however it was nested in the clade of the bird viruses with 93 bootstrap value figure 3b the topologies of the two trees were significantly different shimodairahasegawa test p  00001 notably this difference was only attributed to the spanish flu virus in order to distinguish whether the cluster of the spanish flu virus into the avian branch was due to homologous recombination or convergent evolution adapting to avian host we reconstructed its phylogenetic history using the third nucleotides of codons in the m1 and m2 orfs between the two breakpoints figure 3b the topologies of the two trees were identical figure 3b and b therefore it is more likely that homologous recombination caused the spanish flu virus to jump into the avian branch rather than convergent evolution adapting to avian host the genetic material provided by the avian parent to the spanish flu virus is approximately 305 nucleotides nt in the m segment which encodes for 56 aas at the m1 cterminus and 60 aas at the m2 nterminus the m1 protein region from the avian virus is different from that of the human virus at two aas t218a d231n this could lead to rapid changes in virion composition since m1 is the most abundant protein in viral particles for m2 the recombination might cause a significant substitution up to five aas figure 4c the m2 genetic region from the avian virus encoded the complete phgated proton channel of the virus figure 4a and b in addition according to the sequence similarity and bootscan analysis of the concatenated iva genome and phylogenetic reconstruction of na and ns the na and ns segments of the spanish flu virus might be reassorted from avian ivas figure s1 within the ha segments there is also a crossover site in the sequence similarity plot figure s1a however there is no phylogenetic evidence that the similarity crossover of the ha gene is due to recombination figure s1c and d which is consistent with the previous report worobey et al 2002 establishing the genetic basis for interspecies transmission of ivas is paramount for predicting the potential human danger associated with new pandemic strains the latest influenza pandemic was also caused by h1n1 virus in 2009 the 2009 virus is a triple reassortant virus of swine origin that contains gene segments from swine human and avian influenza viruses garten et al 2009 but it does not have the high virulence as the spanish flu virus unlike the 2009 virus the spanish flu virus is considered not to have acquired genetic material from avian iva via reassortment or recombination antonovics et al 2006 gibbs  gibbs 2006 smith et al 2009 vana  westover 2008 however the spanish flu virus has multiple proteins carrying the unique aas of the avian branch suggesting its progenitors had infected avian before its outbreak and thus the mutations adaptive to birds might have been fixed in virus genome during circulation in avian host basler et al 2001 reid et al 1999 2004 2000 taubenberger et al 2005 interestingly in this study by introducing a bird iva lineage isolated in the early 20th century into the dataset we found that the na and ns segments of the spanish flu virus are more likely from avian iva moreover approximately 300 nt fragment of its m segment is also inherited from avian iva these results provided direct evidence for the avian origin of the virus the two major advantages of recombination over mutation are that recombination accelerates the rate at which advantageous genetic combinations are produced and allows more efficient removal of deleterious mutations simonloriere  holmes 2011 this could also result in the change of host tropism and virulent phenotypes as occurred with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv lemey rambaut  pybus 2006 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus sabir et al 2016 even for negative rna viruses recombination has also been responsible for outbreaks of bovine ephemeral fever virus in cattle he et al 2016 bat rabies virus in skunk and raccoon ding xu sun he  he 2017 and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus in human he  ding 2012 for the spanish flu virus gibbs et al 2001 proposed its ha was recombined from human and swine ivas and the recombination played the key role in the outbreak of the virus however this recombination evidence was thought to be invalid because the phylogenetic histories of ha were not different in the regions inside and outside the proposed recombination breakpoints worobey et al 2002 here we provided robust phylogenetic evidence that the m segment was a chimera inherited from a human virus and a bird virus showing that homologous recombination does be the important genetic mechanism driving the formation of the spanish flu virus although recombination might infrequently occur between ivas the avian ha protein binds preferentially to 23linked sialic acids whereas human ha protein binds preferentially to 26linked sialic acids this determines the host difference matrosovich  klenk 2003 however outbreaks of avian ivas such as h5n1 and h7n9 have been found in human being nga et al 2019 suggesting that avian iva can potential infect human several studies have also shown that ha of h7n9 can bind both human and aviantype receptors belser et al 2013 watanabe et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 therefore it is not strange that the spanish flu virus is a mosaic from avian and human ivas based on this study and previous reports smith et al 2009 taubenberger et al 2005 vana  westover 2008 we would like to propose a hypothesis about the origin of the spanish flu virus its progenitor a human flu virus occasionally infected birds during circulation in avian host the virus obtained the na and ns segments via reassortment and the 300 nt m segment through recombination from avian ivas and later jumped back to humans and caused the devastating pandemic however it is difficult to trace when the recombination event in the m segment took place because the real parents of the spanish flu virus cannot be identified therefore we are not sure to what extent this recombination affected the virus recent studies have showed that both the ha and pb2 proteins of the spanish flu virus can enhance viral replication moreover pb2 can also increase the virulence of the virus malaspinas malaspinas evans  slatkin 2012 qi et al 2018 here we found that the recombination has shaped a new m segment that is significantly different from any avian and mammalian ivas which may give the virus a unique biological phenotype it has been known that the disease course and pathological damage caused by the virus are associated with the capability of replicating to titers higher than those of other strains wolbach 1919 the m protein is the regulator of iva growth yasuda bucher  ishihama 1994 yasuda toyoda nakayama  ishihama 1993 small changes in m can have large effects on replication phenotype reid et al 2002 m can also affect the virulence of the virus brown liu kit baird  nesrallah 2001 smeenk wright burns thaker  brown 1996 through the recombination the spanish flu virus acquired the seven unique aas from the avian iva in m1 and m2 previous studies have shown that the mosaic proteins might have given the spanish flu virus a high replication capacity the recombinant m segments of its offspring strains pr34 apuerto rico834 h1n1 and wsn33 awsn33 h1n1 figure s2 have been shown to confer highgrowth characteristics in singlegene reassortant strains yasuda et al 1994 suggesting that the recombination may give the spanish flu virus a high replication power and thus influence its pathogenicity the 1957 asian flu and 1968 hong kong flu pandemics also involved ivas of avian and human origins kawaoka krauss  webster 1989 to see whether their m segments are the direct descendants of the 1918 spanish flu virus we also analyzed the m segment phylogenetic history of the three viruses based on the recombination event it turned out that the m segments of 1957 and 1968 viruses might not be directly descended from the 1918 virus since the recombination signal of the 1918 virus was not present in their m segments figure s2 in conclusion this study showed that the m segment of the spanish flu virus was a recombinant originating from human and avian ivas while the na and ns segments were generated by reassortment between mammalian and avian ivas providing direct evidence of its avian origin moreover the recombination might be associated with the high replication capacity of the virus and thus play an important role in its high pathogenicity  journal pre-proof characteristics of respiratory virus infection during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus in beijing

of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed characteristics of different respiratory virus infection retrospectively collected patients with definite etiological results using nasal and pharyngeal swabs in fever clinic results  1860 patients were screened and 136 patients were enrolled 72 5294 of them were diagnosed as influenza flu a virus infection 32 2353 of them were diagnosed as flu b virus infection 18 1324 and 14 1029 of them were diagnosed as covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection respectively covid-19 group had a higher rate of contact with epidemic area within 14 days and clustering onset than other groups fever was the most common symptom in these patients the ratio of fever and the highest temperature were higher in flu a virus infection patients than in covid-19 patients covid-19 patients had lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than flu a virus and rsv infection group but higher lymphocyte count than flu a and b virus infection groups covid-19 group 8333 had higher rate of pneumonia in chest ct scan than flu a and b virus infection groups conclusions page 3 of 18 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 3 influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of respiratory virus infection even during the epidemic of covid-19 in beijing no single symptom or laboratory finding was suggestive of specific respiratory virus however epidemic history was important for screening of covid-19  which is spreading in china 1  and influenza a h1n1 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov that emerged in the past decade 2 3 4  2019-ncov is payed much attention recently 5  and disease caused by 2019-ncov was named as covid-19 short for coronavirus disease 2019 by world health organization 6  however other respiratory viruses even though not that widely spreading can also cause similar symptoms as 2019-ncov does and should not be ignored here we summarized the composition of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed characteristics of different respiratory viruse infection patients with fever oral temperature 373 or respiratory symptoms cough sputum pharyngalgia rhinorrhea dyspnea and so on were suggested to go to fever clinics for screening in beijing peking union medical college hospital pumch had a fever clinic for screening also to strictly control the development of the epidemic situation of covid-19 all patients with epidemiologic history of covid-19 there was a history of travel or residence in wuhan and its surrounding areas and communities with reported cases within two weeks before the onset of the disease or within 14 days before the onset of the disease contacted with covid-19 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 5 patients with positive nucleic acid test or within 14 days before the onset of the disease contacted with patients with fever and respiratory symptoms from wuhan and its surrounding areas and communities with reported cases or there was clustering onset of disease 7 were required to screen even though without fever or respiratory symptoms at pumch clustering onset was defined as two or more cases of fever and  or respiratory symptoms were found in a small area such as family office school class and other places within two weeks patients medical records were taken by doctors containing the symptoms signs epidemic history and so on epidemic history contained 1 contacted with epidemic area within two weeks before the onset of the disease 2 contacted with confirmed or suspected cases within two weeks before the onset of the disease 3 contacted with poultry livestock or wild animals especially dead animals within two weeks before the onset of the disease 4 clustering onset nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected by clinicians with  statistical analysis was finished by spss statistics 170 the normality of the distribution was assessed using the kolmogorov-smirnov test group t-test was applied to the normal distribution data and mann-whitney u test was applied to the non-normal distribution data data are shown as meanssd or median25-75 chi square test was used for comparison of two or multiple rates or components analyses were presented as two-sided comparisons the p value less than 005 was considered to be significant  fever was the most common symptom in the respiratory virus infection patients all the patients of flu a virus infection had fever the ratio was higher than that in  there was no statistical difference in complete blood count parameters between similar to what was reported in covid-19 9  fever was the most common symptom in the respiratory virus infection patients in this study the ratio of fever and the highest temperature were higher in flu a virus infection patients than in covid-19 patients given to the absence of fever and low grade fever in covid-19 patients and its high risk 10 11  it was feasible to ask fever free patients with respiratory symptoms to screen as it was previously recommended 11  even though the rate of pharyngalgia headache myalgia and fatigue were relatively higher in influenza infection groups it could not be said that presence of these symptoms was page 10 of 18 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 10 meaningful for excluding covid-19 because they were not specific symptoms in different respiratory virus infection indeed no specific symptoms were helpful in distinguishing covid-19 from other respiratory virus infection 11  as it was previously reported covid-19 patients had low or normal wbc and neutrophil count 9 10  and in this study it showed that covid-19 patients even had lower wbc count and neutrophil count than flu a virus and rsv infection group also it was reported that they had low lymphocyte count 9 10  but this study found that the lymphocyte count was higher in covid-19 than in flu a and b virus infection patients this results said that low wbc neutrophil and lymphocyte were suggestive of viral infection but could not distinguish different respiratory virus also even though crp level was higher in rsv infection group than in covid-19 and flu b infection group but it was not statistically different in flu a infection flu b infection and covid-19 groups however it was possible that lower wbc and lymphocyte levels and higher crp level might be more valuable in monitoring the disease severity rather than in screening for covid-19 10  the value of cbc parameters and crp deserved more study in respiratory virus infection the percentage of pneumonia in chest ct scan was higher in covid-19 group than in flu a and b virus infection group it was in accordance with other studies that showed covid-19 patients were likely to had pneumonia 9 10  and covid-19 should be vigilant if it showed pneumonia in chest ct scan during the spreading of 2019-ncov as what was recommended in a screening procedure in fever clinic 11  and chest ct scan might be a fast and convenient tool in the distinguishing ground-glass opacity
