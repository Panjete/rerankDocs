the interruption of infection chains through appropriate hand sanitization was pioneered in 1847 by the hungarian physician semmelweis ignc flp ignaz philipp semmelweis and became what is probably the first example of evidencebased medicine4 isolation or quarantine social distancing and physical barriers like masks are additional measures to slow the transmission of respiratory viruses other measures like prophylactic coating of airways with polymers are under development5 frequent handwashing proved effective against the spread of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic in 200220036 and of the middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 20077 however this hygienic measure is not easy to implement for individuals with frequent customer or patient contact or travelers hand sanitizer solutions or gels are recommended as an alternative in these cases among the most popular sanitizers are alcoholic hand rub solutionswhile nonenveloped viruses like norovirus or rhinoviruses have a low sensitivity towards alcoholic denaturing agents members of the enveloped coronaviridae family are highly sensitive towards ethanol or isopropanol 2propanol chlorhexidine gluconate and sodium hypochlorite were found to be surprisingly inefficient8 repeated use of alcohols dries out the skin and small quantities of the alcohols may be absorbed but they are effective9 the literature on the inactivation of previously known coronaviruses by surface disinfection procedures suggested 6271  ethanol to be effective against sarscov2 within 1 min10 experimental work by several laboratories on the virus itself then showed that it is even less stable toward denaturation by alcoholic solutions11 exposure to concentrations of just 30  of either ethanol or isopropanol for 30 seconds fully suppressed viral infectivity likewise the virucidal activity of the hand rub solutions known as who formulation 1 with 85  ethanol and who formulation 2 with 75  isopropanol against sarscov2 was found to be excellent with full inactivation of the coronavirus at 40  or 30  concentration respectively while the alcohol component is the main virucide 0125  vv h2o2 is added to kill bacterial spores that may be present in the raw materials or the container the addition of 145  vv glycerol as a humectant improves the dermatological properties and thus the acceptance of the product12 for surface disinfection the same formulation may be used with no additives required and surgical hand preparation may be achieved by three applications for a duration of 35 minunfortunately commercial sanitizer solutions containing either alcohol can be difficult to obtain in the current health crisis we are unaware of data for other countries but data published by the german federal statistical office destatis show the severity of the problem during the week of march 28 2020 sales of disinfectants were 75fold higher than usual and in the subsequent weeks they dropped to half the normal sales as the products were largely sold out13 by comparison the increase in sales of soap reached a peak of 34fold of the average and that of toilet paper just 21fold of the sales averaged over the preceding six monthsethanol is produced on a large scale on our planet the us renewable fuels association reported that 85 million metric tons were produced in 2018 worldwide14 the european renewable ethanol association epure stated that the production of the european union in the same year was 46 million metric tons while an additional 05 million tons were imported15 besides minor usage by the chemical industry and food and beverages production 9  each the lions share 82  of the production was used as a fuel additive against the backdrop of reduced individual mobility during the crisis in most countries it appears likely that enough bioethanol should currently be available for the health sectorseveral factors appeared to contribute to the supply problems as mentioned above one factor was hoarding by consumers who bought unreasonable quantities of sanitizers while they were still available quickly depleting what pharmacies and drug stores had in stock furthermore the supply chain was partially disrupted while truckloads of ethanol were available in europe the logistics of getting trucks to sites that can fill 200 l drums became more challenging due to closed or tightly controlled borders drums of this size then had to be transported to facilities that can either produce sanitizers or fill the smaller containers commonly used by pharmacists furthermore the containers used in medical practices as well as the dispensers used by physicians health care workers and consumers became ever more difficult to obtain prompting unconventional measures such as refillson march 4 the bundesanstalt fr arbeitsschutz und arbeitsmedizin baua16 the relevant regulatory body in germany issued a decree that allowed pharmacies to produce hand sanitizer solutions locally the decree and its update of march 6 confirmed that aqueous solutions of ethanol do not require regulatory approval to be produced for sale as biocidical agents the first decree also explicitly mentioned aqueous 2propanol 70  and who formulation 2 as biocidal agents for hand hygieneunfortunately medical grade alcohol as a starting material for the local production of disinfectant solutions including hand rub formulations was largely sold out in germany in the second week of march the usual suppliers of pharmacists typically gave delivery times of several weeks at the peak of the supply crunch this left technical grade ethanol or isopropanol of unknown purity as the only available starting material for the preparation of hand rub formulations without analysis this source was considered problematic by many solving the analytical problem is where organic chemists in academia were able to contributethe baua decree mentions a purity of 99  ww or 9922  vv for isopropanol to be in accordance with eu law the who guideline states that analysis should be made when an analysis certificate is not available to verify the alcohol concentration and to adjust the volume used to obtain the final recommended concentration what local pharmacists use for quality control and what the who guideline mentions is an alcoholmeter that measures the density of the liquid but does not provide information on its chemical composition gas chromatography is mentioned in the who guideline for higher level quality control but this option is largely unavailable to pharmacists in the fieldwe and others then analyzed technical grade isopropanol and ethanol by 1h nmr spectroscopy a 1  solution of either alcohol in cdcl3 gave wellresolved spectra with excellent signaltonoise ratio showing minimal levels of impurities for isopropanol acetone was detected as the most prominent trace impurity by spiking with authentic material due to its low toxicity and its traditional use in nail polish remover this impurity was considered unproblematic for hand rubs and the purity of our technical grade isopropanol was declared sufficient for producing hand sanitizer locally together with a collaborating pharmacist as a consequence substantial supplies of the alcohol could be freed up for local production quickly as of mid april over 2 metric tons of who formulation 2 have been delivered to physicians in the state of badenwrttemberganother area where chemists may contribute is the development of antiviral drugs small molecule drugs have been game changers in the fight against other viruses among them are azt zdv zidovudin retrovir17 a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and the first compound approved to treat aids another breakthrough antiviral drug is sofosbuvir 1 trade name sovaldi shown in figure 118 an inhibitor of the rnadependent rna polymerase of hepatitis c virus hcv that is able to cure patients of the vicious disease caused by this virus like sarscov2 hcv is an enveloped singlestranded positivesense rna virus
while sarscov2 is commonly described as a novel virus genetically it is closely related to the sars coronavirus sarscov or sarscov11 the rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp is 96  homologous for the two viruses this polymerase is a prime target for antiviral therapy as human cells do not contain such an enzyme that copies rna sequences into rna two other drug targets are the main proteinase 3clpro and the spike protein of the viral envelope with a much lower level of sequence identity a review of this and the avenues it offers for drug intervention can be found in a recent paper by liu and colleagues19 in this context it is worth mentioning that opportunities for therapy were identified for sarscov1 more than 15 years ago20 21 22 another betacoronavirus that is related to sarscov2 is the virus causing mers again this virus has been studied in detail and options for therapeutic intervention have been identified23 24
successful rna polymerase inhibitors such as sofosbuvir18 work by incorporating modified nucleosides into the viral genome that halt viral replication this approach has been very successful in the treatment of hepatitis c which can be cured within a short treatment period the drug sofosbuvir is a phosphoramidate prodrug or protide a type of compound pioneered by chris mcguigan25 it is metabolized in the liver in several steps into its active triphosphate form which is recognized and incorporated as an analog of uridine5triphosphate by the hepatitisc virus polymerase one of the frontrunner drug candidates for the treatment of covid19 remdesivir 2 is a similar prodrug construct it is a cnucleoside mimic of adenosine monophosphate26 in protide phenyl phosphoramidate form remdesivir was developed by gilead sciences to combat ebola and related filoviruses but did not have sufficient activity against these targets in 2017 it was shown in vitro and in animals that it can inhibit merscov and sarscov1 replication27 in the replication processes remdesivir in its triphosphate form competes with its natural counterpart adenosinetriphosphate atp inducing rna chain terminationbased on the high sequence similarity between sarscov1 and the causal agent of the covid19 pandemic homology modeling was used to predict the 3d structures of the rdrp and other important viral proteins of the latter out of the more than 20 viral proteins encoded in the sarscov2 genome proteases 3clpro mentioned above and plpro represent potential targets for antiviral drugs the 3chymotrypsinlike protease 3clpro of sarscov2 differs in only 12 out its 306 amino acid residues from its ortholog in sarscov1 its structure was quickly predicted in silico and this was used for the virtual docking of a collection of 7173 commercial drugs in the search for candidates for drug repurposing28 among the topscoring candidates for which the highest binding affinities were predicted were the two antivirals velpatasvir and ledipasvir both compounds are fdaapproved inhibitors of the ns5a protein of the hepatitis c virus but so far the predicted action against the sarscov2 3clpro has not been confirmed experimentally a similar approach on the same enzyme was employed by another team and led to different candidate structures29 while a team from china and saudi arabia chose to identify phytochemicals as potential inhibitors in similar fashion using in silico methods30 while modeling is fast it does not produce a new drug and experimental work is needed to validate those predictions a recent crystal structure of 3clpro also referred to as mpro complexed with an ketoamide inhibitor shows how quickly encouraging results can be obtained experimentally31 a crystal structure of the rdrp of sarscov2 has also been published in the last few days32
one of the most detailed theoretical studies thus far used homology modeling on 19 different sarscovproteins and on the human ace2 receptor protein the putative molecular entry vehicle for the virus into human cells for virtual drug screening33 for each viral protein and for the ace2 receptor several drugs or natural products were identified as potential binders notably remdesivir was also found to bind to the rdrp enzyme of sarscov2 in silico experimentally activity against sarscov2 was also demonstrated in vitro34 in the same experimental study antiviral activity was found for the antimalarial drug chloroquine which is unlikely to act on either rdrp or proteases chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine35 act on several targets and can have severe side effects their antiinflammatory effect may reduce the level of proinflammatory cytokine il6 mobilized by the immune system of covid19 patients in order to kill infected cells before too many copies of the virus are made sometimes this defense mechanism overreacts resulting in a lifethreatening condition36 both remdesivir and chloroquine are currently among the compounds undergoing clinical trials with covid19 patientsthe synthesis of compounds like remdesivir is far from trivial though not least because the amino acid ester and aryloxy group make the phosphorus of the phosphoramidate a stereogenic center synthesizing chiral phosphoramidates of this level of complexity is a synthetic challenge37 and so is the synthesis of other drug candidates for treating the virus that will be identified by homology modeling and targetbased virtual ligand screening or conventional medicinal chemistry approaches developing efficient syntheses for such compounds and making them available to laboratories that test them is a second opportunity for chemists who wish to contribute to fighting sarscov2there is a third opportunity for chemists in the current crisis reaching out to others through our scientific societies when a virus spreads and employees stay home running an efficient operation becomes difficult as soon as an employee gets infected and obtains a positive test result entire divisions may be shut down to prevent the spreading of the virus colleagues in quarantine must be provided with food and other supplies and homeschooling ties up significant resources as a consequence many members of our societies are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress or are too overwhelmed by emails and calls to remain fully operational this problem affects the supply chain from drivers to executives but it is not limited to logistics and production it also affects authorities the apparent suicide of dr thomas schfer the minister of finance of the german state of hesse is a tragic example of what can happen to those put under ever increasing pressure in the current pandemic trying to spread useful information through governmental channels can thus add to the stress level of administratorswe feel that the network our scientific societies such as the german chemical society gdch offer can and should be used to reach out to each other social media can be very useful but are also the source of unfiltered anger and accusations emails to a select group of colleagues such as the members of the liebigvereinigung the organic division of the gdch well maintained and checked by the officers of the society can be a way to disseminate information that does not suffer from said disadvantages another option is posting useful information on the newly installed corona webpage of the gdch38
chemists have contributed very significantly already not least by synthesizing the necessary amounts of primers and dntps for test kits but there are countless challenges that lie ahead broader testing for viral infections39 as well as serological testing to confirm immunity a task that proved difficult even for the relatively confined mers outbreak40 41 is just one of them improving the social acceptance of face masks in some western countries42 and producing such masks in sufficient quantities is anotherwhether it is instructions for producing buffers required for test kits or simple face masks for protection against infectious droplets useful information can be shared the same is true for funding opportunities or legal issues that affect society members chemists are resourceful people and scientific societies are exceptionally experienced in sorting through information submitted to their journals here lies a third opportunity for chemists to contributewhen we almost ran out of isopropanol for our hand sanitizer solutions a nonpublic email call led to a company in the area offering larger quantities of the solvent the company was willing to offer it well below its current inflated market price and our university was willing to support us with logistics and the free use of facilities at the end of a busy day one of the clinical pharmacologists who helped with the local production of who formulation 2 looked at our less than attractive facility and said there is still an important role for good old chemistry in our societythe authors declare no conflict of interestsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is an enveloped strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-191 it is known to spread through droplets suspended in the air as well as contact with contaminated surfaces contaminated hands are the leading vehicles of transmission through touch on ones eyes mouth and nostrils thus introducing the virus into the mucosa1 viruses including sars-cov-2 are wrapped in lipid membranes and attach onto the hands facilitated by the presence of body oils with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends2desperate measures to contain the covid-19 pandemic have been proposed ranging from hand washing social distancing and community containments among others13 other public health and community-based strategies imposed by countries such as china north america italy and south africa include cancellation of public events restrictions on human contact games school closures and screening of incoming passengers at airports13-5 the impact of these measures which are majorly informed by lessons learnt from similar outbreaks are yet to be conclusively outlined6kenya has adopted a number of measures in dealing with covid-19 including a recommendation that the government should supply the marginalized communities with water and soap for hand washing7 though this may not be sustainable due to economic challengeshand washing with soap and water is now highlighted as a first-line preventive and a hygienic practice in dealing with covid-198 although this simple yet effective action is advocated as a first-line measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus several households from resource-limited settings and with poor access to water and sanitation may struggle to adhere to this criterion9 in particular people living in rural areas and informal urban settlements in developing counties such as kenya are more likely to be affected compared with the rest of the population10 in kenya alone only 59 of the population have access to clean water services11 the ministry of health organizes workshops and communication campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of hand washing with soap to prevent the spread of disease however only 5 of people wash their hands with soap at critical times11 in the current unprecedented situation of covid-19 hand washing together with cleaning of surfaces commonly shared by people is recommended to prevent the spread of virus8 the culture of hand sanitization is foreign practice to many in the communityin the informal settlements in kenya water supply is intermittent scarce and unaffordable for most households12 in cases when water is available families living in these areas struggle to strike a balance between using the scarce resource for hand hygiene and other competing basic needs such as cooking livestock watering and drinking12although alcohol-based hand sanitizers have been suggested as an alternative to hand washing they remain costly for many households living in the informal settlements furthermore hand sanitizers are not effective in visibly soiled hands12-14 in their study on alternative strategies for hand hygiene in resource-limited settings sandhu and goodnight15 suggested sustainable incremental improvement in hand washing by using available and alternative resources such as ash and soda such approaches would translate to the use of what is accessible and possibly effective as the communities work toward the ideal situation of soap and running water for handwashing it therefore important to explore existing evidence to understand the alternative strategies for hand wash and cleaning of shared surfaces in absence of soap water or alcohol-based sanitizersour aim was to document alternative indigenous and workable solutions in the absence of alcohol-based sanitizers water and soap we reviewed studies that reported the use of locally available products that can be used to decrease virus attachment on surfaces and decontaminate exposed hands and clothes some studies hypothesize that viruses can be dislodged from hands and clothes when the content of dissolved organic or inorganic matter is increased to create competition for binding sites with the virus16 traditionally soil ash and salt have been used as both mechanical and chemical forms of neutralizing contaminants in soiled hands and surfaces1617 dry kitchen ash has previously been recommended as an alternative to soap in hand washing in kenya18 the premise of the effectiveness of such materials assumes that households will obtain the soil ash and salt from uncontaminated sources contaminated soil ash or salt may have detrimental effects such as infections with microbes and parasites among others16 the availability of these alternative methods may be limited to people living in informal urban settlements areas but not in the rural areaswe searched the literature from pubmed to identify eligible articles studies were then mapped assessed and synthesized for a narrative presentation we used a combination of the following search terms to identify articles that we included for further assessment coronavirus or covid-19 and mechanical coronavirus or covid-19 and sodium chloride coronavirus or covid-19 and sand coronavirus or covid-19 and alkaline coronavirus or covid-19 and temperature coronavirus or covid-19 and salt coronavirus or covid-19 and ash a pubmed search was supplemented by a search of articles from google scholar and gray literature from the world health organization websitearticles were included if they met the following criteria 1 article represents a research article rather than a letter or commentary 2 the primary focus of the study was to test or evaluate the effectiveness of an alternative strategy for handwashing or cleaning surfaces 3 the study setting was a community or a resource-limited environment or 4 studies reported the experiences of communities using the alternative strategy out of the 15 full-text articles that were screened at the eligibility stage 8 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria did not evaluate the effectiveness of alternative strategy n  3 study setting was not a community n  3 and the article was not a research article n  2 please see the prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses flow diagram showing the selection of articles figure 1two authors lk and ac independently reviewed the full-text articles and where discrepancies were noted they were resolved in consultation with the third and fourth reviewer pw and in until a consensus was builtat the cellular level hypertonic conditions have been known to inhibit coronavirus20 at the same time the high osmolality of sodium chloride is known to kill microbes through desiccation and dissolution of fats and oils on the surface therefore detaching the contaminants from colonized surfaces including the hands22gargling with naturally occurring sea water or salt solution containing chloride ions cl inhibit a number of viruses including the coronavirus from the throat mucosa resulting in a reduction of the viral infection period with an average of 25 days and a reduction in viral shedding2021sand soil and ash have been used as hand washing agents in low resource setting23 the act of rubbing of hands with sand generates mechanical force adequate to dislodge any form of matter on the surface of the hands and by default carry away other types of contaminants including microbes17 although the reviewed studies did not document the mechanism of action against coronavirus specifically it is implied that these mechanical actions may be of benefit in coronavirus dislodgement it is noted that the effectiveness of use of these alternative materials is subject to the quality and amount of water concurrently used24 studies on use of these materials without water are limited if available however an anecdotal note on fresh wood ash highlighted its alkaline nature and its use as a dry agent on surfaces such as floors handles and on body wastes such as vomit and blood stains25effect of ph on the fusion of coronavirus with the host cell has been documented2627 as well as the loss of its infectivity at ph of 827 the possibility of decreased attachment to inanimate surfaces covered with fluids of over ph of 8 may be inferred from this observation28 ash of any kind creates an alkaline environment that does not support the existence of most pathogens with possibility of destabilizing coronaviruses that thrive in a ph of between 55 and 8029 the effect of highly acidic environment on sars-cov-2 needs further investigation decreasing the ph of inanimate surfaces by rubbing ph altering acidic fruits such as lemon on hands in the event of unavailability of water need to be exploredtemperatures higher than 27c have been reported to reduce coronavirus infectivity in surrogate cells and inanimate surfaces192730 high temperatures and low humidity have been reported to reduce the transmission of covid-19 by wang et al31 similarly nursing covid-19 patients in a warm atmospheric temperature has been reported to contribute to improved survival rates32on this basis it may be necessary to investigate the hypothesis that sun-drying with temperature of over 27c of contaminated items like clothes and other inanimate objects may be desirable to prevent transmission of the coronavirus this option may apply to households where infected persons have been identified and isolated airing personal effects in the open sun may work effectively in places with limited access to water33 the thermal benefit may be achieved through placing items on dry black soil surfaces that can reach 60c in tropical sun25 sunlight provides natural supplementation of vitamin d which is known to protect the respiratory system by regulating secretion of pro inflammatory cytokines known to cause lung injury34 exposure of family members to sunshine and warmth may be beneficial in the management of covid-19 infectionrandomized studies should be carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of these alternative hygiene management methods on coronavirus the findings of such randomized studies may generate protocols for their use these local products if proven to be effective may reduce cost and increase access to decontamination products especially to disadvantaged communities the results of such studies could lead to development of policy that could be beneficial especially to the marginalized communities the proposed alternatives to water soap and commercial sanitizers for hygiene and decontamination of surfaces in resource-limited settings are timely in the face of covid-19 pandemic these alternative products need however to be evaluated in order to derive evidence-based conclusions about the side effects on the skin when used as hand sanitizersfew studies have specifically been done to establish the impact of these alternative wash methods on sars-cov-2 the studies done at cellular levels involving sars virus family though with some positive results may not be inferred on external and inanimate surfaces sars-cov-2 may not report similar behavior to the rest of sars familyas at this moment there is no vaccine for the prevention of covid-19 the best prevention is to avoid being exposed to the virus adhikari et al 20201 as a result of this government and individuals adopted various measures in preventing the spread of the disease the government and health sector advocacy groups contributed tremendously to the spike in the use of various preventive methods such as citytown and national lockdown self-isolation quarantine stay-at-home model avoidance of crowd social distancing wearing of face-mask and hand gloves periodic hand washing particularly with liquid soapsdetergents use of abhs avoidance of touching the face among others following unsubstantiated claims some individuals in the developing countries resulted to the overconsumption of acclaimed immune-boosting substances such as ginger garlic lemon fruits and salt solution etc besides some in the tropical countries believed that the hot weather could reduce the chances of survival of the virus hence they resulted to staying long hours in the bright day sunlight andor periodic consumption of hot drinks such as water tea and juice with the intention of providing an unhealthy high temperature environment for the survival of the infectious virus some other people resulted to the consumption of food or substances that increases the ph of the body to the alkaline region since there were unsubstantiated claims that the virus does not survive at alkalinic ph although viruses are sensitive to ph and temperature changes and cannot survive beyond a narrow range sturman et al 199085 mi et al 201962 a crude means of achieving such could be more deadly than envisagedmoreover the tentative approval by the united states tentative of chloroquine-based therapy as trial for the management of covid-19 patients on compassionate ground based on who guideline led some individuals to an unethical practice of the indiscriminate consumption of chloroquine-based drugs as both prophylaxis and curative although initial trials indicated some interesting positive results at minute doses gao et al 202033 liu et al 202054 singh et al 202082 reports are still premature and yet to be universally accepted if clinical data confirm the antiviral activity of chloroquine-based drugs the novel covid-19 could become one of the cheapest and simplest to treat among infectious respiratory diseases this is because the drugs are quite affordable raoult et al 202073 the affordability and accessibility of the chloroquine-based drugs partly led to the abuse with resultant lethality and health hazards which included abdominal discomfort coma and even death in some cases wong et al 2011101 in fact the moderate dose of chloroquine can cause effects such as depression psychosis delirium mood swing personality change among others good and shader 198236 the close derivative hydroxychloroquine is also known to possess side effects such as retinal toxicity cardiovascular toxicity refractory shock and ventricular arrhythmias fung et al 200732 rther et al 200776 marmor et al 201660 tsang et al 201991 meanwhile chloroquine phosphate and a few other derivatives have been reported as potential anti-dote to covid-19 infection gao et al 202033 sahraei et al 202078although many of these preventive measures were often adopted many of them frequently present mild to severe implications with only a few of them proving really potent and safe in reality some of the measures were quite detrimental to human health and it could result to death before even contracting the dreaded viral infection covid-19 choi et al 201722 chan and chan 201820 while all the measures adopted thus far have both their merits and demerits this report focuses more on the chemistry of the death and the associated danger particularly in the use of hand sanitizers and other applied preventive chemicals against the spread of covid-19 as well as other germs the advent of the covid-19 outbreak marked the commencement of the surge in the series of industrial and domestic-made chemicals like the hand sanitizers liquid soaps disinfectants and others the upsurge in the global consumption of hand sanitizers following the covid-19 pandemic was unprecedentedly geometrical the use of hand sanitizer became well renowned to the extent that some individuals apply on their hands every 30 minutes especially when outside the home while the practice seems a plausibly effective on-the-go solution in the prevention of the spread of the viral infection other serious dangers are quite associated although microorganisms pervade almost everywhere human survives bhoonderowa et al 201410 kljalg et al 201747 and the use of sanitizers can help in minimizing their spread and deleterious effect on human the frequent use may however pre-dispose users to some degree of fatality chan et al 201721 chan and chan 201820various sub-standard brands of hand sanitizers flooded both offline and online markets in the developed and developing countries besides the hike in the prices of these household products their acquisition could be tantamount to self-purchase of quicker death while the chemical composition of the various household antiviral preventive products used is sometimes regional or country-based some chemicals are more accessible and universal to all some of them are thus discussed hereinhand sanitizers are hygienic products that are applied on the hands to prevent the spread of microorganisms like viruses bacterial and fungi such as coronaviruses rhinoviruses influenza viruses herpes simplex virus ebola virus staphylococcus aureus enterococcus faecalis escherichia coli traveller diarrhoea among others especially where access to water is limited fendler et al 200230 conover and gibson 201624 wolfe et al 2017100 thaddeus et al 201887 kuenzli et al 201950 hand sanitizers though originally developed for the healthcare sector ascenzi 19953 block 200112 it has become a routine for many people to carry hand sanitizer with them at all times especially during the recent disease outbreak industrial and home-made hand sanitizers are made of various chemical compositions subject to what is locally available a brief check of brands on the internet local markets and the literatures indicated two main categories of sanitizers alcohol-based and non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers nabhs the alcohol-based hand sanitizers abhs are primarily composed of alcohols such as either ethanol isopropyl alcohol propan-1-ol or propan-2-ol and additives such as colorants stabilizers fragrance and sometimes preservatives which may include formaldehyde parabens among other chemicals luby et al 200457 200556 kramer et al 200748 napolitani et al 202065 other chemicals usually added for various purposes include polyacrylic acid glycerin carbomer propylene glycol triethanolamine trolamine tetraethylammonium chloride dichlorodimethylphenol figure 1fig 1 chlorine deionized water and extract of plants wolfe et al 2017100 thaddeus et al 201887 surini et al 201886 the world health organization guideline for the preparation of abhs revealed the composition to be 80  ethanol 145  glycerol and 0125  hydrogen peroxide or 75  isopropyl alcohol 145  glycerol and 0125  hydrogen peroxide who 201097 on the other hand the non-alcohol based hand sanitizers nabhs are made up of various chemicals similar to the component found in the alcohol-based type with the exclusion of alcohol however anti-microbial or disinfecting agents such as triclosan tcs triclocarban sodium hypochlorite chlorhexidine benzalkonium chloride and benzithonium chloride are often added hayat and munnawar 201642 bondurant et al 201913some of the chemicals used in various disinfectants include chloroxyphenol b oleum aromaticum triclosan triethanolamine tetraethylammonium dichlorodimethylphenol chlorine etc it is quite imperative that antimicrobial agents disinfectants and antiseptics substances possess strong activities against the pathogens including the biofilm-forming pathogens else antimicrobial resistance could easily develop bridier et al 201116 hauser et al 201641 ghanem et al 201835 the assumption has led to the use of extremely strong and sometimes hazardous chemicals as disinfectants for effectiveness or improved potency combinations of two or more active ingredients are often used in some anti-viral disinfectants ahmed et al 20202a newly developed nabhs which contains only 14  alcohol by volume and usually applied in small volume was reported to work synergistically with the other active agent in the sanitizer via a system called quad system technology to kill the virus and other germs cavage 201017generally in abhs formulations with ethanol between 60 and 95  are known to be significantly effective in preventing spread of microbial infections kramer et al 200249 and are generally regarded safe fda 199429 who recommends washing of hands under running tap water and when the resources for that is not available abhs comes handy however the abhs are recommended over the use of soap due to its ease of use and capability in stalling microbial spread who 200998 hayat and munnawar 201642 however some other potential alternatives such as nonorganic antibiotics and organic or natural biocides have been proposed in place of triclosan due to some of the reported side effects kim et al 200746many abhs carry a lot of risks first most abhs contain alcohols in excess of 60  which made them to be classified as class i flammable liquid substance as a result of their flash point below 100 c fahrenheit kramer et al 200249 fda 202028 precisely ethanol 80  vv and isopropyl alcohol 75  vv have flash points of 175 c and 19 c respectively who 202095 this quite indicates that the products can ignite at relatively low temperatures hence abhs increase the risk of fire accidents although abhs are a more accessible and usually a preferred choice for many people during epidemics like the covid-19 compared to choices like the towelettes rai et al 201772 yet they carry their own significant risks the risk associated with the use of the abhs includes accidental poisoning via ingestion fire hazard organ toxicity via absorption through the skin among others figure 2fig 2 children are often attracted to the nature smell and cool feel of alcohol on the skin and series of accidental poisonings including fatal ones in child ren have been reported chan and chan 201820 for instance investigation carried out on young children who swallowed abhs revealed that they were diagnosed of apnea acidosis and some even went into coma rayar and ratnapalan 201374 it has been established that younger children have decreased liver glycogen stores which increases their risk of developing hypoglycemia and have various pharmacokinetic factors which make them more susceptible to developing toxicity from alcohol tran et al 200789 marek and kraft 201459 in addition alcohol-alcohol dilution is a major contamination in the industry a more affordable alcohol with similar physical properties is sometimes used to adulterate another alcohol for pecuniary profit if the ethanol for instance is adulterated with other toxic alcohols such as methanol irreversible blindness coma or even death could result gormley et al 201237 forrester 201531 moore 201963 methanol is known to be more lethal than ethanol as unintentional ingestion by children and deliberate consumption by older subjects often lead to poisoning requiring prompt antidotal therapy critical care in addition to other supporting therapy chan and chan 201820 methanol is reportedly more toxic when inhaled or exposed to human orally or through the skin alcohol concentration in the blood could increase via absorption through the skin when used frequently due to its toxicity it is therefore strongly not recommended for use in hand sanitizers however some reports indicated that such contaminations have been observed in abhs mowry et al 201564 chan and chan 201820 transdermal poisoning resulting from skin absorption of methanol is well reported qiao and guo 199271 ryu et al 201677 in fact exposure to methanol was reported to cause multiple sclerosis henzi 198443 other types of alcohol-alcohol intoxication and poisoning have been reported chan et al 201721 chan and chan 201820the commonly used alcohol in abhs ethanol is a known toxicant and central nervous cns depressant capable of inducing hypoglycemia baum 20179 moore 201963 the use of isopropanol-based hand sanitizers carries equal or even greater risk than ethanol-based counterparts isopropanol besides being intoxicating it is converted in the liver to acetone propanone which causes greater cns depression than ethanol litovitz 198653 various deaths and morbidities associated with abhs have been reported gormley et al 201237 darracq et al 201325 jones et al 201345 forrester 201531 basyal et al 20188 moore 201963 interestingly there has been emerging cases of alcohol-tolerant microorganisms which therefore cast aspersion on the future of the use of alcohol in hand sanitizers pidot et al 201870 bondurant et al 201914 it is predicted that more organisms would develop resistance to alcohol in the near future if indiscriminate discharge to the environment is not controlledother adverse health effects that could result from both abhs and nabhs include ocular irritation vomiting conjunctivitis oral irritation cough and abdominal pain qiao and guo 199271 choi et al 201722 chan and chan 201820 in some rare scenario adverse effects could include acidosis respiratory depression headache hypoglycemia irreversible blindness central nervous system depression seizure coma and death figure 2fig 2 these effects are noted to be more severe in abhs bonner 201715 choi et al 201722 chan and chan 201820 the continuous use or overuse of hand sanitizers can cause chronic irritation and severe skin breakdown among other effects qiao and guo 199271 especially in children a study that reported the incidences of poisoning associated with abhs between 2011 and 2014 indicated that children below 12 years had incidences of over 70000 exposures to hand sanitizers of which 92  are due to abhs with only 8  nabhs exposure bonner 201715furthermore the continuous topical application of ethanol on the skin was reported to lower skin barrier functions thereby rending the membrane highly susceptible to harmful chemicals in soaps and cosmetics lachenmeier 200851 moreso percutaneous toxicity could also occur in children with lacerated skin lachenmeier 200851 in fact the potential for abuse of abhs has raised more concern now than before although abhs seem easier to use and proved higher efficiency than some detergent-based sanitizers the repeated exposure of users to the abhs calls for caution perez et al 201969triclosan tcs 2 4 4-trichloro-2-hydroxydiphenyl ether is a universal antimicrobial agent that has found its way into many pharmaceuticals and personal care products as well as in the promotion of growth in animal including aquatic species daughton and ternes 199926 it is used as antibacterial agent in many consumers and household products such as medicated soaps hand sanitizers deodorants toothpastes air fresheners and other cosmetic products sethuraman et al 201480 it is currently being considered as an emerging contaminant wang et al 201893triclosan with its related compound triclocarban figure 1fig 1 used in consumers products such as liquid soaps and hand sanitizers previous mentioned is of paramount concerns to scientists due to its long persistency in the environment fda 201627 usgs 201692 its ability to cause disruption of the endocrine hormone system is still being evaluated and already recommended to be avoided bonner 201715 stoker et al 201084 it was classed as a pesticide in the national pesticide information retrieval system npirs triclosan 202067 of the united states previously hexachlorophene an organochlorine compound known as nabac figure 1fig 1 with structural similarity to triclosan had been banned as disinfectant by the fda following health concerns due to the allegedly associated teratogenicity iarc 199844 halden 201439 tcs together with bisphenol a were reported to possess potential to weaken the immune system clayton et al 201123 tcs is reported to cause oxidative stress and induce genotoxicity in goldfish suggesting a potential ecotoxicological risk to aquatic ecosystems stasinakis et al 200883 halden 201439 silva et al 201581 tcs has been reported as persistent organic pollutants that are retained for months or years in water bodies lygina et al 201358antibiotics abuse overuse and misuse of soaps and hand sanitizers is often responsible for effects such as antibiotics resistance and endocrine disruption atolani et al 20167 lu et al 201855 tcs a typical antibiotic is commonly used in many soap preparations and some hand sanitizers are known to produce high anti-microbial efficiency however many studies have implicated it as a source of induction of antibiotic resistant microorganisms as the use of only 02 mgl tcs for only 30 days can cause multi-drug resistance to escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus of which similar effects were not reported for chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide-based agents westgate et al 201694the use of alcohol in abhs is equally not absolutely safe as it can easily be absorbed through the skin reports indicated that blood concentration of ethanol could reach 23  within 90 minutes of use of abhs kramer et al 200748 in the study ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations were as high as 17 and 195 mgl respectively ethanol is often converted to acetaldehyde which is also absorbed into the blood stream thompson et al 200588 npirs ethanol 202067 the metabolic products are often more toxic in the human system high concentration of ethanol in human blood ingested via consumption of alcoholic beverages is known to cause both short-term and long-term toxicity such as inebriation and liver cirrhosis hence the use of abhs could invariably lead to increased concentration of alcohol in human blood kramer et al 200748 there are increasing incidences of intentional ingestion of ethanol-containing hand sanitizers especially by alcohol addicts gormley et al 201237 since children are attracted to the scent bright coloration and the attractive packaging of abhs they are generally more at risk rayar and ratnapalan 201374 within 2011 - 2016 us poison control centers reported over 100000 calls with regards to children exposure to hand sanitizer georgia poison center 201534 cdc 202018the intoxication by the ingestion of hand sanitizers is a major overlooked risk seeking urgent attention globally jones et al 201345 raza et al 201475 moore 201963 high degree of morbidity and mortality are risks associated with the use of abhs santos et al 201779 therefore following the proliferation in the production of abhs due to the covid-19 pandemic there is an obvious need for global caution and conscientiousness in the acquisition and utilization of hand sanitizersit was reported that most germs or microbial pathogens cannot survive adequate washing with liquid soaps the structure of most pathogenic bacterial and virus is less resistant to the potency of the alkalinity the corrosive nature and membrane-shattering ability of most liquid soaps while the proper washing with the liquid soaps kills the pathogens up to 999  the rinsing with clean water helps to eliminate the dead organisms from hands most liquid soaps are water-based hence this naturally reduces the skin penetrating effect of some of the components compared to abhs most hand-sanitizers usually organic-based are also known to kill pathogen up to 999  when effectively rubbed on the hand but the absorption potential through human skin to some vital organs such as the kidney and liver could result to toxicities such as nephrotoxicity cirrhosis among others kramer et al 200748 choi et al 201722 chan and chan 201820 since hh is of paramount importance to the prevention of the spread of virus and other germs the use of safe hand rub soap or sanitizers is imperative due to associated toxicities and side effects some hand rubs soaps and sanitizers contain some chemical compounds which may only be most appropriate for use on non-skin surfaces such as the surfaces of furniture door handles walls phones glass toilet zincs metal tools vehicles exteriors electronic gadgets hospital equipment among others and not on human skin in order to underscore the relevance of alcohol in disinfection of non-skin objects a study reported that a single cleaning with an alcohol wipe proved higher potency than the alcohol-based hand rub in decontamination of stethoscopes used in hospitals mehta et al 201061 other studies also showed that use of hand sanitizers used outside hospital environment do not show superior benefit to soap oughton et al 200968 cdc 202019 hence washing with soap and warm water with good hh may adequately suffice for homes and as well eliminate exposure to hazardous chemicals and consecutive release to the environment wolf et al 201899 the cdc and some other reports indicated that besides preserving good environmental flora washing with soap and water produces better or equivalent results compared to abhs sanitizers at removing or killing certain types of virus such as the noroviruses and other germs grayson et al 200938 blaney et al 201111 bondurant et al 201913 cdc 202018hand sanitizers usually end-up being deposited in high concentrations of the constituting chemical residues contaminants in the environmental soil and water bodies high concentration of these chemicals released in the environment could trigger multi-drug resistance westgate et al 201694 antimicrobial resistance is obviously a major public health concern globally the world health organization who reported that about 700000 people died due to antimicrobial-resistant infections every year who 201996 it is further predicted that the death due to antimicrobial-resistant infections could reach 10 million annually by 2050 if no concrete action is taken now who 201996experiment has revealed that washing with ordinary soap solution is effective at killing and eliminating the virus and other germs in the hand the fatty outer surface of the virus is denatured by the soap molecule and that process leads to the destruction of the virus which is washed away by water it is worth mentioning that hand washing with soap solution and rinsing with water preferably warm water will kill and eliminate the germs from the surface using of abhs will kill the organism without eliminating them from the surface the use of soap and water must be a preferred choice when the hand is visibly or grossly contaminated abhs also do not remove pesticide from the hand cdc 202018 the use of abhs in such instances could make the hand so messy and unpleasant in fact the food and drug administration fda of the united states already banned the use of triclosan in antibacterial soaps iarc 199844 halden 201439recent advances in the cosmetic industry have led to the production of safe hand sanitizers obtained via green process this involved the incorporation of safe natural antiseptic agents into soaps hand rubs or nabhs in place of the synthetic ones that are associated with multiple side effects natural products such as plant extracts exudates purified isolates and essential oils have been proposed as germ-killers in hand sanitizers soaps and other cosmetics and body care products ningsih et al 201766 hartatik 201440 lateh 201552 surini et al 201886 zubair et al 2018103104 atolani et al 201965 20204 natural products such as coconut oil have been used to produce hand sanitizers with enhanced cosmetic properties tran et al 201990 such green alternative will preserve the natural environment and the skin of people atolani et al 20167following the multiple side-effects associated with the use of abhs and some liquid soaps due to the unsafe active agents in them the following recommendations have become inevitablemanufacturers and health care providers should advocate the potential dangers associated with abuse overuse and misuse of abhs and antibacterial active soapsthe habitual use of abhs must be deliberately avoided as much as it is possible its use should be occasional when other options such as soap and warm water are not available this would impact safety of both users and the environmentusers should only purchase small amount of abhs at a time to avoid overt addiction and abuse due to the surplusthe use of hand sanitizer should be limited to only the finger and wrist region as absorption via the arm and other body parts could be increased thereby raising blood alcohol concentration within a short timewhen the use of abhs is unavoidable users should ensure use of low concentration alcohol at an average of 60-70  as higher concentrations could be more deleteriousthe abhs should be kept far away from heat flame spark-source or any oxidizing agents to avoid fire incidence since they are flammablechildren should not be allowed direct access to abhs as the fatality of accidental ingestion in children is worse and incidences are on the risein case of liquid soaps soaps with triclosan or triclocarban and other questionable safety profile should be avoidedthere should be incorporation of skin protecting emollient in abhs and liquid soap in order to prevent after-use skin dryness skin breakingcracking as well as reduce alcohol penetration through the skingeneral cleanliness and good hygiene is imperative to keep microbial infections at bay consistent tidiness will minimize the need for repetitive use of liquid soaps and abhsthe enormous release of adulterated and uncontrolled infection-preventing household products such as the antibacterial active liquid soap and abhs in the global markets have several potential adverse health effects on human such as dehydrated skin irritation poisoning and cancer among others thus the careful adoption of hand washing with selected safe liquid soap should be encouraged by all improvement in hand hygiene is akin to the containment of the spread of germs including the ravaging viral infection covid-19 however when the use of hand sanitizer is inevitable consumers should be cautious of the chemical constituents as well as the concentration of each constituent these measures are important to the prevention of avoidable implications such as unintentional or deliberate ingestion or chemical absorption through the skin which could lead to incidences such as irreversible blindness depression intoxication liver cirrhosis acidosis headache central nervous system depression seizure hypoglycemia coma and death while preventing infections such as the covid-19 and other microbial-induced infections slow and systematic death should be meticulously avoided otherwise the prevention mode could lead to higher fatality than the

ilorin ilorin nigeriathe emergence of the covid-19 coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic has risen to be a significant global public health concern and led to extensive use of hand disinfectants given its contagious nature there was a total of 38 million reported cases affecting over 200 countries worldwide as of 7 may 2020 12 covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which can persist and remain infectious on surfaces for up to 9 days 34 the recent study reveals that transmission of sars-cov-2 is possible in the form of aerosol and fomite and the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days depending on the inoculum shed 5 hence it is crucial to interrupt the transmission chain of the virus through contact isolation and strict infection control tools 6 following face masks appropriate hand hygiene is of utmost importance as hands may be contaminated from direct contact with patients respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes or indirect contact via surfaces which may then facilitate the transmission and spreading of the disease 789 the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak was caused by a novel human coronavirus cov sars-cov that could survive on surfaces for 24 to 72 h 10 the studies on sars-cov outbreak settings showed that providing efficient handwashing facilities reduced transmission 11given the dangers imposed by this disease the centre for disease control and prevention cdc the united states has promoted and encouraged hand hygiene through handwashing or use of hand sanitizer 12 hand disinfectants are commercially available in various types and forms such as anti-microbial soaps water-based or alcohol-based hand sanitizers most often used in hospital settings different types of delivery systems are also formulatedfor instance rubs foams or wipes figure 1 the world health organisation who recommends alcohol-based hand sanitizer abhs in line with the proven advantages of their rapid action and a broad spectrum of microbicidal activity offering protection against bacteria and viruses however the effectiveness against non-enveloped viruses is still debatable and questionable 7131415161718to date most effective hand sanitizer products are alcohol-based formulations containing 6295 of alcohol as it is capable of denaturing the proteins of microbes and inactivating viruses 1920 there are a few challenges and concerns with regard to this formulation in terms of fire hazards and skin toxicity due to high alcohol content 21 this systemic review aims to investigate the range of available hand sanitizers and their effectiveness against the human coronavirus as well as the formulation aspects adverse effects and recommendations to improve the formulation of current hand sanitizersthis study was conducted according to the prisma recommendations 22 we systematically reviewed the available literature in pubmed and google scholar up to 2020 the search terms we used are hand sanitizers and alcohol and treatment and handwashing and virucide and bactericide and cure or failure or mortality a manual search was also performed we set no year limit and english is the only language we limit the study selection based on effective treatment resulted in a potential eradication of pathogens the data extracted from each study comprised the main characteristics of the study such as the first authors name year study design and country out of many reports we selected articles based on the hand disinfectant agents and their potential outcome suitable for the present viral pandemic data were extracted by two authors based on the screening of the titles and abstracts obtained from the pubmed and google scholar database the other authors have checked the materials to fulfil the criteria for the workhand sanitizer can generally be categorized into two groups alcohol-based or alcohol-free figure 2 an abhs may contain one or more types of alcohol with or without other excipients and humectants to be applied on the hands to destroy microbes and temporarily suppress their growth 23 abhs can effectively and quickly reduce microbes covering a broad germicidal spectrum without the need for water or drying with towels nevertheless there are a few shortcomings with the effectiveness of abhs such as its short-lived antimicrobial effect and weak activity against protozoa some non-enveloped non-lipophilic viruses and bacterial spores 23on the other hand the alcohol-free sanitizer makes use of chemicals with antiseptic properties to exert the antimicrobial effects these chemicals have a different mode of action and function according to their chemical functional groups table 1 242526 as they are non-flammable and often used at low concentrations they are relatively safer to use among children as compared to abhsabhs is available in different dosage forms namely gel liquid and foam as each type has its own characteristics a study was conducted to understand the impact on sensory attributes that may affect users acceptance of the product and ultimately influence usage leading to hand hygiene compliance 272829 the overall result showed that gels and foams are more widely accepted compared to liquid especially in terms of handleability though the latter left a high clean feeling and took a shorter time to dry 30united states food and drug administration usfda has given the list of eligible antiseptic agents used in the non-prescription also known as over-the-counter or otc and listed in table 2 this list is highly useful in selecting appropriate antiseptic active ingredients intended for use by health care professionals in a hospital setting or other health care situations outside the hospital 31 recently the united states pharmacopeia usp compounding expert committee cmp ec recommends the three formulations for compounding alcohol-based hand sanitizers for use during shortages associated with the covid-19 pandemic and listed in table 3 32abhs in the form of a spray which trigger stream aerosol solution allows direct contact of the alcohol solution with the target surface however there are several limitations associated with the sprays including overspray breathed by patients and flammability ready-to-use alcohol hand sanitizing wipes hsw is a pre-wetted towelette containing disinfectants antiseptics surfactants etc in a sealed package ready for use in topical disinfection the advantage of hsw is eliminating the possible contaminations and transfer of pathogen due to towelettes reuse however the longer storage time could increase the probability of losing antimicrobialviricidal activity due to the possible binding of active ingredients onto the towelettes or by the degradation of the active ingredient 33 keeping hands clean is a fundamental and essential step to avoid getting sick while limiting the transmission of germs to others cdc recommends handwashing with soap and water whenever possible as it remarkably reduces the amount of all types of microbes and dirt on the skin surface 1534 both the soaps and alcohol-based sanitizers work by dissolving the lipid membranes of microbes thereby inactivating them figure 3 thus the sanitizer serves as an alternative when the soap and water are not readily available the suggested minimum alcohol content of 60 is needed for it to exert the microbicidal effect as compared to soap alcohol-based sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs including norovirus and clostridium difficile the common pathogens that can cause diarrhoea 3536 while most people prefer to use sanitizers as they come in handy and assume that the sanitizers may not be as effective as the soap at killing germs this is because people may not use a sufficient amount of sanitizers to clean the hands 3738 the liquid may evaporate before it is evenly rubbed all over the hands therefore compromising the efficacy of the sanitizers 3739 also the sanitizer may not work well when the hands are grossly dirty or contaminated with harmful chemicals 40although hand sanitizers may be less effective than soaps in some situations it is undeniable that they are the preferred form of hand hygiene in healthcare settings the use of alcohol-based sanitizer may improve the compliance of healthcare workers to hand hygiene practices as they are easily accessible and take less time to use around 253 ml of liquid equivalent to two pumps from a dispenser is deposited on the palm and rubbed all over the surfaces of both hands for 2530 s to maximize the efficacy of the sanitizer 41similar to alcohol chlorhexidine works by disrupting the arrangement of cytoplasmic membranes thereby leading to precipitation of cell contents 44 it is most effective against gram-positive bacteria and has modest activity against a gram-negative bacteria as well as enveloped viruses 4445 as chlorhexidine is cationic it is advisable to avoid using chlorhexidine-containing products with natural soaps and hand creams that contain anionic emulsifying agents as they may cause inactivation or precipitation of chlorhexidine thus reducing its efficacy 444546 chlorhexidine gluconate 012 is likely to have antiviral activity against the coronavirus as it does against other enveloped viruses 47chloroxylenol is a common agent as a preservative in cosmetics or as an antimicrobial agent in soap the antimicrobial effect of chloroxylenol is attributable to its ability to deactivate enzyme systems and alter cell wall synthesis in microbes it is good at killing bacteria and enveloped viruses but less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa 4849iodine was once an effective antiseptic used for skin disinfection it can penetrate the microbial cell wall and form complexes with amino acids or unsaturated fatty acids to impair the synthesis of cellular components nonetheless due to its potential to cause skin irritation and discoloration iodophors have come into play to replace iodine as the active ingredient in antiseptics the fda has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or high-level disinfectants with iodophors as the main active ingredient 50iodophors are a combination of either iodine iodide or triiodide and a high molecular weight polymer carrier such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone this carrier is responsible for improving the solubility of iodine enhancing the sustained release of iodine and minimizing skin irritation 51 the degree of antimicrobial activity determined based on the amount of free iodine present in the structure having said so formulations with lower iodophor concentration may have significant antimicrobial activity as well because the amount of free iodine tends to increase after dilution 52both iodine and iodophors exhibit germicidal activity against a gram-positive gram-negative and spore-forming bacteria as well as various fungi and viruses 535455 however the concentration of iodophors used in antiseptics eg povidone-iodine 510 is usually insufficient to achieve sporicidal action furthermore the nasal povidone-iodine formulation has shown acceptable tolerability and favorable riskbenefit profile to help mitigate the perioperative spread of covid-19 in patient decolonization 56quaternary ammonium compounds are composed of four alkyl groups connected to a nitrogen atom in the centre the typical examples include benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride and cetyl peridium chloride they act by adsorbing to the cytoplasmic membrane thus causing leakage of the constituents they are more active against gram-positive bacteria and lipophilic viruses the activity against fungi mycobacteria and gram-negative bacilli is comparatively weak 15at low concentration triclosan is bacteriostatic due to its harmful effects to bacterial enzymes responsible for the composition of fatty acid from cells wall and membranes at high concentrations triclosan disrupts the bacteria membrane leading it to death 85758 it has good activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus candida spp and mycobacteria the efficacy of triclosan may be affected by ph use of emollients and the ionic nature of certain skin formulations 58a lot of sanitizers also include humectant for instance glycerine in the formulation to reduce the incidence of dry skin associated with the use of alcohol-based products as the alcohol can strip away sebum that helps to keep the skin moist though fragrance and colorant added to improve the aesthetics it is generally not recommended to do so due to the risk of allergic reactions 4143the skin is composed of three main layers a superficial epidermis 50100 m a middle dermis 2 mm and an innermost hypodermis 12 mm it constitutes the first line of defence against invading microorganisms while providing protection against mechanical impacts and preventing excessive loss of water from the bodythe vital barrier function of the skin resides primarily in the uppermost epidermal layer the stratum corneum sc the sc contains layers of corneocytes that are terminally differentiated from keratinocytes that make up the basal layer of epidermis 1559 the adjacent corneocytes are interconnected by membrane junctions called corneodesmosomes to enhance the cohesion of the sc 60 the lipids that are derived from the exocytosis of lamellar bodies during terminal differentiation of keratinocytes will fill up the intercellular spaces between the corneocytes and they play a role in maintaining the cutaneous barrier function 61 the layer underneath the sc is known as the keratinized stratified epidermis it consists of melanocytes that produce melanin a skin pigment that provides skin with its color and protects the skin from ultraviolet radiation apart from that langerhans cells which are involved in the immune response and merkel cells that are responsible for light touch sensation can also be found within this layer 6263though the skin serves as a barrier that protects one against harmful microorganisms it hosts a wide array of beneficial bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermis staphylococcus aureus micrococcus spp propionibacterium spp and corynebacterium spp 6465 these bacteria may help to prevent the colonization of pathogenic microbes by either competing with them for nutrients or stimulating the skins defence system under normal circumstances they exhibit low pathogenicity however when the skin flora distribution is disrupted for example due to the long-term use of topical antibiotics or frequent hand washing they may become virulent 6667 to reduce the incidence of infection the microbiota balance is restored and maintained through constant skin regeneration the whole process takes about 28 days starting from the mitotic division of basal epithelium to desquamation when the dead keratinocytes in the sc are sloughed off it takes away the microbes that colonized the skin surface this continuous process significantly limits the invasion of bacteria while achieving a balanced growth among the microbial populationsthe virus sars-cov-2 is termed due to of its genome sequence similarity to sars coronavirus sars-cov 6869 the covs belong to the same genus beta coronavirus sharing similar morphology in the form of enveloped positive single-stranded rna viruses 7071 these viruses can be deactivated by certain lipid solvents such as ethanol ether 75 chlorine-containing disinfectants and chloroform except chlorhexidine 70 ethyl alcohol at concentrations of 6080 is a potent viricidal agent inactivating all the lipophilic viruses eg influenza herpes and vaccinia virus and many hydrophilic viruses eg adenovirus enterovirus rhinovirus and rotaviruses but not hepatitis a virus hav or poliovirus 32the 2015 who model list of essential recommended ethanol at 80 vv and isopropyl alcohol at 75 vv under the category disinfectant alcohol-based hand rub 72 ethanol 6085 appears to be the most effective against viruses compared to isopropanol 6080 and n-propanol 6080 23 the study conducted with who-recommended alcohol-based formulations demonstrated a strong virucidal effect against emerging pathogens including zikv ebov sars-cov and mers-cov 73 another study conducted in germany found that the ethanol in the concentration of 426 ww was able to destroy sars coronavirus and mers coronavirus within 30 s 74 the efficacy of various alcohol-based sanitizers at different concentrations was also investigated in several studies as shown in table 5the most commonly reported skin reactions with the use of abhs are irritant contact dermatitis icd and allergic contact dermatitis acd 7677 the symptoms of icd can range from mild to debilitating with manifestations like dryness pruritus erythema and bleeding if severe as for acd the symptoms can either be mild and localized or severe and generalized with most severe forms of acd being manifested as respiratory distress or other anaphylactic symptoms 7879 sometimes it may be difficult to distinguish between icd and acd due to the overlap and similarities of symptomshand hygiene products such as sanitizer and soaps can be damaging to the skin through several mechanisms denaturation of the stratum corneum proteins alteration of intercellular lipids decrease in corneocyte cohesion and reduction of stratum corneum water-binding capacity 8081 the biggest concern is the depletion of the lipid barrier especially with repeated exposure to lipid-emulsifying detergents and lipid-dissolving alcohols as it may penetrate deeper into the skin layers and change the skin flora resulting in more frequent colonization by bacteria 828384 in order of decreasing frequency of icd including handwashing soaps are iodophors chlorhexidine chloroxylenol triclosan and alcohol-based products among the alcohol-based formulations ethanol has the least skin-irritant property compared to n-propanol and isopropanol 21 there are however other contributing factors that increase the risk of icds such as lack of use of supplementary emollients friction due to wearing and removal of gloves and low relative humidity 858687 abhs also has a drying effect on hands which can further cause the skin to crack or peel 888990on the other hand acd is caused by allergic reactions towards certain agents in the formulations such as iodophors chlorhexidine triclosan chloroxylenol and alcohols 91 individuals with allergic reactions to alcohol-based preparations may have true allergy to alcohol or allergy to impurity aldehyde metabolite or other excipients like fragrances benzyl alcohol parabens or benzalkonium chloride 299293the adverse effects caused by sanitizer or handwashing soaps can be easily prevented by identifying the trigger and countered with appropriate measures using one or a combination of following methods selecting products with a less irritating agent moisturizing skin after hand sanitation and avoiding habits that may cause or aggravate skin irritation 29419394when frequent hand cleansing is expected for instance among healthcare workers it is preferable to select products that have a good balance between effectiveness safety and compatibility with all skin types the concerns about drying and irritant effects of alcohol or certain antiseptic soaps may hinder the acceptance and ultimate use of these preparations 52 hence to reduce this problem abhs containing humectants or emollients can be used instead 95 in recent years novel water-based antiseptic lotions are also being studied such as that using benzethonium chloride which not only addresses the issue regarding cutaneous adverse effects but also broadens the efficacy against viruses and tackles concerns about flammability associated with conventional abhs 76temperature and humidity are considered as significant contributors to the risk factors of dermatitis the retention of skin moisture is longer in tropical countries and places with higher relative humidity compared to cold dry environments 96 this aspect calls for a varying need of emollients concerning respective environmental conditions and climates according to geographical locations some individuals such as the elderly and healthcare workers who often wear occlusive gloves are more prone to dry skin therefore it is a good practice for these high-risk individuals to use moisturizers containing humectants fats or oils to enhance skin moisture and improve skin barrier function 96proper hand hygiene by washing hands or using alcohol-based sanitizer is one of the most critical measures to prevent direct or indirect transmission of the covid-19 as it reduces the number of the viable sars-cov-2 virus on contaminated hands there are five instances that call for hand hygiene before and after having direct contact with patients before handling invasive devices for patient care after exposure to body fluids or excretions after contact with objects including medical appliances within proximity of the patient and before starting any aseptic task 96the cdc recommends washing hands with soap and water whenever possible because handwashing reduces the amounts of all types of germs and chemicals on hands 97 if soap and water are not available using a hand sanitizer with a final concentration of at least 60 ethanol or 70 isopropyl alcohol inactivates viruses that are genetically related to and with similar physical properties as the covid-19the action of handwashing can mechanically remove the microorganisms but the removal of resident pathogens is more effective when hands are washed with preparations containing anti-microbial agents 96 according to the policies and procedures on cdc who and the infection control by ministry of health malaysia the recommended duration for the entire handwash procedure spans between 40 to 60 s using the standard 7-step techniquecomparatively sanitizer containing at least 60 alcohol is more effective in destroying the microorganisms than handwashing with anti-microbial soaps due to their ability to inactivate and destroy the microbes 96 however it should be noted that the abhs may not be as effective if the hands are visibly soiled dirty or greasy so handwashing with soap and water is preferred under these circumstances the duration to rub sanitizer all over the hand surfaces is approximately 20 to 30 s 96proper hand hygiene is one of the essential infection control strategies as it can undeniably lower the likelihood of direct or indirect transmissions of microorganisms the use of abhs is becoming more common because of their rapid action and efficiency in killing microorganisms mainly when handwashing using soap and water is not practical or convenient there are however some situations in which handwashing is preferred as abhs are less effective when the hands are visibly dirty or stained and cannot cover certain kinds of pathogens it is vital to select abhs with the appropriate amount of alcohol and practice the correct hand hygiene technique when cleaning hands to ensure all the microorganisms are effectively killedthe covid-19 outbreak is straining hospital and general response resources in many countries one supply issue that has attracted global attention is personal protective equipment ppe in particular filtering facepiece respirators ffrs the desirable n95 type or otherwise widely used face masks which are suitable for airborne pathogens filtration and used by millions of healthcare professionals and public responders n95 type masks are made by various manufacturers under different trade names the term niosh n95 relates to a filter efficiency rating that means the mask materials block about 95 of particles that are 03 m in size or largerppe options and mask availability will likely remain challenging given the ongoing divergence in the medical and public responses as well as the apparent different strategies and local availability between the g20 countries and the rest of the world often with fewer resources this means additional alternative perhaps only temporary solutions must be established for the reuse refreshing or extended wear of face masks this could reduce competition for newly manufactured masks and ppe and also allow resource optimization for countries with limited access to primary supplies for the use and reuse of masks we expect continuing differences between large scale institutional approaches strategies ideally suitable for hospital environments and methods that can be quickly applied locally by non-experts with limited resources for example the wide use by the general public of improvised homemade face masks one of these options is thermal sterilization based on multiple reports of the successful deactivation of viral material in the 7075 c regimes with less than 30 min exposure but with relative humidity perhaps also being a beneficial factor 1 however the survivability and reliability of multiple face mask types and their ongoing filtration effectiveness under thermal conditioning is less well known in this study and discussion we wish to address a few simple questions and provide guidance to the community dealing with mask and ppe availability for the covid-19 response which touches on underlying material science aspects 2from a materials point of view are there obvious shortcomings with the thermal conditioning of face masksis there sufficient material robustness as demonstrated by masks to withstand moderate over-temperatures and extended exposure times ie beyond rapid 30 min exposures at 75 c
as well aswhat is the retention behavior of simple spray-on disinfectant solutions and their active compounds on surfacescould simple spray-on solutions containing disinfectants of low toxicity aid mask reuse and also enhance the currently improvised face masks
following the h1n1 h5n1 and sars-cov-1 epidemics there were a number of journal publications and reports investigating disinfectionsterilization methods and retention of viral matter for ffrs 3 4 5 these studies acknowledged that in a pandemic the current manufacturing capacity and vast ffr stockpiles 89 million per month in the usa would need to be supplemented by reuse of ffrs indeed the current 2020 shortage of ffrs in many countries has precedence in the spot shortages experienced during the 20092010 influenza outbreak 6 the pre-covid-19 research and the recent 2020 research into ffr reuse offers a number of strategies for disinfection each with their own advantages and disadvantagesthe similarities in chemical and physical stability of the sars-cov-2 virus to other viruses allows the assumption that methods used in the study of ffr decontamination of h1n1 h5n1 or sars-cov-1 can be used successfully towards sars-cov-2 7 this reasoning is validated by the first emerging investigations of sars-cov-2 stability which tentatively show it can be eliminated with the usual disinfectants uv-c irradiation or elevated temperatures 8 9 10 11 it should be noted that the substrate also may play an important role chin et al showed that after two days no infectious sars-cov-2 was detectable on fabric but on a surgical mask significant levels were detected after 7 days 10 given the preliminary nature of these studies there is still far more investigation and validation required including investigation of all decontamination methods to meet the resources available to the disparate users of ffrshigh energy irradiation has a long history as a method for sterilizing medical devices energetic photons are known to cause degradation of nucleic acids hence is effective in inactivating pathogens gamma-irradiation of ffrs to 10 kgy 1 mrad has been shown to have little effect on the fit of the masks evaluated using the saccharin apparatus fit test however the filtration of 03 m particles was compromised 12 gamma-radiation is also known to cause degradation of polyolefins usually in the 50 kgy range with dependence on dose rate subject to an oxidative sensitivity 13 14 15 16 uniquely for masks here radiation-induced charge carrier formation affecting the electret filter layers 17 could be a contributing variable resulting in the reduction of the ffr filter performance access to gamma-radiation sources capable of reaching kgy doses is also not widespread so taken together irradiation may not be the most convenient choice for large scale ffr decontaminationultraviolet uv-radiation in the uv-c region of the electromagnetic spectrum is another form of ionizing radiation and has a long history of use in sterilizing surfaces unlike gamma-radiation it is readily available in most hospital and laboratory settings a number of studies have highlighted the potential of uv sterilization from common 254 nm lamp sources 18 19 20 including use of laboratory bio-safety cabinets 11 and a high throughput process including steps for tracking ffrs 21 however there could be line-of-sight penetration aspects for deeper disinfection uvc is much less penetrating than gamma and potential surface degradation issues as polymers are relatively sensitive to uv-c similar to gamma doseshydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidant and is effective as a disinfectant either as a gas plasma vapor or solution for ffrs hydrogen peroxide vapor hpv use is well-documented for not affecting fit or filter performance 1922 and is promising for high throughput disinfection it is one technique that has been tested on ffrs inoculated with sars-cov-2 and shown to be effective although the results are only preliminary 23 it is currently being used in some parts of the us to disinfect large batches of ffrs for re-deployment to users 24 with detailed descriptions as to how to implement hpv use 25 hydrogen peroxide gas plasma however has been shown to affect filter performance relative to a standard sodium chloride particle penetration assay although no mechanism was proposed 19ethylene oxide eo gas is widely used in the medical device and food industries as a sterilization method and suitable for large scale operations the gas itself is toxic and explosive so care is needed when handling it and absence of residual gas must be confirmed after treatment 23 furthermore a study into residual chemicals on ffrs after eo treatment showed the presence of toxic reaction products believed to be originating from reaction of the rubber straps 26 other less conventional methods for decontamination include a novel oxidant mixture dimethyldioxirane 26 high energy plasma generating electrodes as part of a mask 27 and masks impregnated with copper oxide 28 these strategies may be useful in the future but as yet they are unproven approachesthe use of heat to decontaminate ffrs is an approach that requires minimal resources since ovens are usually easily available microwave heating is the exception however as it is known to cause deformation of ffrs perhaps due to more uneven local heating 18 previous work with h1n1 and h5n1 have shown that 70 c at 85 humidity for 30 min 429 is sufficient to inactive the viruses on ffrs 30chemical-based sterilization is easily achieved by alcohol contact ethanol or isopropanol or the more classic anti-viral and anti-bacterial compounds than can be commonly found in many commercial products it is important to distinguish between the momentary disinfection offered by alcohol contact and evaporation and longer lasting effects that can be provided by less volatile active compounds remaining on surfaces hand sanitizer usually has only isopropanol or ethanol as the active compound whereas a disinfectant spray usually has a low amount of an additional active constituent anti-viral properties are given by compounds such as benzalkonium chloride 10 chlorhexidine gluconate 31 or ionic substances such as citric acid or perhaps even edta and likely also some anionic or nonionic surfactants that in essence have the ability to disrupt the viral envelope 32 there is usually little distinction between their activity on enveloped sars-cov-2 causing covid-19 or non-enveloped viruses for example the bacteriophage ms2 simulant except some comments have been made that ms2 might be more stable than the sars-cov-2 interestingly citric acid based buffer solution containing nasal sprays were quoted to reduce the titer of an influenza a sydney597 h3n2 influenza strain by up to 3 logs after 1 min contact time 3233 similarly some oils such as tea tree oil or oil of thyme are associated with good anti-viral properties 34 for any use on masks and on surfaces that are easily touched it is of course important to use disinfectants that are low in toxicity and are ideally found in existing daily use items benzalkonium chloride is a common anti-microbial substance still on the fda list for hand sanitizers 35 and also used in commercial disinfectant sprays and citric acid or tea tree oil are part of consumer productsthis brings up again the idea that masks could perhaps be simply sterilized by soaking in alcohol or combined solutions alcohol plus secondary active constituent however there is evidence that some of the commercial n95 masks suffer in their filtration efficiency when soaked with alcohol or ipa based disinfectant solutions or similarly even under higher temperature steam environments 36 this is due to their complex construction in terms of a hydrophobic or electrostatic layer that is relatively easily compromised in the presence of steam and concentrated alcohol solutions however we could also speculate that masks could perhaps be just surface sterilized with a carefully applied thin deposit of an active ingredient left behind from an alcohol solution basically a top surface treatment rather than a deeper soaking such an approach could be seen as the most basic momentary refreshing of a mask for extended wear or shorter term reuse if conditions require such action in principle no different than often using hand sanitizer of course any disinfection will likely be limited to the immediate surface and not necessarily kill viral material trapped deeply within the filtration layers further there would need to be cross-checks whether suitable filtration efficiency is in fact maintained and whether a treated surface has indeed the expected additional anti-viral property we speculate that this will be less of a concern for simple cotton or fabric-based masks that are now often seen with the do it yourself approaches for these and similar more forgiving surfaces the thoughtful application of ipa based spray-on solutions containing some longer lasting anti-viral compounds may be one avenue to increase the beneficial nature of such face masks active ingredients should be selected based on proven low toxicity or compounds already in use with human contact ie established anti-viralsany approach towards refreshingsterilizing face masks or improving custom-made cloth masks with the application of small amounts of a spray-on solution offering added disinfectant properties also requires us to consider how long active compounds may persist on the mask surface contact infrared atr attenuated total reflection spectroscopy is an excellent method to probe how quickly thin layers in the micrometer range may disappear or could be retained the exact anti-viral efficacy of specific compounds should be corroborated based on existing literature data by additional bio-assays or further established by our bio-medical and virology colleagues and is outside the scope of our current study instead we wish to demonstrate how low amounts of active ingredients may display unexpected volatility or tend to stay on surfaces for extended time at rt and 37 c this is an essential foundation to further consider the use of dilute alcohol based spray-on disinfectants not only as the simplest method for quick mask surface sterilization but also applicable to other ppe surfaces or shared equipment key-boards computer mice or similarany existing sterilization and reuse methods or alternatives currently under consideration for masks filtering facepiece respirators will need to be assessed on their own specific merits with sterilization efficiency filtration function and overall performance mechanical properties and fitting to be evaluated in parallel this study wishes to provide further guidance for thermal disinfection approaches of mostly n95 masks disinfection via the application of dilute spray-on solutions and the retention of disinfectants on surfacessubject to a limited supply of face masks a preliminary screening study consisting of a set of multiple masks was sequentially aged in slightly vented dry circulated air laboratory ovens for 24 h at 65 c followed by 24 h at 80 c and 24 h at 95 c all masks remained in excellent condition after 24 h at 65 c yet with some evidence for onset of material weaknesses during the final step of 95 c exposure it became clear that higher temperatures or extended times would certainly be pushing mask reliability into an unfavorable regime one fresh set of masks was then aged for 24 h at 80 c ie slightly above the target sterilization temperature range of 7075 c and another set for validation of additional robustness for 24 h at 95 c these two sets were then inspected for signs of visual degradation while the elastic bands were tested in tensile mode by stretching a specific length 75 mm by 100 doubling of its lengthit is important to point out that the aging conditions here involved low relative humidity simply generated by heating of ambient air in the ovens there is evidence that humidity will aid virus deactivation on stainless steel at elevated temperatures up to 65 c 37 however in the current study the optimal thermal and relative humidity conditions for viral kill efficiency were outside the scope our focus is rather on the materials aging behavior for which thermal oxidation and perhaps shrinkage or other immediate deformation could be important additional relative humidity is not expected to negatively affect polyolefins and related materials because they take up very little water and are not hydrolytically sensitive but the mask filtration efficiency and charge carrier capability can be impacted by humidity 3638 the most suitable thermal exposure conditions should be derived based on balancing the primary viral disinfection needs with material thermal aging aspects mask filtration performance and fitting behavior after exposure and the availability of dry heat commercial climate controlled incubation chambers or perhaps relative humidity controlled sealed ovens by added salt solutions deliquescence 3940 from a materials aging point of view in particular here for polyolefins exposure conditions of no more than a day in the temperature range of 7595 c are not expected to result in significant oxidation even if inexpensive and weakly stabilized commercial materials are involved 4142 further aside from an immediate response such as shrinkage or warping some copolymers have lower softening points thermal aging of polymers is often also of cumulative nature meaning a total exposure condition can be composed of multiple successive exposure intervals 4344 this means if a material can easily handle one day at 80 or 95 c then one would expect a few repeated 1 h exposures at such temperatures to be no worse in terms of overall materials performance 4344 the point is thermal testing for a day gives confidence of material robustness and that several repetitive short sterilization steps ought to be achievablewe obtained face masks summarized in table 1
and shown in fig 1
 that are commonly encountered in the us health system and one example that is more suitable as a n95 dust mask for work under particulate conditions moldex n95 commonly used mask production materials are polypropylene and polyester fabrics usually as melt or electrospun fibers 45 fig 2 fig 3 fig 4
offer an overview of the layered structure of such face masks and the polymeric fabrics employed as analyzed by ir spectroscopy showing spectral absorbance versus wavenumber for material identification purposes commercial ppe masks embrace similar filter materials mostly polypropylene and polyester and design principles hence any conclusions on their thermal aging and filter performance behavior are likely to be more broadly applicable

3m 18601860s  the aged mask appears near identical to the original un-aged specimen it has the same color but the ink printed on its front has diffused slightly into the fibers blurry print the nose foam and elastic bands are still intact as much as the elastic bands retain their initial stretch properties the elastic bands appear durable and can easily withstand the extended 80 c exposure with no obvious degradation
3m aura 1870 n95  this mask maintains its color there is no obvious ink diffusion and the elastics retains its original stretch ability the nose foam remains attached securely and there are no apparent issues with this mask thereby easily accommodating this 80 c exposure with no obvious degradation
kimberly-clark n95  this mask maintains its color but there is some ink diffusion shrinkage and partial warping at 80 c the top of the duckbill has an embedded metal band to mold the mask to the users nose the bottom does not have the metal band and the plastic there is warped this could affect the fit at the chin and could allow particulates to bypass the chin seal also the inner plastic lining see fig 8 appears partially fused together and does not allow the duckbill to be opened easily anymore without tearing the inner polymer liner from the filter sections based on ir it is likely some ethylene copolymer with methyl acrylate this inner lining would have to be kept apart while in the oven it is also possible that wearing the mask may prevent any subsequent adhesion as the surfaces may no longer touch as effectively it may help having the mask open in its duckbill configuration prior to thermal conditioning not lying flat and folded for the exposure here we preferred not to open the mask to get a better picture of the intrinsic filter performance similarly other masks or objects should not be stacked on top to prevent this inner lining from coming in contact and fusing the elastic bands performed with sufficient elasticity remaining
halyard fluid shield level 3  this mask maintains its color but there was some ink diffusion shrinkage and partial warping at 80 c in contrast with the kimberly-clark model the bottom of the duckbill does not have the metal band and the plastic is warped again this could affect the chin fit and allow particulates under the seal as this mask does not have the inner plastic lining there is no issue with any fused polymer liner due to a lower melting material again the elastic bands had sufficient elasticity remaining
medichoice face shield  this polyester pet confirmed by ir based face shield displays significant shrinkage and was completely destroyed it cannot withstand 80 c for 24 h we note that the foam on the forehead and elastic band was still securely attached and there were no issues with the foam and elastic this face shield also does not withstand shorter times and slightly lower temperatures ie 30 min at 75 c
moldex 2400 n95  only a single mask was available as part of the initial cumulative screening exposure for 24 h at 65 80 and 95 c this mask maintains its color and no obvious changes were observed after the initial aging at 65 c after aging at 80 c for 24 h the bottom edge of the mask started to crack slightly again this could affect the chin fit and could allow particulates under the seal the elastic band performance retains its initial stretch properties after this cumulative aging schedule aging at 95 c for 24 h is too much for this mask as significant structural failures were observed cracking at the chin section was more pronounced and the high impact polystyrene confirmed by ir vent started to deform and warp
exposures for 24 h at 95c similar observations apply to all masks described above for 80 c this means these masks and their polymeric materials have somewhat predicable behavior for elevated temperature exposure the 3 m 1860 1860s and aura 1870 n95 types are not anticipated to degrade significantly should they experience slightly higher temperatures or longer times than the bare minimum sterilization targets these masks have some intrinsic thermal robustness in contrast unfortunately the duckbill types kimberly-clark 46767 n95 and halyard fluidshield level 3 have a specific material vulnerability with some warping as a material response which could compromise their subsequent best fit in addition there is the potential adhesion issue between the two layers for the kimberly-clark n95 via the additional liner we encourage any end-users to check for this behavior and its impact should thermal sterilization be appliedin summary the 3 m 1860 1860s along with the aura 1870 n95 display better thermal performance based on the exposure test results these masks could certainly be thermally-treated at a target temperature of 75 c and be reusable as long as effective viral deactivation is confirmed and their filter efficiency remains equally functional a previous study similarly showed that dry thermal treatment had little influence on mask performance of a particular type 36 the kimberly-clark and halyard duckbill masks showed some deformations at the chin seal which could lead to a compromised fit this would need to be verified on a few specimens with individual fit testing responses in parallel we also recognize that the testing for 24 h at 80 c is perhaps more conservative than only a few sterilization exposures at no more than 75 c this means the duckbill type masks may still perform after limited thermal exposureinstitutional large scale approaches for sterilization of masks and ppe exist as hydrogen peroxide vapor treatment which has been extensively reported and is now approved by the fda 242546 and perhaps gamma irradiation when facilities are easily available but polymer materials and filter reliability is to be confirmed or uv illumination 1218 19 20 we also recognize that aqueous solutions of isopropanol or ethanol are used in hospitals for quick momentary disinfection with some discussions on the web that ethanol could be more effective than isopropanol for sars-cov-2 while hard surfaces are easily wiped down and that can be expanded to suitable ppe alcohol soaking of masks is so far seen as detrimental to filtration efficiency and mask performance 36 once the alcohol has evaporated there is also no extended sterilization effect on any cleaned surface hence cleaning with wipes is temporary at bestthis brings up the question of whether simple improvised alternatives may exist in which longer lasting anti-viral compounds are easily deposited on suitable surfaces including masks this would offer an active surface or on-demand touch-up disinfection beyond the mask being only an inert physical barrier with the rapid propagation of custom-made cloth masks which have unknown filtration efficiency there could be added value by such quick refreshing options similar to the use of hand sanitizers in this sense we see value in improvised applications of a gentle mist of alcohol solutions containing a secondary active compound this could also be carefully applied to the perhaps vulnerable surface of face masks if no other quick disinfectant method is available and extended use is absolutely necessary as mentioned earlier covid-19 is a global pandemic which affects numerous countries with undoubtedly limited opportunities for high-tech maskppe disinfection and recycling technologies we envisage simple disinfectant solutions and hand-held misters that are widely available we also recognize that these may already exist and are likely used subject to existing experience and improvisation skills in local health services and communities they may not offer comprehensive ie deep disinfection of the mask but can certainly address surface contamination and assist with repetitive handlingsimple compounds with known anti-viral disinfectant properties are ionic surfactants benzalkonium chloride chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine and similar 103547 such substances are used in many products for example disodium edta is added to freely available contact lens solutions stearylkonium chloride is in hair conditioner and chlorhexidine gluconate is an ingredient in mouthwash to treat gingivitis or periodontal disease they were more widely available in the past before they have attracted additional fda scrutiny recently with ongoing reviews of over-the-counter antiseptic active ingredients 35 however such compounds are recognized as the key ingredients in many anti-viral formulations 47 ionic species and substances with strong hydrogen bonding are expected to disrupt the viral packaging layer or docking surfaces described as trimeric spike glycoproteins 48 from an alternative point of view tea tree oil for example has also been reported as having good anti-viral properties when applied on surfaces 34 or citric acid which has strong ionic features in the low ph range that is regarded as anti-viral 10 our intent here is not to specify the exact anti-viral properties and individual procons of specific disinfectants but rather to show how such active compounds could be easily applied in an improvised manner and whether they can remain on surfaces as very thin layers atr infrared absorption spectroscopy as a surface sensitive technique is ideally suited to quickly explore the relative volatility and continued presence of any deposited compoundswe used a commercially available disinfectant spray and prepared a few representative solutions of anti-viraldisinfectant compounds dissolved in 70 vol isopropanol for a simple screening study a high fraction of isopropanol has two advantages namely momentary disinfection behavior but also a low solution viscosity which aids the generation of a fine mist this is more difficult to generate from solutions that are richer in water resulting in larger droplets and more heterogeneous surface coatings we evaluated the following solutions involving surfactants commercial disinfectants essential oils or other ingredients that may have anti-viral properties such as edta or copper sulfate povidone iodine may also be effective but it was not obtained for the current studycommercial lysol spray ethanol 58 with alkyl 50 c14 40 c12 10 c16 dimethyl benzyl ammonium saccharinate 01 as active compound70 ml isopropanol and 30 ml di water with added 25 ml pine-sol multi surface cleaner70 ml isopropanol and 30 ml di water with added 3 wt citric acid and 1 wt mild liquid hand soap a small amount of soap was added to prevent crystallization of the citric acid after isopropanolh2o evaporation70 ml isopropanol and 30 ml di water with added 1 wt disodium edta and 1 wt benzalkonium chloride and 1 wt chlorhexidine gluconate this solution does not mix well there is some colloidal precipitation hence it needed to be shaken well before its application70 ml isopropanol and 30 ml di water with added 3 wt tea tree oil this compound was found to be quite volatile70 ml isopropanol and 30 ml di water with added 3 wt limonene this compound was also quite volatile
notes on solubility edta is not easily soluble in 7030 ipah2o copper sulfate is not soluble in 7030 ipah2o disodium edta is not easily soluble in 7030 ipah2o but is soluble in h2o
these solutions were deposited with two short squirts from a small hand held spray bottle at distances of 2030 cm spectral acquisition was started and monitored over 24 h at 25 and 37 c the isopropanol carrier evaporated quickly leaving a thin film of the remaining active substance on the atr crystalafter a thin film of the alcoholdisinfectant solution was deposited on the atr crystal the immediate spectral changes showed the rapid loss of isopropanol and water usually on the order of 10 min at 25 and 3 min at 37 c for the commercial disinfectant spray there was evidence of the active compound quaternary ammonium saccharinate remaining for a few hours at 25 c but quickly disappearing at 37 c fig 10
 the residue of a commercial disinfectant cleaner product pine-sol mostly surfactant in water easily remained on the crystal surface for 24 h at both temperatures fig 11
 in contrast despite its attractive smell and anti-viral properties 34 tea tree oil dissolved in the alcoholwater mix quickly disappeared within 1 h at 25 c fig 12
 tea tree oil might be helpful for short-term disinfection but clearly will not remain sufficiently on surfaces a similar disadvantageous volatility was observed for limonene as the active compound citric acid in combination with some small amount of surfactant however forms a persistent film within 10 min sufficient time for complete solvent carrier evaporation that does not display any further spectral changes fig 13
 this is an example for excellent surface retention if such a deposited film is not touched after deposition commercial disinfectants in 1 individual concentration applied here as a screening mixture of benzalkonium chloride edta and chlorhexidine gluconate forms a similarly stable film deposit fig 14
 for visualization purposes only a micrometer-sized thin film on a reflective bench top is shown in fig 15
for the citric acid spray-on solution this deposit is non-toxic and easily cleaned up subject to proving that such very small amounts of residue will not interfere with the filtration efficiency of a mask we suggest further evaluation of such simple disinfectant sprays for mask refreshing and extended wear options basic disinfection solutions are easily improvised as well and hence widely available of course any choice for a specific solution and active constituent will need to be assessed on its own specific merits with disinfection efficiency and filtration function to be evaluated we wish to emphasize that surface retention is equally important and that relatively non-toxic disinfectant compounds are also availableconsidering the global impact of the covid-19 pandemic we also have to consider that state-of-the-art disinfection and reuse approaches may not be available everywhere options such as hydrogen peroxide vapor exposure irradiation or basic thermal conditioning on a large scale may not exist for some countries in such situations improvised approaches for the reuse of ppe and masks may be limited to visual inspection perhaps cosmetic cleaning or no more than the application of small amounts of disinfectant sprays as mentioned earlier deep soaking with isopropanol or similar or actual washing of these masks is strongly discouraged as it negatively affects the electret filter layers 17 and is hence expected to reduce particulate filtering performance but what about applying a minimal surface treatment to enable a momentary refreshing of the external surface with disinfectant as we showed above isopropanolwater could act as a suitable carrier for common disinfectant additives and surfactants in comparison tea tree oil spray induced a thin surface deposit that is surprisingly evaporative nevertheless it would also have some residence time on the mask surface and aid in temporary surface disinfection perhaps even via some penetration of vapors into the filter layerswe do not wish to recommend a particular formulation approach or comment on the exact effectiveness of individual compounds for their viral deactivation yields on mask surfaces and its substructure other than that known disinfectants can be applied on the outer surface and are expected to have some benefit our focus is on the technical feasibility of spray-on coatings using non-aggressive ingredients with established anti-viral properties at the same time we also believe that many options exist for suitable disinfectants combined with some surfactant in alcoholwater solution we note that in related internal snl efforts for the cleaning and disinfection of hard surfaces a combination of a 3 commercial all purpose surface cleaner pine-sol with only 03 benzalkonium chloride in water showed excellent kill efficiency for ms2 viral simulant in solution plating with a log reduction greater than 5 10 ppm residual traditional large surface cleaning is expected to be safer when it is only water based less alcohol vapor exposure but for the spraying of masks the isopropanol contribution generates a finer mist meaning there is some additional advantage besides alcoholisopropanol also offering some immediate contact virus kill efficacy further viral deactivation in solution is likely more effective than on dried surfaces which have a disinfectant deposit hence we explored spraying slightly higher concentrations than would be needed for cleaningdisinfectant solutions with the discussion below showing some examples for this approachwe showed the surface retention of disinfectants on the atr crystal earlier which was achieved with no more than two gentle squirts from a small hand-held sprayer we added a tiny amount droplet of red food dye solution to our disinfectant solution for the purpose of visualizing the spray deposits on masks with a low-cost 50 ml fine-mist sprayer we were able to achieve a homogenous surface layer solutions were prepared using 7030 vol isopropanolwater as a carrier with added active ingredients to enable a simple screening of how disinfectants could be deposited a 3 m aura 1870 n95 mask was coated with a weak solution containing 3 citric acid and 1 liquid hand soap resulting in homogeneous coverage fig 16
 the halyard mask was sprayed with added 25 of a commercial cleaner pine-sol having a non-ionic surfactant ingredient as shown in fig 17
 and the kimberly clark mask with a solution containing 1 pine-sol and 1 benzalkonium chloride a rudimentary solution having a trace of surfactant and a known relatively easily available and low risk disinfectant a 3 m 1860 mask was coated with an addition of 1 benzalkonium chloride 1 chlorohexidine gluconate and 1 disodium edta the intent here being for basic ionic activity for demonstration purposes only in all cases a thin coating could be easily applied commercial sprayers with enhanced atomization features could of course more easily apply thin coatings on multiple masks in parallelin situations when chemical based disinfectants may not be available at all then the most basic approach could be a gentle exposure of the mask surface to some weak spray of isopropanolwater or similar as a carrier with some added surfactant as active ingredient this is based on reports that even hand soap has some anti-viral properties 10 as shown in fig 17 of course we recognize that meaningful disinfection in this case is likely not guaranteed but a spray-on approach of this nature would at least assist the mask user to minimize surface contamination from repetitive handling and surface resident viral exposurethe filtration efficiencies of thermally aged and gently coated masks were characterized to assess if a discernible difference could be observed when compared against untreated n95 masks a rd filtration system at sandia national laboratories was used to quantify the efficiencies of kimberly-clark and halyard type masks as a function of particle size the system simulates where possible the parameters defined by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh for certification of filter materials for n95 respirators niosh 2019 49 a detailed description of the system instrumentation used and methodology implemented may be found in the relevant system description 50full mask geometries were mounted onto custom filter holders and inserted into the test section of system a polydisperse nacl test aerosol was used and measurements upstream and downstream of the test articles were taken with a tsi scanning mobility particle sizer spectrometer smps 3938 each respirator was tested at two filter-face velocities as suggested for the evaluation of the filtration performance of cloth masks and common fabric materials 51 which were derived from the lower and upper flow rates defined in the niosh standard triplicate measurements were conducted for each test configuration the filtration efficiency at each particle size measured was computed from the difference in aerosol concentration upstream and downstream of the test article care was taken to ensure only statistically significant data are reported uncertainties in these measurements were propagated accordingly through all calculationsthe relative filtration performance of masks was examined in the 10400 nm range ie a particle size range that is very important to be effectively filtered out by comparing the performance of treated specimens to a non-treated reference mask the data for low and high flow conditions for the kimberly clark mask when treated at 80 c for 24h and sprayed with a 1 pine-sol and 1 benzalkonium chloride 7030 isopropanolwater solution are shown in fig 18
 clearly there has been little effect of the two treatments although there is some scatter in the data subject to the limited mask availability and our inability to test multiple face masks we expect some underlying mask to mask variation anyhow subject to different batches perhaps handling during acquisition or their relative age as well also while identical in appearance these kimberly clark models were also provided with different branding depending on suppliers ie one mask had an additional technol stamp on its rear surface a comparison again for low and high flow rate conditions for the halyard mask is shown in fig 19
 this mask type has intrinsically less scatter and despite the spray-on coating being generously applied see fig 17 evidence is that neither the disinfectant spray nor the thermal exposure at both 80 and 95 c had any measurable consequences on filtration performancean additional filter efficiency study was conducted on a separate filter penetration test-bed fpt located at snl as with the aforementioned system this test-bed was also designed to follow where possible niosh guidelines for n95 respirator material testing the fpt differs from the prior system in that it size-selects a mono-disperse nacl aerosol by utilizing a tsi 8020 electrostatic classifier and tsi 3081l differential mobility analyzer dma upstream from a 47 mm stainless filter housing niosh guidance describes an aerosol with a particle size median diameter of 0075  0020 m with a geometric standard deviation not exceeding 186 which the fpt system verified however it is worth mentioning that the monodisperse aerosol does not capture the fda recommended mass median particle diameter of 03 m additionally the filter housing diameter used by the fpt is smaller than the mounts used by tsi 8130 120 mm therefore flow rates were adjusted according to equivalent filter face velocities so the filter housing geometry was mitigated finally in order to calculate filter efficiency concentration was compared upstream and downstream of the filter material tested by a tsi 8022 condensation particle counter cpc five tests upstream and downstream were conducted with 1 minone minute intervals mask performance tests yielding relative filtration efficiency are reported below as summarized in table 2
 for two n95 face mask types the 1860 and aura 1870 from 3 m under multiple exposure conditions once again the results show that the disinfectant spray or the thermal exposure at both 80 and 95 c had no measurable consequences on filtration performancewe have focused on two directions to enable the extended use of ppe face masks one avenue that has also been recognized by others see recent literature is the use of thermal exposure for mask disinfection in the 75 c range subject to confirmation of the most suitable times and temperatures by our bio-medical colleagues another strategy particularly if local resources are limited and institutional large scale mask treatment approaches are not available the subtle spraying of a masks surface with a weak disinfectant solution might be an improvised option to enable some topical disinfection or at least a refreshing of surfaces that are often touched and could be contaminatedfrom a materials performance point of view only a few minor issues during thermal exposure were observed some masks showed warping and the beginning of material weaknesses but most importantly no significant negative impact on filtration performance was observed due to thermal conditioning for no more than 24 h at 80 or 95 c similarly filtration performance was maintained despite the application of a spray-on coating on mask surfaces there is good confidence for the feasibility of some repetitive thermal reconditioning steps considering that the tested masks mostly withstood temperature and times higher than currently discussed for virus kill requirementsdilute and gentle spray-on alcohol-based solutions containing low risk non-toxic disinfectants perhaps improvised due to lack of local availability of ingredients and when applied to the top surface only ie avoid soaking may complement the now ubiquitous custom-made face masks with their often unknown filtration effectiveness similarly this might be a viable option for any masks and other ppes to offer quick additional anti-viral properties or short term refreshing we do not recommend a particular disinfectant formulation but rather introduce the current concept and wish to emphasize that specific viral kill efficacy of any disinfectant on mask surfaces has not yet been determined we have however demonstrated that known low toxicity disinfectants can be applied to masks without affecting filtration and structural characteristics and that benzalkonium chloride still on the approved list for hand sanitizer 35 with surfactant in solution is effective against ms2 viral simulant which corroborates disinfectant efficacy against covid-19 10 further we have not addressed any inhalation risk which due to the nature of needing some disinfectant cannot be zero gentle spraying deposits collectively 100 mg for two sprays of material on the mask surface which for example with 1 active content means roughly 1 mg disinfectant mixed with some surfactant could be amorphously adhered to the outer mask surface the risk of exposure to such quantities cannot be eliminated but will have to be balanced against the needs to improve mask availability longevity and anti-viral efficacy in the context of other options perhaps not being available as with many other aspects of this pandemic careful and informed compromises with of course individual preferences including disinfectant choice need to be pursued as there are no perfect and zero risk solutionsour results on thermal and spray-on approaches represent some forward looking opinions that should not be misinterpreted any use of thermal and spray-on disinfection on masks should be considered within the additional risks seen in the use of chemical disinfectants and mask fitting behavior after thermal reconditioning further a surface spraying is not expected to kill any virus particulates trapped within the interior filter layers nevertheless commercial masks embrace similar filter materials and design principles hence any conclusions on their reuse and filter performance are likely to be more broadly applicable however continued good mask fits and general cleanliness are also important for extended usethese are subjective and personal opinions of researchers in the polymer materials reliability and bio-medical field in the context of the current global covid-19 pandemic only there is no intent to challenge existing guidelines for ppemask use policies or give any preference to ppemask manufacturers and any specific technologies that may already exist or are under development due to time constraints driven by the urgency of the covid-19 situation these screening studies should not be considered as comprehensive evaluations with any implied recommendations and guidance outside the scope of these efforts the parallel work of other researchers is expected to complement our understanding of mask and ppe performance collectively this will guide us towards viable methods and approaches for maskppe reuse and additional application options snl and qut do not endorse specific mask disinfection approaches we only wish to report on their thermal responses medical experts and virologists will have to make decisions based on covid-19 deactivation properties for suitable time and temperatures to enable mask and other ppe reconditioning

this paperthe new coronavirus called 2019-ncov is a new type of virus that was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 ghinai et al 2020 the 2019-ncov is from same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars community-acquired pneumonia cap and other common colds the 2019-ncov is a relatively large virus with a size of about 12 nm and is from a group of enveloped virus family containing a positive-sense single-stranded rna fehr and perlman 2015 ebrahimi et al 2020 the virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected persons respiratory droplets coughing and sneezing as well as contact with infected surfaces the 2019-ncov can survive for hours on surfaces but a simple disinfectant can eliminate it lai et al 2020a covid-19 signs and symptoms include fever cough and shortness of breath in more severe cases the infection can lead to pneumonia or respiratory severe problems and ultimately in rare cases the disease will be fatal huang et al 2020ain the absence of a safe and effective vaccine as well as a lack of specific drug treatment the only solution is preventing its transmission performing general education and implementing appropriate prevention and control precautions can help people prevent risk of infection such as washing hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based disinfectant gel covering mouth with your bent napkin or elbow when sneezing or coughing avoiding close contact with those who have symptoms and being sure to see a doctor if have a fever cough or difficulty breathing haybar et al 2020 the virus transfers through direct and close contact with respiratory droplets of the affected person cough or sneeze or contact with contaminated surfaces ghinai et al 2020 yu et al 2020 and it can survive for hours on surfaces but a pure disinfectant can eliminate itepidemiologic and field studies show that 2019-ncov just similar to sars and mers is spread through fine-grained particles such as particles sneezing out of the mouth yu et al 2020 schwartz and graham 2020 in only a single old study tang 2009 the survival of the airborne human coronavirus 229e hcv229e a virus used in research as a representative or surrogate of coronary respiratory viruses was studied under different temperature and relative humidity conditions the study showed that under such conditions the virus has a half-life of 27 and 67 h at 30 and 50 humidity respectively while its half-life at 80 humidity is only 3 h when the temperature drops as 6 degrees the viruss half-life is increased 3 h at 80 humidity similar conditions and consequences have been reported for seasonal flu lowen and steel 2014 this severe effect of lowering the temperature on prolonging the viruss half-life at high humidity could help the 2019-ncov spread under these conditions in spite of several clinical studies that claimed that spreading the virus into droplets can be prevented using appropriate masks it is challenging to prevent it from spreading into aerosol forms as well as the type of mask makes no significant difference long et al 2020 wang et al 2020b subsequent studies showed that viruses that had become airborne aerosols and spread through defective sewage were the possible cause of the sars coronavirus that killed lots of people in hong kong in 2003 yu et al 2004 in the same year only one incident in sars contaminated 22 out of 120 passengers on a 3-h flight olsen et al 2003 surprisingly the contamination included people who were outside the persons 2-m distance and viruses could not be transmitted to them through aerosols and droplets la rosa et al 2013 although it is difficult to prove that the virus has spread only through aerosols and droplets the relatively low humidity of the aircraft has undoubtedly contributed to the higher survival of the sars virus in the particles but a later study did not observe that transmission of sars-associated coronavirus and suggested that the risk of transmission is not amplified aboard aircraft vogt et al 2006a research report from canada points to the fact that open oxygen masks can help to spread disease agents such as sars in fact viruses such as sars are transmitted through the droplets emitted from these masks somogyi et al 2004 air exhaled through the oxygen masks transmits viruses in the droplets farther away increasing the risk of the respiratory disease spreading to health facilities further research is needed to fully determine that the sars virus and similar viruses can survive and stay live and spreadable in the warm and humid environment of oxygenated airresearch findings on the impact of humidity and temperature on the survival of the virus in airborne particulate matter indicate contrary to that li et al conducted a comprehensive study on the spread of the sars virus at the hong kong hospital and found evidence of the transmission of the virus aerosols they also suggested improving the air conditioning or ventilation system to reduce the risk of spreading such diseases li et al 2005 the 2019-ncov is claimed does not survive at temperatures above 26 c but it can survive for approximately 510 min on the skin 6 to 12 h on plastic materials and 12 h on metal fig 2because safety and ethical considerations do not allow the covid-19 infection test on the human specimen researchers used human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e as a surrogate to study the survival of the coronavirus on human hands initial findings from these tests show that about 45 of hand-infected viruses survive and remain viable after 1 h warnes et al 2015 such a survival time is much longer than other viruses such as the para-influenza virus type 3 which disappears after only 10 min in another study researchers used human fingers to show that by washing only with water the concentration of hcov-229e was reduced by 70 however with the use of hand-sanitized alcoholic disinfectants the concentration of this virus decreased by 9999 within 30 s geller et al 2012 this study highlights the importance of effective hygiene and disinfection preventing and controlling of infectious diseases caused by coronavirus familythere is no evidence that corona is transmitted through food or drinking water and recreational water one study shows that sars in the water can survive to a very limited degree wang et al 2005coronavirus is more stable and more resistant to environmental surfaces than other coated viruses warnes et al 2015 otter et al 2016 recently molecular methods such as pcr have been studied for the transmission of pathogens to the environmental surfaces of aircraft maris 1990 however the detection of pathogenic viruses in environmental samples seems to be necessary to assess their potential ability to infect and spread the disease mathematical simulations also confirm the fact that environmental levels play an essential role in the spread of coronavirus in health facilities ikonen et al 2018three-level biosafety has been suggested for protectivity 1 level 1 protection disposable hats disposable surgical masks disposable isolation clothing and disposable gloves wang et al 2020c 2

face mask or a medical mask goggles or face mask to a full set or with an electric air filter respirator pei et al 2020wearing a face mask is suggested for healthcare workers and people who have respiratory symptoms but is not recommended for healthy people organization wh 2020a nonmedical masks made of other materials such as cotton fabric has not been well evaluated esposito and principi 2020scientific research to date on the covid-19 has yielded no conclusions that the covid-19 outbreak will decline with the start of the warm season many researchers have said it is too early to predict whether the covid-19 will decrease as the season progresses mahase 2020 studies have hypothesized that areas where covid-19 has suffered the most have similar weather patterns lipsitch et al 2020 countries located in the east and west of the globe did not have a significant impact on the prevalence of the disease among communities and on the other hand the north and south have provided a model for the relative prediction of disease outbreaks gates 2020 but now scenario has changed and countries located on east and west of globes usa  japan have already declared emergency and this statement was in contradiction with reality also it is estimated that this disease will reach saturation in the usa in july 2020 arias velsquez and meja lara 2020 and outbreak of covid-19 significantly correlated with average temperature minimum temperature and air quality bashir and ma 2020there are striking similarities between average wuhan city air temperature in january time of outbreak here and other polluted places in february as well as their humidity vetter et al 2020 the temperature at meteorological stations in these areas between 4 and 9 c and in cities due to urban factors has been slightly above and between 5 and 11 c sajadi et al 2020b it can also be predicted that with the onset of summer in northern hemisphere of the covid-19 it may be slightly influenza-like in the tropics and spread simultaneously in the southern hemisphere anderson et al 2020in addition to known factors influencing the transmission of viruses such as population displacement and human-to-human contact environmental factors can affect transmission of droplets and the viruss survival but for covid-19 disease the evidence is still very limited absolute humidity which is defined as water in the ambient air is considered a robust environmental factor for virus transmission huang et al 2020b oliveiros et al 2020 islam et al 2020 qi et al 2020 berumen et al 2020 guo et al 2020 barreca and shimshack 2012 in examining the relationship between climate and sars-cov-2 it is important to note that different regions of the world which have had a high prevalence in recent weeks have had different climates also no significant relationship has been found so far sajadi et al 2020b table 1 in analysis of regional regression countries affected by high prevalence of disease are divided into different regions and in these regions climate will be examined and recorded in several changes then for first period from first day of outbreak to day of study regression of daily aggregate growth against average temperature and relative humidity will be taken bukhari and jameel 2020b in this model we try to control variables such as population and gdp table 1 however temperature was not associated with epidemic growth of covid-19 and case counts zhu and xie 2020in a study by wang et al the effect of air temperature and relative humidity on the transmission of 2019-ncov from 105 samples of viruses carrying infected and contaminated pairs calculated the number of daily virus production per 100 chinese cities with more than 40 confirmed cases they reported that high temperatures and high humidity significantly reduced transmission of virus respectively also 1 c significantly reduces temperature increase and 1 decrease in relative humidity of daily virus production previous studies have shown that high temperature and humidity reduce the transmission of influenza and sars which is consistent with wang et als study this study showed that the arrival of summer and rain in the northern hemisphere might effectively reduce 2019-ncov transmission wang et al 2020ain a study by lou et al they looked at the number of covid-19 reproductions across chinas provinces and found that rising temperatures and humidity necessitated the arrival of spring and summer in the northern hemisphere alone without extensive public health interventions it does not reduce the number of viruses luo et al 2020 therefore it is important to understand the impact of environmental factors on the increasing prevalence of covid-19 to support disease control decisions ma et al 2020 it is especially important in areas with high temperatures and humidity where the risk of transmission is minimized shi et al 2020 distribution of significant disease prevalence in the community at limited latitude and longitude temperature and humidity is consistent with the behavior of seasonal respiratory viruses due to the fact that temperature and humidity are known factors in the survival of sars-cov mers-cov and influenza chan et al 2011 the prevalence of covid-19 in long periods of time has occurred at certain levels of temperature so that conditions of prolonged exposure to this temperature range increase the risk of disease outbreak rahman et al 2020b in addition to prolonging half-life and survival of virus other possible mechanisms related to temperature and humidity including droplet stabilization and increased virus spread in the nasal mucosa like other respiratory viruses are further evidence that these two factors affect 2019-ncov schaffer et al 1976 shirbandi et al 2020 it is important to note that although colder areas are relatively free of 2019-ncov they can affect the survival of the virus due to the low freezing cycle lamarre and talbot 1989 the researchers also found that low humidity was a factor in transmission of influenza in laboratory and onset of seasonal flu lowen et al 2007 shaman et al 2009many researchers and politicians have suggested that the covid-19 disease will go away on its own in warmer weather in the coming months in the northern hemisphere roy 2020 some have even said that the sars experience in 2003 is an evidence of this claim what can now be said in response to this claim based on existing studies is that it is possible to reduce the transmission of 2019-ncov in hot and humid weather with the closure of gathering centers such as schools and universities but it is not logical because these reductions do not occur alone or without any effective public healthrelated intervention it should be noted that even sars does not disappear for natural reasons but does not survive due to very severe public health interventions these include isolating and quarantining infected people and people in contact with them social distancing and other targeted actionstherefore it can be concluded that in case of 2019-ncov it is expected that like other beta-coronaviruses virus may be slightly more effective at low temperatures such as in winter although the underlying mechanism is not well-known therefore the size of this change in transmission and pathogenicity of the virus is expected to be moderate and will not stop by itself comparing to the pandemic the 2019-ncov is expected to be less immune to humans and even easily transmitted outside the cold season changing seasons and closing down gathering centers such as schools and universities may help but it is unlikely to stop the transmission of the virus to make effective policy it is necessary to determine whether the closure of gathering centers such as schools and universities may help to reduce the rate of transfer effectively in which if it would not be effective the resources are wasted during such closures for example recent evidence suggests that children may be as susceptible as adults bi et al 2020 so the critical question is whether the virus is easily transmitted under different temperature and humidity conditions finally except for a limited number of articles it is currently being published and shows that there is no conflict in the results regarding the effect of these two variables on the survival and transmission of the virusthe more practical and quantitative method of qct-2 showed that ethanol could kill 999 of hcov-229e policy et al nd other studies showed that alcohol-based mixture such as lozenge that contains amyl meta-cresol and dichlorobenzene alcohol could have direct and significant effects in reducing the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov oxford et al 2005 morokutti-kurz et al 2017 another research evaluated the impact of alcohol-based hand sanitizer on positive cases of mers-cov and showed that using this mixture had a significant increase in the utilized amount of virus as well as hand hygiene compliance rates increased to 88 al-tawfiq et al 2019formaldehyde 4 is used as a complete sterilizer and disinfectant however for safety reasons its use as a regular disinfectant is not recommended this disinfectant can kill the tgv virus in 99999 in 5 min and a 2 solution can kill more than 999 of hcov-229e sattar et al 1989phenolic-based ingredients have a long history of using coal tar soap with creosol although some disinfectants use the same historically active chemical changes in creosol have been made to make them more effective against germs for example o-phenyl phenol with a concentration of 200 ppm is quite effective against coronavirus sattar et al 1989 however adding detergent or ethanol can increase its effectiveness and eliminate 999 of the hcov-229e within 5 min similarly chemicals made from phenolics need other helpers to be effective shah et al 2020many studies were ongoing according to clinicaltrialsgov database according to this database bacillus calmettegurin bcg vaccine which primarily used against tuberculosis tb will be intervening other vaccines such as inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine lv-smenp-dc vaccine measles-mumps-rubella vaccine autologous dendritic cells loaded with sars-cov-2 antigens av-covid-19 chadox1 ncov-19 angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blocker arb igm and igg antibodies vpm1002 development of the bcg vaccine and adoptive cellular transfer act are ongoing there are no food and drug administration fdaapproved vaccines to prevent or trial covid-19 however fda issued emergency use authorization eua for emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients grein et al 2020the scientific evidence in this review article suggests that the spread of 2019-ncov may be influenced by climatic variables such as temperature and humidity apparently warm humid weather may indicate less transmission of the 2019-ncov considering the topic that seems to impose both the positive and negative data on the possible effect of environmental factors especially humidity and temperature on the stability and transmissibility of the 2019-ncov almost all available evidence revealed the possible positive effectcountries located in the east and west of the globe did not have a significant impact on the prevalence of the disease among communities and on the other hand the north and south have provided a model for the relative prediction of disease outbreaks gates 2020 the government and public health organizations can take steps to reduce the rate of covid-19 transmission in the future for example in addition to helping their people leading countries can help low- and middle-income countries lmics prepare for the epidemic and most effectively fight against the disease khadka et al 2020many lmic health systems are now vulnerable and a pathogen such as covid-19 can quickly lead to serious problems and challenges and eventually collapse of healthcare system given the natural inclination of richer countries to give priority to their own people over other countries this has led to a political and economic leverage in poor countries pioneer countries can save the lives of their own people by slowing the global transmission of the covid-19 by helping to prepare african and south asian countries to fight the disease gates 2020helping lmic is essential to strengthening the primary care system with the infrastructure to fight epidemics well-trained healthcare workers not only provide vaccines but also monitor disease patterns as part of early warning systems that warn the world of a possible outbreak given the limited testing capacity in african countries the numbers of confirmed cases of covid-19 may greatly underestimate the true burden although there was little evidence of unexplained outbreaks of the virus at face value the figures suggest that an african continent people had suffered fewer covid-19 deaths than the top list countries such as usa russia and uk zhao et al 2020b khafaie and rahim 2020baccording to epidemiologists 2019-ncov is not among the thermophile viruses so it will become inactive once the cold season begins however others suggested that 2019-ncov disappears at 30 c which is a misconception about the virus it is also reported in the multimedia that it is better to use fried food to eliminate covid-19 while the virus is cold-friendly and will survive longer with lower temperatures based on the results of new studies on the 2019-ncov the virus can survive on the surface for 4 to 28 days but if the temperature drops to less than 30 to 40 c the life span of the virus will be reduced rather than eliminated casanova et al 2010 some scholars think that if the temperature reaches 30 c the virus will not survive which is a misconception because at this temperature the viruss survival will reduce and does not mean that the virus will completely eliminate wang et al 2020a since the bats body temperature is 48 c so the 2019-ncov has nothing to do with these creatures levesque et al 2016 the virus is also sensitive to humidity in addition to temperature therefore sars coronavirus and possibly 2019-ncov have a longer life span of 50 than 30 humidity chan et al 2011 according to published data the human coronavirus can survive at temperatures of 20 c for up to 9 days and if the temperature rises to more than 30 c it perhaps decreases 2019-ncov viability but the lower the temperature is associated with the more virus activity in such a way that it can continue its activity for up to 28 days casanova et al 2010 thus the most effective way to reduce the activity of this virus is to use disinfectants such as ethanol 70 these types of substances can kill the virus within a short minutecurrently in a modeling study using the classification of covid-19 confirmed cases was investigated as one of the epidemic diseases consequentially the average daily temperature and relative humidity of hubei province in china and the number of covid-19 confirmed cases were selected they demonstrated that the relative humidity and the maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases the daily temperature and relative humidity affected 2019-ncov positively and extreme daily temperature with an average of 154 c affected this virus negatively pirouz et al 2020 recently a published evidence reports that 2019-ncov significantly contaminates air surface environment and protective equipment by droplets of an infected person meaning that environment is an important issue to consider because it is a potential medium of transmission thus it is necessary for strict adherence to environmental and personal protection and hygiene as well as social distancing ong et al 2020we are poorly aware of their survival in the environment and the precise factors of their transmission however limited studies in this field show that 2019-ncov is more resistant to environmental factors than other coated viruses the environmental conditions necessary for the survival and spread of 2019-ncov are somewhat clear but unlike animal coronaviruses the effect of humidity and temperature on the 2019-ncov activity is controversial researchers in the field of epidemiologists believe that the 2019-ncov is not a thermophilic virus so it will be activated with the onset of the cold seasonaccording to published data human coronavirus can survive for up to 9 days at 25 c and if this temperature rises to 30 c its lifespan will be shorter the 2019-ncov is sensitive to humidity and the lifespan of viruses in 50 humidity is longer than that of 30 also temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the covid-19 mortality rate and may facilitate 2019-ncov transmission seasonal factors are recognized to play an essential role in the transmission of viruses responsible for various respiratory diseases besides most of these diseases reach epidemic proportions and key outbreak during winter recently researchers claimed that the two main causes contribute to the description of any association between viral outbreak and the seasonal factors including changes in environmental parameters and human behavior specifically changes in temperature and humidity disturb the viral stability and transmissibility thus considering the recent and available evidence it seems that low temperature as well as dry and unventilated air may affect the stability and transmissibility of the 2019-ncovviral transmissions and infections have posed severe threats to human health and wellbeing throughout history and have led to widespread socioeconomic disruptions during the 2014 ebola pandemic in west africa the gross domestic product gdp growth of liberia one of the worstaffected countries fell from 87 in 2013 to just 07 in 2014
1
 bolstered by the closeknit global connectivity we enjoy today the threat of a global virus pandemic is greater now than any other time in human history as viruses can spread across the globe at unprecedented rates even a century ago in 1918 the spanish influenza pandemic caused a worldwide healthcare catastrophe with more than 50 million deaths and 500 million infections
2
 a similar pandemic today will undoubtedly result in even more disastrous outcomes
3
 at the time of writing in early april 2020 the novel coronavirus causing covid19 sarscov2 or formerly known as hcov19 which was first reported by china in late 2019 has resulted in more than a million confirmed cases of infections and almost 57000 fatalities worldwide
4
 this is the largest coronavirus outbreak in human populations within the first 20 years of the 21st century occurring on a larger scale than the earlier outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 20022004 and 2012 respectively
5
 while government interventions can influence the rates and range of outbreaks
6
 individuals can play equally or arguably even more important roles in limiting the spread of viruses in the public and healthcare arenas
7
 humantohuman transmission of common influenza viruses and coronaviruses can occur through virusladen body fluids as well as selfinnoculation of the mucous membranes in the nose mouth or eyes by touching contaminated dry surfaces
8
 depending on the type of surface and ambient conditions viruses can persist for as short as 5 min to greater than 28 days on inanimate surfaces
9
 the use of sanitizing agents for personal care and surface disinfection are clearly of paramount importance in limiting viral transmissions by inactivating the viruses before they have a chance to enter the human bodyin this review we summarize the various types of sanitizing agents used in commercially available formulations scientifically demonstrated for their virucidal properties to inactivate viruses in suspension and on surfaces viruses that require vectors for transmission such as the chikungunya and dengue viruses are not considered these virucidal agents can either destroy viruses or alter their surface structures to prevent them from infecting potential host cells section 2 they differ from antiviral compounds
10
 which inhibits virus replication in host cells the effective dose of each sanitizing agent exposure time for effective virucidal activity suitability for usage under domestic or healthcarehospital settings and mechanisms of action are considered we also explore what has been scientifically shown for some common myths believed to inactivate viruses and prevent their spread finally we present promising new research directions materials and strategies that have been shown to inactivate viruses but have yet to reach widespread commercial availabilityviruses are typically composed of a viral capsid containing nucleic acids inside the nucleic acid serve as the template information for replication while the capsid and its associated proteins function both to protect the nucleic acid and bind to host cell receptors
11
 the coronavirus sarscov2 for example uses the spike glycoprotein to bind to host cell sialic acid receptors
12
 outside of a host cell viruses are unable to replicate and increase in number however they can often survive for long periods of time in this state
13
 when they encounter a suitable host cell they will infect and enter the host cell hijacking the cellular machinery for its own replication viruses are able to infect cells including even bacterial cells and cause a range of commonly seen diseases see table 1 this is exacerbated by the lack of effective treatment against several of these virusessurfaces including our hands play an important part in the spread of viruses viruses such as poliovirus and bacteriophage showed a much higher survival when they were transferred by direct contact of surfaces as opposed to droplet aerosolization or dust containing viruses
14
 handtosurface contact of only 5 s was sufficient to transfer a significant proportion of the virus and viruses could then spread by touching the mucosa of the nose or conjunctiva of the eye
15
 the chance of spread is in turn directly correlated with the viral survival time on the surface which shows considerable variation between different viruses for example among different soft surfaces tested enteric viruses were shown to survive on wool blankets for the longest period of time poster card for the shortest period of time and cotton fabric for an intermediate period of time
13
 a very recent study has found that the covid19 coronavirus sarscov2 can persist longest on propylene plastic surfaces and stainless steel with viable viruses found up to 72 hr after initial application though at a greatly reduced viral titer
16
 much shorter persistence was observed on copper surfaces with no viable viruses observed after 4 hr while the closelyrelated sarscov1 coronavirus showed no significant statistical differences in halflife on these surfaces sarscov2 could persist considerably longer on cardboard surfaces 24 hr were required for no viable sarscov2 to be detected compared with just 8 hr for sarscov1the main measure of efficacy of the disinfectant is by the fold reduction in infectivity of the virus and this is typically conducted by carrier tests and suspension tests the key parameters that affect the efficacy of disinfection agents against viruses include the contact time concentration of disinfection agent and the particular virus involved
17
 the disinfection inactivation can be described by modified forms of the chickwatson lawlognnokctwhere n
o is the original number of microbes n is the final number of microbes c is the disinfectant concentration t is the contact time and k is the inactivation rate constant specific to the microbe
18
 with a decrease in the concentration of the active disinfecting ingredient the contact time will likely need to be increased to achieve adequate disinfection
19
 a reduction of viral infectivity by 4 log units correlates to a 9999 reduction in the viral titer the log unit reduction and percent  reduction are used interchangeably in literature to describe disinfectant efficacydisinfection efficacy can also be influenced by environmental factors if disinfection requires chemical reactions to take place such as for formaldehyde then the rate of disinfection will be higher at higher temperatures under cold temperatures certain disinfectants could be ineffective as the rate of disinfection would be exceedingly low
20
 humidity is also another factor that could affect disinfectant penetration to the virus for reactions such as aldehyde disinfectants a change in ph will also affect the disinfectant efficacy
17

there are specific unique characteristics of viruses that influence inactivation by disinfection there are three main types of viruses with different structures classified here according to increasing difficulty of chemical disinfectant inactivation enveloped viruses large unenveloped viruses and small unenveloped viruses see table 2 larger viruses are generally more sensitive to disinfectants although there are exceptions
21
 a few disinfectant solutions tested were all effective against the enveloped viruses herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus hiv type 1 although less effective against the small nonenveloped human coxsackie virus
22
 enveloped viruses contain a lipid envelope that is required for infection and therefore interfering with the envelope could potentially reduce virus infectivity lipophilic disinfectants can often be used to inactivate enveloped viruses in contrast nonenveloped viruses utilize a protein coat for infection and therefore inactivation often requires denaturation of the redundant viral capsid proteins or essential replicative proteins
23
 disinfectants that disrupt proteins such as glutaraldehyde or sodium hypochlorite could be effective at inactivating nonenveloped viruses
21
 sodium hypochlorite was shown to inactivate the bacteriophage pao1 and further electron microscopy studies showed that there was extensive structural damage to the phage including damage to capsid proteins
24
 however the disinfectant might also need to penetrate to destroy the nucleic acids as viruses such as polio retain infectivity with the rna alone
21
 while the enveloped virus influenza h1n1 could be inactivated by all the disinfectants tested
25
 it is much more challenging to inactivate small nonenveloped noroviruses and several commonly available disinfectants are not able to sufficiently reduce infectivity
26
 
27

viruses also show resistance to disinfection due to the cellular materials that viruses are normally associated with viruses are normally reliant on host cells for replication so they are often found together with material such as cell debris soil and aerosolized droplets
20
 these are called viral clumping protective factors and they can both reduce the penetration of the disinfectant to the virus and can also interact and reduce the activity of the disinfecting agents this has a big impact on the disinfectants necessitating a much higher concentration for effective disinfection disinfection is commonly associated with and reliant on cleaning processes as the removal of organic material impurities first can allow for a better disinfection process
28
 viruses can also aggregate in the environment for example upon exposure to disinfectants thereby making it more difficult for disinfectants to penetrate and access the viruses
29

alcohols specifically isopropyl alcohol otherwise known as isopropanol and propan2ol and ethyl alcohol ethanol are capable of inactivating a wide spectrum of bacterial fungi and viral activities these actives play an important role in the healthcare industry for skin antisepsis and disinfecting small medical tools although it is shown to be effective in annihilating infectious microorganisms alcohols are not sporicidal
30
 
31
 and are often coupled with other major biocidal actives to improve its disinfection efficacy
31

potent biocidal agents eradicate viruses and bacteria by various mechanisms such as disrupting the structure of the cell and coagulating andor denaturing proteins in the microorganisms although few studies have been done to fully understand the biocidal activity of alcohol it is often believed that alcohols disrupts the cell membrane and denatures the proteins in general
31
 
32
 viruses as well as many other microorganisms are commonly susceptible to this mode of action previous studies have reported that with the inclusion of water in the biocidal system the efficacy of alcohol increases as water would facilitate quicker denaturing of proteins
30
 
31
 
33
 additionally the inclusion of water significantly increase the effectiveness of the alcohols as it delays the evaporation of the alcohol and increase its exposure to viruses and bacteriagenerally the efficacy of alcohols in eradicating microorganisms is optimum between 60 and 90 by solution in water vv
30
 
33
 in one of the studies it was reported that 80 ethyl alcohol was effective at eradicating hepatitis b virus under 2 min and 70 isopropyl alcohol of that within 10 min
34
 however the virucidal activity of alcohol depends greatly on its concentration of the actives and the type of test viruses ethyl alcohol is effective against enveloped viruses and a few nonenveloped viruses studies have shown that ethyl alcohol inactivates enveloped virus such as herpes and influenza to select nonenveloped viruses such as adenovirus rhinovirus and rotavirus
30
 isopropyl alcohol however was reported to be effective against enveloped viruses but ineffective against similar nonenveloped viruses
30
 the differential virucidal action could potentially be a result of the lipophilic nature of isopropyl alcohol as compared to ethanol
31
 the efficacy of alcohols to inactivate viruses is heavily dependent on the surface properties of the microorganism isopropyl alcohol by nature lipophilic interacts favorably with enveloped viruses and disrupts their activity effectively the envelope layer of viruses mainly comprises lipid bilayers which causes the membrane to be sensitive to the chemical and physical conditions
35
 nonenveloped viruses are generally known to be more resilient to disinfectants compared to enveloped viruses and this includes alcohols studies have been shown that both alcohols are potent virucidal agents against enveloped viruses such as hepatitis b virus
34
 herpes virus
36
sarscov
37
 and human immunodeficiency virus hiv
38
 but not nonenveloped viruses such as hepatitis a virus
34
 and polio virus
39

although alcohols are effective in eradicating some types of viruses other disinfectants such as quaternary ammonium compounds qac glutaraldehyde and hydrogen peroxide quickly outshine its performance
30
 therefore disinfectants with alcohol as its main active ingredients are generally not used to disinfect critical equipment or environment in the healthcare settings
30
 the use of isopropyl alcohol is also limited as it only inactivates lipid viruses this greatly reduces the capabilities of alcohol as a broader use disinfecting agent because alcohols are flammable liquids large amounts of alcohol will increase the risks and dangers of it as a disinfecting agent the flash point of a higher concentration of alcohol solution is lower than that of a lower concentration
32
 
40
 according to boyce 70 ethyl alcohol has a flash point at 205c while the flash point of 30 ethyl alcohol is at 29c
32
 furthermore prolonged and repeated usage of alcohol compromises the integrity of materials such as plastics and dyes materials with constant exposure to alcohol may experience discoloration cracking and swelling due to the effects of alcohol another difficulty with the use of alcohol is that it evaporates quickly when exposed to air therefore reducing the contact time with the virus achieving maximum disinfection is difficult unless the tools are immersed in a bath for a period of timeeven though the capabilities of alcohol are limited the active is still commonly used in various disinfectant procedures it is imperative to note that together with other properties of alcohol its role as a disinfectant is still irreplaceable alcohols are often used as an effective disinfectant for thermometer noncritical tools and noninvasive probes in the hospital
30
 noncritical surfaces of medical instruments that are reusable are also disinfected with alcohol another advantage of using alcohol as a disinfectant is that it is user friendly alcohol solutions are nonstaining evaporates quickly low toxicity compared to other forms of disinfectant and have a mild acceptable odor these characteristics are critical in the healthcare settings as it contributes to the efficiency and the necessary sanitization in the systemquaternary ammonium compounds qacs form the main bulk of the cationic surfactants
52
 and they mostly inactivate viruses by solvating and disrupting lipid envelopes or membranes
46
 
53
 they are characterized by the presence of a cationic ammonium group which is the hydrophilic head
53
 the ammonium group has four organic substituents such as alkyl or heterocyclic groups forming the lipophilic tail and the charge is balanced by an anion such as a halide or sulfate
54
 some of the most common qacs found in household disinfectants include benzalkonium chloride
42
 didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride
46
 alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium saccharinate
55
 and cetyl pyridinium chloride
56
 figure 1 in addition to the common qacs a new generation of qacs has also been developed and they are referred to as twinchain or dialkyl quaternaries examples include didecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide
57
 and dioctyl dimethyl ammonium bromide
58
 they claim to retain virucidal activity better in hard water and also in the presence of anionic residues
59

qacs are attractive as they are relatively nontoxic colorless and odorless
60
 they are wellknown for inactivating enveloped viruses but their virucidal activity depends on concentration duration of application and temperature
42
 
61
 tsujimura et al evaluated the virucidal effect of three qacs namely benzalkonium chloride bzk mono bis trimethyl ammonium methylene chloridealkyl c915 toluene mbat and didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride dda
46
 it is found that the qacs require warmer temperatures to exhibit more significant virucidal properties
46
 
62
 the qacs at their highest recommended concentrations of 005 wv 002 wv and 002 wv respectively had no virucidal effect on enveloped equine herpesvirus type 1 after 10 min reaction time at 0c
46
 when the temperature is increased to room temperature the virucidal activity of the qacs is found to be dependent upon duration of reaction
46
 reaction times shorter than 1 min produced no virucidal effect while the minimum effective concentration mec at 5 min is mostly double that of the mec for a 10 min reaction
46
 mec is defined as the lowest concentration of the biocide that reduced the virus titer value by 9999 or greater as compared to control reactions
46
 this suggests that effective disinfection utilizing qacs is best achieved using warm water and longer reaction times
62

an advantage of utilizing qacbased disinfectants is their relatively high tolerance toward the presence of contaminating organic matter their ability to inactivate viruses is usually not diminished by the presence of organic matter
46
 
63
 as seen in other common disinfectants such as alcohol and chlorine based disinfectants
46
 tsujimura et al demonstrated that the virucidal effects of mbat and dda are unchanged by the addition of 5 fetal bovine serum fbs but the mec of bzk increased by four times when exposed to 5 fbs
46
 however in another study by rabenau et al
64
 the authors demonstrated that the virucidal effect of bzk based disinfectants against sars coronavirus is not significantly reduced by the presence of albumin or sheep erythrocytes the seemingly contrasting results might be attributed to the fact that bzk disinfectant formulations tested by rabenau et al contain other active ingredients like glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride too
64

qacs are regarded as lipophilic and target enveloped viruses by solvating their lipidbased envelope
17
 however nonenveloped viruses are mainly characterized as possessing a protein capsid which is hydrophilic
17
 thus qacs may have lower affinity and also lower disinfectant ability toward these viruses
17
 
43
 
65
 it is possible that the cationic moiety interacts with the protein capsid on the nonenveloped viruses and lead to viral inactivation
22
 
43
 
65
 romanowski et al investigated the virucidal effectiveness of benzalkonium chloride bzk against common human ocular types of adenovirus that are nonenveloped viruses
42
 the results suggest that the effectiveness of bzk varies with the virus and also concentration of bzk at the highest tested concentration of 01 bzk five adenoviruses are inactivated with virus titers 3log10 units while the remaining two adenoviruses are insufficiently inactivated with reduced titers 1log10 units but 3log10 units lower concentrations of bzk exhibited compromised ability to inactivate the adenoviruses in another study by wood and payne a formulation with a final bzk concentration of 02 wv is found to be effective against nonenveloped human coxsackie virus after 1 min of exposure but was ineffective toward inactivating other more resistant nonenveloped viruses like poliovirus and human adenovirus under the same conditions
22
 the same bzk formulation is also found to inactivate only some of the enveloped virus like the herpes simplex virus but failed to inactivate other enveloped viruses like human immunodeficiency virus and human coronavirus after 1 min of exposure
22
 this shows that the virucidal effects of qacs are highly dependent upon the specific virus and the conditions of exposure to achieve virus inactivation needs to be tailoredsodium laureth sulfate nlauroylsarcosine and sodium linear alkylbenzene sulfonate figure 2 are some common anionic surfactants present in detergent and personalcare products such as soaps shampoos and toothpaste
66
 and they have been demonstrated to be effective disinfectants towards a range of viruses
48
 
67
 in the study by tsujimura et al the authors demonstrated that the disinfection ability of sodium linear alkylbenzene sulfonate las against enveloped equine herpesvirus type 1 is dependent upon duration temperature and organic matter contamination
46
 las is able to effectively inactivate equine herpesvirus type 1 at 0c when applied at 005 concentration for 10 min the minimum effective concentration mec is reduced by four times when the temperature is raised to room temperature for 10 min however when the duration is shortened to 1 min the mec rose to 005 in addition mec value at room temperature and 10 min reaction duration increased by two times in the presence of 5 contaminating fbsalthough the main mode of disinfection by surfactants is usually via solvating the lipid envelopes of viruses
17
 surfactants like sodium laureth sulfate sls that possess strongly hydrophilic heads have a different disinfection mechanism as compared to a more hydrophobic surfactant like nlauroylsarcosine ls
43
 the interaction between sls and viruses is dominated by ionic interactions instead of hydrophobic interactions
43
 sls thus solubilizes liposomal membranes at a slow rate but bind rapidly to the protein component of ca2atpase membranes causing unfolding and extraction of the proteins
43
 the viral penetration into cells can be divided into three stages the first being the initial attachment of the virus to the cell surface heparin sulfate followed by forming stable attachment to the heparin sulfate and then fusion of the virus with the cell membrane leading to penetration of the virus into the cell
43
 piret et al report that sls and ls reduce viral infection of cells by interfering with different steps of the viral penetration process
43
 incubating enveloped herpes simplex virus with ls reduced the first stage initial binding to cells while sls functioned by disrupting the fusion process between the viral envelope and cell membrane as ls reduces the initial binding of the virus to cells the virucidal effectiveness of ls requires the preincubation of the virus with ls in order to prevent future viral binding to cells the lack of a preincubation period significantly reduced the virucidal effectiveness of ls on the other hand as sls does not reduce initial viral binding to cells the virucidal effects of sls is less reliant upon preincubation of the virus with sls moreover it is also shown that sls can exhibit viral inactivation effects on viruses already firmly attached to cells due to the complementary mechanisms of disinfection the authors suggested synergistic combination of sls and ls in a single formulation in addition the authors also note that the presence of contaminating organic matter reduced the disinfectant ability of both sls and ls and consequently concentrations 5 and 25 times higher respectively are required to achieve viral inactivationnonionic surfactants are commonly used as emulsifiers and can be classified by the type of bonds between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments
44
 
68
 
69
 the connecting bonds are commonly amide ether etherester or ester bonds
44
 
69
 
70
 nonoxynol9 nonylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol triton x100 pdiisobutylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol and brij97 polyoxyethylene 10 oleyl ether are nonionic surfactants containing ether bonds figure 3ac while onyxol 345 nnbis2hydroxyethyldodecanamide contains amide linkages
44
 
70
 figure 3d examples of nonionic surfactants containing ester bonds are such as span20 sorbitan monolaurate and span80 sorbitan monooleate
44
 figure 3ef lastly tween20 polysorbate20 and tween80 polysorbate80 are nonionic surfactants containing etherester linkages
44
 figure 3gh these nonionic surfactants inactivate viruses by solvating the viral envelope and disrupting the nucleocapsid
44
 their viral disinfectant ability is highly associated with the type of linkages between their hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments
44
 nonionic surfactants with ether and amide linkages have high virucidal effectiveness while those containing ester and etherester linkages are much weaker at inactivating viruses when tested under the same conditions
44
 however the high virucidal activity of the ether and amide containing nonionic surfactants also corresponded to high cytotoxicity and would thus require high dilution factors
44

zwitterionic surfactants are molecules bearing both cationic and anionic charges but with an overall neutral charge
71
 their virucidal activity is less investigated but they may possess interesting properties crawford et al demonstrated that a zwitterionic detergent empigen bb an alkylbetaine based on a c12c14 alcohol is able to inactivate influenza a and b but still retain the biological activity of the surface haemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na antigens
45
 the authors proposed that the mechanism of disinfection by the zwitterionic detergent is via viral disruption instead of solubilizing the surface proteins as cationic anionic and nonionic surfactants do
45
 
72
 this special ability to inactivate viruses but retain the biological activity of their surface antigens allows the zwitterionic detergent to be utilized during the development of vaccines
45

sodium hypochlorite the active ingredient in household bleach is a strong oxidizing agent it dissolves in water to form hypochlorous acid which can be reduced to form water and the chloride anion the hypochlorous acid molecule can react with peptide bonds and thiol groups chemically oxidizing proteins and other biomolecules and abolish function
74
 the efficacy of disinfection decreases with an increase in ph likely due to the decreased proportion of hypochlorous acid group present
75

sodium hypochlorite is fast acting and is effective at low concentrations at 10 ppm available chlorine sodium hypochlorite is able to inactivate bacteriophage pao1 within 30 s and further characterization studies showed that a large number of structural components were damaged or deformed by the treatment generally it was found that the extent of damage was proportional to the concentration of sodium hypochlorite and the contact time
24
 sodium hypochlorite at 05 5000 ppm could inactivate ebola surrogate bacteriophage phi6 with 10 min contact time on a stainless steel surface but not a nitrile surface
28
 sodium hypochlorite was able to inactivate adenovirus together with 5 serum at a concentration of 1900 ppm with 1 min contact time achieving a mean log10 reduction of infectivity of 487
76

sodium hypochlorite can be used for difficult to disinfect nonenveloped viruses such as noroviruses sodium hypochlorite could inactivate norwalk virus a type of norovirus at a concentration of 160 ppm after 30 s exposure as quantified by rtpcr
77
 sodium hypochlorite could also inactivate the norovirus surrogates feline calicivirus and murine norovirus to greater than a 5 log10 reduction of infectivity with a concentration of 2700 ppm and 1 min
78
 sodium hypochlorite at 05 concentration with 1 min contact time was able to deactivate the hepatitis a virus while another oxidizing agent peracetic acid was unable to do so
79

sodium hypochlorite at high concentrations of 1000 ppm is regularly used for clinical disinfection however it has an odor and can be irritating to mucous membranes at high concentrations less concentrated hypochlorous acid solutions are less stable to environmental factors such as temperature and light and the oxidizing potential can be used up by impurities
80
 in terms of application a concentrated stock of 5 sodium hypochlorite that is more stable is typically recommended to be diluted 100 to 005 before use so as to mostly avoid the downsides of concentrated sodium hypochlorite during the disinfection process the most common oxidizing agent disinfectant in the united states is aqueous solutions of 525615 sodium hypochlorite also known as household bleach
81

sodium hypochlorite is sensitive to the presence of organic material and a significantly higher concentration is required to achieve the same disinfectant efficacy while 100 ppm sodium hypochlorite can effectively disinfect a clean surface of hiv1 virus in 30 s the activity is reduced in the presence of organic material a higher concentration of 500 ppm and 12 min is required in the presence of 80 serum and around 10000 ppm 1 is required in the presence of 80 blood
82
 sodium hypochlorite at 50 ppm was found to disinfect hiv in saline alone but a 50fold higher concentration of 2500 ppm was required to disinfect in the presence of 10 plasma and 5000 ppm 1 was required in the presence of blood
83
 in a review guidance for clinicians noncritical surfaces that are contaminated with blood or other tissues are suggested to be cleaned first to remove organic material before spot decontaminating with sodium hypochlorite solution
84

compared to sodium hypochlorite sodium dichloroisocyanurate has disinfectant activity that persists for longer is more tolerant to the presence of organic material and has a higher disinfectant efficacy overall sodium dichloroisocyanurate could inactivate the bacteriophage phi6 an ebola surrogate at 05 concentration in 10 min on multiple different surfaces while sodium hypochlorite could not inactivate sufficiently on nitrile surface
28
 sodium dichloroisocyanurate at 50 ppm was found to disinfect hiv in saline alone but a 50fold higher concentration of 2500 ppm was required to disinfect in the presence of 10 plasma and 5000 ppm 05 was required in the presence of blood
83
 sodium dichloroisocyanurate at 10000 ppm shows disinfectant activity in the presence of 70 serum while sodium hypochlorite only shows similar activity in presence of 20 serum
85
 this is postulated to be because only 50 of the total chlorine is in the available hypochloritehypochlorous acid component form that can be neutralized by serum while the rest of the chlorine can be progressively pushed toward hypochloritehypochlorous acid to maintain the chemical equilibriumhydrogen peroxide is a strong broad spectrum inactivation agent it decomposes to form water oxygen and the highly reactive hydroxyl free radicals which can cleave or crosslink a large range of biomolecules including proteins nucleic acids and lipids
17
 a 13 solution with a 5 min contact time was able to inactivate to greater than 5 log10 reduction both the enveloped virus herpes simplex virus and the nonenveloped virus poliovirus showing a similar broad spectrum virucidal activity
86
 an accelerated hydrogen peroxidebased ahp disinfectant at a concentration of 05 and a contact time of 1 min showed a log10 reduction in infectivity of over 4 for both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses including hiv coronavirus 229e poliovirus and rotavirus wa
87
 the ahp solution at concentration 05 was tested with another set of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses and showed effective inactivation of the enveloped sindbis virus and nonenveloped reovirus within 5 min
88

hydrogen peroxide was also effective against noroviruses although at generally higher concentrations than sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 018 and 5 min contact time the ahp disinfectant was able to inactivate feline calicivirus and at 35 and 10 min contact time the ahp disinfectant was able to inactivate surrogate murine norovirus to greater than 5log10 reduction
78
 a 21 liquid hydrogen peroxide solution with 10 min exposure could inactivate murine norovirus and bacteriophage phi x174 on stainless steel surfaces by 4 log10 units
89
 a disinfectant comprising of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid could inactivate surrogate feline calicivirus by 999 at an effective peroxide concentration of 01 and 15 min contact time
90

even when reused a 7  solution with a contact time of 5 min was able to show an almost 5 log10 reduction in infectivity of poliovirus showing that some disinfectant activity was still present
91
 a sonicated hydrogen peroxide system with a cartridge containing hydrogen peroxide at 315 and 2 min contact time showed that it could attain a mean log10 reduction of 520 for human papillomavirus hpv
92

peracetic acid decomposes in an analogous manner to form the highly reactive hydroxyl free radicals as well as acetic acid and oxygen
93
 peracetic acid at 02 could inactivate adenovirus 8 in hard water in 5 min with a mean log10 reduction of infectivity of 475
76
 peracetic acid at 023 and at a contact time of 15 min could reduce the infectivity of coliphage ms2 by greater than 3 log10 units there was much more effective deactivation as compared to hydrogen peroxide tested under the same setup
94
 peracetic acid at a low concentration of 85 ppm 00085 and contact time of 1 min could reduce the infectivity of a murine norovirus surrogate by 3 log10 units in suspension and reduced virus infectivity on surfaces of fruits and vegetables by 4 log10 units
73
 a peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxidebased disinfectant at an effective peroxide concentration of 01 and contact time of 15 min could reduce infectivity of feline calicivirus a norovirus surrogate by 4 log10 units in the absence of feces while a higher concentration of 2 was required in the fieldlike conditions with feces as organic material impurity
90
 powder forms of peracetic acid at 05 concentration and 15 min contact time could reduce the infectivity of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus by more than 9999 4 log10 units
95
 these forms of peracetic acid were developed to provide higher stability and which could be dissolved in situ to form the disinfectant solutionpovidone iodine is an example of an iodophor which is a mixture of elemental iodine and a carrier polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone in this case the carrier polymer has no virucidal activity on its own
96
 iodine the active and powerfullyvirucidal agent exists as a complex mixture of many species eg i2 i i3
 io io3
 at equilibrium in water but aqueous iodine solutions can be cytotoxic and cause irritancy
97
 hence the polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer entraps the various iodinecontaining species by hydrogen bonding figure 5a providing a reservoir of iodine for its sustained release in small doses at a time maintaining its virucidal properties for prolonged periods while decreasing toxicity povidoneiodine is a broadspectrum virucidal agent manufactured in formulations containing 7510 iodophor in solution and are used in clinical applications such as sterilizing agents for pre and postoperation skin cleaning in surgical swabs scrubs and ointments as well as everyday products including antiseptic handwashes mouthwashes and gargles that contain lower concentrations of the iodophor
98
 povidoneiodine is not suitable for use with silicone products such as silicone catheters as iodine can cause accelerated deterioration of the material
99
 the iodophor is capable of inactivating  40 reduction of log10 viral infectivity a large range of viruses which include the enveloped coronaviruses influenza a
100
 and vaccinia virus as well as nonenveloped polyomavirus and adenovirus
101
 within 1 minute table 3 for the mostresistant nonenveloped polioviruses however aqueous formulations of povidoneiodine betaisodona  solution containing 11 available iodine required at least an hour for reduction of infectivity of  40log10 units in contrast alcoholcontaining povidoneiodine formulations eg betaseptic mundipharma containing 10 available iodine and ca 40 2propanol and 40 ethanol could inactivate these polioviruses within 5 min
101
 owing to the synergistic virucidal activity of the iodophor and the alcohols although it is generally safe and more effective in inactivating viruses than many other antiseptic agents eg benzalkonium chloride chlorhexidine digluconate
102
 povidoneiodine may cause thyroid dysfunction with longterm prolonged use
103
 as well as allergic contact dermatitis
104
 necessitating careful medical monitoringthe origins of the broad virucidal efficiencies of povidoneiodine has still yet to be fully elucidated and is likely to occur by multiple mechanisms reducing the likelihood of chance viral mutations conferring resistance there is evidence that iodine can block the receptors of the virus responsible for attachment to the host cell surface
100
 furthermore iodine can inhibit the activity of viral enzymes eg neuraminidase essential for virus release from host cells preventing its spread to other uninfected cells
98
 for enveloped viruses it has also been suggested that virus membrane can be destabilized by the reaction of iodine with the unsaturated cc bonds of membrane fatty acids
105

chlorhexidine is a broadspectrum cationic bisguanide biocide figure 5b found in many antiseptic products an active ingredient in handwashes mouthwashes and oral gels eg corsodyl disinfectants and preservatives chlorhexidine has generally low irritability good substantivity on skin and rapid bactericidal activity however its activity is highly dependent on its formulation being reduced by the presence of organic matter including serum as well as anionic surfactants and phospholipids
106
 as well as being phdependent
17
 compared to bacteria its virucidal activity is more variable and significantly less effective and sloweracting than povidoneiodine generally chlorhexidine is ineffective against nonenveloped viruses polio and adenoviruses but shows variable potency for inactivating enveloped viruses eg herpes simplex virus influenza a cytomegaloviruses and hepatitis b virus table 3 against human coronavirus hcov299e however chlorhexidine showed limited effectiveness with a 10 mm solution showing only a 3 log10 reduction after 1 hour
107
 mechanistically the viral inhibition of chlorhexidine has been proposed to arise from interactions with surface glycoproteins on enveloped viruses which may reduce the activity of viral enzymes such as dna polymerase enzymes for the hepatitis b virus
108
 this chlorhexidinereceptor binding is suggested to account for its effectiveness albeit slow against rotaviruses
109
 which are nonenveloped viruses containing surface glycoproteins that allow host cell infectionchloroxylenol also known as parachlorometaxylenol pcmx figure 5c is a halogenated phenolictype antiseptic used as the key active ingredient in dettol commonlyused for household disinfectants wound cleaning and for disinfecting surgical equipment it is most effective against bacteria but its virucidal activity is variable a 1998 study of chloroxylenol against a number of human viruses found it to be effective against the enveloped viruses herpes simplex 1 and hiv table 3 but was practically ineffective against the nonenveloped polioviruses adenoviruses and coxsackie virus as well as the enveloped human coronavirus atcc vr759
22
 however a later study using the murine hepatitis virus as a surrogate for the sars coronavirus found it to be highly effective 450 log10 reduction within a 30 s contact time
111
 in spite of its widespread commercial use for a long time surprisingly little is known about its mechanism of action against both bacteria and viruses chloroxylenol is generally safe to humans for external use but has been reported to cause irritant contact dermatitis and contact depigmentation
112

formaldehyde is the simplest aldehyde figure 6a and a powerful highlevel disinfectant with potent viral inactivation capabilities often sold as an aqueous solution called formalin it has been used to inactivate viruses for vaccine production
113
 and for scientific study
114
 as a highlevel disinfectant it can effectively and quickly inactivate many different types of viruses table 3 both in suspension and on surfaces by chemically alkylating the amino nh2 and sulfhydryl sh groups of proteins
115
 as well as the amino groups of nucleic acid bases eg adenine of dna and rna
116
 as these functional groups are more reactive at alkaline phs than acidic ph formaldehyde is most effective as an alkaline solution however its high reactivity renders its usage healthhazardous other than being a mutagen and suspected carcinogen
117
 it causes irritation of exposed body surfaces eg skin and eyes
118
 
119
 furthermore its pungent odour can be detected at concentrations lower than 1 ppm as a result other than usage in a wellventilated area strict regulations for human exposure govern its use as a disinfectant and sterilizing agent in hospitals and healthcare facilities and thus it is not used as a household disinfectant formaldehyde has been shown to be a sloweracting disinfectant than glutaraldehyde
17

like formaldehyde glutaraldehyde or sometimes known as glutardialdehyde figure 6b is a powerful broadspectrum disinfecting and sterilising agent which is highly effective against many viruses after short exposure times table 3 this dialdehyde is usually sold as an acidic solution but its reactivity can be switched on by making the solution alkaline at ph  75 in an alkaline solution glutaraldehyde has a limited shelflife and stability as its tendency to polymerise
120
 can reduce the number of reactive available free aldehyde groups essential for its virucidal activity to determine the reactivity of glutaraldehyde solutions chemical tests have been developed though the manufacturers instructions must be carefully adhered to for accurate results to be obtained
121
 in a similar manner as formaldehyde the aldehyde linkages of glutaraldehyde can react with the reactive groups on proteins rna and dna however as a dialdehyde its two reactive functional groups can form inter and intramolecular crosslinks with these biomolecules that destroys their activity
122
 for instance glutaraldehyde inactivates the hepatitis a virus and enteroviruses by reacting with lysine residues on their surfaces
123
 reactions with capsid proteins are also proposed to account for its virucidal effectiveness against polioviruses
124
 
125

glutaraldehyde solution 20 is usually used to decontaminate surgical equipment endoscopes and dialyzers in clinical settings but it needs to be used in a wellventilated setting by trained personnel due to its strong and unpleasant odour although not suspected to be carcinogenic
126
 it is known to cause dermatitis and irritation to mucous membranes in eyes nose and mouth
127
 due to these reasons it is not used as a household disinfectant generally metals rubber plastics and lensed instruments are tolerant to glutaraldehyde though it has been recommended not to be used to disinfect noncritical surfaces due to its cost
128

orthophthalaldehyde or 12dicarboxybenzaldehyde figure 6c is another highlevel disinfectant like both formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde its virucidal properties stem from its reactions to crosslink reactive groups of proteins and nucleic acids although it is a less potent crosslinking agent than glutaraldehyde this deficit is made up for by its more lipophilic aromatic nature which enhances its uptake by the lipid membrane and has even shown faster bactericidal activity than glutaraldehyde
129
 while opas bactericidal properties are welldocumented
130
 its efficacies against viruses is less well established table 3 a study in 2006 using stainless steel careers showed that a 055 opa solution could gave 484 log10 reduction in adenovirus 8 after 1 min exposure
131
 03 and 05 opa solutions gave  3 log10 reduction in the respective infectivities of surrogate hepatits b and c viruses on glass surfaces after a 1 min exposure
132
 to assess the effectiveness of opa against coronaviruses a study using the surrogate mouse hepatitis virus on stainless stell surfaces showed 17 log10 reduction in infectivity after 1 min contact with 055 opa
133
 however the same concentration of opa was found to be ineffective against a suspension of human papillomavirus type 16 after a 45 min incubation
134
 there us a current dearth of studies on the effectiveness of opa against suspended viruses and more studies are required to establish the general virucidal efficicacy of opa against a wider variety of virusesopa has numerous advantages over glutaraldehyde first it is chemically stable between ph 3 and 9 and does not require any further activation prior to usage second it does not have a strong perceivable odour and does not irritate the skin eyes or nasal mucosa
135
 as a result exposure monitoring is not required for its usage unlike glutaraldehyde furthermore its excellent material compatibility
129
 allows its usage as a disinfectant in many clinical settings such as for endoscopes
135
 
136
 and urological instruments however opa can stain exposed skin grey and hence has to be rinsed off with copious quantities of water or used with personal protective equipment eg gloves and eye protection for this reason it is not used as a common household disinfectantcommonly used in a variety of skincare products to treat dermatological issues such as acne essential oils were known to be both topically safe and able to combat a variety of skinassociated pathogens yet their explored germicidal activities are mostly bacteriarelated and hence cannot be directly extrapolated into effective disinfection of all viruses
147

in terms of research into the antiviral or viral inhibiting efficacies of common essential oils several oils have been proven effective against select viruses such as the herpes simplex virus type1 or the bovine viral diarrhea virus
148
 the operative mechanism of action however varies greatly between the different essential oils and depending on the stage of inactivation render them effective against only certain specific strains
149

through the study of star anise oil and some essential oil constituents for example it was identified that the oil itself as well as the specific compounds transanethole farnesol and caryophyllene were capable of direct inactivation of the herpes virus potentially through the disruption of the virion envelope prior to host cell infection
149
 other reports indicate that antiviral activities of essential oils do happen through similar mechanisms including the virucidal effects of sesquiterpenes against various enveloped viruses
150
 and the inhibitive effects of eugenol against the herpes simplex virus
151
 due to the lack of research investigating the specific virucidal actions of these compounds against the selected viruses it is unsafe to assume that effective sanitization can occur broadly over all recommended types of essential oils when considering several of the aforementioned cases as examples most of which act upon the virion envelope it is possible to conclude that they would be rendered ineffective in the disinfection of nonenveloped virus speciesat the same time it is also important to note that their purported antiviral activities may not be directly relevant to the purposes of sanitization or disinfection antiviral activities such as the inhibition of viral replication or gene expressions while potentially effective in the treatment of viral infections may not necessarily be what the user is expecting in terms of a topical or surface disinfectantthe development of global antimicrobial resistance due to the overprescription of antibiotics is indicative of their high exposure to the public community this could potentially allow for growth in public sentiment with regards to the belief that antibiotics are capable of treating a variety of diseases including those caused by various viruses an early survey of the public in the netherlands showed that almost half of the population incorrectly believed in the ability of antibiotics in treating infections caused by viruses in the same study 909 believed in the need for antibiotic treatment when faced with pneumonia and another study in a different area reported a 942 of the population sharing this belief
152
 
153
 this set of patient beliefs could have a negative impact on the decisions of healthcare professionals due to the pressure of catering to patient demands even though it was shown to have no effect on the patient recovery and satisfaction
154

in fact statistical evidence has shown that the inappropriate use of antibiotics prescribed by medical professionals has been observed to be high even up till recent years where it was estimated that up to 30 of antibiotic prescriptions among outpatients may have been inappropriate
155
 this could have potentially stemmed from a variety of reasons including perceived patient expectation
154
 and misdiagnoses due to the similarities in the manifestations of clinical symptoms
156
 as such the correction of patient beliefs is still fundamental in the prevention of antibiotic overuse in such clinical settingsthere has been a long history of the employment of ultraviolet light in the elimination of microbial pathogens whereupon its efficacy has been regarded highly enough for it to see use even in the disinfection in the laboratory and healthcare settings
157
 it can thus be anticipated that there will be the resulting perpetuation of the notion that uvgi will be an effective agent in the combating of viruses while this belief does hold merit it is important to examine the restrictive conditions under which this does hold truefirst as the efficacy of uvgi is dependent on the absorption by the target dna which has a maximum absorption wavelength of 260 nm microorganisms have been found to be selectively vulnerable to the exposure to light at wavelengths specifically at or in close range of 2537 nm
158
 when tested against the strain of bacteriophage virus x174 it was shown that the wavelength could be increased to up to 280nm without significant reduction of virucidal efficiency but a significant decrease was observed upon the increase to 301 nm
159

second it has been shown that the germicidal activity of uvgi is compliant with the bunsenroscoe reciprocity law where it was established that the efficiency of inactivation is dependent on uv dose which is the product of uv intensity mwcm2 and exposure time seconds
160
 the resulting implications in the translation into application mean that upon a reduction of uv intensity the virucidal action of uvgi can be compensated through the increase of exposure time
161
 when tested for four different strains of airborne bacteriophages ssrna ms2 atcc 15597b1 ssdna x174 atcc 13706b1 dsrna phi 6 with envelope lipid atcc 21781b1 and dsdna t7 atcc 11303b1 it was reported that the required uvgi dose required was approximately increased twofold when attempting to increase 90 inactivation to 99 inactivation
162
 in the same study it was also observed that certain strains of viruses were more vulnerable to uvgi than others the uvgi doses required were in increasing order 339423 wscm2 for ssrna 444494 wscm2 for ssdna 662863 wscm2 for dsrna and 9101196 wscm2 for dsdna
162
 a similar ranking was reported when it came to observing the sensitivities of similar virus classes on a surface medium as opposed to aerosol
158
 the susceptibility of viruses to this method was thought to be dependent on several factors such as physical size molecular weight dna conformation repair enzyme and chromophore presence clumping propensity etc which could all affect the uv dose required
163

as such while there is a high potential for uvgi to serve as a virucidal technique and even solar radiation to play a major role in environmental virucidal activity under appropriate conditions
164
 it is important to consider the set of circumstances under which these are truea popular dietary supplement vitamin c has had a history of being recommended in popular literature for the purposes of treating respiratory infections
165
 while earlier studies have demonstrated its ability to prevent and alleviate the symptoms of virusinduced respiratory infections its mechanism of action as well as its virucidal potency were not examined
165

prior to this vitamin c was the subject of various studies that investigated and concluded on its potential to inactivate the poliomyelitis virus under in vivo settings but the route of its administration was either through injections
166
 or nasal instillation
167
 it was however reported that in this case the dosage required was sufficiently low to be achieved via supplementation
168
 another in vivo study of viral inactivation involving the herpes virus also was achieved via injection
169
 apart from these various other studies involving different virus strains such as rabies
170
 and enteroviruses
171
 have reported in vitro viral inactivationthe sum of gathered literature so far suggests however that the desired properties of ascorbic acid are achieved mainly through a combination of its ability to inactivate the virus inhibit intracellular virus replication as well as the other beneficial effects of the vitamins which in turn render it capable of alleviating the severity of a range of virusrelated diseases
168
 while indicative of the potential of the use of vitamin c to supplement medical therapy this does not necessarily imply its potency as a virucidal disinfecting agentthe basis of some of these myths stems from their common association with antimicrobial properties garlic is commonly associated with fairly broadspectrum antimicrobial effects exhibiting antibacterial antifungal antiviral and even antiprotozoal activities its constituents that render it effective against viruses have been discovered to include allicin diallyl trisulfide and ajoene
172
 
173
 it has displayed antiviral effects against a variety of viruses including influenza a and b rhinovirus hiv herpes simplex 2 cytomegalovirus viral pneumonia and rotavirus
174
 in specifically considering its virucidal range garlic has been shown to be effective against herpes simplex virus type 1 and the parainfluenza virus type 3
173
 the virucidal effects of garlic and its active compounds do not cover the entire range of virus strains and they have been shown to be ineffective against certain types such as the coxsackievirus
175
 high concentrations of garlic extract have also been shown to be toxic to cells therefore caution is advised when garlic is attempted to be used
175
 thus prior to turning to garlic as a viable alternative to conventional disinfectants it is imperative to consider the strain of microbes to be eliminated as well as whether garlic can be applied in a safe yet effective mannerapart from the aforementioned there have also been various other myths circulating in the online community with regards to the prevention of the infections especially with the case of the latest covid19 pandemic leading to the need for the clarification that has been conducted by the who and the official media of various countries as mentioned in the previous segment another commonly perpetuated belief is the inability of rinsing of the nose with saline solution or gargling with salt water to treat viral infections possibly due to its location of action this is commonly associated with the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections and has a historical basis in the ancient practices from india
176

upon investigation of its in vivo efficacy it was shown that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation was capable of reducing the duration of illness by 22 over the counter medicine use by 36 and illness in household members by 35 thirty percent more individuals also saw a reduction in viral shedding by 05 log10 per day which could serve as a reason for the lowered transmission rates
176
 the result shown however was not necessarily always positive as some studies into the hypertonic saline nebulization of children with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis showed no significant alleviation of their symptoms
176

the studies regarding saline solutions thus far however have mostly been investigations into its clinical effects which while somewhat suggestive of its potential in symptom reduction are not sufficient to prove if it does possess virucidal behavior for disinfection purposescyclodextrins cds are naturallyoccurring macrocyclic molecules comprising of 7 covalentlyjoined glucopyranose units possessing a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic interior cavity which can encapsulate nonpolar molecules in water a family of sulfonated cds was recently studied for their virucidal activities figure 7a which differed in the length of the flexible alkyl groups between the anionic sulfonate groups cd1 and cd2 as well as rigidity of the spacer unit cd3
177
 cd1 displayed broadspectrum virucidal activity against many viruses from different families including from herpes simplex virus type 2 hsv2 respiratory syncytial virus types a and b human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza virus type a while being ineffective against enterovirus d68 and influenza virus h3n2 the long alkyl linker of cd1 appeared to be the key to its high virucidal activity giving complete hsv2 inactivation within 15 minutes and whose virucidal activity was not affected by dilution compared to cd1 a shorter linker in cd2 and a more rigid one in cd3 made the cyclodextrin derivatives less effective it was proposed that cd1s best virucidal activity against hsv2 stemmed from its ability to bind to most numbers of glycoprotein b found on the viral surface blocking the proteins fusion loop and induces conformational changes to these proteinsin addition to cyclodextrin derivatives macrocyclic calix4arene derivatives also showed promising virucidal activities 13bisbithiazolyltetraparasulfonatocalix4arene c4sbtz figure 7b was shown to show better virucidal activities against human coronavirus hcov229e than the frequently used antiseptic chlorhexidine chx section 35
107
 firstly c4sbtz were not cytotoxic towards l132 cells whereas chx and hxm showed notable toxicities with ic50 values of 43  106 and 38  105 moll respectively in addition c4sbtz demonstrated a faster virucidal rate as compared to chx
107
 at a concentration of 103 moll a 5 minincubation of hcov229e with c4sbtz reduced viral titers by 27 log10 units as compared to just 14 log10 reduction for the same concentration and duration of chxinterestingly some compounds found in food were found to exhibit virucidal activities cinnamaldehyde an organic compound that is responsible for cinnamons flavor and odor was effective against norovirus surrogates and hepatitis a virus
178
 carvacrol a natural monoterpene derivative of cymene also known as a natural food additive was found to inactivate two norovirus surrogates completely at a concentration of only 05
179
 the grape seed extract was also shown to reduce the hepatitis a virus and feline calicivirus on infected lettuce and pepper after a minute of incubation
180
 these edible food extracts could be potentially used as virucidal agents in selfsanitizing food packaging applicationssilver and its salts have had a long history of use as antiseptics and disinfectants and their broadspectrum biocidal properties are well established
181
 silver dihydrogen citrate for instance can reduce the infectivity of feline calicivirus a surrogate for the human norovirus which causes diarrhea and vomiting by  4 log10 units after 1 and 30 min in suspension and on glass surfaces respectively
182
 silver nanoparticles agnps are a class of silver nanomaterials and are defined as dispersions of silver particles between 10 and 100 nm in size generally agnps are effective biocides in small doses
183
 although their potential toxicities to humans are still under intense debate
184
 
185
 modern methods have enabled agnps of welldefined shapes particle sizes and polydispersity to be synthesized
186
 which are important parameters that dictate their eventual biocidal activities biological fate and toxicity
187

the virucidal properties of agnps are still largely unexplored but initial reports are encouraging agnps can inhibit viruses by a number of mechanisms including binding to and interacting with viral surface proteins
185
 as well as denaturing enzymes by reacting with amino carboxyl imidazole and sulfhydryl groups
188
 in a study using 3050 nm agnps surfacecoated with polyvinylpyrrolidone against various strains of hiv1 the agnps were found to bind onto surface glycoproteins gp120 and chemically modifies it by denaturing its disulfidebonded domains
189
 this prevents the virus from binding to receptor proteins on potential host cells which are necessary for viral entry and infection dilute agnp solutions could elicit significant virucidal activity as inhibition of 50  of viral infectivity could be attained at agnp concentrations of  091 mgml compared to commonlyused biocidal silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine the agnps were found to be more effective against the hiv1 strains suggesting that the release of ag0 atomic clusters from the agnps is more potent virucide than ag itself such destruction of viral surface glycoproteins has also been suggested to account for the virucidal effects of agnps against the influenza virus
190
 agnps have also been incorporated into polymer films comprising of poly 3hydroxybutyrateco3hydroxyvalerate a biopolymeric material which achieved the dual function of stabilizing the agnps and bringing about virucidal behavior against norovirus surrogates
191
 agnpcontaining products are appearing increasingly in the market including clothing wounddressings ointments and food packaging materials
192
 whose biocidal activities are a result of slow sustainedrelease of the silver nanomaterials however it should be noted that like all disinfecting agents aforementioned the virucidal efficacies of agnps differ from virus to virus furthermore the quantities shapes size and types of silver nanomaterials released depend on their realworld settings and applications
193
 all of which affects their virucidal properties thus the effectiveness of these agnpcontaining products against viruses in reallife settings as well as their toxicity towards humans need to be carefully evaluated and studiedother than agnps gold nanoparticles aunps are also promising virucidal agents aunps synthesized using garlic extract with an average size of 6 nm showed virucidal activity against the measles virus by also binding to surface viral receptors and preventing subsequent host cell binding and infection
194
 however due to the cost of the gold chemical precursors aunps are unlikely to become cheap and commercially widely available disinfecting agentsthe use of metal nanomaterials to form selfdisinfecting surfaces have gained traction in recent years as viruses can persist on contaminated surfaces for prolonged periods selfdisinfecting surfaces are capable of inactivating viruses in contact with them in situ reducing the chances of virus transmissions via human contact with contaminated surfaces in one design the selfdisinfecting surface was established with photoactive metal nanocrystals which required visible light stimulation for viral inactivation these surfaces fabricated from nanocrystals of cuinzn4s6 cizs with band gaps within the visible light range could absorb visible light and produce active oxidative species that inactivated the influenza a virus by oxidizing the amino acid residues presented on the viral envelope proteins figure 8 while highly virucidal visible light must be present to guarantee the selfsanitizing effect thereby limiting the practicality of the systempolymers capable of inactivating viruses are a new and exciting area of research a large number of polymers capable of killing bacteria and preventing their proliferation are known today
196
 but comparatively very few are known to be virucidal such polymers can 1 act as carriers for controlled release of bioactive virucidal molecules or 2 possess intrinsic viral inhibitory properties on their own due to the chemical functional groups present on the polymer structure compared to the former whose virucidal efficiencies are limited by diffusion and initial loadings of the bioactive agents through the polymer matrix the latter has the advantage of showing longterm activity furthermore these intrinsically viralinactivating polymers can be formulated or cast into various forms for customized applications such as disinfecting coatings binders in pharmaceutical products water purification filters and as additives in paper or common household materials for these reasons we discuss only intrinsicallyvirucidal polymers herethe vast majority of viraldeactivating polymers are charged in 2006 klibanov reported that hydrophobic polyethylenimine pei derivatives can inactivate enveloped viruses such as the influenza a virus
197
 cationic and zwitterionic possessing equal numbers of positive and negative charges pei derivatives figure 9a showed close to complete the virucidal activity in 5 min on the other hand much slower virus inactivation was reported for anionic pei reaching 89  virucidal activity only after 2 hr while the neutral derivative showed no virus inactivation notably an alcoholic solution of these polymers could be painted onto glass slides to form virucidal coatings the inactivation was proposed to arise from the interaction of the erect charged polymer tentacles with ionic sites within the hydrophobic lipid membranes of the influenza a virus a similar mechanism of action likely accounted for the virucidal activity of cationic pyridiniumtype polyvinylpyrrolidones figure 9b which damages the lipid envelop of influenza a and leads to virostasis
198
 pyridinium polymers with a high degree of chemical crosslinking which are insoluble in water are also effective in removing viruses from water
199

the lack of a lipid membrane in nonenveloped viruses eg adenoviruses necessitates a different strategy for inactivation the cationic quaternary phosphonium polymer in figure 10 achieves this by interacting with the binding fiber proteins on the virus preventing them from binding to cellular receptors necessary for entry into cells at aqueous concentrations as low as 100 ppm these noncytotoxic polymers have a virucidal efficiency of 865
200

in 2013 cationic chitosan derivatives figure 11 were shown to be highly potent for inhibiting the replication of human coronavirus hcovnl63 a common cold virus
201
 the combination of chitosan and the specific cationic quarternary ammonium substituent appears to be essential for its activity as unfunctionalized chitosan  and carrageenans and heparin were ineffective in vitro despite their ionic nature the chitosan derivatives bearing different degrees of substitution were also highly selective in their virucidal activity being effective against only murine hepatitis virus and a number of human coronaviruses hcovnl63 hcov229e hcovoc43 and hcovhku1
202
 their virus inhibition occurred from the formation of a complex with the s protein of the coronaviruses which prevents the viruses from binding to its cellular receptor for infectionairborne transmission of viruses is another major route of humantohuman transmissions and can occur in the form of aerosols a cutoff droplet size of  5 m is typically chosen
203
 these aerosol microdroplets settle slowly from the air and as long as the virus particles remain viable are respirable and can result in direct viral transmission to the alveolar region the airborne stability of viruses varies greatly and depends on relative humidity and temperature lower humidity is generally favorable for viruses with more lipids whilst viruses with low or no lipid content show stability at higher humidity
204
 the effects of humidity on virus stability is also dependent on temperature for instance lower temperatures can enhance the stability of nonenveloped rhinoviruses at high relative humidity
205
 airborne transmission is one of the major routes of transmission of the enveloped influenza a virus
206
 and has been implicated in sarscov1 superspreading events during the 20022004 outbreak
207
 a recent study has also revealed that the covid19causing sarscov2 virus possesses similar aerosol stabilities as the sarscov1 remaining viable for the 3hour duration of study
16
 furthermore given the high momentum of the multiphase turbulent gas cloud emitted from sneezing and coughing virusladen droplets may possibly be spread for distances larger than the 12 m recommended separation for sarscov2
208
 in fact sarscov2 virus particles were found in the ventilation systems of the hospital rooms housing covid19 patients in china
209
 clearly methods and disinfectants capable of disinfecting the air are thus valuable in limiting viral transmissions especially within indoor environmentsmethods for disinfecting indoor air is currently an active field of research though much more remains to be understood and no perfect solutions yet exist while uvgi can be effective and efficient in inactivating viruses in aerosols
210
 it can also lead to significant skin and eye discomfort
211
 photocatalyst silver iondoped tio2coated air filters
212
 and ionisers
213
 have also been recently studied and demonstrated to be effective in removing viable viruses from the air though they are not expected to be standalone solutions thus far very few chemical disinfecting agents have been studied for inactivating airborne virusesin 2016 the use of extremely low concentrations of chlorine dioxide clo2 was reported to inactivate airborne viruses
214
 using the model bacteriophage viruses ms2 and x174 001 and 002 ppm of clo2 could reduce the number of viable bacteriophages by  2 log10 units after 3 hours in an exposure chamber concentrations of clo2 lower than 01 ppm has been shown to show no human toxicity clo2 is a stable free radical and is a powerful oxidizing agent and can inactivate viruses by oxidizing a critical tryptophan residue in their binding site
215
 low concentrations of clo2 has been found to decrease the infection of mice exposed to aerosols of influenza a virus
216
 and instances of respiratory diseases in a japanese army base
217
 suggesting the possibility that the gas can control and limit airborne viral transmissions however more research to understand the longterm effects of clo2 exposure needs to be carried outthe various classes of disinfectantssanitizing agents inactivate viruses via different mechanisms and their potency against viruses is highly dependent upon the type of virus and application conditions such as concentration exposure duration temperature ph and organic load therefore knowledge of the target virus and careful control of the application conditions are crucial to achieve effective disinfection in general it is observed that disinfectantssanitizing agents like povidoneiodine aldehydes and oxidizing agents that inactivate viruses by chemically modifying their surface groups are fastacting and highly potent towards most viruses but their application is also often limited by their higher toxicity and damaging effects to surfaces
101
 
103
 
118
 
123
 on the other hand disinfectants like alcohols and surfactants that mostly rely on dissolving the lipid envelopes tend to only show potency towards a narrower range of viruses and may require longer exposure durations but are often more biocompatible
32
 
42
 an ideal disinfectantsanitizer would be one that is effective towards a broad range of viruses with fastaction and high potency but still suitable for longterm use exhibiting good biocompatibility and mild effects towards surfaces a potential direction may be to develop potent disinfectant agents from natural compounds
218
 as they may have less toxicity allowing the product to be childsafe
219
 and also safe for longterm usage new generation sanitizers with viral inactivation mechanisms that can enhance and balance broad disinfection efficacy with biocompatibility are thus likely to have good potential in becoming the preferred choice of consumersthe authors declare no conflicts of interestaccording to the available documents the most important way to transmit diseases especially in medical centers is by hands and now we know that more than 80 of infections are transmitted by touch as it has been documented normal human skin is colonized by different kind of bacteria with totally different aerobic counts ranging from 1  106 colony forming units cfucm2 on the scalp to 1  104 cfucm2 on the forearm this is while total bacterial counts on the hands of a health person is ranged from 39  104 to 46  106 cfucm2
1
 along with this the hands of some health care workers may become persistently colonized by some pathogenic flora such as staphylococcus aureus gramnegative bacilli or some other kind of microorganismsin the recent pandemic covid19 which is stands for coronavirus disease 2019 is introduced as the cause of world acute respiratory infection crisis and outbreak
2
 in this context public health guideline recommended by world health organization emphasized on frequent and correct washing hands with standard hand rubs to prevent transmission and reduce the spread of the mentioned pandemic diseases based on these protocols and recommendations use of alcoholbased hand rubs has become very common around the world although it is true that hand hygiene is the most important way to break the infection chain transmission but using proper solution with the standard formula should be consider strongly although handwashing with water and soup is the most recommended procedure but due to lack of access in some situations ethanolcontaining hand rubs are used frequently as a substitute for mentioned method in the recent crisis due to the fact that the consumption of hand rub solutions has greatly increased in the world several cases of related risks have been proposed which are discussed in this article so evaluation the alcohol concentrations should be considered in quality control procedures meticulous due to the fact that handwashing can be performed with different methods and compounds so this instruction should be considered and assay both in terms of behavior and the risk of production formula governments and health policy makers should encourage local production but monitoring the hand rub formulations to have enough efficiency and safetyanother problem about hand rubs is skin complications due to the excitement in the world and overuse the alcoholbased hand rubs have caused adverse effects on the skin of many people who used it frequently figure 1 demonstrates a contact dermatitis in two cases and an exacerbation of atopic dermatitis on the palm in a review study by cristina beiu et al it has been mentioned that frequent handwashing for covid19 prevention can cause hand dermatitis
2
 good hand hygiene helps prevent the transmission of infections such as covid19 but these preventive practices can also damage the skin it has been proved that frequent hygenization of hands make several changes in texture of skin these changes are ranged from development of cutaneous xerosis dryness up to irritant contact dermatitis icd and rarely allergic contact dermatitis acd these disorders are induced by different mechanisms such as physical chemical and immunological appearing hand dermatitis makes difficult situation to balance the dilemma of maintaining hand hygiene and preventing eczema flare based on these mechanisms properties of hand hygiene policy rub compounds quality and formula and used techniques are very important to be measured and must be considered based on the following circumstancesone of the most popular hands hygiene techniques according to the recent pandemic crisis related to covid19 is the use of gloves the remarkable thing about this is prolonged wearing medical gloves which have some side effects such as increased sweating and humidity of the hands and in the following increases the inflammatory responses and irritants which will be followed by fungal and bacterial skin infectionsrepeated use of soaps surfactants detergents or solvents due to their capacity to remove skin surface lipids damage to skin proteins denature epidermal keratin and even induce alteration of the cell membrane of keratinocytes can lead to icd and rarely to acdfrequent use of alcoholbased products can result in skin dryness and irritationin addition to the above and due to the recent crisis related to covid19 there are some other points that should be considered during executing the instructions
since the outbreak of covid19 although washing with warm water and soap remains the gold standard for hand hygiene but according to the structural characteristic of coronaviruses enveloped viruses with bilayer lipid alcoholbased products introduced as the most effective hand sanitizers in this crisis and due to the high volume of alcohol consumption a number of problems are emerging which if not controlled in a timely manner could create other crises for the general health of society one of the problems with alcoholic products is the production of hand rubs with nonstandard formulas for example it has been cleared that methanol is used instead of ethanol in some products while methanol itself is not a type of toxin but when adsorbed to the human body it metabolized by dehydrogenase enzymes into formaldehyde and formic acid these end products are toxic and may cause metabolic acidosis brain injury blindness cardiovascular instability and death
3
 
4
 methanol toxication most frequently results via oral industrial inhalation and transdermal routesone of the dangers of widespread use of alcoholic solutions in society especially by ordinary people is eliminating many skin normal florae that are very important for the health system and this is because those such compounds do not differentiate between foe and friend bacteria
5

another important point about alcohol products is its production based on the nonstandard formula especially situationbased protocols in standard alcoholbased hand sanitizers varying amounts 6080 most effective higher and less are not most effective and types of alcohols are used in these compounds isopropyl alcohol ethanol ethyl alcohol npropanol or a combination of two of these are used
6
 this group of sanitizers is found effective at killing many types of bacteria including grampositive and gramnegative types and also different virus families including influenza a virus rhinovirus hepatitis a virus hiv and coronaviruses however they have virtually no activity against bacterial spores protozoan oocysts and very poor activity against nonenveloped nonlipophilic viruses
7
 
8

although alcohols with the mentioned points are rapidly germicidal when applied but have no significant residual activity and regrowth of bacteria occurs after use of alcohol sanitizers for this reason some compounds such as chlorhexidine quaternary ammonium compounds octenidine or triclosan are added to alcoholbased formulations to increase persistent activity of hand rubs according to the recent crisis food and drug administration released a temporary compound producing guideline for certain alcoholbased hand sanitizer products during covid19 pandemic on march 14 2020 as the public health emergency

 based on such emergency instructions produced antiseptics solutions have not proper effect and cannot cover all introduced pathogens especially all kinds of nosocomial infections although this single alcoholbased sanitizers with no persistent compounds may be effective on the infectious agent causing the 2020 crisis sarscov2 according to its limited activity against certain groups of microorganisms this will cause selection pressure on ethanolresistant microorganisms this clonal selection especially in hospital settings will lead us to emerge and reemerge of some controlled microorganisms that will cause a new crisisthe authors declare no potential conflict of interestall authors drafted part of the manuscript and approved the final versionthe emergence of novel pathogens bacterial or viral have always posed serious challenges to public health around the globe one of these dangerous pathogens is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 more commonly known for causing coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 which has been declared a global pandemic by the world health organization in early 2020 since its discovery in december 2019 in wuhan there have been over three million confirmed cases worldwide by april 20201 with cases increasing exponentially around the world it has caused significant burden on all aspects of society despite aggressive isolation methods to prevent the spread of the virus currently therapeutic strategies to deal with covid-19 are only supportive making prevention aimed at reducing transmission the best methodone of many ways implemented to prevent the spread of this virus as with previous contagious pathogens is frequent and effective handwashing in both healthcare and community settings alcohol-based hand sanitizers have become a popular alternative to the traditional handwashing with soap and water alcohol based hand sanitizers have been utilized as an effective alternative to handwashing to prevent the spread of bacterial and viral infections making it one of the essential protocols in decreasing healthcare burden2

3 a range of hand sanitizers are available with various combinations of ingredients and modes of delivery given the popularity of hand sanitizers during this pandemic it is important to understand which types of hand sanitizers work best against this novel virus in this review we will discuss the role of various types of alcohol-based hand sanitizers in effective elimination of bacterial and viral pathogens with the focus on the effectiveness against enveloped viruses such as sars-cov-2viruses are relatively simple structural infectious agents with a minimum of two structural components first they contain genetic material such as dna or rna the genetic material inside viruses are either single stranded ssdna or ssrna or double stranded dsdna or dsrna the strands are also either positively or negatively sensed positive sense dna suggests it is directly translatable into protein if it were rna negative sense rna on the other hand is the complementary strand for messenger rna in order to protect and encapsulate the genetic material all viruses also contain a protein coat called a capsid viruses can then further be divided by the presence or absence of a lipid envelope which determines whether viruses are enveloped or non-enveloped despite being composed of various structural and functional elements that are common to many life forms such as genetic material and lipid envelopes viruses must have a host in order to replicate and hence are not typically described as living entitiesbacteria are single-celled living organisms that unlike viruses do typically survive without a host and are viewed as living agents the genetic material is freely floating dna and similarly to viruses bacteria lack nuclei like viruses bacteria are diverse in their structure they typically have an inner cell membrane and an outer cell wall though exceptions do exist peptidoglycan a component of the outer cell wall is a polymer consisting of sugars and amino acids bacteria contain varying thicknesses of peptidoglycan which partly explains whether bacteria stain purple or pink during the gram-stain procedure and thus determines the classification of gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria there is however bacteria that lack peptidoglycan and therefore do not stain these are known as atypical bacteriathere are two large categories of hand sanitizers 1 non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers nabhs and 2 alcohol-based hand sanitizers abhs the most common primary active ingredient of nabhs benzalkonium chloride a quaternary ammonium is a commonly used disinfectant4 disinfectants with benzalkonium chloride are generally less irritating than those with alcohol though more recent evidence suggests it may cause contact dermatitis more often than previously thought5 although abhs are less user-friendly on skin than nabhs abhs predominate in healthcare settings given their low cost and efficacy of reducing infectious transmission6 non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers however are less worrisome regarding their flammability and abuse potential6hand-sanitizer preparations containing alcohol on the other hand can include ethanol isopropyl alcohol n-propanol or a combination of these7 water as well as excipients and humectants solutions containing alcohols between 60 - 95 in volume are most prevalent and effective humectants are included to prevent skin dehydration and excipients help stabilize the product as well as prolong the time needed for the evaporation of alcohol thereby increasing its biocidal activity8the compound n-propanol is the most commonly used alcohol compound in biocides7 it is not known with much confidence the exact mechanism of alcohols antimicrobial activity however it may be related membrane damage and inhibition or uncoupling of mrna and protein synthesis through effects on ribosomes and rna polymerase9 or associated with protein denaturation7 for activity against bacteria its optimal bactericidal efficacy is achieved at concentrations between 60 to 9010 in fact absolute alcohol or alcohol that is no more than one percent water is less bactericidal than alcohol between the aforementioned range10 water is thus critical in the protein denaturation process no matter which process if not multiple are affected by alcohol essential metabolic pathways membrane damage and loss of cellular integrity ultimately occur7 it is important to note however that alcohols exhibit bactericidal activity against vegetative bacteria - those undergoing metabolism and binary fission - but not against spores11the viral targets of alcohol-based hand sanitizers are predominantly the viral envelope if present which is derived from host lipid envelopes the protein capsid which contains and protects the genetic material and the genetic material itself7 given that all these components are necessary for the viral life cycle eg attachment penetration biosynthesis maturation lysis and thus critical for its ability to transmit to another host it can be presumed that altering the structure or function of any of the aforementioned components will typically render the virus ineffectivewhile less is known regarding the specific mechanism of action of alcohols agents against viruses compared to bacteria it is understood that ethanols have a broader and stronger virucidal activity than propanols in fact high concentrations of ethanol has shown to be highly effective against enveloped viruses12 and thus is effective against the majority of clinically relevant viruses13 it is also interesting to note that adding acids to ethanol solutions can increase its efficacy against viruses that are more resistant to ethanol alone13

14 despite the potential synergy of ethanol and acidity it remains known that most hand sanitizers continue to be ineffective against non-enveloped viruses15similar to alcohol-based hand sanitizers benzalkonium chloride bc the primary ingredient of nabhs is generally not effective against non-enveloped viruses16

17 though a study demonstrating its efficacy against the non-enveloped human coxsackie virus suggest exceptions exist18 despite this exception it appears that the lipid envelope of either bacteria or viruses are critical structures for bcs effectivenessthe cationic headgroup of bc is progressively adsorbed to the negatively charged phosphate heads of phospholipids in the lipid bilayer and as a result increase in concentration19 the consistent increase of bc concentration results in reduced fluidity of the membrane and thus the creation of hydrophilic gaps in the membrane19 in addition the alkyl chain tail component of bc further perturbs and disrupts the membrane bilayer by permeating the barrier and disrupting its physical and biochemical properties19 protein function is subsequently disturbed and the combination of the aforementioned effects results in the solubilization of the bilayer constituents into bcphospholipid micelles19 bc also interrupts intercellular targets and compromises the conformational behavior of dna20traditionally bacteria on hands can be categorized as resident and transient floras common resident floras include staphylococcus aureus staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis which colonize deep layers of the skin and are resistant to mechanical removal21 on the other hand transient floras such as s aureus escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa colonize the superficial layers of skin21 there are also numerous bacterial strains that can be transmitted to the host from other sources that can potentially develop into a variety of bacterial infections abhs are very effective for quickly destroying many pathogens by the action of the aqueous alcohol solution without the need for water or drying with towels according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc alcohol-based hand sanitizers have excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity including multidrug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin resistant s aureus vancomycin resistant enterococcus22 specific in vitro studies show that hand sanitizers containing 60 to 80 ethanol produced 4- to 6-log reduction in 15 to 30 seconds against a range of bacterial and fungal species23 numerous studies have also documented in vivo antimicrobial activity from contaminated hands24

25 while different alcohol-based hand sanitizers all demonstrated antimicrobial effects against various gram-positive and negative bacteria using the kirby-bauer method which uses antibiotic-impregnated discs to test the susceptibility of strains propanol based sanitizers were more effective compared to ethanol with the greatest zone of inhibition4

21with increasing use of hand sanitizers as an infectious control measure it is also important to note any potential tolerance mechanisms from bacteria an in vitro alcohol tolerance assay using a lower concentration of isopropanol showed that newer isolates of e faecium were more alcohol-tolerant than their predecessors26 other similar studies on other pathogens have also demonstrated increasing tolerance when exposed to lower concentrations of alcohol27 tolerance is not only limited to alcohols but also exists for bc28

29 the presence of any selective pressure in environments encourage microbes to adapt and evolve resistance to such pressures and in the case of bc researchers have observed resistant strains that were able to survive certain concentrations of bc 01-04 since the 1960s30

31 given this tolerance to quaternary ammonium compounds is not a novel observation as time goes on and the use of both alcohol and bc continue in hand sanitizers and disinfectants it is inevitable that tolerance will only increase while future studies are conducted to determine novel mechanisms of tolerance it is essential to emphasize adherence to hand hygiene protocols that require adequate exposure volume and concentrations of hand sanitizers to minimize selective pressures and thus tolerancealthough viruses are more difficult to directly study in vivo compared to bacteria numerous studies have attempted to validate the effectiveness of hand sanitizers on viruses the world health organization recommends alcohol based hand sanitizer formulations against bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv hepatitis c virus hcv zika virus murine norovirus and coronaviruses as shown with effective inactivation in quantitative suspension tests32

33 other formulations from sterillium that contain isopropanol as the main ingredient also completely inactivated enveloped enteric and respiratory viruses such as h1n1 influenza a virus34 but failed to inactivate non-enveloped viruses except rotavirus a number of in vivo studies have also been conducted where the virus is applied to fingertips and the efficacy of the hand sanitizers in reducing the numbers of viral particles recoverable from the hands is determined35 many of these finger pad tests show moderate efficacy against most non-enveloped viral strains which are known to be more resistant to disinfectants than enveloped viruses36

37 it is crucial to keep note of the type of viral strains as most commonly ren fact high concentrations of ethanol has shown to be highly effective against enveloped viruses12 and thus is effective against the majority of clinically relevant viruses13 that being said although nonenveloped viruses such as hepatitis a and enteroviruses require 70 - 80 alcohol to be reliably inactivated sattar et al suggest that 60 ethanol was sufficient to reduce the titers of rotavirus adenovirus and rhinovirus by 3 log10 within a 10-second contact period36 even with non-enveloped viruses satisfactory activity can be achieved with higher alcohol concentrations and extended contact times3

38as evidence on the novel sars-cov-2 continues to rapidly emerge data from previous coronaviruses can be extrapolated in the context of the efficacy of hand disinfection given their structural similarity a systematic review examining the 2002-04 sars outbreak indicated that 9 out of 10 small case-control studies pointed towards the idea that hand washing decreases the likelihood of nosocomial and community transmission although only three showed statistical significance partly explained due to the small sample sizes of the studies39 a portion of the studies varied in the specific method of hand washing some studies used hand sanitizers while others did not specify whether it was achieved through soap and water or sanitizers although direct in vivo confirmation of virus inactivation after hand sanitizer use is infeasible to achieve in a standardized method in vitro studies have confirmed that alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be effective in decreasing the viral load specifically in vitro studies using sputum cultures of sars-cov infected patients with four different alcohol-based hand sanitizer formulations were all able to inactivate the virus below the limit of detection40transmissions of sars-cov-2 have been described with incubation times of up to 10 days facilitating its spread via droplets contaminated hands or surfaces41 as such it is important to note the efficacy of inactivating viruses on all modes of transmission alcohol based disinfectants have also been shown to effectively inactivate sars-cov and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus on inanimate surfaces such as metal glass and plastic42one of the key limitations for analyzing the true efficacy of hand disinfection arises from the method of data collection via retrospective self-reporting which can lack standardization and objectivity in frequency and method of handwashing39 there is also a myriad of confounding variables especially in hospital settings such as frequency and extent of contact with infected persons and the use of personal protective equipment as hand hygiene is one aspect of a multi-component intervention to reduce infection rates it is difficult to truly assess the effectiveness of hand sanitizers independentlynumerous hand sanitizers consisting of different ingredients and methods of application have been compared however the centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommends washing hands with soap and water whenever possible over hand sanitizers22 the superiority of handwashing stems from various factors such as elimination of a wider spectrum of pathogens and chemicals and removal of bioburden on soiled hands a 2016 systematic review supports the historical skepticism about the use of hand sanitizers in food preparation settings and suggests that hand washing with soap and water is more effective than alternative hand disinfection methods for removal of soil and microorganisms from hands43nonetheless we wanted to specifically compare the efficacy of hand soaps and sanitizers on their efficacy on inactivating enveloped viruses an in vitro quantitative suspension test comparing three different ethanol-based hand sanitizers and three different antimicrobial soaps all demonstrated a 4 log10 9999 reduction in the test enveloped viruses44 although there is limited evidence in direct comparison between soap and sanitizers numerous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of sanitizers on various enveloped viruses13

32 when pertaining to non-enveloped viruses finger pad testing showed that hand washing with soap and water is sufficient to remove 5 log10 virus particles of human norovirus gi and mnv1 while alcohol based hand disinfectants were not able to effectively inactivate these same viruses34 alcohol-based products achieve rapid and effective inactivation of various bacteria but their efficacy is generally lower against non-enveloped viruses this might even explain the speculation that the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers might be a risk factor for norovirus outbreaks that were previously described in long term care facilities45

46on the contrary scientific studies have shown that after hand washing as many as 80 of individuals retain some pathogenic bacteria on their hands47 moreover hand washing removes the bodys own fatty acids from the skin which may result in cracked skin that ultimately provides a potential entry portal for pathogens48 to overcome the limitations of plain hand washing hand sanitizers were introduced claiming to be effective against those pathogenic micro-organisms as well as to improve skin condition due to the addition of emollients in it49three common modes of delivering the active ingredient in hand sanitizers whether alcohol or other disinfectants are foams gels and sprays there is limited research on comparing the efficacy of various sanitizer delivery systems on virucidal efficacy one study with 30 human volunteers showed 3 log10 reductions of h1n1 viral counts on finger pads with foam gel and wipes with no differences in efficacy among delivery types50 similar findings were seen by grayson et al comparing ethanol based gel and liquid forms on h1n151 both of these studies suggest that there could be some varying differences in efficacy due to the method of mechanical friction that could contribute to physical removal of pathogens but there needs to be further research conducted to compare the efficacy between the various hand sanitizer delivery systemsaside from virucidal efficacy the formulations of hand sanitizers were identified as one factor influencing compliance to hand hygiene though conflicting results exist a single pump from foam dispensers provides approximately 11 ml of hand sanitizer52 manufacturers suggest different recommended volumes for application but a recent study compared gel and foam hand sanitizers and found no statistically significant difference of complete hand coverage upon usage of equal volumes52 it did however conclude that volumes 2 ml resulted in high rates of poor coverage 67 - 87 whereas volumes  2ml generated a lower rate of incomplete coverage 13 - 53 the world health organization does not have a specific volume of sanitizer they suggest but recommend to cover all surfaces of the hand challenge fg who guidelines on hand hygiene in health care a summary geneva world health organization 2009 contrary to the previous results52 a study comparing foam and gel with equal concentrations of ethanol determined that foam spreads more than gel and that the average log10 reduction of foam was superior against escherichia coli bacteria than gel53 to translate these experimental findings to clinical practice however the compliance of utilizing adequate amounts of foam sanitizer must be met a study reviewing the potential compliance of various hand sanitizer varieties found that foams containing 62 ethanol have a long drying time and given this healthcare workers in clinical practice likely use inadequate volumes of the product in order to quicken the drying time and consequently do not use a sufficient amounts of foam hand sanitizer for complete hand coverage54 indeed a focus group of nurses strongly rejected high volumes 3ml of hand sanitizers in gel foam or liquid form as there is not enough time to apply such large doses whilst working on a busy ward55 moreover the gel and foam formats were considered more desirable than the liquid due to some key desirable properties including fast absorption softmoisturized hand feel clean non-sticky feel and low smell55 another study compared the tolerability of gel and liquid forms with varying ingredients ethanol or propanol among dental students and found that all types were tolerated56 multiple studies suggest that there are other factors such as sanitizer ingredients addition of skin moisturizer and accessibility in the workplace that affect compliance and ultimately make it difficult to directly compare the different types of hand sanitizers further studies need to be conducted to determine the long-term compliance of the various sanitizer forms which are more useful in settings where consistent hand hygiene is crucialwith the current research in the literature it is difficult to confidently suggest one mode of hand sanitizing delivery over the other what we can state however is that soap and water is superior to sanitizer and when hand washing is unavailable or inconvenient a sufficient volume of sanitizer is important to ensure complete hand coverage and compliance is critical for appropriate hand hygiene and finally with extrapolating the virucidal data on viruses of similar structure to sars-cov-2 this virus can be effectively inactivated with current hand hygiene products though future research should attempt to determine this directly
the global disaster covid-19 pandemic has various reasons for its dramatic increase worldwide some researchers opine that the sars-cov has its origin from bats and the prevalence of this virus to humans was through palm civets the intermediate source between bats and human population1

2 the most responsible reasons for it include the large human population gathering and human intervention which have violated the ecosystem globally the population of the world intrudes the various untouched ecologies and put themselves before the unknown viruses and bacteria without knowing their threat or impact of exposure to humankind3

the coronavirus can travel beyond species boundaries earliest infection of sars-cov-2 was in wuhan china and the who has called this pandemic as corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 initially it was thought that this virus also has its origin from the animals to humans as some of the infected people were from a wholesale seafood market in wuhan at a later stage infections were found in humans those who have not even visited that particular market thus making clear that this virus can also spread by human to human exposure5 6 7there can be various ways of transmission for this virus to infect the human population spreading or transmission of covid-19 can be through close contact of human beings or by touch or the aerosol spreading of the virus8 9 10 the most common way of spreading of this virus is through respiratory droplets as the infected one coughs or sneezes these micro-droplets containing the virus can infect a healthy human by settling on the face mouth nose ears eyes or hands11 this virus can sustain for a long time on various surfaces which is also considered as a significant reason for its transmission frequent touching of the facial area handshake and unavoidable touch to different surfaces while travelling through various transport means is also a significant threat to humans also the transmission is known as hidden transmission by the carrier unknowingly spreading the infection to other population exists12coronavirus can last on for long durations on different metal surfaces ranging from hours to days13

14 recent studies show that the coronavirus can last about three days on a plastic surface as well as on stainless steel surface it can also sustain for a period of whole one day on cardboard whereas it can only sustain for about four hours only on a copper surface15the use of disinfectants decimates microorganism of virus or bacteria on inner layers or inert surfaces by acting as an antimicrobial agent disinfectants are not always impressive against all kinds of microorganism like bacterial spores as sterilisation which kills all types of life by the use of extreme physical or chemical procedures16 disinfectants play a critical role in decimating microorganisms outside the human body or on various surfaces it separates disinfectants from antibiotics and antiseptics which acts inside the human body or on living tissues respectively mechanism of disinfectants involves the destroying of the cell wall of microbes and enters into their metabolism to destroy or inactivate themthere are many sanitizers available in the market to disinfect different metal surfaces these were having composed of chemical substances capable of disinfecting microorganisms which may be suspended in various media like air alcohol and alcohol plus quaternary ammonium cation based compounds aldehydes oxidizing agents and the biguanide polymer polyaminopropyl biguanide etc table 1
shows various disinfectants and their rolesanitizers are the substances that disinfect and clean simultaneously and these kill more germs than the sanitizers 24

25 disinfectants are frequently used in hospitals clinics and also in the bathrooms and kitchens to kill infective organisms from the above table we can decide the role of disinfectants in human lifea comparative study of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 viruses is done to estimate their decay rate on different metal surfaces and in an aerosol they have used a bayesian regression model to study the decay rate of the virus on different surfaces around ten experiments with different conditions involving the above two viruses were done for five different environmental conditions these include four metal surfaces and aerosol plastic stainless steel copper and cardboard were the four metal surfaces taken to consideration the reason behind to take theses metal surfaces was the use of these materials in our day to day life whether the population is travelling shopping or doing work in the office study on the aerosol showed that sars-cov-2 could sustain it for up to three hours one important observation was that during the time the virus reduces its infecting capability from 1035 to 1027 tissue culture infective dose tcid 50 per litre of air a similar tendency of sars-cov-1 is also observed in this study and identified that the infection capability of covid-19 virus has reduced from 1043 to 1035 tcid50 per millilitre26 table 2
gives a comparative study of both viruses and shows that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 have significant sustaining time on different surfacesalthough the behaviour of both the viruses is almost similar on some metal surfaces like in the first three environmental conditions they show linear decay in infection capability27 28 29 30 however in aerosol plastic and stainless steel the concentration of virus on the medium is different but the differences are insignificant under the tested experimental conditions sars-cov-2 was similar to sars-cov-1 these viruses include high viral load having the potential to infect the peoples and before spreading the affected person may be asymptomatic31 32 33 34 35from the available data an analysis is made on the infection capability and duration for which a particular virus can sustain in a medium or on a surface to depict the trend of decreasing infection tendency of the virus figure 1 and 2
 thus to make these two graphs the lower concentration values were taken from the table no 1 as those are the correct values of concentration at the end of sustaining time of virus on different metal surfacesit can be derived from figure 1 and figure 2 that the sustainability of sars-cov-2 is more or less similar to sars-cov-1 for the given environmental conditions we see a linear decrease in the infection capability of this virus with respect to time and the same varies according to the medium surface this linear decrease shows the exponential decay in virus titre in per litre of air or millilitre of medium with time the green line shows the linear decay of infection capability in the graphs graphs for both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 are confined from 1 to 5 digits theses digits depict the five environmental conditions viz 1-aerosol 2-plastic 3-stainless steel 4- copper and 5-cardboardcoronavirus can sustain for a long time on various surfaces which is a major reason for its transmission this virus can contaminate on different metal surfaces and stay on them from hours to days with a maximum span on plastic and stainless and least on the copper surface the alcohol-based disinfectants can significantly reduce the survival and decay time of the virus the two important coronaviruses sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 have significant sustaining time on different metal surfaces and their behaviour is almost similar on various metal surfaces and in aerosolsover-crowding poor sanitation and indoor air pollution are known risk factors for covid-19 spread poverty also contributes to covid-19 risk by presenting impossible tradeoffs between preventing disease and sustaining access to food and medicine many pwh in east africa rely on crowded public transportation for work and procurement of basic amenities several pwh recently lamented that although they understand the risk they must ride public transportation every day to work so as to pay rent and other expenses although aware of the benefits many pwh cannot afford to purchase protective gear such as masks which help to protect against the virus in response we have seen many hiv clinics developing publicprivate partnerships with neighborhood tailors to produce masks at low prices from available scraps of material moreover physical distancing is a luxury that many in east africa do not have the option of practicing the median household size in the region is five people with few owning homes with multiple rooms 6 in many of these homes hand washing poses a challenge as they have limited to no access to running water soap or sanitizer 7 in response we have seen hiv clinics and local businesses produce hand sanitizers using readily available materials such as locally brewed alcohol and curl activator hair gelmany pwh in east africa depend on agricultural production and unskilled manual labor for survival 6 shelter-in-place orders reduce their ability to produce sell and buy basic goods 8 there have been reported cases of attempted suicide in our hiv clinics for this reason covid-19 could cause a stark increase in food insecurity that could kill many more people than the virus itself 9 concurrently east africa is experiencing a plague of desert locusts of a scale unprecedented in modern times 10 and floods that could bring an acute food shortage to over 25 million people 11 in combination these natural disasters are likely to affect pwh more than the general population as pwh are more susceptible to food insecurity 12 food insecurity in turn is known to interfere with hiv care leading to poor clinic attendance poor antiretroviral therapy art adherence poor immunological and virologic responses lower efficacy of art higher mortality and increased hiv transmission risk 13 during the current covid-19 crisis for example many pwh report being unable to take their art on an empty stomach for fear that the drugs will make them sickhiv healthcare providers in africa are partnering with pwh to develop individualized solutions to food insecurity in some areas national governments are providing food handouts in other areas local charities provide food for some pwh the best solution is to temporarily relocate to relatives who are in the process of harvesting their cropswe are witnessing a concerning rise in feelings of helplessness among people with hiv the proliferation of misinformation about the virus on social media feeds into these sentiments 14 15 many pwh have access to smart phones and receive much of their news from whatsapp or other mobile applications 16 if only i knew what to believe complained several pwh for example rumors have spread that the thermal scanners used at entrances to facilities can cause brain cancer and that masks cause people to develop lifelong lung disease there are also many messages promoting the use of herbal remedies for prevention of covid-19 despite the fact that these herbs might adversely interact with art 17 the lack of understanding of coronavirus and its effects on hiv leads pwh to be more fearful given what they know about their condition this stress and sense of impending doom can lead to a fatalism that is reminiscent of the advent of the hiv epidemic if god wills it i will die from the coronavirus we were told by more than one pwh this same sentiment of hopelessness debilitated pwh and families for decades at the beginning of the aids epidemic hiv counselors and pwh have dealt with rumors and fatalism before and they are using lessons learned form the past to address these new challenges in some populations of patients such as adolescents counseling is more effective if conducted in groups some clinics are therefore planning group counseling and support sessions when the clinic is otherwise empty to allow for physical distancing and honest conversationsmany pwh are afraid to go to hiv clinics fearing exposure to coronavirus many hiv clinics in africa are situated within large public hospital campuses several pwh have informed us that they dont want to go to their hiv clinic because it is located in a hospital where coronavirus patients are admitted in addition many hospitals require patients to bring their own masks to gain entry and some pwh have been denied entry into hospitals because they were not able to afford a mask for these reasons many pwh have opted to obtain art at health facilities closer to home in some cases though this has resulted in unintended disclosure of hiv status in their communitiesin some crowded hiv clinics strict physical distancing may not be sustainable in response many east african hiv clinics have moved waiting areas outside to allow for sunlight and space fig 2 hiv nurses together with pwh are figuring out ways in which transportation to the hiv clinic can be made safer many crowded areas can be avoided for example with proper planning and walking or biking instead of using public transportation when safe travel to the hiv clinic is not possible community healthcare workers trained to adhere to covid-19 safety protocols can delivery art to the homes of pwhcovid-19 related interruptions in art could have profound long term repercussions setting us back after many years of progress 18 interrupted treatment increases the risk of treatment failure opportunistic infections virologic resistance transmission of hiv from mothers to children death and increases hiv transmission in the community 19fortunately hiv programs in sub-saharan africa have been at the forefront of improving efficiency of care delivery for years and they are now rising to the challenge of covid-19 20 one solution that enhances efficiency of hiv care and reduces covid-19 transmission risk is extension of art prescription durations to 3 or more months a strategy that was gaining traction long before the covid-19 pandemic 21 for countries that only allow three-month prescriptions of art doctors and nurses are sometimes providing two prescriptions for stable patients with suppressed viral loads so that they do not need to return for 6 monthscovid-19 is new but the fear stigma and poverty that determine health for much of the world are not we have much to learn from pwh about resilience and resourcefulness as we plan the response to covid-19 in sub-saharan africa we should start by listening to pwh chances are they have faced similar challenges before and have solutions that are more likely to be successful in their context than global mandates designed for different settings cultures and resourcesthe number of hospital-acquired infections hais has been growing exponentially worldwide since 1980 especially due to the emergence and wide spread of multidrug-resistant mdr bacteria multidrug resistance is an intrinsic and inevitable aspect of microbial survival and has been a major problem in the treatment of bacterial infections14 the evolution of bacterial resistance is a consequence of the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and of the transmission of resistance within and between individuals58 also the lack of new clinically relevant classes of antibiotics constitutes a major threat to public healthhais are among the major causes of death and increased morbidity among hospitalized patients with a minimum of 175 000 deaths every year in industrialized countries912 several investigations showed that 60 of worldwide hais have been linked to the attachment of different pathogens to medical implants and devices such as venous and urinary catheters arthroprostheses fracture-fixation devices and heart valves1318 as a direct consequence the replacement of implants which entails significant costs and suffering for patients often remains the only efficient therapy19 additionally it has been demonstrated that the increased incidence of hais is related to cross-infections from patient to patient or hospital staff to patient and to the presence of pathogenic microorganisms that are selected and maintained within the hospital environment including equipment1112023 poor infection control practices may facilitate patient-to-patient transmission of pathogens for instance in the accommodation of multiple patients in the same room however failure of the immune system due to illness andor the use of immunosupressors and other therapeutic drugs can increase the patients susceptibility to infections moreover the use of antibiotics can inadvertently select antibiotic-resistant microorganisms21since the environment serves as an important reservoir for infectious organisms the control of hospital infections is a matter of great concern and a major challenge the introduction of optimized disinfection products and processes is critical to control and prevent the spread of nosocomial infections cross-resistance and persister cells24 within recent decades requirements regarding the antimicrobial activity of disinfectants in the medical field have been defined in various european standards25 also guidelines have been developed by the cdc which recommend hospitals to thoroughly clean and disinfect environmental and medical equipment surfaces on a regular basis26 however there is a variety of products available on the market with moderate or even insufficient antimicrobial action25 new products and technologies with permanent antimicrobial activity without the risk of generating resistant microorganisms are needed12 hence this manuscript provides information on the main pathogens causing hai and the relevant in-use and emergent strategies for their controlthe increase in hai is associated with the higher capacity of bacteria to resist and adapt to harsh environmental conditions including the presence of antimicrobial agents deadly pathogens can survive for long periods of time on hospital surfaces making the environment a continuous reservoir of infectious agents the adhesion of pathogens to a surface followed by biofilm formation in 24 h is a critical microbiological problem for healthcare services10 in fact the concentration of disinfectants required to kill sessile bacteria may be 1000-fold higher than that required to kill planktonic bacteria of the same strain thus antimicrobial therapies fail to kill biofilms most of the time2730 furthermore there are few prevention techniques to control biofilm formation without causing side effects31some of the most important pathogens involved in hais include methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa clostridium difficile pseudomonas aeruginosa vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp vre acinetobacter baumannii and some enterobacteriaceae strains1213233 to a lesser extent pathogens such as candida species viruses adenoviruses noroviruses rotaviruses influenza parainfluenza hepatitis b viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-associated coronaviruses can also survive on surfaces and medical equipment although there is little evidence of possible survival23234 most of these pathogens can survive for months on surfaces3235 some examples of the most persistent hospital pathogens are summarized in table 1 along with some of their characteristics some investigations have proposed that gram-negative bacteria persist longer than gram-positive bacteria and although it has been suggested that the type of surface does not influence the period of persistence it has also been shown that longer persistence may occur on plastic or even on steel3236 in terms of environmental conditions lower temperatures 46c and high humidity 70 improved the persistence of several bacteria fungi and viruses32 moreover the frequency of contamination has been shown to vary depending on the body sites at which patients are colonized or infected it was demonstrated that 36 of surfaces sampled in the rooms of patients with mrsa in a wound or urine were contaminated compared with 6 of surfaces in the rooms of patients infected with mrsa at other body sites37pathogens can spread from patient to patient through contact with inanimate surfaces including medical equipment and the immediate patient environment38 there is clinical evidence suggesting an association between poor environmental hygiene and the transmission of microorganisms causing hais39 cheng et al40 found a strong correlation between environmental contamination by mrsa and hospital infection rates drees et al41 demonstrated an increase in vre infection risk for an occupant of a room where a patient with this infection was previously treated it was also demonstrated that nosocomial transmission of norovirus c difficile and acinetobacter spp was correlated with contaminated environmental surfaces15 in another study a positive and measurable effect on the clinical environment was demonstrated with the introduction of one extra cleaner which apparently protected the patients against mrsa infection42 the potential for contaminated environmental surfaces to contribute to pathogen transmission depends on two important factors the pathogens must survive on dry surfaces and the contamination has to occur on surfaces commonly touched by patients and healthcare staff at a sufficiently high level to enable transmission to patients35 moreover pathogen transmission will also depend on the infectious dose and route of transmission along with host susceptibilityshared clinical equipment that comes into contact with intact skin despite being unlikely to introduce infection can also promote the transfer of microorganisms between patients43 the most frequently contaminated surfaces are floors doorknobs television remote control devices bed-frame lockers mattresses bedside tables and toilet seats in rooms previously occupied by an infected patient1123544 wilcox et al45 found that 50 of commodes toilet floors and bed frames sampled at a hospital were contaminated with c difficile medical devices including stethoscopes and otoscopes are highly prone to be contaminated with bacteria and have been implicated as potential vectors of cross-transmission46 moreover bacteria were found on various plastic items in the hospital including pagers and cell phones47 cotterill et al48 provided suggestive evidence that contaminated ventilation grills were sources of mrsa outbreaks in hospitals additionally an estimated 2040 of hais have been attributed to cross-infection via the hands of healthcare personnel who have become contaminated from direct contact with the patient or indirectly by touching contaminated environmental surfaces1538 in fact hand hygiene is a major contributing factor to the current infection threats to hospital inpatients49 barker et al50 showed that norovirus is consistently transferred via the fingers to melamine surfaces and from there to other typical hand-contact surfaces such as taps door handles and telephone receivers pessoa-silva et al51 demonstrated that hands become increasingly contaminated with commensal flora and potential pathogens during neonatal care and that gloves do not fully protect the workers hands from contamination pittet et al52 concluded that bacterial contamination increased linearly with time on ungloved hands during patient care this demonstrates the importance of decontaminating hands before every patient contact fendler et al53 concluded that the use of an alcohol gel hand sanitizer decreased infection rates during a 34 month period and can provide an additional tool for an effective infection control programme the same conclusion was reached by hilburn et al54 the gloves of medical staff are also easily infected from direct contact with an infected patient or indirectly by touching contaminated surfaces which serve as a carrier for pathogenic microorganisms11 in a study focused on mrsa infection 42 of personnel gloves that contacted the furnituresurfaces of a patient room but had no direct contact with infected patients were contaminated3744 more significantly it was found that 65 of the nursing staff that had directly treated an infected individual contaminated their gownsuniforms with the organism55 the white coats shirts and ties of doctors have also been found to contain potentially pathogenic flora56maintenance of a good hospital environment requires the implementation of adequate strategies such strategies are described in guidelines proposed by several committees particularly the healthcare infection control practice advisory committee57 for instance in the case of surfaces with blood contamination a disinfectant with activity against tuberculosis and hepatitis b virus hbvhiv or a 525 bleach solution at a final dilution of 1  10 can be used11 these documents describe procedures to be implemented in healthcare facilities in order to achieve efficient cleaning and disinfection and also review the main uses of disinfectants as well as their mechanism of action and activity rutala and weber58 developed a set of guidelines for hospital environment cleaningcleaning is related to the clearance of foreign material from a surface or equipment allowing the removal of some organic material and microorganisms by detergents1133 however this process does not kill bacteria which under favourable conditions can redeposit elsewhere and form biofilms31 consequently cleaning must always precede disinfection and sterilization in order to eliminate infectious microorganisms59 a significant amount of microorganisms is destroyed by the disinfection process which involves the use of chemical agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds aldehydes alcohols and halogens or radiation and heat11313360 the control of hospital infection must involve both disinfection and sterilization processes and sometimes the use of aerosols to clean the air1133a biocide can target different locations on a cell as it may interact with the surface the bacterial cell wall and the outer membrane or it may penetrate the cell where it can cause reversible or irreversible changes by interacting with nucleic acids inhibiting enzymes and cell growth2460 when choosing a disinfectant several factors must be taken into account such as its efficiency compliance with regulations user acceptability instrument compatibility the types of surfaces and medical equipment and the pathogenicity infection rates and persistence of the microorganisms61 a disinfectant must be safe easy to use and effective against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms and should not leave toxic residues3161 the efficiency of the disinfectant depends on several factors mainly surface characteristics hydrophobicity charge and roughness the amount of organic and inorganic matter temperature ph the chemical structure of the biocidal agent and the type of infection and pathogen112431 the mode of action of the disinfectant and the route of entry into the cell porin channels in the case of hydrophilic disinfectants and the hydrophobic path for hydrophobic disinfectants also play significant roles24 the risk of infection of the roomsurfaceequipment must also be considered in the choice of the disinfectant as well as its concentration and exposure time2462 hospital areas should be defined according to the risk of infection in order to establish and promote proper cleaningdisinfection areas where contamination is expected eg laboratories operating theatres ambulatory surgical units labour and delivery rooms areas with blood or body fluid spills and neonatal and burn units must be cleaned and disinfected frequently often several times per day1 areas of low risk such as administration and waiting rooms only require a daily cleaningaccording to its efficiency and ability to kill bacterial spores an antimicrobial product can belong to one of four distinct groups sterilants or high- intermediate- and low-level disinfectants table 2 given the increased resistance to antimicrobial agents displayed by bacteria upon biofilm formation this hierarchy is only a rough guide606364 a disinfectant is almost never 100 effective due to the resistance of some bacteria to specific compounds and due to inefficient cleaning protocols1 once a disinfectant is removed the surviving bacterial population can potentially regrow moreover viable spores still attached to various materials can remain undetected by current sporicidal tests resulting in overestimation of the sporicidal activity of sterilizing agents65the efficacy of diverse chemical disinfectants in inhibiting and killing some of the most clinically relevant bacteria pathogenic fungi and yeasts has been evaluated by several authors the activity of a disinfectant is generally analysed in terms of its mic and mbc however the most suitable measure is the log10 reduction of the number of cfu the time taken to obtain a 5 log10 reduction is also a reference to assess disinfection efficacy61the use of biocides has evolved over time alcohols such as ethanol have a long history of antiseptic use around the 19th and 20th centuries phenolics and hypochlorites started to be employed and later quaternary ammonium compounds66 more recently the most common products have been chlorhexidine and silver salts peroxygens glutaraldehyde and ortho-phthalaldehyde6667alcohol disinfectants cause protein denaturation and are effective against vegetative bacteria fungi and viruses but have no effect on spores6168 chlorine-releasing agents can oxidize membrane proteins and are very effective in removing biofilms from surfaces requiring short exposure times for growth inhibition576168 however these chemical agents are corrosive to metals and can be inactivated by the presence of organic matter576169 moreover in the last few years the use of chlorine has been associated with the formation of carcinogenic compounds and some pathogens have been shown to be resistant to chlorine70 the aldehyde-based disinfectants disrupt proteins and nucleic acids by alkylation and have antimicrobial activity against spores bacteria viruses and fungi6164 quaternary ammonium compounds and phenols solubilize the membrane and the cell wall68 hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid promote protein denaturation and are active against several groups of microorganisms and pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections38576164 the mechanism of action of different disinfectant categories has been presented elsewhere in greater detail647172countless studies have been performed regarding the antimicrobial action and efficacy of different disinfectants rutala and weber69 reviewed the use of inorganic hypochlorite bleach in healthcare facilities for disinfection of medical devices and environmental surfaces and concluded that the many advantages of chlorine eg fast microbiocidal activity cost-effectiveness and good track record are likely to support its continued use in healthcare settings griffiths et al73 evaluated the efficacy of several disinfectants sodium dichloroisocyanurate chlorine dioxide 70 industrial methylated spirits 2 alkaline glutaraldehyde 10 succinedialdehyde and formaldehyde mixture 035 peracetic acid and a peroxygen compound at 1 and 3 against different strains of mycobacteria and showed that disinfectants based on sodium dichloroisocyanurate were more effective moreover they concluded that clinical strains were more resistant to biocides than laboratory type strains73 other studies have shown that chlorhexidine at 05 concentration is the best choice among several antiseptics and surface disinfectants including betadine hydrogen peroxide sodium hypochlorite alcohol and ultraviolet radiation to kill clinical yeast isolates either in planktonic cultures or in biofilm74 oie et al75 analysed the effects of four different chemical treatments 02 alkyldiaminoethyl glycine 001 or 01 sodium hypochlorite and 80 ethyl alcohol on the disinfection of porous and smooth surfaces contaminated by s aureus in a university hospital the results demonstrated that the disinfection of porous surfaces was more difficult and none of the disinfectants was effective highlighting the need for more frequent disinfection and the use of high-level disinfectants on these surfaces75 more recently speight et al76 evaluated the effect of 32 disinfectants on spores of c difcile by a suspension test and only eight products gave 3 log10 reduction in viability within 1 min to have a more realistic simulation of probable real-life exposures under dirty conditions 3 bsa these results underscore the importance of carefully selecting the disinfectant to eliminate spores of this particular microorganism76 kim et al77 analysed the effectiveness of 13 disinfectants used in hospitals day-care centres and food service kitchens zep fs amine z zep dz-7 lemonex zep micronex tbq zep fs formula 386 l perosan liquid sanitizer lph se vesphene iise coverage spray hb plus coverage spray tb zep kitchen surface sanitizer and zep fs rtu-d2 against enterobacter sakazakii in suspension dried on stainless steel and in biofilm and concluded that not all biocides used in hospitals can kill this microorganism also the efficacy of disinfectants was higher for planktonic cells reduction to undetectable levels77 bridier et al78 studied the effects of three common disinfectants peracetic acid benzalkonium chloride and ortho-phthalaldehyde on 77 bacterial strains and found that mycobacteria demonstrated a marked resistance to all the biocides benzalkonium chloride was inefficient even at very high concentrations also resistance was dependent on the strain within the same species78 gutirrez-martn et al79 analysed the activity of 16 active compounds and 11 commercial disinfectants against campylobacter jejuni by performing a suspension test in the presence and absence of serum high levels of reduction 6 log10 for some disinfectants chloramine-t povidone iodine 1 available iodine cetylpiridinium chloride ethanol isopropanol chlorhexidine digluconate formaldehyde phenol and 10 of the 11 commercial formulations especially those based on quaternary ammonium compounds were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of organic material79 table 3 compiles some of the available information regarding hospital disinfectants
disinfection methods employed in many intensive therapy units and other healthcare facilities include the use of antimicrobial wipes such products might be efficient in removing a microbial bioburden from a surface80 the use of alcohol wipes was also demonstrated to generally decrease the mean daily bacterial load on toilets where wipes were made available81 however in most cases antibacterial wipes used in hospitals were found to spread germs rather than eradicate them wipes can act as sources of cross-contamination when they are used on surfaces next to patients or on those commonly touched by staff and patients eg tables keypads82 moreover many hospital personnel use a single wipe several times to clean and disinfect multiple surfaces before discarding it instead they should use a wipe on a single discrete surface that requires only low-level disinfectiona description of methods for hospital equipment disinfection with an analysis of the exposure time and the type of disinfectant and a summary of advantages and disadvantages of some chemical sterilants can be found elsewhere1157 nevertheless it has to be taken into account that some of these studies were performed with culture collection strains whose responses to the presence of these disinfectants may differ from those of clinical isolates60 furthermore some studies evaluated only a single strain of the species therefore the results obtained may not always be representative of what occurs in clinical practice most of the presented investigations were performed on a laboratory scale which may not truly reflect the complexity of a hospital scenariothe need for appropriate disinfection procedures is enhanced by the multitude of outbreaks that have resulted from improperly decontaminated patient-care items83 the disinfection processes previously described are executed by the application of chemical agents in solution however this kind of disinfection has some disadvantages the application of disinfectants requires an exposure time of at least 510 min the chemicals might react with acids they might lose their activity in contact with organic substances and some of them can cause skin eye and respiratory tract irritation23in this context new disinfection strategies must be developed and their efficiencies must be evaluated in terms of their potential applications in hospital settings this need for novel control methods has been emphasized by the increased resistance of bacterial species to some disinfectants mainly as a consequence of biofilm formation31one of these alternative strategies is steam vapour disinfection which has been evaluated by different groups tanner84 demonstrated a reduction of 7 log10 in mrsa vre and p aeruginosa to undetectable values within 5 s of application of a steam vapour system sexton et al23 applied a steam vapour system to combat mrsa total coliform bacteria and c difficile cells attaining a 90 reduction in bacterial levels hydrogen peroxide vapour hpv is also used for decontamination of clinical surfaces and equipment otter and french85 found that vegetative bacteria and spores 67 log10 cfu survived on surfaces for 5 weeks but were inactivated within 90 min of exposure to hpv in a 100 m3 test room initial inocula of m tuberculosis 3 log10 and geobacillus stearothermophilus 6 log10 were exposed to hpv at 10 locations during room experiments and both microorganisms were inactivated in all locations within 90 min of hpv exposure86 falagas et al38 reviewed other studies of disinfection with hpv against mrsa c difficile and other pathogens in several sampled hospital locations including surgical wards ward side rooms single isolation rooms multiple-bed ward bays and bathrooms complete or almost complete disinfection of the sampled hospital sites was achieved with airborne hydrogen peroxide hpv appears to have low toxicity and has good compatibility with most inanimate materials87uv light exposure has also been applied for room decontamination it has been used in air-handling systems and upper-room air-purifying systems to destroy microorganisms and can also inactivate microorganisms on surfaces88 uv-c was demonstrated to be effective in eliminating vegetative bacteria on contaminated surfaces both in the line of sight and behind objects within 15 min and in eliminating c difficile spores within 50 min89 in other study a mobile uv-c light unit significantly reduced aerobic colony counts and spores of c difficile on contaminated surfaces in patient rooms88 it was also demonstrated that ceiling-mounted uv germicidal irradiation lamps were effective in reducing the viability of both bacillus cereus and bacillus anthracis vegetative cells and spores after a minimum exposure time of 1 h at an intensity as low as 8 wcm290both the hpv and uv light methods have demonstrated good results however they require the removal of patients and healthcare personnel from the room have a high acquisition cost and increase room turnover time91 moreover they do not replace standard cleaning and disinfection92bacterial adhesion to stainless steel surfaces the most commonly used material in industry and hospitals is one of the major reasons for cross-contamination in many scenarios93 thus more recently different strategies for the production of antimicrobial surfaces with the purpose of reducing hai have been extensively investigated and developed researchers have focused on the development of surfaces with antimicrobial coatings in order to inhibit biofilm formation by either killing the bacteria or preventing their adhesion bacterial growth control can then occur by three different modes of action biocide leaching which involves the release of a cytotoxic compound to kill attached microorganisms adhesion prevention which uses a super-hydrophobic covering in order to prevent microbial adhesion and contact killing which consists of disruption of cell membranes in contact with the surface13 many of these techniques consist of surface modification by introduction of antimicrobial substances such as antibiotics metals such as copper and silver and antiseptics9398 these surfaces can be obtained by different methods including adsorption ligandreceptor pairing and covalent binding94 surfaces that release antimicrobial products can work quite efficiently although they eventually become exhausted and the diffusible antimicrobials pose the potential problem of inducing microbial resistance since the surfaces are continually releasing active compounds to the environment for a long period of time5599 alternatively the design of surfaces that kill microbes on contact and do not release biocides may solve this problem the covering of surfaces with transient metals such as copper and silver as mentioned above is a well-established strategy moreover surfaces that catalytically produce biocides using externally applied chemical electrical or optical energy are an interesting alternative99an example of biocide leaching is the use of surfacine which incorporates an antimicrobial compound silver iodide in a surface-immobilized coating a modified polyhexamethylenebiguanide83 this compound interacts with the microorganism by electrostatic attraction penetrates the cell and finally kills it83 surfaces treated with silver iodide resulted in excellent elimination of vre at challenge levels of 100 cfuin2 for at least 13 days11 furthermore these surfaces retained the antimicrobial effect even after cleaning11 photocatalytic oxidation on surfaces coated with titanium dioxide tio2 is also a possible alternative in the presence of water and oxygen highly reactive oh radicals generated by tio2 and mild uv-a are able to destroy bacteria thus reducing bacterial contamination100 another example of a product that releases an organic antimicrobial is microban which contains triclosan 5-chloro-2-24-dichlorophenoxy-phenol as the antimicrobial agent making the surface resistant to the growth of microorganisms55 this antimicrobial technology can be found in hundreds of consumer industrial and medical products around the worldcovalent immobilization of bioactive compounds onto functionalized polymer surfaces has also seen rapid growth in the past decade in such industries as biomedical textiles microelectronics bioprocessing and food packaging101 table 4 presents some examples of the application of these surfaces
furthermore other kinds of surface are stimulating intensive research and some of them are already used while others are promising candidates for practical application102104 examples include materials for medical implants such as catheters devices and instruments that are in contact with patients surgical gowns and other protective clothing such as surgical masks caps and polymeric coatings on surfaces such as shower walls102103 antimicrobial polymers provide a very suitable strategy for achieving this objective since they can be applied to diverse objects polyelectrolyte multilayers pems have also been investigated extensively as biomaterials and biomaterial interfaces and also for bacterial contamination prevention104gas plasma is another promising alternative to sterilization that can be applied in healthcare services although it is mainly targeted to equipment rather than to surfaces plasma consists of a mixture of photons electrons ions atoms and radicals such as atomic oxygen ozone nitrogen oxides hydroxyl and superoxide as a result of air plasma discharges the gas enters an ionized state by energetic transfer and exhibits antimicrobial properties920105106 two types of plasma can be defined according to the conditions under which the plasma is formed thermal and non-thermal plasmas compared with non-thermal plasmas thermal plasmas require higher pressure and are characterized by higher temperatures and a local thermodynamic equilibrium105106 these systems have many advantages over more conventional disinfection techniques as they enable the disinfection of the interior of some types of equipment and materials such as needles at low cost and with easy handling107108 furthermore gas plasma does not require chemical products and it is not toxic to the skin20 shimizu et al108 performed treatments with plasma using a surface micro-discharge device under different temperature and humidity conditions the antimicrobial effect was tested on escherichia coli and enterococcus mundtii with a reduction of 5 log10 after 15 and 30 s of plasma treatment for e mundtii and e coli respectively108 other researchers have developed a large-scale plasma dispenser and evaluated its effect on e coli and candida albicans in agar plates in the presence and absence of textiles107 their results demonstrated that the system was not affected by the presence of the textile and in both cases a 15 s treatment caused a 5 log10 reduction and after treatment for 5 s the fungi were reduced by 4 log10 joshi et al10 studied the biocidal efficacy of non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma against e coli s aureus and mrsa in biofilms and planktonic cells the planktonic cells were completely eliminated after 120 s of treatment whereas the mrsa growing in biofilms were killed by 60 within 15 s suggesting that the effectiveness of a plasma system is highly dependent on exposure time and cell density10 recent investigations evaluated the effect of non-thermal gas plasma on biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis and mrsa on glass surfaces a log10 reduction of 4 and 45 was observed after 1 h of exposure respectively and greater reductions could be attained with more prolonged exposure times9 burts et al20 tested an atmospheric non-thermal plasma as a disinfectant for hospital pagers by analysis of mrsa reduction and found complete disinfection within 30 s different cell densities and exposure times were also evaluated and a 45 log10 reduction was obtained within 10 min more information regarding this disinfection strategy has been reviewed by moisan et al105106 these novel disinfection techniques are important means of reducing the high numbers of nosocomial infections and are more efficient than conventional disinfection methodsthere is great concern about the growth and prevalence of hai due to the increased incidence of resistant bacteria furthermore the development of new antibiotics is a difficult task because of high research costs and regulatory issues conventional cleaning methods for the eradication of hospital environmental contamination seem to be inefficient this manuscript reviews several new disinfection alternatives as attempts to overcome these problems most of the data currently available have been generated by the manufacturers and need to be validated by independent investigations moreover studies concerning bacterial biology and physiology allied to genomics and computer analysis should be applied to identify and understand the pathogenesis associated with resistant bacteria and crucial targets for novel biocides thus further evaluation and implementation of new measures and new disinfection methods are necessary not forgetting their validation in terms of effectiveness safety and disposal additionally it is important always to evaluate the risk of emerging phenotypic resistance when developing new disinfection strategiesthis work was supported by operational

kit was used allowed for stabilization of the normal microbial populations residing on the hands the following week subjects hands were sampled for microorganisms on days 1 and 5 to establish a mean baseline population count for each subjects hands subjects clipped their fingernails to 1-mm free edge and removed all jewelry from hands and forearms for each baseline determination subjects rinsed their hands and the lower two thirds of their arms in tap water regulated at 40c  2c and cleaned their fingernails using a nail cleaner under supervision of a technician subjects then washed their hands and forearms with 5 ml of a liquid nonmedicated baseline soap working up a lather throughout this procedure subjects maintained their hands in a position above their elbows following a 30-second rinse in 40c  2c tap water the glove-juice sampling procedure was performed by laboratory personnel as followspowder-free loose-fitting sterile latex gloves were placed on subjects hands and laboratory personnel instilled 750 ml sterile stripping fluid without product neutralizers into each of the gloves the wrists were then secured and laboratory technicians massaged the hands through the gloves in a standardized manner for 60 seconds a 5-ml aliquot of the glove juice was removed from each of the gloves and each aliquot was diluted in 5 ml butterfields phosphate buffer solution with product neutralizers dilution 100 the 100 dilution was then serially diluted in butterfields phosphate buffer solution with product neutralizers duplicate spread andor spiral plates were prepared from each of the glove-juice dilutions using tryptic soy agar with 007 lecithin wtvol and 05 tween 80 wtvol and were incubated at 30c  2c for approximately 72 hours following incubation the colonies on the plates were counted and the data recorded using the computerized q-count plate-counting systemthe following week test week each subject applied a single randomly assigned product 4 times each day for 5 consecutive days with a minimum of 15 minutes between applications the water-optional handwash product 61 alcohol-zpt was tested in both a waterless and a water-aided configuration hence a

fig 1 at wash 1 the 61 alcohol-zpt product was significantly more efficacious p  05 than either the 20 chg product or the 05 triclosan product as measured by log10 reduction parameters by wash 10 both the 61 alcohol-zpt product and the chg-based handwash product were significantly p  05 better than the triclosan-based handwash the higher reduction from baseline observed at wash 10 with the chg product may be related to the application times because the 61 alcohol-zpt product was applied for 15 seconds per wash compared with the 30-second time for the 10 chg-based product applicationsthe 61 alcohol-zpt product in a waterless application produced mean reductions in the serratia marcescens population of 343 log10 following application 1 and 310 log10 following application 10 
fig 2 at wash 10 the 61 alcohol-zpt product was significantly p  05 more efficacious than the 61 ethyl alcohol handrub without preservative log10 reduction  122 hence whether used with or without water the 61 alcohol-zpt product satisfied the requirements specified by the fda a 2 log10 reduction in population following wash 1 and a 3 log10 reduction in population following wash 10use of the 61 alcohol-zpt product resulted in a reduction from the baseline population of more than 30 log10 on test days 1 3 and 5 the product also demonstrated significant p  05 persistent antimicrobial properties preventing regrowth of microbial populations to baseline levels 
fig 3 determining the residual properties of the 61 alcohol-zpt product proved difficult because it demonstrated greater than a 30 log10 reduction from baseline on all 3 sample days a level of antimicrobial activity better than observed for the other product tested the unpreserved 61 ethyl alcohol hand sanitizer demonstrated statistically significant p  05 log10 microbial reductions from baseline but failed to achieve a 3 log10 reduction on test day 5 additionally microbial regrowth 8 hours postproduct-application showed antimicrobial persistence to be relatively poor and no appreciable residual activity was apparent over the 5-day course of study p
  05 by test day 5 the 61 alcohol-zpt product was significantly p  05 more efficacious than the unpreserved 61 ethyl alcohol product at every time point as measured by log10 reduction parameters see
table 1none of the 3 test products or the reference product used in water-aided applications produced an average 3 log10 reduction in hand flora on test day 5 nevertheless when used as a water-aided handwash the 61 alcohol-zpt product produced significant p  05 immediate reductions in normal hand flora on all 3 sampling days showed a high degree of persistence through 8 hours of gloving and demonstrated good residual properties 
fig 4 the 2 chg test product and 4 chg reference product likewise produced significant log10 reductions in hand flora immediately following the water-aided washes and showed good persistence and residual properties the 05 triclosan test product did not demonstrate any significant antimicrobial properties over the 5-day period of study fig 4 the 61 alcohol-zpt product proved to be significantly p  05 more efficacious than the triclosan product at every time point on test days 1 3 and 5 summarized efficacy data for the persistence and residual effects of these products in the water-aided and waterless test modes are available at table 1fifty-eight female subjects fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled for study participation and 21 subjects completed the study twenty subjects voluntarily withdrew during the washout phase prior to testing and 17 were disqualified for failing to meet clinical grading criteria at baseline the 61 alcohol-zpt product was shown to be very well tolerated under exaggerated conditions of exposure only mild clinically insignificant changes were observed which included small increases in dryness and hand skin erythema prior to washes performed on days 4 and 5 and following washes on day 5 results of the self-assessment questionnaires at day 5 end point revealed no significant perceived changes in hand skin moisture skin condition feeling of healthy skin skin cracking or redness noninvasive bioengineering measurements confirmed that hand skin condition was not compromised during the exaggerated use of the cleanser data not shownthe 61 alcohol-zpt product formulation exceeds all in vivo criteria established by the fda in the tfm for the waterless and water-aided applications and hence is a water-optional health care personnel handwash comparable data were obtained as well for the required in vitro studies data on file but not shown the nature and characteristics of the zpt preservative system has been discussed elsewhere11
the increased efficacy observed with the 20 chg 381 log10 reduction versus the 61 ethyl alcohol product 323 log10 reduction at wash 10 in the water-aided mode fig 1 is likely to be related to product application times 30 seconds for the 20 chg product vs 15 seconds for the 61 alcohol-zpt product coupled with the nature of the health care personnel handwash in vivo test this test requires the contamination of the hands with 50 ml of a solution containing not less that 108 organismsml of the indicator strain serratia marcescens at baseline determination and prior to each of the required 10 washes therefore 109 cfu of serratia marcescens are applied to the hands during the course of the test differences in efficacy that are in the range of 05 log10 under the conditions of unequal wash times should be viewed cautiously for these reasons the authors are more likely to consider the data generated in the corresponding persistence and residual effects study fig 4 as reflective of actual product performance because a total of 20 washes are used over a 5-day period for each product thus minimizing to some degree the lack of parity associated with wash timesalthough 61 ethyl alcohol alone does provide antimicrobial action immediately postapplication 20 log10 reduction on all 3 test days this product was unable to compete with the 61 alcohol-zpt product in terms of persistent effect at the 8-hour postapplication time point see fig 3 the unpreserved ethyl alcohol product did not achieve the immediacy of kill or the residualpersistent effects observed with the 61 alcohol-zpt product used in a waterless application in the waterless mode of application the 61 alcohol-zpt product exhibits significantly greater p  05 antimicrobial properties see table 1the 20 chg 40 chg and the 61 alcohol-zpt products performed generally in an acceptable manner with some noteworthy differences in efficacy among the products the 61 alcohol-zpt product in general demonstrated better persistence especially at the 8-hour time point than did the other water-aided products it is interesting to note that for the 2 chg multiple 30-second applications were required over 2 to 3 days to achieve marginal antimicrobial persistence at the 8-hour test point see fig 4 data for test days 3 and 5 a surprising outcome of this study was the failure of the 05 triclosan product to produce any significant antimicrobial effects despite 20 applications of 30 seconds each over the 5-day periodthe data in table 1 compare log10 reduction values from the immediate and 8-hour sample collection times and therefore may provide the best opportunity to assess overall antimicrobial persistence and residual effects as noted previously the 61 alcohol-zpt product when applied waterless produced log10 reductions from baseline that average at least 35 thus it is difficult to assess the residual effects the antimicrobial persistence however is unsurpassed by any other product or application technique waterless or water-aided for the water-aided applications only the 05 triclosan product failed to demonstrate persistence or residual effects the difference among the other products was not statistically significant despite the shorter water-aided wash time for the 61 alcohol-zpt productoverall the results show that the 61 alcohol-zpt product was tolerated exceptionally well under exaggerated exposure conditions as shown by the parallelism in results observed among the clinical assessment parameters the subjective self-assessment responses and the noninvasive bioengineering measurements these results uniformly indicate that real skin-conditioning benefits are realized when the 61 alcohol-zpt product is used in a setting such as that exemplified by health care in which hand sanitation is practiced repeatedly and oftenthe virucidal efficacy of this formulation has been documented previously11 the data confirmed the virucidal action of the 61 alcohol-zpt product against a wide variety of viral agents to include coronavirus hcov atcc vr-740 both hcov and sars-hcov belong to the virus family coronaviridae the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 from zepto metrix corp of buffalo ny hepatitis a virus hav from crem university of ottawa herpes simplex type 1 hsv-1 atcc vr-260 and human rotavirus strain wa atcc vr-2018 these agents represent both rna and dna viruses some with envelopes and others without which are known to be responsible for a significant amount of human morbidity and some mortality furthermore hav and the human rotavirus are known to be resistant to several of the antimicrobials commonly used for hand antisepsis10 for these in vitro studies the viral agents were cultured using standards methods in cell lines appropriate for propagation to levels at or above the required titer of 10600 infectious unitsml the viruses were harvested baseline numbers determined and exposed for 3 minutes 30 seconds for the human coronavirus to the test formulation diluted by virus inoculum to a 90 concentration following exposure to the test product the surviving population was determined for each virus employing techniques appropriate for that virus to be considered virucidal the baseline populations must be reduced by not less than 3 log10 beyond observed cytotoxicity all testing was performed per american society for testing and materials astm method e 1052-96 a standard test method for efficacy of antimicrobial agents against viruses in suspension12
routine use of the 61 alcohol-zpt product would not only greatly reduce the transient and resident bacterial and yeast flora but also might decrease significantly the likelihood of transmitting viral agents of disease to others by contaminated hands this improvement in hand hygiene could also yield significant economic savings because viruses are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and even mild infections can be a significant burden on the health care system and the general economy data obtained in the united states for over 2 decades incriminate viruses in 5 of all nosocomial infections this number climbs to as high as 32 in the pediatric setting more recent developments in the medical community suggest that the impact of viruses as agents of nosocomial disease may be greater now viruses can survive on human hands for hours and experiments with human volunteers have demonstrated the potential for hands to spread viral agents including those of the common cold and enteric diseases as one might expect caregivers and food handlers are most often implicated in this type of disease transmission4 10 in summary the 61 alcohol-zpt product formulation meets or exceeds all requirements of the astm method to be considered as a virucidal agent properly formulated alcohol-based products can have potent virucidal action against even some of the most resistant viral agents this important aspect of skin antisepsis should not be overlooked when selecting a surgical scrub or health care personnel handwashthe 61 alcohol-zpt water-optional product meets or exceeds requirements for the health care personnel handwash indication and is therefore fda and cdc compliant it is formulated with surfactants and therefore is appropriate for use as either a water-aided or a waterless health care handwash it may be used waterless for hands that are not visibly soiled or with water for hands that are contaminated with blood other body fluids or other types of organic material or to assist in the removal of bacterial spores such as those of clostridium difficile the product provides antimicrobial persistence and residual effects and repeated use contributes positively to overall skin conditioning it is cidal for many viral agents of human disease that are readily transmitted via contact with contaminated hands finally it is nontoxic and not subject to inactivation by anions or changes in ph as has been observed with chg13 14 a product with these attributes fulfills a previously unmet need and could favorably impact compliance with handwashing protocolsa new infectious disease namely covid-19 was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan china csse 2020 caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 zhu et al 2020 covid-19 has then rapidly spread around the world and was declared as a pandemic by the world health organization who as of 14th april 2020 around two million people have contracted the disease and over 125 thousand deaths have been attributed to covid-19 globally csse 2020 the outbreak has triggered the so-called pandemic pantries a term that well defines the spikes in stockpiling of emergency supplies all around the world among these supplies stocks of hand sanitisers have rapidly vanished from some markets as soon as the frequent handwashing and sanitisation was recommended by the public health agencies across the world according to a market research from nielsen the sale of hand sanitisers skyrocketed by 300 and 470 in the last week of february and first week of march 2020 respectively in comparison to the same time in the previous year huddleston 2020 similarly in italy  one of the most affected countries by covid-19 - sales of hand sanitisers in supermarkets augmented by 561 during the first three weeks of the pandemic 24th february-15th march 2020 compared to the previous year ufficio studi coop 2020 there have been reports across the world that supermarkets and pharmacies as well as hospitals and other healthcare facilities have been running out of hand sanitisersa search in google trends enables to understand the magnitude of the emergent interest of the general public in hand sanitisers google trends analyse and compare the search volume of given keywords on google fig 1
a shows the trend of the search of the keyword hand sanitizer american english spelling within the united states a fairly constant volume of google searches on this topic was shown until february 2020 when a massive spike of 100-fold increase in interest in hand sanitizer appeared this finding correlated with the increased search of the word covid-19 hinting the obvious relationship between the two terms to put these numbers into context comparison between the search on hand sanitizer to that of the words pill drug and medicine was done in fig 1b results show that before the spread of the new coronavirus these words were constantly googled 2550 times more frequently than hand sanitizers while during the peak of the pandemic march 2020 hand sanitizers was searched approximately twice as much as those keywords although the astonishing peak of searches on hand sanitizer is moderately tapering down it is expected that the interest in this topic will remain much higher than the pre-pandemic levels because until a vaccine against covid-19 will be made available hand sanitisation will remain at the forefront of infection prevention measures moreover it is reasonable to speculate that the current awareness of the general public of the importance of hand disinfection will remain assimilated and will become an integral part of peoples hygiene practices even post-covid-19 erato respond to the hand sanitisers severe shortage not only pharmaceutical companies but chemical industries breweries and perfumeries have started unconventionally to produce hand sanitisers bomgardner et al 2020 as academics and pharmacists working in pharmaceutical technology departments of schools of pharmacy we have received a high number of requests related to hand sanitisers spanning from other faculties and businesses requesting the production of hand sanitisers in our laboratories to pharmacists asking for advice on the compounding of such products indeed hand sanitisers can also be prepared extemporaneously in pharmacies however pharmacists need an appropriate formulation and manufacturing directions to ensure a consistent product with adequate quality consumer habits and patterns are rapidly reshaping under the covid-19 crisis mckenzie 2020 and the unprecedented demand of hand sanitisers is likely to remain as the new normal for an extended period of time we therefore aim to provide in this article a technical perspective on the functionality and development of alcohol-based hand sanitiser formulationsoverall the application of abhrs remains more versatile convenient quick and less irritating than hand washing with soap and water edmonds et al 2012 for the general public the cdc suggests washing the hands with soap and water rather than to use the abhr whenever possible this is because hand washing can virtually remove all types of pathogens while the hand sanitiser can effectively kill 999 of germs eg less effective with cryptosporidium norovirus and clostridium difficile moreover in case of extremely greasy or dirty hands abhr effectiveness is reduced due to poor penetration of the product through the layer of dirt in soiled hands in contrast the detergents in a hand wash enable deeper cleaning and higher removal of germs moreover potentially harmful substances can only be washed by a soap and water rather than hand sanitisation using abhrs however handwashing facilities are not readily available at work or public places moreover in instances where hand sensitisation is needed more frequently such as during frequent contact with individuals or products the abhrs are the most effective and convenient infection preventive measure cdc 2019a hadaway 2020 it is however important to emphasise that abhrs only work when used correctly thus considering that not all abhr formulations are the same appropriate labelling is important in directing the correct doseamount needed to achieve an adequate sanitisation hadaway 2020 the choice of container closure and dispenser is also vital in dispensing the correct amount of the sanitiser on each usethe cdc recommends a frequent sanitisation of hands in healthcare settings due to the potential frequent contact of hands with pathogens while being not so heavily soiled and greased the abhrs are therefore the most effective measure of infection control during routine patient care however when hands are visibly dirty such as before and after eating or after using restrooms healthcare providers need to wash their hands properly with soap and water cdc 2019b edmonds et al 2012 gold and avva 2020there are some reports of novel formulations emerging on the market claiming to be effective against all viruses including sars-cov-2 dei pharmaceuticals 2020 however there is no evidence yet published to support the label claims in a recent article jansen has examined the evidence on disinfectants efficacy against sars-cov-2 jansen 2020 it was noted that definitive claims on the effectivity of various disinfectants against sars-cov-2 cannot be made simply because this is a new virus and the range of off-the-shelf abhrs has never been tested for sars-cov-2 like other respiratory viruses the new coronavirus is known to spread mainly from person-to-person through airborne droplets cdc 2020 moreover the information about the virus survival on surfaces and the environment is still limited jansen 2020 it has however been indicated that sars-cov-2 can also be transmitted through surfaces as it can survive for a long period of time on various materials for instance the virus remains stable on plastic and stainless steel for 23 days van doremalen et al 2020 this implies that anyone touching infected surfaces can potentially contact and spread the virus jansen 2020 it is in this context that hand disinfection becomes highly crucialsars-cov-2 is an enveloped virus hinting the presence of a lipid layer protecting the viral core typically enveloped viruses can be effectively inactivated by most antiseptic agents jansen 2020 a study in 2017 reported that zika zikv ebola ebov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and other enveloped viruses were all efficiently killed by two alcohol-based formulations one containing ethanol 80 vv and the second containing isopropyl alcohol 75 vv recommended by the who siddharta et al 2017 these data confirm that abhrs can be successfully used as an effective infection preventive measure during viral outbreaksa recent unpublished study reveals that both commercial alcohols and the who-recommended alcohol-based hand rubs can effectively inactivate sars-cov-2 the virus responsible to cause covid-19 kratzel et al 2020 remarkably both ethanol and 2-propanol individually could kill the virus within 30 s at a minimal final concentration of  30 authors did not specify the concentration units this provides a strong evidence to support the use of abhr amid the covid-19 outbreak efficacy of alcohols in hand sanitisation is also dependent on various other factors such as the quantity applied to the hands the dose the exposure time and the applicationrubbing techniquehow long hands need to be rubbed together when using an abhr is an important question but the recommended time by various public health organisations varies from as low as 10s to 60s boyce et al 2009 it has been argued that rubbing time is significantly affected by various other factors such as the dose of the sanitiser the hand size application surface area and the formulation itself wilkinson et al 2017 reported that drying time was strongly associated with the dose and hand surface area the evaporation rates of alcoholic ingredients may vary in gel and liquid-based sanitisers and may directly correlate to the time when hands start to feel dry after application this can therefore directly influence healthcare professionals perception of the sufficient rubbing time kenters et al 2020the sanitisation dose may be controlled by using specialised containers and closure systems such as pump containers that may dispense a pre-calibrated amount on each dispensing this can guarantee that a minimum effective dose is always dispensed to assure efficacy however the dose is subject to sanitisation surface area and may be subject to users perception on how much is sufficient an adequate training on hand hygiene and sanitisation amid infection control within health care facilities is therefore a key to ensure that a correct dose and technique are always used however this is complicated by the range of formulations and products available on the market with varying viscosity and alcoholic evaporation rates a standardised monographed formulation with tightly controlled specification can be a way forwardalcohol in hand rubs can cause skin dryness particularly over frequent exposure emollients as well as other skin conditioners have been shown to decrease the drying effect of alcohol on the skin ahmed-lecheheb et al 2012 harbarth et al 2002 kramer et al 2002glycerin is the most commonly used humectant in hand sanitisers and other cosmetic products houben et al have shown that incorporation of glycerin in hand rubs promotes hand hydration to an extent that is directly proportional to its concentration in the formulation houben et al 2006 in another study abhrs containing glycerin were found to increase skin hydration but also to decrease the surface ph and superficial sebum content on the skin although not to an extent to compromise the skin barrier function ahmed-lecheheb et al 2012 a very high concentration of glycerin can also have detrimental effects as it can slow down the drying time and can increase the sticky sensation on the skin especially if large or repeated doses are used greenaway et al 2018 houben et al 2006 glycerol can lower the bactericidal activity of abhrs when used at a concentration of 145 vv suchomel et al 2013 reducing glycerol content to concentrations of 050073 has been proposed as the best compromise in maintaining antimicrobial activity while still offering the needed skin protection menegueti et al 2019 suchomel et al 2017emollients other than glycerol can also be used to improve user acceptability and skin tolerance of the abhrs suchomel et al 2017 2013 in a recent study suchomel et al have shown that the bactericidal efficacy of an isopropanol-based hand rub was decreased by glycerol but not by a novel humectant made of ethylhexylglycerin dexpanthenol and a fatty alcohol authors have suggested that other humectants should also be screened for their ability to maintain microbial efficacy suchomel et al 2017propylene glycol is the second most used humectant in cosmetic products and it is generally used for this purpose at concentrations of 2 to 5 being less expensive than glycerol it can be more desirable to be used in hand sanitisers barel et al 2009 flick 1989 aloe vera gel has also been used for long in various cosmetic products as a humectant being able to retard water evaporation from formulations yet to a lower extent than glycerin and propylene glycol aloe vera gel can be used in combination with glycerol and propylene glycol to improve their water evaporation retardation effect at high concentrations ie 25 aloe vera gel can also contribute to the firmness of formulations meadows nd aloe vera-based healthcare products being considered natural constitute nowadays a large and growing market javed and atta-ur-rahman 2014 this is probably related to an increasing interest of consumers towards natural products thus the incorporation of aloe vera gel in hand rubs can be considered a good marketing strategy for abhrsthickeners are polymers that differently from small molecules cannot be univocally identified by the chemical name or cas number which does not take into consideration relevant features such as molecular weight degree of substitution ratio between substituents etc indeed each of the aforementioned viscosity enhancers is commercially available in a variety of grades exhibiting variable thickening behaviour rheological properties solubility and even regulatory classification eg pharmaceutical or cosmetic or food grade the actual grade and the percentage of the polymer used in commercially available abhrs are however not known or disclosed on the label for these reasons selecting the appropriate excipient for a particular application is important to help with this we have analysed and hereby report the viscosity and rheological behaviour of various commercially available hand sanitisers in italy such measured parameters of marketed products were then used as a reference to explain how gels of similar characteristics can be manufactured using different viscosity enhancersthe thickening behaviour of 10 commercial hand sanitisers sold in the italian market was analysed all the products were tested by measuring the shear stress on increasing shear rate viscometry test to study the effect of shear rate on viscosity details relative to the experimental procedures are reported in method sm 1 and fig sf1 in supplementary information we only tested hand sanitisers from a single pack taken from a single batch for each product the general behaviour of all the products is reported in fig 2
and table 1
 as expected most of the abhrs exhibited a shear-thinning behaviour as typical of polymeric dispersions the only exception was the product containing hec which resembled the newtonian behaviour and exhibited very low viscosity noteworthy the product containing hec also showed white precipitates settled on the bottom which on shaking resulted in a cloudy system all the other alcoholic gels containing carbomer had a characteristic plastic behaviour refer to table 1 for the yield stress values with a strong shear rate dependency power law index  05 in table 1 all the carbomer-thickened gels showed almost superimposable viscosity profiles except for apoteke tigienizzo and steriman gel which were characterised by a lower consistency finally the only product containing hpmc showed the typical behaviour of a weak gel characterised by pseudo-plasticity and a moderate shear rate dependency power law index almost double compared to carbomer gel but still much lower than 1 interestingly the hpmc-based gel exhibited a viscosity similar to that of the carbomer-based gels at the higher shear ratesoverall the unique and stronger shear rate dependency of carbomer-based products means that compared to other gels they are more solid-like on standing and become more liquid-like under agitation shear-thinning this dual behaviour is a desirable feature for hand rubs as the carbomer gel will have an attractive robust consistency a nice appearance and could still be dispensed in consistent doses - not being runny then during application the viscosity would decrease drastically under the high shear of the hand rubbing action which will help in well spreading of the product over the surface areacarbomers also known as carboxypolymethylene are a series of synthetic high molecular weight and cross-linked poly-acrylic acid polymers widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries for the formulation of semisolid and oral liquid products of various consistencies these polymers are effective thickeners suspending agents and stabilisers at a very low concentration 013 ww carbomers differ by the cross-linker and its density and the solvent used during their polymerisation based on the cross-linker type carbomers can be grouped into carbomer homopolymers acrylic acid crosslinked with allyl sucrose or allyl pentaerythritol carbomer copolymers acrylic acid and c10-c30 alkyl acrylate crosslinked with allyl pentaerythritol and carbomer interpolymers carbomer homopolymer or copolymer that contains a block copolymer of polyethylene glycol and a long chain alkyl acid ester for each category the cross-linking density can be low medium or high providing polymers with a varying ability to increase the viscosity of aqueous systems the traditional carbomers are still synthesised in benzene a toxic solvent that cannot be used for pharmaceutical applications the pharmaceutical-grade carbomers are synthesised in either ethyl acetate or a mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane for an unambiguous designation of these copolymers numeric codes such as 910 934 940 941 are used as the suffix within the carbomer nomenclature to provide an indication of their molecular weight and specific components of the polymer lubrizol 2005all carbomers must be neutralised to ph 6575 to achieve the maximum viscosity the consistency of the dispersion starts to decrease at ph  90 for aqueous dispersions a large number of neutralising agents such as sodium hydroxide ammonium hydroxide potassium hydroxide l-arginine aminomethyl propanol tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenediamine triethanolamine tromethamine peg-15 cocamine diisopropanolamine and triisopropanolamine can be used when carbomers are used for thickening of ethanol isopropanol or hydroalcoholic mixtures like in hand sanitisers the neutraliser must be selected carefully to avoid the precipitation of the polymer metallic alkalis such as naoh and koh are recommended to be used in hydroalcoholic mixtures of up to 20 ethanol and triethanolamine in those containing up to 5060 ethanol considering the percentage of ethanol generally employed in the formulation of hand rubs 6095 the most suitable neutralisers are tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenediamine neutrol te aminomethyl propanol amp ultra pc2000 and triisopropanolamine up to 8090 of ethanol lubrizol 2002carbomers have thickening properties much higher than cellulose derivatives at a ph range of 59 a typical 05 ww carbomer solution at ph 75 exhibits viscosities in a range of 400011000 mpas carbopol 971p 2940039400 mpas carbopol 974p and 4000060000 mpas carbopol 980 those are the grades commonly employed in topical products such as lotions creams and gels lubrizol 2009 an evaluation of the effect of ethanol on the consistency of the hydrogel prepared in hydroalcoholic media is not straightforward comparison studies on hydrogels in pure water and in hydroalcoholic media are lacking one report that compared the flow behaviour of carbopol ultrez 10 0105 ww in aqueous and hydroalcoholic media 15 wv and 30 wv ethanol fresno et al 2002 showed that the presence of ethanol decreases the consistency of the hydrogel the decrease in consistency was more pronounced at a polymer concentration of 01 ww than at 05 ww and at a low ph ph  4 osei-asare et al also prepared a gel using 62 vv of ethanol with 081 vv carbopol 940 but unfortunately viscosity data were only partially reported osei-asare et al 2020some manufacturers have also provided guidance on carbomer selection for hydroalcoholic gels lubrizol suggested the use of ultrez due to their higher transparency and ease of preparation lubrizol 1998 while ashland proposed carbomer 980 at around 035 for a gel with 72 ww of ethanol ashland 2018a considering this and our experience we recommend 0306 high viscosity carbomers carbopol ultrez 10 or carbomer 980 or 051 medium viscosity types carbomer 974 along with aminomethyl propanol as a neutralising agent for the preparation of abhrshec is a non-ionic partially substituted polyhydroxyethyl ether of cellulose available under the trade name of natrosol ashland or cellosize dow it is prepared by the reaction of ethylene oxide with cellulose in the presence of sodium hydroxide under controlled conditions each glucose unit of the cellulose backbone contains three hydroxyl groups capable of reaction if all three hydroxyl groups of each glucose residue react the theoretical degree of substitution ds would be 3 although this is not practically achievable the introduced hydroxyethyl groups can indeed react again with the free ethylene oxide at basic conditions giving a side chain containing a different number of hydroxyethyl groups to account for this the total molar substitution ms describes the average number of ethylene oxide molecules attached to each glucose residue hec with ds and ms of 15 and 25 respectively is known as natrosol 250 natrosol 250 is available in a range of molecular weight grades l m h hh differing in their aqueous viscosity where the l m h hh refers to low medium high and very high viscosity respectively furthermore the pharmaceutical-grade of the product is indicated by the abbreviation pharm whereas the cosmetic grade is indicated by the abbreviation cs aqualon 2000 ashland 2018b hec is easily dissolved in cold or hot water but unlike other cellulosic derivatives it is insoluble in organic solvents the low or medium molecular weight types are fully soluble in glycerol and have a good solubility in hydroalcoholic media containing up to 60 ethanol ashland 2018b specifically the manufacturer indicates that hec is soluble in a 7030 waterethanol mixture and partially soluble in a 4060 waterethanol mixture both at 25 c and 60 c ashland 2018bnatrosol 250 has been used as a thickener rheological modifier colloidal protective stabiliser and suspending agent the viscosity of aqueous dispersions increases with increasing the concentration and molecular weight mw of hec used for instance at a concentration of 2 ww the viscosity increases from around 20 mpas for l-type polymer up to around 100000 mpas for hh-type the manufacturer does not provide further information regarding the viscosity of hec dispersions in hydroalcoholic mixtures aqualon 2000 brown et al measured and compared the elastic modulus g of 3 hec the type was not specified dispersions in water and in hydroalcoholic mixtures containing up to 60 ethanol the measured g was 354 pa in water the consistency of the dispersion reached a maximum at 30 ethanol 470 pa then decreased again at 40 or higher ethanolic concentrations the viscosity dropped to 229 pa in 60 ethanol due to poor hydration of the polymer in less aqueous media brown et al 1998 therefore high molecular weight hec 12 could be suitable for the preparation of hand rub gels containing 5060 ethanol hec gel formulations containing 60 alcohol are not recommended due to the poor solubility of the polymer and the cloudy appearance that results as shown in fig sf2 supplementary information since 6095 ethanol is necessary for efficient hand disinfection hec does not seem to be a suitable viscosity enhancer for abhrshpc is a non-ionic water-soluble ether derivative of cellulose with remarkable aqueous thickening and stabilising properties hpc is manufactured by ashland and commercialised under the trade name of klucel it is made by reacting alkali cellulose with propylene oxide at elevated temperatures and pressures at these conditions an ether linkage can be formed between propylene oxide and one or more of the three reactive hydroxyl groups of each glucose monomer unit of the cellulose chain the degree of substitution usually varies from 1 to 3 but can be  3 if the secondary hydroxyl group in the side chain

further grades of hpc are available on the base of viscosity mw and are designated as el e l j g m and h in the order of viscosity klucelhydroxypropylcellulose physical and chemical properties 2017hpc has been used as a thickening agent providing aqueous systems with a broad viscosity ranging from  10 mpas to  10000 mpas depending on the type used at 2 wt in pure water viscosity increases exponentially to the increase in concentration particularly a maximum viscosity  10000 mpas can be reached in the range of 055ww for the high mw grades ie h m and g a maximum viscosity of around 1000 mpas can be reached using the intermediate mw grades ie j l at 810ww while a maximum viscosity between 100 mpas and 1000 mpas can be obtained using the low mw grades ie e and el limited information is available regarding the effect of ethanol on the viscosity of hpc systems it is possible to prepare a clear hydrogel using 100 ethanol as a dispersion medium for high medium and low mw hpc grades however gels prepared with 100 ethanol have a slightly lower viscosity than the systems prepared in 100 water the percentage decrease in viscosity in pure ethanol is more marked for high and intermediate mw hpc with respect to the low mw hpc moreover the viscosity of gels of hpc in hydroalcoholic media is much higher than gels prepared with pure solvents even water at least for the intermediate mw polymers for instance 2 hpc gels in a hydroalcoholic mixture 3070 ethanolwater had a viscosity of 500 mpas which is higher than those in pure water or ethanol 270 mpas and 210 mpas respectively klucelhydroxypropylcellulose physical and chemical properties 2017 the same trend was reported by ramachadran et al for the viscosity of 3 ww hpc type g in 5050 hydroalcoholic gels

hydroalcoholic gel with 72 ww ethanol ashland 2018a interestingly the viscosity profile reported for the hpc hydroalcoholic gel is superimposable to the viscosity of biot scudo gel a commercially available abhr thickened with hpmc fig 2 therefore we recommend a high molecular weight hpc 115 for the preparation of abhr gelshpmc aka hypromellose in the european and united states pharmacopoeias

groups commercially available hpmc eg methocel metolose pharmacoat vivacoat vivapharm benacel are characterised by differences in terms of abundance of methyl and hydroxypropyl groups and their molecular weights an initial 4-digit number defines the abundancy of the substituent groups specifically 2910 or type e according to colorcon indicates a methoxy substitution of 2830 and a hydroxypropyl substitution of 712 2208 or type k according to colorcon indicates a methoxy substitution of 1924 and a hydroxypropyl substitution of 712 while 2906 or type f according to colorcon indicates a methoxy substitution of 2730 and a hydroxypropyl substitution of 47 the numeric code in the nomenclature is followed by the viscosity mpas of a 2 aqueous solution for instance hypromellose 2208 4 m is a hpmc having methoxy and hydroxypropyl contents of 1924 and 712 respectively exhibiting a viscosity of 4 mpas at 2 in water dow 2002 li et al 2005hpmc is commonly used as a thickener in aqueous solutions and is extensively researched in the literature it is also used in a large variety of binary solvent systems as per manufacturer dow 2002 however it is not much used in non-aqueous solvents brown et al reported the values of storage moduli of 5 hmpc hydroalcoholic mixtures up to 80 ethanolic medium like hec and hpc the viscosity behaviour followed a bell-shaped curve with a maximum viscosity at 50 ethanol the viscosity of the mixture decreased to a level equal to that of pure water when the ethanol approached 80 brown et al 1998 robert et al studied the effect of ethanol up to a concentration of 40 for gels containing 2 hpmc 2208 4 m and found a similar observation to that of brown et al roberts et al 2007interestingly the rheology of 2 hpmc 2208 4 m gels in 1040 hydroalcoholic mixtures from roberts et al 2007 is similar to a commercially available abhr which is biot scudo gel thickened with hpmc table 1 also the viscosity profile of 15 hpmc 2208 10 m gel containing 72 ww of alcohol from ashland ashland 2018a was similar to that of the commercially available product biot scudo gel fig 2 acknowledging that the commercial product unknown polymer concentration and the gels reported in the literature known polymer concentration have similar viscosity the use of hpmc 10 m  15 and hpmc 4 m  225 both types 2208 and 2910 for the preparation of abhrs is recommendedcmc is a water-soluble anionic derivative of cellulose that acts as a thickening agent rheological modifier stabiliser protective colloid and a film-forming agent cmc is made by the reaction of cellulose with sodium monochloroacetate in the presence of sodium hydroxide under strictly controlled conditions feddersen and thorp 1993 cmc is available from ashland under the tradenames aqualon cmc and blanose cmc depending on the site of production and by other manufacturers with trade names such as tylose cb and walocel c as for the other cellulose derivatives the physical properties of cmc can be varied by the ds and mw cmc is typically offered in three different ds such as 07 09 and 12 referred to as cmc type 7 9 and 12 and a broad range of molecular weights indicated by the letter l low m medium and h high the regulatory classification is given by the letters f for food cs for cosmetic and ph for pharmaceutical compliance according to us european eu and japanese j pharmacopoeia ashland 2012cmc is soluble in water at all temperatures and forms clear colloidal dispersions at 16 with viscosity between 10 and 10000 mpas it is practically insoluble in most organic solvents including ethanol 95 however it can be dispersed providing clear systems in hydroalcoholic mixtures of up to 40 ethanol at higher contents up to 60 ethanol cmc can be dispersed but it provides opaque systems low-viscosity grades work better with alcoholic gels than high-viscosity types which show clouding and polymer precipitation at higher ethanol content the manufacturer does not provide any information regarding the effect of ethanol on the viscosity of the dispersions feddersen and thorp 1993 the only reference available is from brown et al who compared the viscosity of 10 cmc the type and mw is not specified in pure water and hydroalcoholic mixtures up to 40 ethanol a remarkable increase in the viscosity was observed from pure water g 432 pa to a mixture containing 30 ethanol g1186 pa followed by a drop g 671 pa at 40 ethanol which may be attributed to the poor solubility of cmc in higher alcoholic media brown et al 1998 according to the literature low viscosity cmc being more stable in ethanol is more suitable for the preparation of gels with a maximum ethanol concentration of 50 in our experience it was found that cmc dispersions precipitate and become opaque at 60 ww ethanolic concentrations fig f3 supplementary information it is therefore not advisable to use cmc for abhrs containing higher ethanol concentrations recommended for optimum germicide efficacyin the direct addition method all the components except for the thickener have to be preliminarily solubilised in the waterethanol mixture then the thickener is added preferentially sifted slowly in the vortex of the vigorously agitated hydroalcoholic solution with mechanical or magnetic stirring aqualon 2000 kluceltm hydroxypropylcellulose 2017 lubrizol 1998 for carbomer thickeners it is necessary to raise the ph to around 657 with the neutralising agent the neutralising agent has to be added dropwise or gradually after the complete dispersion of the polymer possibly monitoring the ph with a ph-meter using electrodes suitable for measuring viscous or dirty samples or a ph-indicator paper gel preparation using this procedure is faster with the surface-treated grades of thickeners such as carbopol ultrez types for carbomer or natrosol r-grades for hpc due to the low lumpiness of these polymers when dispersed for carbomer ultrez grades the direct method should be slightly modified - for more details readers are referred to lubrizol 1998 also all carbomer thickeners are faster to disperse than the others due to their ph-dependent viscosity they remain in the liquid phase during product preparation until the ph is adjusted to neutral this is an advantage as solvent diffusion and polymer hydration are much more rapid in liquid state than in an already formed gel system on the other hand the direct addition method can be slower and more difficult for hpmc and hpc gels even for surface-treated grades due to their high tendency to form lumps during dispersion the direct addition method is a very effective and economical procedure as long as an efficient stirring system is available for productionthis procedure requires the thickeners to be pre-wetted with a water-miscible organic solvent in our experience this is the standard procedure used in pharmaceutical practice the best results can be obtained using glycerol or propylene glycol as wetting agents at 11 to 14 polymerwetting agent ratio the wetting procedure is usually operated using mortar and pestle when a homogenous wet slurry is obtained the hydroalcoholic solution containing all the other components previously dissolved can be gradually added always under vigorous stirring with the pestle the addition of the neutralising agent for carbomer polymers follows the same procedure reported in the direct addition method the reverse addition method is only suitable for the production of small batches when magnetic or mechanical stirring systems are not available therefore we recommend this procedure for small-scale extemporaneous compounding in community or hospital pharmaciesthe preparation of gel containing high viscosity grades of hpmc or hpc could be sometimes difficult due to the tendency to form lumps a common procedure to avoid such problem and to speed-up the preparation is represented by the hotcold technique dow 2002 however such a procedure is unsuitable for alcoholic gels because of the potential loss of ethanol content during the preparation due to evaporation roberts at al reported the preparation of 2 hpmc 2208 4 m hydroalcoholic gels containing 40 ethanol using a modification of the standard hotcold technique roberts et al 2007 briefly an aqueous gel is prepared with the hotcold technique and then while cooling ethanol and other volatile components if any is added under stirring although this procedure could represent an interesting alternative to the previously reported methods there is not enough information to support its use in the preparation of hydroalcoholic gels containing  60 ethanolanother preparation method that can be used to prevent lumping especially for hpmc and hpc is a combination hybrid of the direct and reverse addition methods briefly a wet slurry is prepared similar to the reverse addition method and then it is gradually added under mechanical or magnetic stirring to the hydroalcoholic mixtures as in the direct addition method ashland 2017 dow 2002a market research was carried out in italy at the beginning of april 2020 amid the covid-19 to review the range of commercially available abhr products in local pharmacies supermarkets and online retailers table 2
provides a summary of these products including their composition alcoholic content type of thickeners and legal classification extracted from the products label various products sold online with essential information missing on the label were not included in the tablecomparing the thickening agents used in the formulation of hand rubs it is evident that most of the products are made viscous by the use of carbomer and an amine-based neutralising agent ie aminomethyl propanol or triethanolamine the only exceptions were represented by two products thickened by either hpmc or hec and a third product in which carbomer neutralised by sodium hydroxide was used interestingly these three hand gels were among the ones on which we performed the rheological analysis table 1 whereby they showed different rheological behaviour compared to most other analysed products the product containing hec was practically liquid with a white precipitate at the bottom that could be explained by a decreased polymer solubility at high ethanolic concentration indeed the manufacturer of hec indicates that this polymer possesses good solubility in hydroalcoholic media containing up to 60 ethanol ashland 2018b hinting at a decrease in polymer solubility at higher ethanolic concentrations as for the carbomer gel neutralised with sodium hydroxide it was slightly opaque and less viscous compared to the majority of the carbomer products table 1 noteworthily sodium hydroxide is not recommended as a suitable neutralising agent for carbomer-based hydroalcoholic gels by the manufacturer due to possible polymer precipitation lubrizol 2002 as stated earlier therefore it can be concluded that the standard combination of carbomeramine-based neutralising agents seems to form a product with good gel qualityanother interesting aspect that arises from the products analysis in table 2 is their regulatory status these products are marketed in europe following two different regulatory pathways the cosmetic products regulation regulation eu n 12232009 2009 and the biocidal products regulation regulation eu n 5282012 2012 the label claims on the product determine the choice of the regulation market if the product is used to cleanse or clean the skin then it is subjected to the cosmetic products regulation while if the use of the product aims at disinfecting the skin from potentially infectious organisms or if the action of the product goes beyond the general use of personal hygiene then the hand sanitiser should follow the biocidal products regulation the marketing authorisation procedures and labelling requirements significantly differ between the two regulatory pathways specifically a biocide has to be authorised by a competent authority national health authority or european commission after the evaluation of a dossier containing all the information regarding the safety and effectiveness of the product the product label must report the concentration of the active ingredient including alcohol the uses for which the product is authorised including all warnings hazard and precautionary statements on the other hand evidence of safety is the key requirement for a cosmetic product for the market authorisation the company has to notify the product information file pif to the cosmetic products notification portal cpnp which makes the information electronically available to competent authorities or poison centres the product label must contain the list of ingredients in descending order of weight particular precautions or warnings and the cosmetic activity unless it is clear from its presentationthis implies that the biocide and cosmetic hand rubs can have different amounts of ethanol in the products all alcohol gels in table 2 commercialised as biocides report the ethanol concentration in the label which is always in the range 60 to 95 suggested as a safe and effective concentration for disinfection by the us fda and who boyce et al 2009 fda us 1994 conversely reporting the concentration of ethanol is not mandatory for cosmetic sanitisers of the 13 alcoholic gels approved as cosmetics the amount of ethanol is reported only in 5 products where one contained only 50 alcohol surprisingly in three products water is listed as the first ingredient followed by ethanol suggesting an ethanolic concentration of even 50 by weight such cosmetic products although good for cleaning the skin are not fit for use as disinfectants this can be misleading for the general public as they might not be aware of the product suitability amid the covid-19 pandemic consumers aiming to buy an effective hand disinfectant might unintentionally pick up from the shelves a very similar hand gel product which is however not a disinfectant ie a cosmetic it is crucial in this context that pharmacists and retailers promptly advise customers to choose the appropriate product for the right purpose ie disinfection or simple cleaning overall during a pandemic providing consumers with the correct information on hand sanitisers should be a priority of utmost importance perhaps also regulatory agencies could consider revisiting the current regulations to better safeguard consumersbuilding upon the information and outlook provided in the previous sections of this review a guide on formulation selection for the development of hand sanitisers is presented in table 3
 here functional ingredients are grouped in classes and possible options within the same class are evaluated and compared in terms of timeease of preparation the equipment required for the preparation cost of material antimicrobial efficacy product appearanceacceptability ease of use and moisturising capacitydermatological profile cas number of materials is also indicatedin response to the health habits and market patterns extreme changes brought about by the current covid-19 outbreak we review here the current knowledge and trends on the formulation of hand rubs the article also presents a detailed guide on ingredients selection and formulation design and manufacture of quality hand sanitisers the main outcomes of the analysis presented in this review are listed belowevidences show that hand sanitisation is a main infection preventive measure during a pandemic justifying the emphasis by the various healthcare organisations across the world the huge increase in sales witnessed during the covid-19 outbreak and the consequent shortage of hand sanitisers the european commission has recently highlighted the tendency of many economic operators to consider the possibility to shift andor increase the production of hand cleaners and disinfectants to respond to the current needs european commission 2020 businesses producing hand sanitisers and compounding pharmacists are now challenged to keep up with the exceptionally high demand for such productsmost gel formulations contain carbomers and an amine-based neutralising agent to form the gel matrix other gelling polymers could also be used in theory as alternatives however such polymers do not often provide hydroalcoholic gel products of the same ideal rheological behaviour and appearance touch feel ease of use and stability carbomer remains in our opinion the gold standard gel former in alcohol-based hand sanitiserssubstandard products can be available in certain markets when the low standard is related to the selection of less appropriate excipients or formulation procedures but the alcoholic concentration is maintained between the accepted standard of disinfection ie 6095 for ethanol the risk for consumers is mainly a reduced perception of product quality and attractiveness and reduced ease of use while overall product efficacy is maintained the poorly formulated products may also be subject to inappropriate use and sanitisation techniquemuch more worrying is the presence of hand cleaners on the market containing low substandard andor unknown concentrations of alcohol that are not commercialised as disinfectants there is a tangible risk that consumers might and are using hand cleaners which product appearance is very similar to hand disinfectants while being unaware that such products cannot ensure disinfection and are not fit for use amid the covid-19 pandemic to minimise this risk 1 customer counselling by pharmacists and retailers regarding the selection of appropriate products for covid-19 infection control is highly necessary 2 online purchase of hand sanitiser from unknown or unreliable e-commerce sites by the public is discouraged 3 awareness campaigns to educate the public on discriminating between products fit for general hygienecleansing from those for disinfection fit the for covid-19 infection control should be promoted and finally 4 regulatory bodies should revisit current regulations on hand sanitisers to better safeguard consumersthe demand for the hand sanitisers amid the covid-19 pandemic is likely to remain high for long until more efficient infection preventive measures become available such as a sars-cov-2 vaccine moreover public awareness on the importance of hand sanitisation during this pandemic is likely to have long term effects on hygiene habits across the world the public is likely to endure the routine use of hand sanitisers even beyond the covid-19 era as a new norm of self-hygiene
the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paperthe 2019 coronavirus disease called covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the covid-19 outbreak was identified in wuhan china in december 2019 world health organization 2020 the world health organization who declared the covid-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 and a pandemic on march 11 2020 the covid-19 pandemic is affecting almost the entire world as on may 16 2020 covid-19 is affecting 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances there have been about 469 million cases of covid-19 and 310800 deaths with about 180 million people recovered wwwworldometersinfocoronavirusaccording to who covid-19 spreads primarily from person to person through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs sneezes or even speaks people can catch covid-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus these droplets are relatively heavy generally do not travel more than a few feet and they fall to the ground or onto surfaces in a few secondsthis is why social and physical distancing is considered effective in preventing the spread these droplets can also land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables doorknobs and handrails people can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth this is why it is important to wash ones hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rubthe spread of covid-19 and resulting mortality in a region is influenced by many factors including the general health of the people the personal and environmental opportunities for the spread and the type of treatment and welfare schemes available for instance people with good health generally young people are less affected by covid-19 while people with pre-existing health conditions eg diabetes kidney diseases high blood pressure cancer are affected more indeed far greater percentages of deaths have been reported among elder people and those with pre-existing conditions when compared to younger people and those with good health high population density which influences the distance between people low temperature which facilitates the spread of the virus and less waterdisinfectants generally lead to more spread
numerous studies have examined the spread impact and control of covid-19 such studies have addressed a wide variety of aspects these include how population flow drives the distribution of covid-19 eg jia et al 2020 effects of travel restrictions on the spread of covid-19 outbreak eg chinazzi et al 2020 links between climate factors and covid-19 spread eg bashir et al 2000 wu et al 2020 drug development against covid-19 eg abd el-aziz and stockland 2020 and plight of migrants and refugees during covid-19 and calls for their inclusion in response to covid-19 eg orcutt et al 2020 and impact of lockdown on the environment including surface water quality and air quality eg yunus et al 2019 mahato et al 2020 muhammad et al 2020in the context of covid-19 spread and control water plays a particularly important role this is because according to who and governments around the world one of the most effective ways to reduce ones chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 is to regularly and thoroughly wash ones hands with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based hand rub washing ones hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub kill viruses that may be on ones hands therefore the availability and accessibility of water can significantly influence the extent of spread of covid-19 in a region in this regard developing and under-developed regions have a particular disadvantage since the accessibility to water in such regions even for the most basic needs eg drinking sanitation is generally limited eg sivakumar 2011a it is also important to note that these are also the regions generally with high population and population density therefore mitigating or controlling the spread of covid-19 is highly challenging in these regions as it necessitates identifying accessing and supplying significant quantity of additional water resources all around not to mention the social-distancingdespite this i believe the issues associated with water demand and supply to tackle covid-19 has not gained serious attention until now a key reason for this may be the so-called lockdown or stay-at-home restriction that has been and continues to be imposed in many countries at national level or local levels including in some of the most populous countries such as china india and the united states the lockdown has forced almost the entire population in many countries to stay at home this has greatly reduced the need for washing or cleaning ones hands and hence reduced the need for additional water use this situation will certainly change however once the lockdown is partially relaxed or completely removed once people start going out of their homes to their workplaces and other public places as was before they will realize the need to wash their hands more often and thus will need more water this will be not only in their workplaces and other public places but also at their own homes since they will have to wash their hands after returning to their homes from outside to make sure they are not spreading the virus at home it is important therefore to ask whether there are enough water facilities in workplaces and other public places and also at their homes for everyone for the foreseeable future this question assumes particular significance since covid-19 will likely last for years not just months according to many health professionals epidemiologists and others in fields related to infectious diseases and their effects indeed there are concerns that covid-19 may never go away and that we will have to get used to living a new normal way of life ie living with covid-19this means that our demands for water will significantly increase in the future especially in the domestic industrial and recreational sectors for instance considering a country like india with a population of over 13 billion even a small amount of additional water requirement for washing ones hands will increase the water demand by at least a few billions of liters with the already significant demand for water for the agricultural sector which currently uses more than 70 of water globally and even more than 90 in some regions there will be enormous pressure on our water resources this raises several important questions where can we find the additional water resources how to bring the water to where it will be needed both urban and rural areas and throughout the countries what will be the additional water storage and treatment facilities required for water supply how much will it cost will water pricing need to be introduced or increased to cover the costs where water pricing currently does not exist or where there is already water pricing how will the society respond to water pricing especially when it is introduced for the first time in a region as in many developing and under-developing regionsin addition to the increase in the demands for water quantity it imposes covid-19 also presents challenges from the perspective of water quality for instance use of more water and also soap and disinfectants to wash ones hands to control the spread of covid-19 will increase the quantity of wastewater with perhaps even poorer quality coming from homes workplaces and other public places this will in turn increase the required capacities of sewerdrainage structures and wastewater treatment facilities before such wastewater can be discharged safely to appropriate places including to nearby water courses this means there will be additional costs for such potentially new drainage and treatment facilities required it is relevant to note at this point that in many developing and under-developed regions it is common for the untreated wastewater particularly from many industries but also from homes to be discharged into the nearby water courses assuming that this trend will continue at least for the foreseeable future the additional quantity and poorer quality of wastewater will have serious effects on water quality in nearby water bodies including rivers and lakes it is indeed encouraging to note that the quality of water in rivers lakes and other water bodies around the world especially in developing and under-developed regions have significantly improved during the lockdown period eg yunus et al 2020 this however is only temporary and there is no doubt that the situation will become normal again once the lockdown is overfurthermore there are serious concerns about the handling and disposal of products and materials used to control the spread of covid-19 and to treat the covid-19 patients eg face masks hand gloves and personal protective equipment after their use this is because their collection handling and disposal are dangerous and require undertaking extreme precautions it is also important to note that disposing the bodies of covid-19 patients after their death has been an enormously challenging and excruciating experience as has been witnessed in many places around the world handling and disposal of wastes related to covid-19 often require a large quantity of water both during and afterthe above observations suggest that covid-19 will have serious impacts on the water sector in terms of both water quantity and water quality this will bring new and enormous challenges to water planning management and governance such challenges include aspects related to water sources infrastructure for storage and distribution sewerdrainage structures wastewater treatment and disposal and water pricing among others it is also appropriate to note at this point that there are already significant challenges in water planning and management due to population growth and improving living standards global climate change is anticipated to bring its own challenges to the water sector eg sivakumar 2011b in terms of both water quantity and water quality there are also concerns about our ability to produce food and generate energy to meet the future demands which depend to a great extent on water for irrigation and hydroelectricity chen et al 2016how will all these affect our future water planning and management activities especially if covid-19 and its impact last for a long time will totally new planning and management strategies be needed and in what shape and form what can the governments around the world do to address these what can the water managers do what can the people do these are some of the basic questions policy makers water managers environmentalists non-governmental organizations and also common people should be starting to ask needless to say water researchers have a particularly important role in asking these questions and in finding solutions there is no question that this will require interdisciplinary collaborations among water researchers from diverse fields including earth sciences engineering economics law social sciences and psychology while there have already been some efforts towards such interdisciplinary collaborations to address water issues there is still a long way to go especially in view of any new global-scale disasters such as the covid-19 pandemiclooking at the exponential developments we have recently made in diverse fields especially in technology and medicine not many people would have imagined that an infectious disease would almost literally lockdown the entire world and force us to stay at home however that is exactly what is happening now what is even more we cannot be sure that this kind of thing will never happen again indeed something may just be lurking around to cause havoc whether infectious disease or other water seems to offer solutions to almost all the problems on the earth however where to find solutions when the problem is water itself we indeed need to have a long vision to look after and take care of our precious water i hope we will steer our efforts in this direction much more than we have until now if we do not have water to wash our hands then we will be washing our hands of our problemsthe era of corona-virus-disease-19 covid-19 is an important historical period from various points of view from the world health to the huge cascade of socio-economic implications everyday habits have been turned upside down and the way of life of people all over the globe engaged in all activities especially in the health sector will be involved in this necessary change dentists being in close contact with the patients droplets and aerosols generated have to revise the operating protocols to protect the team and the patients from the risk of infectious diseasesunfortunately the pandemic covid-19 will not stop immediately and everyone will have to face each other very long working and social recovery times of the population in this time a large part of the population will avoid dental treatment other than those imposed by pain or urgency both due to money issues and principally for a psychological reason it will not be easy to overcome the fear of infection for many the dental practice is a source of possible infections considering that the first person at risk is the dentist himself the scenario in dental practices is very complex and several problems can arise which are dangerous for the dental practice 123456789for an infection to emerge it is necessary that an adequate number of specific microorganisms can infect a person or groups the classic contamination paths clearly incorporate all the dental unit team and patient body fluids in direct contact with the wound site during operation injuries of the skin and the mucosa with sharp objects body fluids and contaminated material contact with eyes aerosols arising during the operation with air produced by turbine and ultrasonic devices contamination via droplet and surgical smoke formed during electro-cautery or laser applications 1011 the first problem raised with respect to covid-19 is related to the easy spread of viral agents in the air during dental procedures 12131415 hence aerosol is the most aggressive source of covid-19 as well as other viral infections placing dentists and their collaborators at the first line of the exposure to risk scale within the context of healthy personnel 1016the second problem is related to the persistence of the biological agent in operating rooms the aerosol produced by high rotation instruments and ultrasound could remain for several hours in the air and on the surfaces 1718 although it can save the operator if well protected during the therapeutic acts it means that the air will be contaminated thus presenting a risk for operators after removing the ppe personal protective equipment and for the next patientsthis covid-19 pandemic has shown that several people can be positive and spread the viral agents around without any symptoms or signs of biological agents so the dental team a part performing the double triage 1 should consider each patient as sars-cov-2 positive until proven otherwise and use protective equipment in order to preserve their own health and the health of all patients as attending the dental officefor these reasons it is necessary to use rigid and precise operating protocols capable of classifying dental procedures based on risks for the team as well as for the patientsthis study was born from the awareness of a necessary change in decision making processes it involves a rereading of relevant literature in order to build protocols addressed to dentists to assess and modulate the risks of contagion in the dental practice moreover it proposes on the basis of information from literature a classification of dental procedures based on the risk of contagion of infectious agents showing what will change for the dentist and the oral medicine expertan investigation was performed on the online databases pubmed and scopus using a combination of free words and mesh terms dentist and covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or coronavirus-19 and oral health and covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or coronavirus-19 only studies fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were considered eligible for inclusion in this study i performed on human subjects ii written in the english language and iii published in 20192020 the manuscript titles list was highlighted to exclude irrelevant publications and search errors the final selection was performed by reading the full texts of the papers in order to approve each studys eligibility based on sars-cov-2 and other infective agents involved in dentistry data selection and revision was performed by two independent reviewers meb university of foggia and gc university of palermo they singularly analysed the papers and in agreement included 142 papers in this narrative review the authors in consideration of the importance of the emerging topic decided to include also guidelines online documents reviews experts opinions renouncing the prisma-related design of regular systematic reviews figure 1different classes of bacteria viruses and fungi can cause human infections three factors are important for the transmission of these infectious agents an infectious agent a receptive subject and a transmission mode the pathogens involved in infections during health care mainly derive from staff from patients and possible careers but also from inanimate environmental sources figure 2these human sources can 1 have active infections 2 be asymptomatic or in an incubation period or 3 be colonized transiently or chronically with pathogen microorganismsthe infection is the consequence of the contact between a contagious agent and a potential host moreover the same characteristics of the host can influence the onset and the severity of the infectious disease however several other factors can modify the virulence and behavior of infectious disease such as the number of infectious agents the transmission way and the pathogenicity 19 predictors of the disease evolution in a specific subject could be immune status at exposition time age comorbidity and virulence of the agent 20there are two main ways of infective transmission namely vertical from mother to fetus transplacental during vaginal birth or breast feeding and horizontal sexual and non-sexual in a dental setting infectious agents are transmitted in the horizontal non-sexual route 21in the non-sexual horizontal transmission direct or indirect contact eg herpes simplex virus respiratory syncytial virus s aureus droplets eg influenza virus b pertussis or airways eg m tuberculosis are possible routes other viruses can be transmitted by the blood eg hepatitis b and c viruses and hiv via percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure 341422 in synthesis the three main routes of the transmission are 23
contact transmission contact transmission can be through direct contact and indirect contactduring direct contact transmission pathogens are transmitted from an infected person to another subject without an intermediate object or person for example mucous membrane or breaks contact blood or other blood-containing body fluids infected or contact hsv lesion without gloves 34141518222425during indirect contact transmission pathogens are transmitted to the host through objects or human body carrying those pathogens 1718222627282930 moreover all the personal protective equipment ppe such as uniforms or isolation gowns can be contaminated by infectious agents during the treatment of a patient colonized or infected
droplet transmission some infectious agents can reach the host through the direct and indirect contact routes or through droplets 315313233 droplets can carry infectious pathogens travelling for short distances directly from the respiratory tract of the infectious subjects to host reaching susceptible mucosal surfaces 315313233 respiratory droplets are produced during coughs sneezes or talks 34 or by airway health procedures the nasal mucosa conjunctivae and mouth are good portals for respiratory viruses 35 to date the maximum distance that a droplet can reach is not known even if pathogens transmitted by a droplet do not run across long distances 19 the size of droplets has traditionally been defined as being 5 m 19 several types of droplets including those with diameters of 30 m or greater can remain suspended in the air 36 the sizes of the droplets can determine the maximum distance reached largest droplets between 60 and 100 microns totally evaporate before spontaneously falling 2 m away 37 for respiratory exhalation flows the critical factor is the exhalation air velocity these droplets are carried more than 6 m away by exhaled air at a velocity of 50 ms sneezing more than 2 m away at a velocity of 10 ms coughing and less than 1 m away at a velocity of 1 ms breathing 37airborne transmission this means of transmission consists of dissemination of airborne droplet or small particles containing infectious pathogens that remain infective over time and distance eg spores of aspergillus spp and m tuberculosis 31333839404142
sars-cov-2 determines covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 an infectious disease characterized by several important systemic problems such as coronavirus associated pneumonia the principal symptoms are fever cough and breathing difficulties the most patients have mild symptoms some progress to severe pneumonia 43 the diagnosis is performed with the identification of the virus in swabs of patient throat and nose covid-19 can involve the respiratory tract determining a mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome due to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il-1beta and il-6 44 one mechanism that can make the coronavirus lethal is the induction of interstitial pneumonia linked to an over-production of il-6 4445 based on this principle several researchers have started to use an anti-arthritis drug tocilizumab for its anti-il-6 action 46474849 herpes simplex virus hsv can determine a primary infection with minor ulcerative lymphadenopathy gingivostomatitis 50 and a recurrent infection with cold sores herpetic whitlow an hsv infection of the fingers is usually caused by direct contact of the same fingers with infected saliva or a herpetic lesion 515253 skin mucosal lesions and secretions such as saliva can determine the transmission 5455 lesions are usually characterized by vesicles and sequent crusting acyclovir can be used for the treatment of the diseases it is sufficient to wear gloves in order to avoid the herpetic whitlow when the clinician treats patients with hsv lesions 1056varicella zoster virus vzv can determine chickenpox primary disease usually in children and shingles which is very painful secondary disease for the reactivation of a virus residing in sensory ganglia during the latency period 575859 chickenpox disease is highly contagious and spreads via-airborne routes 606162 the virus can infect nonimmune dental team via inhalation of aerosols from a patient incubating the disease masks and gloves can be not sufficient for complete protection of the healthcare workers 10epsteinbarr virus can determine mononucleosis while epithelial tissues can be the site of latency for this virus skin contact blood or saliva can transmit the virus thus members of the dental team are considered to be in the risk group of ebv infection 636465666768 human herpes virus 6 hhv6 can determine generalized rash the virus is present in saliva and a dental team can be considered at low-risk 6970 influenza rhino- and adenoviruses are respiratory viruses for this reason they can be transmitted by droplets and dental team is at risk however masks and gloves can adequately protect healthcare workers 10717273 rubella german measles is a toga virus that can cause cataract deafness and other complications which affect developing foetus so it is particularly dangerous for the female components of a dental team during pregnancy it can be transmitted by droplets in order to avoid these problems dental staff could be vaccinated for mmr measles mumps and rubella 10747576coxsackie virus causes hand-foot and mouth disease and herpangina 77 it is present in saliva and could infect susceptible subjects via direct contact or aerosols 78human t-lymphotropic virus is involved in adult t cell leukaemia and spastic paraparesis this virus can be transmitted through blood 79808182 and in a dental setting it can infect via sharp instruments injuries 10 hepatitis b virus hbv causes acute hepatitis and it is an important risk-agent for the health care staff 8384 the possible ways of transmission are sexual intercourse through blood contaminated material injuries and perinatal way 85868788 so all operators of the dental team should be vaccinated 1089 hepatitis c virus hcv causes non-a and non-b hepatitis and it is transmitted like hbv 85868790 the primary infection is often asymptomatic and the most of infected subjects become carriers of the virus with risk of development of chronic liver disease that could evolve in hepatocellular carcinoma 10 human immunodeficiency virus hiv infects the immune system of susceptible subjects t-helper cells particularly it can be transmitted like hbv sexual intercourse blood borne and perinatal ways 9192 moreover this infection have oral manifestations that can help in diagnosis eg oral candidiasis oral hairy leukoplakia oral necrotising ulcerative gingivitis and oral kaposis sarcoma 1093949596cytomegalovirus cmv is part of the herpes virus family and can cause diseases with several manifestations 97 mumps virus is part of the paramyxoviridae group this pathogen often affects the parotid glands and the consequently characteristic symptom is swelling of these salivary glands 98 moreover this virus can cause inflammation of the ovaries testis pancreas or meninges with several complications after the introduction of the vaccine against measles mumps and rubella mmr mumps incidence has decreased even if several mumps cases have recently been reported 99

mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis and is a bacterium transmitted by inhalation ingestion and inoculation the main symptoms are cervical lymphadenitis and lung infections in order to prevent infection the dental team should be adequately vaccinated and wear ppe 100101102103104105 this bacterium is resistant to chemicals and for this reason sterilization and disinfection protocols must be rigorously performed 10 legionella spp is a gram-negative bacterium that causes legionellosis and generally it resides in water tanks legionellosis occurs with pneumonia sometimes lethal in older people since this pathogen lives in water it can be easily transmitted during dental procedures through aerosols from incorrectly disinfected water circuits 106107 in fact water circuits that remain unused for long periods of time should be checked regularly to prevent legionella bacteria from residing 106107 treponema pallidum causes syphilis and dental team must wear gloves in order to adequate protect themselves 10108meningococcal spp are gram-negative bacteria they are located on the nasopharyngeal mucosa and their presence is generally asymptomatic the bacterium is easily transmitted especially during adolescence when people get together as already mentioned colonization of the nasopharynx is common and while the resulting disease is rare at times it can cause death or permanent disability 109110staphylococcus aureus is an important agent involved in nosocomial infections this bacterium causes a wide range of diseases that can be mild or life-threatening eg bacteraemia pneumonia and surgical site infection 111 in addition s aureus can easily have antimicrobial resistance this bacterium principally resides on the epithelium of the anterior nares in human beings 112group a streptococcus gas is a gram-positive beta-haemolytic bacterium this pathogen is responsible for several diseases in human beings such as acute pharyngitis impetigo and cellulitis it can also cause serious invasive diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome tss 113114115 the bacterium mainly resides in human nose throat and on skin and it is often transmitted without symptoms 116117118 obviously asymptomatic subjects are less contagious than the symptomatic carriers of this bacterium gas is transmitted through respiratory droplets spread in the air for example during coughing sneezing and nasal secretions 117118 in addition this bacterium can spread through close interpersonal contact during a kiss using the same dishes and sharing the same cigarette streptococci mutans mainly colonize dental surfaces after tooth eruption and is associated to the development of caries 119 this bacterium may be transmitted horizontally between children during the initial phases of the s mutans colonization in nursery environments 120 there is scientific evidence of vertical transmission of s mutans from mother to child 121some periodontal bacteria eg a actinomycetemcomitans p gingivalis are considered person-to-person transmitted but it is still unclear if transmission is governed only by domestic pathways without definitive implications for the dental office vertical transmission of a actinomycetemcomitans is between 30 and 60 while that of p gingivalis is rarely observed horizontal transmission ranges from 14 to 60 for a actinomycetemcomitans and between 30 and 75 for p gingivalis 122 certainly by understanding the spread mechanisms of these bacteria it would also be possible to prevent a number of systemic diseases 123 
if the necessary precautions are not taken it is inevitable that operators can become infected through contact of the mucous membranes with blood saliva and aerosols from a potentially infective patient 10 in healthcare setting masks are used in order to
protect personnel from contact with patient infectious materialprotect patients from infectious agents carried by healthcare workerslimit the potential spread of infectious respiratory aerosol between patients 19masks can be worn with goggles in order to protect mouth nose and eyes or with a face shield to provide more complete face protection we must distinguish masks from particle respirators that are used to prevent inhalation of small particles which may contain infectious agents transmitted through the respiratory tract the mouth nose and eyes are sensitive portals to the entry of infective pathogens such as skin cuts medical masks could be flat or pleated some are like cups and fixed to the head with straps or elastic bandsdoes not offer complete protection against small particle aerosols droplet nuclei and should not be used during contact with patients with diseases caused by airborne pathogensthey are not designed to isolate the face and therefore cannot prevent inhalation by the health personnel wearing themthey must be replaced if wet or dirtythere are no standards that evaluate the efficiency of the medical mask filter aorn association of peri-operative registered nurses recommends that medical surgical masks filter at least 03  particles or have a bacterial filtration efficiency of 9095 126 surgical masks sm are used to prevent that large particles such as droplets sprays or splashes containing pathogens could reach nose and mouth 127 although their purpose is to protect patients from healthcare professionals and healthcare team from patients by minimizing exposure to saliva and respiratory secretions they do not create a seal against the skin of the face and therefore are not indicated to protect people from airborne infectious diseasesmasks are available in several shapes modeled and unprinted dimensions filtration efficiency and attachment method ribbons elastic through the ear masks are disposable and must be changed for each patientinstead during the treatment of patients with respiratory infections particulate respiratory masks must be wornparticulate respirators with filtering percentage in use in various countries includep2 94 and p3 9995 in australia and new zelandii 95 and i 99 in chinace-certified ffp class 1 ffp1 80 class 2 ffp2 95 or class 3 ffp3 997 in european union2nd class 95 and 3rd class 999 in japan1st class 94 and special respirators 9995 in republic of koreanational institute for occupational safety and health niosh-certified n95 95 n99 99 and n100 997 in united states 126ffp2 european respirators are comparable to n95 and they are indicated for prevention ofinfectious airborne diseases however ffp3 respirators offer the highest level of protection against infectious agents and are the only ffp class accepted by the health and safety executive hse as regards the protection in the healthcare environment in the united kingdom 126the powered air purifying respirator is also considered a standard part of ppe in certain situations including aerosol generation procedures in high risk environmentseuropean legislationparticulate respirator masks are subject to compliance with directive 89686eec about personal protective equipment the directive on medical devices 9342eec applies instead to surgical masksaccording to the british standard en 1492001 modified in 2009 they are classified into three categories ffp1ffp2ffp3 based on their level of protection and their effectivenesson each particulate respirator mask must be present
name of the manufacturerreference standard nuber eg en 1492009class eg ffp1 ffp2 or ffp3ce markpossible reuse nr or rin the event of a pandemic infection any aerosol generation procedure on infected patients should only be carried out with an ffp3 respirator non-urgent procedures should be postponed until the infection resolvesin the us the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh defined the following particulate filter categories in 2011 in title 42 code of federal regulations section 84 table 3there are several models of ffp2 and ffp3 respirators both with valves and without valves however this is not a filter but a valve that regulates the flow of air at the outlet and therefore makes it easier to exhale therefore these masks are designed to be able to filter very well the air that comes in the mouth nose and lungs of those who wear them instead these masks are not designed specifically to prevent the wearer from infecting someone else with their own breathingin practice if a mask has a valve it can let out particles even if it manages to block almost all the inlet ones and therefore a healthy person can use it effectively so as not to get infected for a sick person or one who could be contagious however using it could infect others by letting germs pass from their breath outwards it is important to say that there is no specific test that has been done to verify the possibility that the virus spreads from an infected person passing through a mask equipped with a valve 128 surgical masks on the other hand are similar in both directions they have been designed to prevent healthcare workers and surgeons in particular from infecting their own breath with patients who may have open wounds on the operating table but also work to protect the healthcare staff themselves against a potentially contagious person their effectiveness however is much lower also because they do not prevent the breath from spreading and allow a lot of air to pass through and to the mouth and nose 128the choice of individual eye protection devices such as goggles or face mask varies according to the exposure circumstances other ppe worn and the need for personal vision 10 in order to protect the eyes eyeglasses and contact lenses are not considered suitable 129 eye protection must be effective but at the same time comfortable and allow sufficient peripheral visionthere are different measures that improve the comfort of the glasses for example anti-fog coating different sizes the possibility of wearing them on prescription glasses although they provide adequate eye protection glasses do not protect from splash or spray the other parts of the facedisposable or sterilizable face shields can be used in alternative to glasses face shield protects the other areas of the face besides the eyes glasses only protect the eyes the face shields that extend from the chin to the forehead offer better protection of the face and eyes from spray and splashes 83the removal of a facemask goggles and mask can be safely performed after removing dirty gloves and after performing hand hygienegowns and coveralls are additional personal protective equipment in the health sector 83 operator hygiene including wearing appropriate clothing and ppe has a dual purpose on the one hand to defend the operator himself in an environment where the infectious risk is high and on the other hand to prevent the operator from becoming responsible transmission of infectionsto increase the protective function of the uniform or to carry out those procedures in which high contamination is expected additional disposable clothing can be worn 83 these clothes can be ppe certified for biological risk and for this recognition must comply with the requirements of the technical standards namely european standards are en 14126 and iso 16604 dpi and en 24920 dm the material constituent is mainly tnt texture not texture which is suitable for disposable use in this specific area to offer greater protection of the part front of the body the most exposed to risk it is required that such lab coats have standard features within the heterogeneity of the models for example back closure covered or heat-sealed seams long sleeves with cuffs tight and high collar obviously for these devices comfort and practicality are also required so the operator must be able to move freely and perceive good perspiration 83different types of gowns and overalls are available with varying levels of protection the level of protection depends on various factors including the type of tissue the shape and size of microorganisms the characteristics of the conveyor and various external factors 130 in high-risk environments it is recommended to use waterproof and fluid-resistant gowns or overallsduring minor oral surgery surgical gowns must be worn with tight cuffs that must be inserted under the gloves fabric work uniforms must be washed daily on a hot 60  c cycle fabric uniforms are not considered ppe since the material they are made of is absorbent and therefore offer little protection against infectious pathogensduring all dental procedures it is impossible to avoid contact of the hands with blood and saliva 10 that is why all operators must wear protective gloves before performing any type of procedure on patients 10 gloves must be changed with each patient and at every contact with contaminated surfaces to prevent cross-infection 10 not only the dentist but also other dental team members must wear gloves during dental procedures 10131gloves used in dental clinic can be distinguished basically in two categories those for purely use clinical and those for instrumentation reordering procedures and of the operational area when cleaning dental appliances and instruments more durable gloves should be worn than normal non-sterile gloves to prevent injury 10regarding clinical gloves a clear distinction must be made between them procedures that require invasive action on the patient or however at clear biological risk and the procedures that do not require them or in any case present a negligible biological risk for the operatorthe two types of gloves resulting from this distinction are found in the words inspection gloves and surgical gloves one commonly used nomenclature 83both disposable products from a macroscopic point of view usually have some obvious differences
surgical gloves in general always distinguish the right side from the left they are long enough to be worn over the cuffs of the gowns and always packaged in sterile pairsthe inspection glove is usually an ambidextrous device shorter and thinner than the previous one and rarely sterile 132
in general clinical gloves are made of latex nitrile or vinyl latex and nitrile have proven to be more resistant than and therefore are generally preferred gloves contain powder to make them easier to wear but which can cause skin irritation 10 powder-free gloves exist on the market and they should be used when such reactions occur 10 some people may experience allergies and contact dermatitis due to latex 10 latex-free gloves for allergy sufferers are also available 10also the weather of use is an absolutely relevant parameter in terms of protection the use of the glove especially if in latex involves development not perceived of microperforations which become particularly significant from a numerical point of view after 60 min and which induce an increase in biological risk 133 the simultaneous use of two pairs of gloves considerably reduces the passage of blood through microperforations 134 there are no significant reductions in manual skills and the sensitivity of the operator wearing the double glove 132it was confirmed that the formation of microperforations can be also induced by washing gloves with soap chlorhexidine or alcohol moreover particular attention should be paid also while waiting for the total drying of the alcoholic substances applied on the hands which has also proven to be potentially harmful to the integrity of the device before wearing gloves 132other personal protective equipment include the disposable cap headgear and shoe coversa disposable cap device is recommended for clear hygienic reasons such as containment operator contamination and prevention of dispersion of dandruff in the environment and even more generic protective functions for the worker such as interlocking with subsequent tearing of hair and possibly scalp from a part of moving andor rotating organs the burning of the hair due to flames or incandescent bodies and hair fouling due to various agents including powders and drops of blood-salivary material 83it is very important to maintain an excellent level of hand hygiene in protection techniques that affects all members of the dental team 10 hand hygiene includes several procedures that remove or kill microorganism on the hands 83
during handwashing water and soap should be used in order to generate lather that is distributed on all surface of the hands and after rinsed offhand antisepsis to physically remove microorganisms by antimicrobial soap or to kill microorganisms with an alcohol-based hand rubsurgical hand rub procedure that kills transient organisms and reduces resident flora for the duration of a surgical procedure with antimicrobial soap or an alcohol-based hand rub 135there are different types of soap
plain soap that have no antimicrobial properties and works physically removing dirt ad microorganismalcohol-based hand rub used without water kills microorganism but does not remove soil or organic material physicallyantimicrobial soap kills microorganism and removes physically soil and organic material 135in 1975 and in 1985 the cdc published a guideline on how to wash the hands stating that the hands should be washed with antimicrobial soaps before and after procedures performed on patients 10the use of gloves is not an alternative to hand washing 10hand washing is different if it is a routine procedure or a surgical procedure in the first case normal or antibacterial soaps are sufficient 89alcohol-containing agents are preferable 10 cold water must be of choice when washing hands because the repeatedly use of hot water can cause dermatitis 10it is recommended to wash hands using liquid soap for a minimum duration of 60 s it is very important to reduce the number of microorganisms before each surgical procedure that is why applying antibacterial soaps and acts a detailed cleaning followed by liquids containing alcohol is recommended 10 despite the fact that the antibacterial effects of alcohol containing cleansers arise quickly such antiseptics including compounds of triclosan quaternary ammonium chlorhexidine and octenidine must be included 10before surgical hand washing rings watches and other accessories must be taken off and no nail polishes or other artificial must be present 1189the use of disposable paper towels is preferable for drying handsafter every procedure and after taking off the gloves it is highly recommended to wash hands once again with regular soapsif soap and water are not readily available it can be used an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 alcohol 10 recommendations for sharps safety in dental settings by cdc 136
must consider all sharp objects contaminated with the patient blood and saliva as potentially infectiousdo not hood the used needles in order to avoid an accidental injection 83put all used sharp objects in suitable puncture resistant bins 83it is necessary to clean all instruments with detergent and water before sterilization 10 during washing it is advisable to avoid splashes of water a wear gloves and face protection the instruments that penetrate the tissues must be sterilized in an autoclave 83 it is advisable to heat sterilize items that touch the mucosa or to at least disinfect them for example with the immersion in a 2 glutaraldehyde solution in a closed bid naturally following the instructions of the producer 83 anything that cannot be autoclaved must be disinfected the handpieces should be able to drain the water for two minutes at the start of the day not autoclavable handpieces can be disinfected using viricidal agent after sterilization all instruments must be kept safely in order to avoid recontamination for a maximum of 30 days 60 days if closed in double bags 83sterilization completely kills all vital agents and spores too the classic sterilization procedure expects the use autoclave with cycles at 121 c for 1530 min or at 134 c for 34 min 2383 it is necessary to thoroughly wash and dry all items before sterilizing them as dirt and water can interfere with sterilization 83steam sterilization cannot be used for all facilities and a possible alternative can be the use of chemical sterilization using ethylene oxide gas formaldehyde gas hydrogen peroxide gas liquid peracetic acid or ozone 83 the disinfection processes do not destroy the bacterial load rather reducing it to acceptable levels commonly used disinfectants are described below table 4the action of cleaning and disinfection can be manual or automatized for example it is possible to use ultrasonic baths in order to clean complex articulated or notched stainless-steel instruments such as cutters the washer-disinfectors provide a high temperature passage generally 90 c for one minute which drastically reduces the microbial contamination of the items the final rinse must be carried out with high quality water table 5it is necessary to have always a perfect protection of operative room with disinfected surfaces 10there are two ways to make a surface aseptic 23
clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces 23 andprevent surfaces from being contaminated by using surface covers 23 a combination of both can also be used 23 the following chemicals are suitable for surface and equipment asepsischlorine eg sodium hypochloritephenolic compoundswater-based water with ortho-phenylphenol tertiary amylphenol or o-benzylp-chlorophenolalcohol-based ethyl or isopropyl alcohol with ortho-phenylphenol or tertiary amylphenoliodophorbutoxy polypropoxy polyethoxy ethanol iodine complex 23 in the literature there are still little information on 2019-ncov similar genetic features between 2019-ncov and sars-cov indicate that covid-19 could be susceptible to disinfectants such as 01 sodium hypochlorite 05 hydrogen peroxide 6271 ethanol and phenolic and quaternary ammonium compounds 4 it is important to pay attention to the duration of use dilution rate and especially the expiration time following the preparation of the solution 4 a recent paper pointed out that surface disinfection could be performed with 01 sodium hypochlorite or 6271 ethanol for one minute in order to eliminate sas-cov-2 139after each treatment work surfaces should be adequately cleaned and decontaminated with ethyl alcohol 70 if blood or pus is visible on a surface it is necessary to clean and disinfect that surface with sodium hypochlorite 05 it is necessary to wear protective gloves and care taken to minimize direct skin mucosal or eye contact with these disinfectantsin addition to disinfection with chemicals a ultraviolet-c uv-c irradiation lamp can be used 140 the uv light system for disinfection has several advantages including does not require room ventilation does not leave residues after use and have a wide action spectrum in a very short time 140 the uv-c lamp must be activated only when the room is empty without staff and without patient in the literature there are no cases of damage to the materials present in the room despite this the acrylic material can be degraded if subjected to repeated exposure to uv-c light and for this reason it is recommended to cover it during disinfection with uv-c 141 ultraviolet light has a wavelength between 10 and 400 nm while ultraviolet-c uv-c light has a wavelength between 100 and 280 nm and the greatest germicidal power is obtained with a wavelength of 265 nm 142 the germicidal effect of uv-c light causes cell damage thus blocking cell replication 141 in descending order of inactivation by uv-c light there are bacteria viruses fungi and spores 143 uv-c rays can be generated by low pressure mercury lamps and pulsed xenon lamps which emit high intensity pulsed light with a higher germicidal action 141 uv-c rays are equipped with high energy which decreases exponentially with the increase of distance from the light source objects or surfaces closer to the uv-c source will have a greater exposure and therefore will have to be disinfected for less time than distant objects 142depending on the nature of the object affected by uv-c light it can block the light rays or allow itself to be passed through allowing the irradiation of the objects placed behind it for example the organic material completely absorbs the uv-c light and blocks its diffusion for this reason the surfaces must be manually cleaned to remove the organic substances before decontamination with ultraviolet light 142the extent of inactivation of the microorganisms is directly proportional to the uv-c dose received and this in turn is the result of the intensity and duration of exposure 142 therefore according to the data in the literature the use of uv-c rays for disinfection has proven effective in reducing the overall bacterial count and significantly more effective than just manual disinfection on surfaces 141in addition to encourage the exchange of air it is recommended to ventilate the rooms between one patient and another if it is not possible to allow the exchange of natural air at least 2030 min forced ventilation systems with high efficiency particulate air hepa filters must be used paying attention to the periodic replacement of the filtersrecommendations for environmental infection prevention and control in dental settings 136establish a protocol for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and environments of which health personnel must be informedcover with disposable films all the surfaces that are touched during the procedures for example switches it equipment and change these protections between each patientsurfaces that are not protected by a barrier should be cleaned and disinfected with a disinfectant after each patientuse a medium level disinfectant ie tuberculocidal indication if a surface is visibly contaminated with bloodfor each disinfectant follow the manufacturers instructions eg quantity dilution contact time safe use disposal 136 table 6if proper maintenance is not carried out microbial pathogens eg pseudomonas or legionella spp can multiply in duwls these organisms grow in the biofilm on the internal surfaces of the tubes where they cannot be attacked with chemicals to prevent the formation of this biofilm the systems should be drained at the end of each day 144in dental unit water lines duwl water must flow and they must be washed regularly it is recommended to rinse for two minutes at the beginning and end of each day and for 2030 s between patients 144 different agents for disinfection of duwl are available all handpieces and ultrasonic meters must be equipped with backstop valves and must undergo periodic maintenance and inspection the filters used in the duwl must be checked periodically or if they are disposable they must be changed dailyrecommendations for dental unit water quality in dental settings
use water compliant with environmental protection agency epa standards for drinking water ie  500 cfuml of heterotrophic water bacteriafollow the recommendations for water quality monitoring given by the manufacturer of the unit or waterline treatment productuse sterile water or sterile saline for the irrigation during surgical procedures 136any waste containing human or animal tissue blood or other body fluids drugs swabs dressings or other infective material is defined as clinical waste and it must be separated from non-clinical waste 144 used disposable syringes needles or other pointed instruments must be disposed of in a special rigid container in order to avoid injury to operators and operators in charge of waste disposal the waste must be kept in a dedicated area before it is collected away from public access and excessive accumulation of waste must be avoided 4144the whole dental team must be vaccinated against hepatitis b in order to increase personal protection 83 individuals who have already been vaccinated should monitor their levels of immunity against hbv over time and make booster shots 145 all dental health care professionals should also receive the following other vaccinations flu mumps live-virus measles live-virus rubella live-virus and varicella-zoster live-virus 10 in addition the rubella vaccine is strongly recommended especially for women who have pregnancy uncertainty 131 the influenza vaccine is very useful for dental health professionals as they are at risk for respiratory droplets infections by working in close proximity to the patients 10 when the covid-19 vaccine is ready healthcare professionals should take it as additional infection prevention and health care worker measures rapid tests can be used in dental practices to diagnose covid-19 before each treatment this is because as mentioned above a patient without symptoms is not necessarily a healthy patientfrom all these data it is evident that the dentist and his team need to use rigid and precise operating protocols in order to avoid infectious contagion 23 several authors proposed some right procedures in the operative dentistry 234102383139146147148149 for this reason we reassume them in a precise operative protocol organized for all the patients and characterized by some defined steps
prevention of infections must be a priority in any healthcare setting and therefore also in any dental clinic to do this staff training and information adequate management of resources and use of well-defined operating protocols is necessaryadequate management of the protection for operators and therefore also for patients begins with the roles of the secretariat in order to better organize the workflow the secretariat must provide a telephone triage it would be advisable to phone each patient to make sure he is healthy on the day of the appointment patients with acute symptoms of any infectious disease should be referred at the time of symptom resolution the medical history of patients may not reveal asymptomatic infectious disease of which they are affected this means the operator must adopt the same infection control rules for all patients as if they were all infective in addition the secretariat must organize appointments in order to avoid crowding in the waiting room it would be advisable for the patient to present himself alone without companions only minors the elderly and patients with psycho-physical conditions can be accompanied in some urgent and non-deferrable cases it is necessary to treat the patient despite being in the acute phase of infection with any virus examples of urgent treatments are pulpitis tooth fracture and avulsion 2 in these cases the operator must implement the maximum individual protection measuresin the waiting room all material eg magazines newspapers information posters that can represent a source of contamination must be eliminated so that the room is easy to disinfectpatients are requested to go to the appointment without any superfluous objects at the entrance of the dental structure the patient must wear shoe covers disinfect the hands with hydroalcoholic solution according to the following indications affix any jacket on a special hanger and disinfect the hands again with hydroalcoholic solution if there are several patients in the waiting room they must be at least two meters away from each other the correct hand disinfection procedure with hydroalcoholic solution is as follows

the same procedure is performed for washing hands with soap and water

6before entering the surgical room the patient must be dressed in a disposable gown and headgear worn in order to avoid any contagion on clothing and hair 7before dental session patient should rinse and gargle with a specific mouthwash chlorhexidine is commonly used for pre-procedural oral rinses in dental offices but its capacity of 2019-ncov destruction has not yet been demonstrated 4 instead pre-procedural oral rinses with oxidizing such as 1 hydrogen peroxide or 02 povidone-iodine are recommended 4 so the pre-procedural use of mouthwash especially in cases of inability to use a rubber dam can significantly reduce the microbial load of oral cavity fluids 3 in fact even if oral rinses seem to limit the viral load virus can spread through the complete respiratory tract and it is not scientifically possible to guarantee that this reduction is constant during the operative manoeuvre eg cough sneezing runny nose then the following pre-operative procedure is recommended to the patient a 1 hydrogen peroxide 15 gargle followed by 30 rinse b do not rinse with water at the end of the rinse and continue with chlorhexidine 020 60 rinse with final gargle of 15 146 at the end of the procedure the patient must be appropriately undressed and have another oral rinse performed before washing hands and face thoroughly8after every patient carefully clean all surfaces starting from the least contaminated to the most potentially infected taking care not to overlook the handles of the doors and the various drawers worktops and all the devices used during the treatment and which are not disposable or autoclavable cover switches mice computer keyboards and anything else that may be more difficult to clean with disposable film the worktops must be free from anything that is not strictly necessary to perform the service an accurate disinfection of the surfaces includes a preventive cleaning of the same in order to eliminate the soil which otherwise would not allow the disinfectant to inactivate the microorganisms 29 in the same way if you want to use disinfectant wipes you must use one to cleanse and after another to disinfect as regards spray disinfectants the percentage of dilution and the time of application vary from product to product you must follow the instructions provided by the company moreover alcohol-based disinfectants 75 05 hydrogen peroxide 01 sodium hypochlorite are recommended to be left to act on the surfaces for 1 min disinfect the circuits of the treatment center at each patient change between patients the tubing of high-volume aspirators and saliva ejectors should be regularly flushed with water and disinfectant such as 01 sodium hypochlorite always air the rooms after each patient at least 2030 min or use germicidal lamps clean floors with bleach at least two times a day9during every procedure minimize the use of an airwater syringe dry the site with cotton rollers when possible use suction at maximum power it might be an idea to use autoclavable plastic suction cannulas that have a greater suction capacity than normal disposable pvc cannulas or use two saliva ejectors in the case of exposed carious dentine try to remove it as manually as possible using excavators be sure to first mount the rubber dam disinfect the crown with pellets soaked in 75 alcohol and recommend with the second operator to position the aspirator as correctly as possible to avoid excessive spraying andor splashing do not use air-polishing avoid intraoral x-rays as they stimulate salivation coughing andor vomiting prefer exams like opt orthopantomography or cbct cone beam computed tomography in case of extractions it is preferable to use resorbable sutures to seal the post-extraction site in the case of patients who are definitely positive for any infectious agent or on which there are greater possibilities of positivity highlighted by the medical history it is necessary to plan their treatment at the end of the day do not touch patient card and pens with dirty gloves it is good practice to cough or sneeze into the elbow the operator must avoid touching his eyes nose and mouth with dirty gloves or hands10isolation with rubber dam 4 isolating the oral cavity with the use of rubber dams greatly reduces about 70 the spread of respiratory droplets and aerosols containing saliva or blood coming from the patient and aimed to the operator area of action 4 after positioning the dam the operator must provide an efficient high-volume intraoral aspiration in order to prevent the spread of aerosol and spray as much as possible 148 if rubber dams cannot be used for any reason the operator should prefer to use manual tools such as hand scalers 411anti-retraction handpiece 4 during the covid-19 pandemic operators should avoid using dental mechanical handpieces that do not have an anti-retraction function 4 mechanical handpieces with the anti-retraction system have valves anti-retraction that are very important in order to prevent the spread and dispersion of droplets and aerosol 14814912all instruments which have been used for the treatment of a patient or which have only been touched by operators during a session and which cannot be sterilized according to standard protocols must be disinfected eg immersed in a container with phenol 23 this tools bagged in disinfection solution must remain in solution for about 10 min 23 some materials such as polysulphide polyvinylsiloxane impression compound and zoe impressing materials after being in the patient mouth are rinsed with water and immersed in a 525 sodium hypochlorite solution for about 10 min 23 the alginate or polyether impressions are also rinsed with water sprayed with a 525 sodium hypochlorite solution and placed in a container for about 10 min 23 wax resin centric relation records and zoe are rinsed with water and sprayed with a 525 sodium hypochlorite solution and placed in a plastic bag for about 10 min 23 provisional restorations and complete dentures removed from the patient mouth are immersed in a 525 sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 min 23 otherwise removable partial prostheses with metal bases are treated with 2 glutaraldehyde solution and placed in a plastic bag for 10 min 23
a novel and useful indication is that of classifying each common dental procedure according to the likelihood of a contagion by one or more infective agents via saliva blood droplets or aerosol for the team and for the patient under the cure or the subsequent nevertheless its type and intrinsic operative difficulty table 7 according to this paradigm all dental procedures involving the use of the air-water syringe andor rotatingultrasoundpiezo tools are able to produce high levels of aerosols and droplets and for this reason the dentist must consider them dangerous for himself the dental team and the subsequent patients meanwhile procedures even if refined eg soft tissues biopsy for oral cancer suspicion but characterized by a lowabsent production of aerosol and droplets must be considered not particularly threateningfor all these considerations the dental team must reconsider its operative protocols and modulate the ppe use according to level of risk of common dental procedures of generating droplets or aerosols table 8 presents the use of different ppes for each common dental procedure in pre-covid vs post-covid era it is definitively clear that the use of air-water syringe andor rotatingultrasoundpiezo tools able to produce high levels of aerosols and droplets need the use of the safest ppe in order to reduceeliminate viral or other infectious agent diffusion within the dental settingin the face of the covid-19 pandemic new biosafety measures are necessary to reduce contagion dentistry is a profession that works directly with the oral cavity and is therefore very exposed to this virus or other infectious agents because of this some measures need to be taken to minimize contagion in fact dentists can play an important role in stopping the transmission chain assuming correct procedures in order to reduce the viral agent diffusion or in promoting undesirable infectious disease diffusion if operating in adherence to adequate safety protocols dental-care professionals must be fully aware of 2019-ncov and other viral agent spreading modalities how to identify patients with active infections and most importantly to prioritize self and patient protection finally the dental team must reconsider the overall infective risk level of every dental procedure and respect the new operative protocols that are or will be formulated by respective national official committees 150151 in order to reduce as much as possible the risk of the contagion for the health and safety of their communitythroughout most of history towns and cities had higher death rates than those in rural areas creating what amounted to an urban health disadvantage  this was largely because of their densely packed and insanitary conditions which made their residents especially prone to diseases spread by contagion and contaminated water so the very creation of these unhealthy man-made environments was responsible for much of the increases in morbidity and mortality of course there were times when some of these problems were reduced for example from the mid-third century bce some of the buildings in major cities in the indus valley  such as mohenjaro daro and harappa had installed drainage systems and even running water to remove human waste in rooms we would call toilets possehl 2002 in subsequent centuries civilizations such as the minoans in crete built underground clay pipes for water supply and sewage removal but it was roman engineering in the centuries before the common era that endowed towns and cities in their empire with the most sophisticated water systems to date bringing clean water from long distances to their settlements adding water fountains and public toilets near town squares and encouraging cleanliness through the many public baths although their use of easily worked lead for some the water pipes did produce some poisoning moreover vitruviuss classical book on architecture morgan 1960 p 21 probably written during the time of augustus included advice to town builders to make sure their settlements were not sited near marshy ground which were known to be prone to fevers and ague probably what we now know as malariathese technical advances in various early civilizations were often forgotten or ignored by subsequent urban builders the result was especially disastrous in the rapidly expanding but unsanitary and overcrowded large towns created in the industrial revolution where levels of mortality and premature death reached such critical levels that political action was finally taken to solve the problem primarily through sanitary water supply and building regulatory policies these policies produced the first major changes to improve the health of urban residents over the last two centuries at least in the countries of what became the developed world and should be known as the first healthy city movement  the second major change in the health of people in urban places developed from the late nineteenth century onwards impressive reductions in mortality and disabilities occurred in part through reductions in family size better hygiene and nutrition and healthier physical environments because of the public health interventions but also by unprecedented increases in the medical professions ability to cure people from many diseases and impaired bodily functions together with improvements in prosperity it removed the historic urban disadvantage in health so that urban areas in the developed world had longer longevity rates than those in rural areasby the end of the twentieth century doubts began to be cast on the ability of existing practices alone to further improve the health of the population especially in urban places three new sets of challenges can be recognized first new medical difficulties have arisen that threaten to turn back the gains of the past centuries such as disease-causing bacteria that are resistant to drugs and the increase in new chronic diseases they not only pose problems in poor developing countries where they are compounded by inadequate sanitary and clean water facilities and poor building structures but in the developed world as the population ages and needs more care second there is a revived emphasis upon the so-called determinants of health  the factors that influence health and ill-health many of which are environmental in nature and are not always effectively dealt with by individual medical care procedures and affect health over the long term for example one of the biggest contemporary problems is air pollution especially from fossil burning in urban areas and in households with open fires a recent world health organization report who 2014a estimates that over 7 million deaths a year occur from this cause not directly but by creating premature deaths from heart disease and respiratory tract cancers the long term effect of this and other factors means there is a need to focus as much upon the reduction of these problems and the promotion of health as upon treatments of diseases or decaying body functions third various agencies from the world health organizations healthy city programme that began in 1986 to local governments and community groups have been advocating new ways of improving health in cities these amount to new organizational changes and targeting of particular problems and have a strong urban basis for this is where increasing numbers of people live like so many of the new urban themes that have been advocated in recent years the approach stresses the need for a commitment to look beyond current practice in health care as well as the need for political community and wider stakeholder involvement as this who statement shows
being a healthy city depends not on current health infrastructure rather upon a commitment to improve a citys environs and a willingness to forge the necessary connections in political economic and social arenas it aims to to create a health-supportive environment to achieve a good quality of life to provide basic sanitation and hygiene needs to supply access to health care who 1998
the emphasis upon factors other than the existing health care system requires a more holistic view of the various determinants that affect the health of the population in urban areas in many ways it represents a new emphasis upon a different type of public health approach one which has gradually declined from the 1880s after the success of the sanitary approach in improving the physical environment this has has strong links with emerging ecological ideas ashton and ubido 1991this chapter begins the review of all these changes by summarizing these new attitudes to health not just ill-health before reviewing the nineteenth century urban improvements that helped reverse the high mortality rates this is not included only for historical reasons but because it provides an exemplar of policies that are still needed in many cities in developing countries today if the health of their urban residents is to be improved the historical review is followed by sections providing a summary of the very serious new challenges to medical care followed by descriptions of the policies that can be used to improve the various health determinants and then the initiatives of the healthy city movement although many of the policies may be made and financed by national governments there is not only an important urban component in the delivery of the services but also the increasing realization that life in an urban habitat may be creating new health problemshealth is not an easy concept to define superficially it seems to relate to the idea of a population that is disease-free however the constitution of the world health organization has described health in a wider way health is a state of complete physical mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of illness who 1948 the trouble with this health definition is that the use of the word well-being covers much of the human condition and does not lend itself to easy measurements nevertheless the phrases well-being and absence of illness  do mean a wide view of health issues is envisaged later this led to a more wide ranging statement about health promotion as much as curing illness from the european office of the who in its ottawa charter for health promotion in 1986
health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over and to improve their healthto reach a state of complete physical mental and social wellbeing an individual or group must be able to identify and to realize aspirations to satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources as well as physical capacities therefore health promotion is not just the responsibility of the health sector but goes beyond healthy lifestyles to wellbeing who-e 1986 p 1
this description emphasizes that the health sector cannot solve health problems alone it has led to the popularization of the concept of wellness  which is being used to describe a more holistic approach to the improvement of health emphasizing health promotion as much as treatment
health is not simply the absence of illness and disease but as something we build with our families schools communities and workplaces in our parks and playgrounds the places we live the air we breathe the water we drink and the choices we make alberta health 20142014 p 4
so there is a new emphasis upon prevention of encouraging healthy living  not just treating our way out of ill-health through existing and future medical knowledge yet a more healthy living is not the only benefit the work of researchers discussed in the knowledge city discussion chap 101007978-94-017-9655-211 has shown the link between iq growth and disease reduction  which means a healthier population is likely to be a more productive and innovative one which assists future economic and social progress eppig et al 2010 these new perspectives have led to the need to pay more attention to the many factors or health determinants that affect health in both the long as well as the short term they lead to interventions designed to create healthy cities that are not limited to the current health care systemit was well known throughout history that urban places were less healthy than rural areas and from the seventeenth century some individuals provided quantitative evidence of these differences for example john gaunt 1662 in england showed that 1 in 30 died annually in london whereas the rates in the country were 1 in 50 with a third of deaths from infant mortality plagues were particularly feared although always present there were extreme epidemic plague years  usually at 10 or 20 year intervals in london but with even more severe outbreaks such as those in 1563 and 1625 where deaths increased five to six times above normal rates harding 2012 p 31 limited medical knowledge meant that there was no clear understanding of the causes of the high mortality but most attributed it to miasma  the effects of foul air and filth in these densely populated unsanitary urban areas within cities there were important variations in mortality rates as shown by villerms pioneering study in paris in 1817 which showed how wealthy areas such as the second and third arrondissements had annual mortality rates of 1 in 62 and 1 in 60 respectively whereas the two poorest areas arrondissements 11 and 8 had higher rates of 1 in 43 la berge 1992 in recent years these historical spatial variations within cities have been investigated more thoroughly for example it has been demonstrated that the richer areas in the centre of seventeenth and eighteenth century london with its more substantial houses and a better fed and clothed population had far lower mortalities than either areas outside the wall in the inner suburbs or the outer edges harding 2012 as their densities increased with more poor housing after the industrial revolution because of low construction standards these areas had even higher death ratesa major change came in the mid nineteenth century when dramatic spikes in mortality especially associated with severe cholera outbreaks focused attention on the problem in britain edwin chadwicks pioneering report on the sanitation of cities 1843 showed how mortality varied with the physical and social composition of residential areas social commentators engels 1844 mayhew et al 18511862 as well as novelists such as dickens tomalin 2011 described in horrific detail the squalid conditions in which the poorest lived worked and died in london and other big cities where many infectious diseases were rampant harding 2012 p 40 but it was the maps of dr john snow showing higher cholera deaths around a soho well in london in 1854 and his demonstration of their link with its polluted water that gradually led to the acceptance that wells or rivers containing water contaminated by faecal matter and rubbish led to the growth of what we now know as the bacteria that cause cholera johnston 2006 frerichs nd the eventual result although it took time was to replace the historic belief that bad air caused disease with one that stressed the role of contaminated water which eventually led to the policies that built sanitary systems and the new specialism of epidemiology of which snow is often considered the originatoralthough there was a great deal of dissention in the early nineteenth century about the causes of death rate increases in the big cities it is now clear that they came from a combination of eight essentially built-environment problems the first was the overcrowding in many houses and areas which increased the risk of contagion from infectious communicable diseases  the second was that urban growth overwhelmed the local ability to provide fresh water supplies or to remove faecal material not only from humans but from the horses that were the main form of transport and fouled the main streets and the many animals pigs cows and chickens kept for fresh food this led to well-water contamination as well as piles of waste  including human faeces that resulted in outbreaks of diseases such as typhoid and cholera in what was literally a stinking environment a third problem came from the lack of cleanliness and hygiene of many in the population making the spread of disease easier in such overcrowded areas a fourth lay in the limited building regulations
 as well as their adequate enforcement either in sites chosen or construction standards the former issue led to structures being built on wet marshy ground or near polluted streams the latter led to damp cold buildings with little warmth small rooms and with few windows buildings in poor areas were often built in courts to increase density creating areas rarely penetrated by the sun while cellars were often used as dwellings these conditions increased the risk of respiratory diseases and also rickets because of an absence of sunlight as well as increasing the danger from firesa fifth problem came from pollution this was not just the stink from faecal and other rotting matter in urban places but from the noxious fumes and toxic waste products produced by the many industrial plants that were mixed up with residences and especially from the typical coal-fuelled household fires that may have warmed rooms but led to indoor pollution outside the buildings the emissions of gases and particles from coal fires often created choking fogs full of particulates in damp river valley environments subject to inversions adding to the respiratory risks this was related to a sixth problem the often dangerous working conditions
in mines and industrial plants or even in home-based industries which led to deaths or injuries from machinery or various industrial processes especially those that gave off noxious fumes or by-products a seventh problem came from the increase and concentrations of poor people
in the cities their poverty was due to the limited wages and often intermittent work which left most with limited means to buy nutritious food warm clothing or adequate shelter combined with poor hygiene it made them more prone to disease an eighth problem came from the limited medical knowledge and access to it at the time this was made worse by the reluctance of many to embrace new ideas while the poor had too little money to even get medical assistance unless it was from charity provided by church organizations the effect of these problems on the lower class in particular was calamitous as seen in a description by engels of the labouring classes who were


 for the most part weak thin and pale their weakened bodies are in no condition to withstand illness and whatever infection is abroad they fall victims to it consequently they age prematurely and die young engels 1844 pp 118119
these descriptions by engels and the more substantial works 50 years later by charles booth pfautz 1967 davies 1978 who produced detailed maps of the degree of poverty in each street in london district measurements of the degree of social condition in major districts davies 1978 and seventeen volumes on the conditions of life and work-places in the metropolis identify many of what we now call the social determinants of health  only a few in these slum areas were able to escape the environment within which life was lived which created the milieu for urban ill-health and premature mortality although conditions were better in the more prosperous areas of well-built and maintained houses hence the physical build and social environment in which so many of the disadvantaged lived lay at the root of their ill-health and early mortalitythe work of chadwick the descriptions of novelists and social commentators as well as doctors such as snow frerichs nd in exposing these problems eventually led to increasing political debate about the need to improve these environments berridge and gorsky 2012 some of the pressure for change came from altruism the view that we are all humans and that the poor should be helped a particular belief among christian religious organizations also important in supporting built-environment changes was the realization by many in the political classes that an unfit weakened population needed to be improved if the country was able to assert and defend itself by healthy effective armed men these reasons plus what amounted to panic from the high spikes of mortality especially during the cholera outbreaks also meant the better-off felt threatened it is also important to emphasize the role played by associations such as health of towns association established in britain in 1844 branches were quickly established by business and social elites in most major centres their members organized public meetings to present facts on mortality variations and exerted great pressure on governments to create laws that led to the development of sanitary and clean water systems in towns as well as public health officials to monitor and often agitate for change ashton and ubido 1991 they helped promote the idea that there must be improvements in the physical fabric of towns and their infrastructures yet there were still those who believed the fault for the conditions in these areas of squalor lay in the poor themselves either because people were too lazy or immoral to improve their condition or they were simply inferior and prone to diseasefour main sets of changes were crucial in transforming the urban health conditions of many settlements the main one consisted of improvements in the physical fabric of cities helped by a series of major public health acts and new technologies for example in britain the 1845 and 1875 public health acts laid down enforceable building standards not simply in construction but in minimum sizes of houses and lay-out plus tarmac roads as well as the requirement for small gardens and at least outside toilet facilities hall 1988 critical in these changes were the additional requirements for a clean water supply and new sewer lines to connect the housing areas to plants to disperse and process the sewage although initially many dumped it into the nearest water body where many obtained their water increasingly it was the responsibility of the municipal government to provide such facilities in addition to fire protection garbage collection services and the banning of animal husbandry in urban areas to reduce their waste this led to greater powers for local governments in providing these services replacing previously inadequate and sometimes private provision as well as the important addition of medical officers of health to monitor health conditions in local areas although often known as the sanitation phase it may be better summarized as a regulatory and engineering phase of improvement
it was the engineering advances in supplying water from often distant reservoirs and then filtering water first through sand and later disinfection with chlorine to kill microbesthat led to clean urban water supplies which were later helped by the invention of engines that allowed water to be pressurized for further distribution to residences another major change came with the development of toilets  using the new water supplies where the flushed water containing human waste was carried away by new sewer systems that also removed other waste water later the addition of sewage processing plants to process the effluent improved the systems instead of the earlier approach of just dumping it into the nearest water body although far too many urban places still do also the new regulations included effective inspection systems that controlled and improved building quality and industrial plants and eventually the safe disposal of toxic by-products overcrowding was gradually reduced by decisions to eradicate older slum areas and build at lower densities while the development of unions gave workers more ability to argue for workplace safety as well as better wagesthe creation of a better physical urban environment helped reduce the spread of water and airborne communicable diseases a second set of factors dealing with broad social changes in health improvement  were also influential lower fertility rates decreased family size and reduced child mortality increases in prosperity led not only to better nutrition from more food supplies but better clothing and housing more cleanliness and a knowledge of hygiene was also important in addition there was a gradual and crucial improvement of medical knowledge and nursing capabilitiesa third trend came from greater acceptance of a new valuation of nature
and appreciation of the utility of green space that began with the romantic revolution in art this stimulated the creation of public parks for leisure and escape from the noise and filth of the city and cemeteries for the safe disposal of dead bodies reps 1965 these ideas later led to the ideas of adding green space to the planning of new subdivisions restricted at first to wealthy residents these planning ideas gradually filtered down to middle class developments and to model towns of workers davies and herbert 1993 and eventually to the garden city ideas they led to a more comprehensive approach advocates for a complete town combining the best of the town and country whose ideas influenced subsequent suburban designs issues discussed in chaps 101007978-94-017-9655-22 and 101007978-94-017-9655-24 especially new ideas about the restorative values of nature also led to the belief that it could contribute to better health which in turn was assumed to develop an improved morality  unlike the social degeneration seen in cities and especially slum areas which were thought by many to breed moral as well as physical diseases in britain it led to many new movements designed to encourage a more active and outdoors life-style from the addition of sports and physical exercise in schools to the scout and guides movement from 1908 with their outdoor orientation and camping trips to the 1926 new health society which sought to improve nutrition as well as to the sunlight league in 1926 which extolled the health-giving properties of sunlight carter 2012 similar movements occurred in many countries especially in germany where there was greater emphasis on the need for hygiene to be taught in schools and to be part of everyday life stemming from the work of dr weyls 10 volume treatise on hygiene that began in 1893 schott 2012 although many these social movements of the early twentieth century faded during the war period and its austere aftermath the revival of the environmental movements from the 1960s and the more recent ideas of the nature deficit in children discussed in chap 101007978-94-017-9655-24 can in part be regarded as the partial inheritors of these earlier traditionsa fourth transforming trend was less a matter of policy or organizations than of fashion and life-style namely the benefits of spa and seaside towns
 these were regarded as being sited in healthier environments allowing the opportunity to improve health by sojourns in these centres the earliest examples came from the expansion of spa towns from the seventeenth century places with mineral springs which were assumed to have therapeutic properties obtained by either immersion in or by drinking such waters adams 2012 many of the early european spa towns were revivals of settlements on old roman mineral water sites and were primarily patronised by the elite which meant they became as much social as medical centres up to the 1930s they were patronized primarily by the elite and their therapeutic values were highly regarded but in the uk many declined after the creation of the national health service in 1948 because this nationalized system was not prepared except in a few cases to subsidize patients to attend what were expensive courses of treatment although there has been a recent revival of some spas in britain and the development of many new private ones it has been concluded that they are based primarily upon methods of treatment rather than the particular place properties of climate or water adams 2012 however in continental europe there has been a much greater continuity and use of many of the old spas as health providers were more likely to prescribe such courses of treatment for all classes the bracing qualities of sea air was also recognized and promoted from the late eighteenth century providing a healthy alternative to the stink noise and fevers found in cities again it was the upper classes who led the initial growth of these centres with increasing affluence by the end of the nineteenth century the middle classes and eventually the working classes after the introduction of paid holiday time also found temporary solace in these seaside places bodily emersion in the sea exercise by swimming and the apparently beneficial effects of tanning were added to the initial atmospheric benefits although the fear of skin cancer from over-exposure to the sun has reduced the time people spend on tanning in the last 20 yearsby the end of the nineteenth century the changes described above began the health transformation of many urban places in developed countries that led to a rapid decline in premature deaths soon after a new phase of improved medical knowledge training surgical techniques the use of new technologies and the discovery of anti-bacterial drugs and vaccinations for many diseases increasingly played a major part in reducing deaths although advances in sanitation and environmental improvement were still being made what became known as the biomedical model became dominant in health care this model
attributes morbidity and mortality to molecular level pathogens brought about by individual life-styles hereditary biology or genetics and it altered public health to personal risk factors such as smoking diet and exercise corburn 2009 p 49
although local government continued the progress of ensuring improvements in the physical fabric and public health officials monitored local health conditions the growth and dominance of what amounted to germ theory ideas and the success of individual cure and care approach by doctors and hospitals meant it was the medical profession not city officials as in the engineering and regulation phase that increasingly became the main decision-makers in health care in addition there was a move away from what is usually called the urban field view in health terms where residents and professionals searched for the particular qualities of place caused by the interactions between the various elements that caused ill-health this was seen in the early sanitary phase which led to more context-specific and localized policy responses although the move to laboratory sites and techniques produced great results the reduced interest from what were real world not controlled conditions meant that the local milieus that caused or assisted diseases were often underestimatedin addition the new profession of planning increasingly downplayed the need to put health issues in the forefront of their concerns certainly many planning departments emphasized the need for a more ordered and efficient land use distribution especially to ensure that noxious industry would be separated from residential areas while ensuring the latter would have various effective public facilities from roads sewers schools recreational areas etc these issues were connected to health improvements but corburn 2009 p 41 has described how attempts were made by some late nineteenth century american planners marsh 1909 to argue that the planning profession should focus primarily on the key issues of social justice and the health of cities that had motivated the nineteenth century reformers such opinions failed to influence leaders of the new american planning association  so efficiency and also aesthetics such as the city beautiful ideas became the main emphasis yet planners often assumed that efficient land use planning was itself a way of improving health especially after acceptance of the neighbourhood unit principle with its insistence on lots of green space the incorporation of many facilities within the unit and the positioning of main roads outside the unit in addition the removal of slum areas and their replacement with new tower blocks was also seen as a way of improving the housing conditions of the poorest classes and hence their health however there is more than a whiff of social determinism in planning  since it is assumed that the provision of new housing in these new low density layouts and new high-rises would automatically alter behaviours and improve health advocates did not anticipate that the neighbourhood units would became car-suburbs as vehicle ownership increased contributing to the lack of exercise or that many of the high estates would become crime-ridden areas with few jobs limited security and social isolation creating new areas of deprivation ill-health and often racial segregation hence in health terms a new set of problems emerged in these newly developed urban environments while disadvantaged areas persisted these were not effectively addressed by municipal planners also the increasing domination of the biomedical model of medicine meant that despite the sterling work of community health specialists most attention was focused on the cure of the diseases of individuals not on wider and often long term issues that contributed to these problems or on the recognition that decision-making on health care issues should involve more than medical professionalstable 131 shows that the who estimates of the top twenty reasons for the direct causes of mortality in 2015 and 2030 is no longer dominated by the communicable diseases that so devastated the populations of cities especially in the past most seem to have been conquered today the majority of the deaths come from so-called chronic diseases linked to organ failures such as heart attacks and strokes to cancers of various types and diabetes these diseases now account for 35 million deaths a year of a total mortality of 57 million which has led to calls for urgent world attention to be paid to these problems who 2010 yet despite the major advances that have taken place in the treatment of such diseases especially if the problem is diagnosed early table 131 shows they are still predicted to be the highest ranking sources of mortality in the foreseeable future moreover these chronic diseases are no longer restricted to the developed world for 80  of the deaths from such causes now take place in low or medium income countries places that are the least equipped to deal with such problems clearly there is need for more research into the cure for these problems some of which come from long exposures to unhealthy environments or poor life-styles over many years which means better health education and monitoring also more treatments for such diseases in the developing world is needed indeed it has been estimated that less than 3  of the international development assistance going to developing countries is spent on non-communicative diseases who 2010 showing the continued fixation with diseases spread by infections a related issue here is the increased costs of providing care for patients with such chronic conditions which require longer periods of care and greater expense

these changes in the causes of mortality are also related to the general problem of coping with aging for it is estimated that the global population of those over 65 years will almost double from the current 600 million to 11 billion by 2035 resulting in a change from 8 to 13  of the population some of these people will be healthy and active but many will have ill-health and there is predicted to be major increases in the numbers of people suffering from various forms of dementia  such as alzheimers for which there is no known cure at present except for interventions that help to delay or reduce its impacts recent estimates show that 356 million people in the world are already suffering from this disease of cognitive impairment and loss conditions that already leads to health care costs of  604 billion who-adi 2012 the numbers with dementia are predicted to almost double by 2030 and will more than triple to 1154 million sufferers by 2050 this will require much larger numbers of senior centres and homes to cope with and treat the growing number of patients as well as finding enough qualified staff it has been known that many life-style factors are correlated with those who have the disease for example people who are active and socially integrated and those with higher educational attainments less likely to be at risk in 2014 a major new study focused on the impact of a series of modifiable life-style factors on the incidence of alzheimers a major type of dementia norton et al 2014 it revealed that seven factorsphysical inactivity smoking mid-life hypertension midlife obesity diabetes depression and low educational attainmentwere all significantly correlated with the disease and that one-third of cases could be avoided by changes in life-style for example those who did not engage in at least three 20 min bursts of rigorous exercise a week were 82  more likely to develop the disease the importance of the study is that the estimated huge increase in numbers could be drastically reduced by these life-style changes the problem of coping with this wave of new cases will be hardest in the developing world where there are less resources to deal with the problem especially in cities where there are likely to be fewer family or long term friends to help with carealthough increases in the elderly population is a growing problem in most developed and middle income countries there are marked spatial inequalities in this effect with aging in japan occurring more rapidly than in other developed countries it is creating one of the most severe current problems but also provides a warning to other countries the population over 65 years of age in japan reached 23  of the total in 2011 and is projected to be 38  by 2050 with the population declining by a third from the current 127 million in 50 years it is estimated that by 2035 there will be 69 persons over 65 years of age in japan compared to 100 in the working population 2564 years up from 43 in 2011 whereas the world today has only 16 in the over 65 age category some of the effects of the aging trend may be reduced by raising fertility rates and by people working longer but these skewed future rates will not only require more health care but will lead to potential gdp losses unless labour is replaced by capital and more immigration is allowed which in the case of japan has never been a policy palatable to the majority since caring for this aging population is now a major problem and many villages and small towns will soon be dominated by old people japan instituted a long care elderly insurance scheme  this is funded by compulsory taxes on people over 40 years of age and other taxes few other countries or cities facing aging populations are making such provision indeed in some countries such as the uk government cutbacks since the 2007 financial depression has led to major cuts in the budgets of local authorities and care for the aged is falling at a time when there is greater need however in some cities there is a gradual realization of the need to plan for this aging process for example in many american cities such as new york and cleveland there are now departments of aging in the municipal organization which are designed to prevent elder abuse and also to provide programmes to assist the elderly especially by creating on-line websites that list the various services that seniors can access and use to obtain help a more general approach to mitigate the effect of aging occurred with the whos establishment of the global network of age-friendly cities and communities in 2006 gnafcc initially based on 33 cities in 22 countries the network is designed to provide guidance to other cities wishing to implement policies that promote healthy and active aging by creating an active and accessible urban environment key components are the involvement of seniors in the discussions and policy formulation and to provide indicators to measure progress as well as evaluations of their effectiveness in subsequent years eight domains of city life have been identified in a guide for age-friendly cities  as well as communities within urban places who 2007 these domains are in the fields of transportation respect and social inclusion outdoor spaces and buildings social participation housing information and communication community support and health services civic partnership and employment opportunities historically many churches and neighbourhood networks based on long residence as well as families have provided fellowship and help for seniors but in a more mobile and secular society these local support systems have decayed making it imperative to plan for an active older population not simply to house them it is tragic that so many old peoples homes are built in remote locations in cities with few places to walk to or to obtain goods resulting in the almost warehousing and segregation of old people  rather than building premises to support active living near shopping or transit nodes and also adopting the other recommendations of the whos age-friendly city network gnafcc issues largely ignored by new urbanism and other themesone of the biggest challenges to modern medicine is to create a more equitable pattern of cure and care the poorest people in developed countries and the majority in the developing world still have limited access to health care facilities  even of a basic level with resultant high and unnecessary death rates from diseases where cures are available one stark example can be seen in table 131 which shows the persistence of high death rates from the old scourges of childbirth  such as preterm birth problems 11 and birth trauma 18 a large proportion of these 19 million deaths occur in rural areas which could be cured by access to modern medical knowledge and better health care which should occur with greater urbanization one of the reasons why both diseases are expected to drop substantially in the next 15 years and result in lower rankingsmuch of the reduction in mortality and ill-health rates in urban places has been due to the way that the most widespread communicable disease threats  such as measles chicken pox polio or tetanus have been controlled by vaccinations that provide adaptive immunity against the pathogens that cause these diseases and by antibiotic drugs that kill bacterial infections so only respiratory infections no 3 in table 131 diarrhoeal diseases no 5 and tuberculosis no 13 are found in the top twenty of the major causes of death today who 2012a in total only a fifth of the annual deaths in the world now come from infectious diseases yet the proportions vary spatially with levels of 40  in the less developed world to close to only 7  in developed countries such as the uk davies et al 2013 p 27 the limited availability of effective health care antiseptic methods and the availability of vaccinations and antibiotics in the developing world combined with limited clean water sanitary facilities and more airborne pollutants means that these treatable diseases still kill far too many people given existing medical knowledge so there is still a lot of room for real progress in the fight against such diseases in the settlements of poorer countries moreover the current control over the most infectious diseases should not lead to complacency some such as smallpox kopolow 2003 have been eradicated with polio well on the way until new outbreaks occurred in afghanistan pakistan and northern nigeria a result of war and fanatical islamists preventing vaccinations others such as increasing cases of tuberculosis in cities such as london seem to come from immigrants arriving with the infection from countries where the disease is still endemic this means that more effective screening of the health background of immigrants is probably needed also there is always the threat of new outbreaks of many of the diseases largely controlled because of increasing numbers of people refusing to accept vaccinations so vigilance to spot new outbreaks and their source as well as mass vaccination programmes are still needed there is also the threat of new previously unknown diseases appearing with the case of the acquired immunodeficiency virus aids and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars providing opposite examples of early failure and success in coping with the problems in the former case holt 2014 has described how the growth of the disease caused by a virus spread through sexual contact and contaminated blood which quickly mutates and was difficult to treat it led to a high of 22 million annual deaths originally unrecognized from its origin in infected monkeys in africa its spread from the 1980s was helped by governments such as south africa which refused basic treatment to victims today antiretroviral drugs can halt its progression allowing people to lead an active life although they are not cured so since 353 million are infected worldwide the virus is still estimated to be the sixth most common cause of death in 2030 table 131 and remains as a major threat by contrast the respiratory disease sars that spread between november 2002 and july 2003 provides an example of the dangers that can quickly emerge in our connected world enserink 2013 it originated from a species jump of the virus to a chinese farmer from its host in bats and civets and then to others in local markets and hong kong in this case it was relatively quickly diagnosed when travellers from hong kong brought it back to north america due to vigilance of doctors in major hospitals in canada and the united states alerted to a new disease in southern china and its rapid identification by canadian researchers and the us centre for disease control and prevention  victims were isolated in special wards with their contacts being tracked and warned enserink 2013 in addition civets in the southern chinese markets that acted as hosts were destroyed the use of masks and other protective clothing by carers and the careful cleaning and sanitation of all surfaces near infected people also reduced the spread of the infections in the longer term the search for cures is vital what the example also shows is the need to have large numbers of wards or places available to be turned into isolation rooms if a similar major outbreak occursa scale of resources which may still be rare in most urban centres even in the developed world in the past separate quarantine hospitals  and even areas were set aside in or near cities for people with infectious diseases for example north brothers island in new york fulfilled this role especially for immigrants although it is now abandoned and its buildings are decaying if infectious diseases cannot be controlled by vaccines and drugs this type of separation may again have to be practiced the history of the sars outbreak shows the need for rapid genome typing of a suspected new disease and the ability to quickly create large numbers of isolation wards to quarantine victims it illustrates how a multipronged and international effort is needed to prevent the spread of new communicable diseases yet there is little doubt that there are many diseases that are still unknown or like the hemorrhagic fever ebola  kills 70 or more of infected people and does not have a cure until recently it had not spread beyond a few isolated areas of africa and seemed to be containable but in 2014 a major outbreak occurred in three countries of west africa which has raised the spectre of a major spread assistance in dealing with the outbreak is being helped by the addition of skilled international medical teams but the burial practices of many cultures in the area plus suspicion of western medical practices and the desire to avoid the stigma of having a family member diagnosed with the disease handicapped containment showing how cultural factors and very limited medical facilities impede medical progress with the exception of hiv-aids the world has managed to avoid pandemics for almost a hundred years since the so-called spanish flu a virus causing a virulent form of influenza that killed at least 50 million and infected 500 million world-wide in 19181920 but the new travel contacts and the increasing concentrations of people in urban places puts this generally positive history of controlling communicable diseases in the twentieth century at greater risk which is also linked to another emerging problemthis is the title of a provocative and chilling small book by the british medical officer of health and her colleagues davies et al 2013 in it she describes an emerging crisis of antimicrobial resistance amr caused by the fact that many microorganisms bacteria fungus virus or parasites no longer respond to the drugs that have been invented to counteract their effect in creating various diseases although reporting is flawed it is estimated that 25000 people die from such problems in europe annually from the inability of formerly effective drugs to work more than are killed on roads almost similar levels of deaths occur from amr in the usa cdc 2014 who 2014b the reason is that the bacteria have developed resistance to the drugs that killed them it was something that sir alexander fleming warned about after accepting the nobel prize for his discovery of penicillin in 1923 namely that it is a fact of nature that bacteria and viruses mutate and develop new forms and those new disease-causing types will be resistant to drugs that previously killed them hence no drug is going to be effective forever the scale of this problem should not be underestimated for similar conclusions have been reached by other reports on the problem in the usa cdc 2o14 and by the who 2014b in its first comprehensive survey of a number of amr bacteria if this mortality was linked to some visible known specific disease there would be public pressure for a cure but since the deaths from these resistant microbes are scattered throughout the country they appear to be almost hidden so the scale of the problem has been underestimated until the last few years the detailed tables in the who report 2014a also show that there are great variations between countries in the scale of the problem which varies with different disease-causing microorganisms some of the biggest worries are seen in the case of tuberculosis where 20  of previously treated cases proved to be resistant to multidrug treatment cases in some countries while in many places gonorrhoea cases are now being treated with the final drug that works in the case of cyprus 36  of a sample of people tested proved resistant to anti e coli drugs  while 68  of sampled people in greece were resistant to microorganisms that caused pneumonia who 2014b in addition south east asia is a region where new resistances to anti-malarial drugs have emerged certainly the sample sizes vary in each case study and cannot be used to conclude they represent the whole population but the evidence is sufficiently worrying for the authors of the three main reports to date to use the words crisis and even catastrophe in descriptions of the problem diseases that were thought to be controlled could return and kill large numbers while the drugs routinely used to prevent infections after surgery are proving less effective in many areas in some areas multi-drug treatment has proved effective but this is very expensive and involves specialised individual treatment that may be the equivalent of  80000 annually making their use out of the question for poorer peoplethe problem of amr is made worse because the major pharmaceutical companies are no longer researching new antimicrobial drugs to replace those previously effective from 1934 to 1968 14 classes of antibiotics were created but only five since that time and none since 1987 davies 2013 while currently the who 2014b recognizes 27 different types of effective vaccinations the reason for the decline in antibiotic development is the costs of innovation perhaps over  1 billion in research testing and satisfying the regulatory agencies companies believe the costs do not justify the potential financial return given that many of the drugs may be needed only once or on a few occasions to cure some infectionunlike the daily drug regimes for many suffers of chronic diseases also limited patent time and the small returns from poor countries where patients cannot afford the drugs although the need is high adds to the reluctance to invest in amr development so a market failure has occurred which means the inability of the market to prove a strong enough attraction to create new amr drugs britains chief medical officer of health has identified the problem starkly
we are losing the battle against infectious diseases bacteria are fighting back and are becoming resistant to modern science in short the drugs dont work our response needs to be global and multifaceted to manage and mitigate the risk of antimicrobial resistance which is just as important and deadly as climate change and international terrorism davies et al 2013 pp ixxiii
there have been many suggestions to solve the emerging crisis one is to resolve the market failure that has reduced research this can be done by helping companies to finance new drug research increasing the participation of government and university researchers as well as encouraging charitable organizations to work with companies in joint venture financing such as the medicines for malaria venture  in addition quicker means of identifying new bacterial and viral strains are needed which is happening through the development of genome sequencing while new serums may be effective  linked to this is the need to have rapid communication through international health agencies about the appearance of new infections allowing countries to take precautions which is the role of americas amr monitoring system set up in 1996 and the whos geneva hub cdc 2013 what is also needed is low-tech advice such as better education to reduce the spread of infections by thorough hand-washing and sterilization on surfaces near infected patients also there is need for more radical cleaning methods in hospitals such as the vaporizing technique that sterilizes everything in hospital wards zoutman et al 2011 there are some signs of success in these efforts for more careful procedures have reduced rates of a particularly troublesome bacterium called methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus bacterium mrsa
in britain by 80  since the 2008 peak when increasing numbers were picking up infections in hospitals davies et al 2013it has also been argued that there are other reasons for amr  too many antibiotics have been given out routinely often for viral infections that they cannot solve while many people do not take the full dose meaning bacteria are not properly eradicated and those that resist multiply in addition broad spectrum drugs are often prescribed designed to cover many diseases making bacterial mutations more likely more specific drugs aimed at particular diseases would help but this requires better diagnostic tests also this broad spectrum approach and indiscriminate use of antibiotics are killing off some of the many millions of good bacteria that exist in our bodies and are helpful for our health so the who and governments at many levels are emphasizing the need to educate doctors and the public to reduce their routine drug use especially for minor infections that do not need them which decreases the opportunity for bacteria resistances to emerge this over-use is especially a problem in countries where antibiotic products can be bought in shops without a prescription it is not only a developing world issue but one that exists in many mediterranean countries where resistances to five basic bacterial strains have grown whereas the figure in the uk where the drugs need a doctors prescription was only 04  who 2014b the growth of illegally produced and often ineffective antibiotics is another challenge that needs to be rapidly contained an even greater problem comes from the routine antibiotic doses given to farm animals especially in the high density farming of chickens pigs and cattle without waiting for infections to emerge and isolating the infected cases this greater exposure to the drugs again makes it more likely that resistant bacteria will emerge such farming practices are routine in north america but banned in europe resulting in europe closing its markets to meat products from north america to drastically reduce this drug use is going to be difficult given the profits that pharmaceutical companies make from such practices we may see similar problems to those experienced by attempts by governments to reduce tobacco advertising etc which led to huge lawsuits by the tobacco firms action on amr is occurring at last but is long overdue if what senior medical people and authorities describe as an emerging crisis is going to be solvedmost people in the developed world now spend most of their lives in indoor environments for time-budget surveys have shown that the average american spends only an hour a day outside this has led to increased attention being paid to the health problems created by these indoors environments godish 2001 in the less developed world the continued use of charcoal or wood burning fires for cooking with inadequate smoke extraction leads to respiratory problems and far too many premature deaths estimated at 43 million annually who 2014a in the developed world the hazards associated with the historic use of asbestos for insulation and lead in paint has become well known and their poisonous effects have gradually been removed by eliminating them in new buildings although older structures may still have these and other contaminants the health and crime effects of lead in paint and from car emission fumes have already been described in the discussion on safe cities chap 101007978-94-017-9655-212 although these and other poisonous materials are being identified and eradicated a wider set of problems associated with indoor living have come from what has been described as the sick building syndrome  indeed it was estimated in 1984 that up to 30  of new office buildings were affected by the problem epa 1991 a wide range of factors contribute to this syndrome such as poor ventilation causing polluted air to circulate poorly sited intakes which bring in exhaust and other fumes biological contaminants in water ducts and tanks various toxic chemical emissions from insulation materials plywood and artificial fibres as well as from the over-use of poisonous cleaning chemicals while dust containing materials brought from outside as well as insects spores dirt and skin particles exacerbates asthmatic conditions itself a disease that is rapidly increasing fortunately the smoking bans in workplaces restaurants and public places has helped reduced the problem it must be acknowledged that it was often cities that began the process of making such practices illegal and subject to fines another problem comes from the fact that living mainly indoors in a climate-controlled environment means that the body does not have to consume so many calories to keep warm so people with the same eating habits are more likely to become overweight by spending too much time indoorsthe increase in indoor living has also reduced exposure to sunlight and its ultraviolet radiation which creates health-giving vitamin d in the body without it there are sunlight deficiencies in the densely populated slums of nineteenth century cities it led to high incidences of rickets in childrena disease of bone deformation traditional societies in northern climes were protected because their diet included high levels of vitamin d from oily fish fortunately the disease was largely eradicated in developed countries in the twentieth century by lower density layouts and mandatory green spaces in new housing areas as well as by dietary supplements containing the essential vitamin d such as by the provision of free milk and the cod liver oil supplements given to children in britain during world war ii gille 2004 sadly new cases of rickets have emerged in children occupying crowded houses in parts of london michie 2013 a reduction in vitamin d can also lead to a depressive illness known as seasonal affective disorder sad  originally seen in countries with long winters and cloudy skies such as in the deep fiordic coastal areas of norway in particular it has become increasingly prevalent in those who do not venture outdoors however this can be cured by increasing the amount of time spent outside in sunlight or through light therapy from intense light pads lurie et al 2006 and adding vitamin d to dietsanother worrying medical trend in recent years has been the explosion in the incidence of autoimmune diseases ai  such as type 1 diabetes multiple sclerosis schizophrenia rheumatoid arthritis crohns disease coeliac disease gluten intolerance several forms of cancer and as some researchers suggest autism kinder and hagaman 2011 yang et al 2013 these diseases are given the ai label as they are caused by the body attacking its own tissues with some researchers suggesting they currently affect 510  of the world population proportions that seem certain to increase even if they are not yet in the highest causes of mortality and ill-health ramagopalan et al 2010 the exact causes are still unknown but it has been recently found that these diseases have higher rates in the developed lands of higher latitudes as well as in urban compared to rural societies and with seasonal peaks in late winter and spring disanto et al 2012 it has also been suggested that these associations seem to account for the higher levels of diseases such as ms in women in cloudy areas such as the orkneys in increases in black-skinned individuals who are second generation immigrants in inner city london as well as in women in iran since the islamic revolution forced many women to wear all-embracing veils gille 2004 michie 2013 researchers are suggesting that the environmental effect of low sunlight exposure in both northern and it must be stressed urban places results in vitamin d deficiencies  which may also be at least a partial cause of the explosion in the incidence of many of these non-skeletal problems the recent increases in asthma rates also seems to have similar causes litonjua and weiss 2007 have calculated that asthma now affects 300 million people worldwide and has shown a 50  increase since the 1970s which also seems to be the result of a deficiency of vitamin d in this case one that impairs lung development in the foetus hagaman et al 2011more recent research has also discovered that natural levels of vitamin d are also low in mothers with children born in late winter-early spring this is due to a lack of exposure to the vitamin d-causing properties of sunlight again linked to more indoor living research reviews have implicated over 18 of these autoimmune diseases ai with low vitamin d levels in pregnancy so that deficits in this vitamin go beyond its role in bone metabolism that leads to rickets yang et al 2013 although the precise causes of the relationships are still under investigation the low vitamin d effect may be exacerbated by genetic risk and perhaps mothers diets weiss and litonjua 2007 litonjua and weiss 2011 researchers have suggested that it is probable that the low vitamin levels may make a pregnant mothers body create antibodies that cause particular genes to malfunction as well as damaging the brain of the foetus these antibodies are not flushed away before birth but remain in the body and cause certain genes in some people to malfunction in later years resulting in the body being attacked by its own immune system this problem in early gestation means that adding vitamin d later in life does not solve the problem it has also been argued that this vitamin also seems to be essential in providing adequate amounts of serotonin in the brain which have been shown to be low in autistic children who have low empathy levels which provides an explanation for the higher incidence of the disease with males and those born in late winter patrick and ames 2014although ai research is still in its infancy recommendations to combat their increase are emerging one is the recommendation that pregnant women eat more natural sources of vitamin d in fruits and vegetables and take supplements of the vitamin this research also suggests that the accepted wisdom since the late 1960s of reducing exposure to sunlight because of the risk of skin cancer needs to be modified for moderate exposure amounts is needed to reduce the subsequent increase of susceptibility to these ai diseases
it seems likely that a gradual decrease in exposure to sun due to sun avoidance behaviours in western societies sunscreen clothing sun avoidance increased time spent indoors reached a critical level in the early 1970s such that humans were not spending enough time outdoors and vitamin d levels reached acutely low levels vitamin d is essential to the normal functioning of the human immune system litonjua and weiss 2007 p 747
all these suggestions seem especially applicable to the poorest population often in overcrowded parts of cities with few park spaces although attempts have been made to ensure poor mothers and their children are provided with vouchers for fruit vegetables and free vitamins such as in britains healthy start programme for children at risk it has been reported that less than 10  used this opportunitya depressing and unnecessary result attributed to gaps in supply chains delivery systems and poor staff training michie 2013all these emerging problems may be amenable to further breakthroughs in medical research and the greater spread of effective care but as the cases of the failure of some antibiotics and the aging population in particular indicate there are huge problems developing that will need a great deal of research work to combat moreover if infectious diseases cannot be controlled by antibiotics the historic danger of diseases spreading by contagion in large urban areas will re-emerge this risk is reinforced by the new fast transports of air and train including cramped subway systems which crowd people into what are effectively sealed containers and deliver them to far flung destinations where they quickly and anonymously disperse into the larger settlements and may infect populations not used to the diseases they may carry also other emerging health problems such as ai diseases seem to have an association with our increased urban living these negative effects of urban living mean there should be a major emphasis on providing healthier urban behaviours and environmentsthese are the first three health determinants shown in fig 131 the most fundamental influence on the health of persons or populations stem from their biological constitution
 their ability to ward-off and recover from disease and disabilities in this context features such as age gender life-history and the genetic make-up of people are all important age is really a matter of being more prone to certain problems as the body ages and experiences what amounts to wear and tear or in the early years when a baby may not have developed the strength or immunities to fight off the dangers in the local environment gender is also important as males or females may be more liable to suffer more from one type of disease or disability than others the latter certainly live longer on average than the former although some of the differences are due to greater risk-taking in males and their more unhealthy life-style choices some families may have flaws in their genetic make-up that make them more prone to certain diseases in addition some groups have a greater ability than others to resist certain diseases not because of inherent racial features but through centuries of developed immunity to problems caused by some pathogens others do not have these resistances the tragic result of these differences not being understood was seen in the european age of exploration when the indigenous peoples of the americas died in their tens of millions from diseases introduced by europeanstable 131 separates medical knowledge
from health care
since high levels of knowledge does not mean there is cure and care for all individuals in an area especially while there are many different forms of care and differential access to it  continued research and effective and equitable application in all of these determinants are obviously needed especially given the need to counteract the severe challenges identified above that come from emerging medical problems nevertheless there are still many spatial inequalities in the provision availability and effectiveness of medical care not simply within and between cities but in urban centres in the developing world that have limited facilities and where only the affluent get adequate care in addition there are increasing worries about accelerating health care costs with ever more technical procedures and longer treatments for the new chronic diseases some indication of the escalation of costs can be seen by the fact that the budget of the national health service in the uk which provides universal coverage for all citizens was originally close to 15 billion 9 billion equivalent when adjusted for inflation to provide current value in 1948 when the programme began but the budget is now is now more than 12 times this original amount and is a growing at 4  a year with increasing needs from an aging population although more careful administration and costs savings in hospitals or in care facilities may reduce the figure the size of the budget and its growth make it unlikely that they will do more than modify the total meaning that new ways of funding the system perhaps by larger tax increases will be required these costs are more difficult to absorb in the less developed world where access and availability to care is limited indeed globally health care availability is inversely related to need howatt et al 2012 this is leading to the development of so-called frugal technologies to solve medical problems at lower costs using less sophisticated techniques in order to increase availability in low income areas another problem that has emerged is the corruption and fraud in some countries for example the us system is largely a private one although there are government agencies that provide care and subsidies for the aged medicare and the poor medicade recent reports suggest fraud could be as high as  272 billion annually which is around 10  of us medical spending te 2014 the health care fraud comes from many sources that include suppliers charging medicade for non-existent supplies patients claiming benefits to which they are not entitled doctors or health clinics charging for extra or non-essential services and filing prescriptions for painkillers and then selling them people stealing medical cards and using them to bill medicare for services that they are not entitled to steps are being taken to reduce this enormous leakage of funds including simplifying the claims systems and providing more vigorous checking this problem of wasted money may be more obvious in the complicated us system but certainly exists in other jurisdictions and must be reduced so that health care money can be spent more wisely and fairlythe fourth determinant contributing to the health or ill-health of populations come from the life-style choices that people make although these effects are often cumulative and take place over decades the strong adherence to the principle that a population in democratic countries should be able to make their own choices reduces the ability to create quick solutions especially of a coercive nature so multi-pronged approaches are usually needed it has already been noted that the population in the developed world in particular spends too much time indoors there is a need to redesign areas and to provide leisure spaces where more outdoor activity is encouraged however the most obvious pernicious effects of life-style choices come from the increase in the use of addictive substances that drastically reduce the life-span of people using such products for example despite the now well-known health hazards of smoking an estimated 12 billion people still use tobacco regularly and the proportions of smokers in even oecd countries is often still over 20  this also puts the others individuals adjacent to smokers at a high risk of smoke inhalation either first or second hand and leads to higher rates of respiratory problems and cancers similarly drug use leads to premature deaths and other crime problems but a more general problem comes from the overuse of alcohol which leads to liver and heart diseases as well as contributions to traffic accidents a recent study revealed that 25  of russian males die before the age of 55compared to 7  in the ukwith an average age of death for males at 64 a result of overconsumption of vodka zaridze and peto et al 2014 however there is also evidence that beer and wine in small proportions has a positive effect on health preedy 2011 and helped reduce mortality rates in historic cities where beer with alcohol killing bacteria was safer than contaminated waterall these problems require determined efforts to produce a reduction of addiction levels  in the case of tobacco use many initiatives have helped reduce the problem such as increasing taxes and banning advertising on products adding health warnings increasing educational programmes to avoid or reduce use and banning their use in public spacesbut the constant litigation by tobacco companies has reduced progress still more effective policies are needed which probably need a combination of persuasion and regulation outright prohibition of products drives the issue underground and criminalizes the behaviour as shown by the us prohibition of alcohol in 19201933 many of the anti-tobacco policies could be applied to reduce binge drinking the same applies to drug use where despite billions spent in attacking the sources of supply and distribution the problem is as worse as ever some have argued that removing criminal prosecutions and treating drug use as a medical not criminal problem would help reduce the addictions but the majority opinion is still against such a change which means that alternative methods must be founda more recent health problem associated with life-style relates to dietary choices  changes in the diet of people in many western countries with overconsumption of sugary drinks and foods rich in fat red meat sugar and salt has led to increased obesity  leading to a greater probability of ill-health from a number of diseases for example it is currently estimated that one-third of school age children in the usa and two-thirds of american adults are overweight or obese with far higher rates in afro-american and hispanic women ogden et al 2014 being overweight or obese increases the risk from a variety of chronic diseases especially heart failure stroke and diabetes which are among the top causes of mortality with numbers projected to increase substantially in the next 15 years table 131 this trend is not simply a result of increasing purchasing poweralthough this makes a huge contributionbut also comes from the relentless advertising by manufacturers to increase demand for their products especially to children creating what amounts to an obesogenic environment in addition far larger portions of most meals and drinks are available compared to 30 years ago which compounds the problem another contributing factor is the limited availability of healthy food options in low-income areasthere is little doubt that national legislations are being enacted to address this growing problem for example almost a third of the population in mexico were reported as being overweight 14  have diabetes and the average daily consumption of sugary drinks was half a litre this led to mexicos 2013 decision to increase by 10  the tax on sweetened beverages using major advertising campaigns to support the policy in other countries such as britain attempts are being made to create agreement partnerships with large retailers to reduce the number of sale prices on products with large portions of fat and sugar as well as on alcohol products many also believe it is important to reduce the level of advertising on such products especially those aimed at children the mandatory labelling of calorie levels in tinned or packaged products is also taking place in the hope that the public will become more aware and make more informed choices about what and how much they are eating yet only a multifaceted strategy will solve this increasing crisis as summarized in a who report 2000 on obesity
 preventing and managing the global epidemic unfortunately limited progress has been achieved since its publication however some cities are taking the lead in public health actions such as those relating to diet before national regulations are developed for example alcon 2012 has argued that mayor bloombergs leadership in promoting healthy initiatives in new york provided one of the first examples of a municipal politician taking controversial stances in this field this led the health commissioner thomas farley to note that
for way too long public health departments have defined their responsibility as essentially infectious disease control rather than the improvement of health of the population alcon 2012 p 2038
the new york approach has been to implement policies to reduce levels of addiction and improve diets such as by the banning of smoking in public places and businesses plastering anti-smoking advertisements on subways banning transfats in restaurants and an attempted ban on large sugary drink containers that was struck down by the courts in addition there has been greater targeting of crime problem areas for most have high levels of ill-health as seen in the crime measures described in the discussion on safe cities chap 101007978-94-017-9655-212 and in creating district public health offices in areas of low health such as one in the bronxin other countries more and more planning decisions are being made to improve the walkability of subdivisions and adding segregated bicycle paths to increase this form of transport as described in chaps 101007978-94-017-9655-24 and 101007978-94-017-9655-26 such policies are designed to increase exercise levels which in turn improves health but it is overeating the wrong types of food that is the major problem in most areas in addition the trend that has reduced play time sports and exercise periods in schools is being reversed in many cities in an attempt to increase the fitness and therefore health of children while the increasing popularity of physical health clubs for adults shows that a start has been made on the problem by at least some people although it is difficult to quantify the effect of exercise recent surveys indicated that 9  of premature mortality in non-communicative diseases is due to low levels of activity  although this varied with the type of disease or illness lee et al 2012 while other researchers argued that participation in sport is associated with a 2040  reduction in all causes of mortality khan et al 2012behind these first four domains of health factors are four categories of environmental determinants  related to the natural built economic and social environments although the causes of disability and premature mortality often relate to one or more of these factors a who survey of the environmental effect on ill-health prss-stn and corveln 2006 estimated that 24  of the global disease burden health years lost and 23  of the annual deaths are due to what are described as modifiable environmental factors
 proportions that rise to closer to a third for children these are described as the factors in the physical and built-environments that can be altered they exclude factors such as disease vectors in water bodies impregnated bed nets as well as social behaviours or life-styles the who report showed that the burden of environmental effects on premature mortality and ill-health is far higher in the developing countries and varies with disease type studies of the risk factors of different diseases show that 85 out of the 102 types covered had an environmental factor although these varied considerably the highest mortality proportions were seen with diarrhoea 94  and malaria 42  far higher than the 20  from lower respiratory causes although this rises to over 40  in developing areas primarily due to fumes from the use of solid fuel fires in enclosed spaces the risk factor may be greater than previously thought as recent work is showing that environmental effects can be passed through generations through epigenetic processes whereby genes are turned on or off tollefsbol 2014the first of these environmental influences are those from the physical conditions features often forgotten when the focus of attention is upon cities in the developed mid-latitude world that have less extreme environments for example health is often affected by extreme deviations from the normal climatic regimes
 such as in cases of extreme cold or heat and high humidity where the elderly young and those in ill-health die in larger numbers in such weather conditions some of these problems are made worse because of the heat-island effect of all the concrete steel and bricks in cities for example in july 1995 a chicago heat wave led to temperatures reaching over 40 calthough the effective temperatures as felt by the body in the sun and in buildings were far higherresulting in the deaths of over 600 people klinenburg 2002 the size of the mortality from this event in one city is worth comparing with other statistics in the decade after 1992 2190 americans died from heat-related causes compared to 880 from floods and 150 from hurricanes although this shows that extreme heat can result in spikes of mortality it is important not to underestimate the effect of disasters from natural hazards
when many thousands even millions of people have been killed by major storms earthquakes volcanic eruptions as described in chap 101007978-94-017-9655-28the second health effect of the physical environmental comes from various biotic hazards
 ranging from snakes to toxic plants although these are often less of a problem in cities as they are often deliberately eradicated of greater significance are the diseases spread by contagion in a densely populated area by pathogens developed in or carried by various animals or insects perhaps the best known historic examples come from the various plagues such as the black death plague that spread from asia via trade routes and peaked in 13481350 in europe and led to the deaths of 75200 million people this was between 30 and 60  of europes populationalthough it must be noted that the century also saw the end of the medieval warming period and poor harvests which led to food shortages and a severely weakened the population herlithy 1997 more modern examples range from the previous descriptions of the rapid global spread of hiv-aids which contrasts with the containment of sarsthe mortality rates and ill-health effects of many tropical diseases are still far too high many not all now have cures but these are not often available in many cities and regions one of the biggest health problems is still associated with malaria  spread by parasites carried by certain types of female mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas although not in the top 20 causes of death in table 131 it has been argued that the 066 million deaths estimated by the who represent gross underestimates with the true figure being closer to 124 million let alone the debilitating effects on many people murray et al 2012 certainly medicines such as quinine several recent drugs and the use of nets over beds at dusk and night when mosquitoes are flying have reduced the risk of the disease so has the draining of marshes and standing water pools in urban areas which reduce the number of places where the insects breed snowdens 2006 detailed study of the effects of malaria in italy until it was finally eradicated in 1962 showed how the disease had previously led to low productivity premature death and economic backwardness in the country it needed a multi-pronged state strategy from the early twentieth century to remove the scourge one that involved medical breakthroughs swamp draining rural clinics and education for preventative measures in tropical areas the hoped-for final solution by chemical spraying of marshes with ddt in the 1960s proved illusory as the parasites have bred resistance to particular drugs and the sprays used led to the poisoning of the water which created other problems for a whole range of birds and animals so despite determined efforts to reduce its effects through new drugs swamp draining and more recently through experiments with the mass inoculation of populations in some areas to reduce the number of people acting as hosts to the parasite malaria still remains a significant cause of ill-health and premature deaths this may get worse as some of the malaria-giving parasites are becoming resistant to the drugs used to treat them which makes new treatment discoveries a prioritythese are only a few of the examples of death and disability caused by factors from the physical environment especially from the hotter wetter environments where a large number of other serious diseases lurk such as dengue yellow fever typhoid etc some people in these areas have increased tolerance to these infections but many of these diseases have an increased ability to harm people who have travelled from other environments without the appropriate medical treatment one of the big emerging problems is the effect of global warming  this will probably lead to lower yields from current crop varieties in an aggregate sense leading to food shortages given world population growth unless new varieties can be developed in addition the warming will allow many flies and insects and hence the pathogens they carry to spread further north infecting people with little immunity so malaria may be spread again to europe as west nile disease is already becoming common in north america the fact that diseases such as african dengue and chikungunya fever have recently spread to the caribbean probably in the blood of an infected airline passenger and then into the local mosquito population means that these and other infectious diseases are likely to occur in more northerly locations causing additional health problemsthe second set of environmental factors that affect health come from poor man-made or built environments issues identified as causing high mortalities that led to the first healthy city movement progress in built-environment improvements  including the infrastructures such as transport systems to reduce their negative outputs has not been halted at least in the developed world for example many public sector high-rises have been razed because of high crime rates and poor construction coleman 1985 in terms of harmful outputs from cities chap 101007978-94-017-9655-26 has described the major improvements in the technical ability to more safely process and use the effluent in sewage processing plants while water can be re-cycled for human use in addition instead of new expensive solutions to bring water from long distances a series of new devices for reducing run-off and using this water mean that new water conservation measures are being used in some jurisdictions that will help water shortage in drier climates however these nineteenth century advances let alone those of recent years are still limited in the cities of the less developed world for the who2012b estimates that 11 billion people still lack access to clean water and 26 billion do not have even a basic latrine although have been major improvements in these basic sanitation and water supply facilities in the last decade many of these people live in rural areas but very unhealthy conditions linked to poor water supply and limited sanitation also exist in many urban places in developing countries especially in the informal shanty towns that are the homes to many in the towns and cities of developing countries one result of poor sanitation is the annual death toll of 18 million from diarrhoea  currently fifth in the who table of annual deaths although it is estimated to fall to ninth position it may still claim 16 million deaths a year in 2030 even though it is relatively easily treatable by modern medical techniqueshealth problems in cities are not simply a result of poorly constructed buildings and infrastructures there are often health problems associated with the use of manufactured substances whose poisonous side-effects are often underestimated some of these were identified in chap 101007978-94-017-9655-212 safe cities such as the lead in gasoline that produced more toxic car exhaust emissions that have been shown to affect brain development and subsequently iq levels and increased crime rates reyes 2007 markus et al 2010 more apparent are the deaths and disabilities from road accidents  which are among the most important causes of premature deaths davies 1997 the whos global study on road safety who 2013a showed that 14 million people die on the roads annually projected to increase to 18 million by 2030 with somewhere between 20 and 50 million more suffering serious injuries today table 131 certainly there are signs of improvement in the mortality rates in countries such as the usa with deaths now down to 34000 a year in 2012 from levels of 54000 in the early 1970s which is still a rate of 108 deaths per 1000 people a year and the size of a small country town even this figure is unacceptable in any case there is little room for complacency in world terms after all 91  of the fatalities are now in low and middle income countries places that contain only half of the world vehicles so far this high proportion is because only 28 countries with 7  of the world population have compulsory road safety standards in five critical areas drink and driving regulations speeding failure to have seat belts child-retaining devices and the enforced use of helmets for motorcyclists and cyclists in many countries mortality rates could be reduced if the following problems were solved lack of driving tests safe crossing places and pavements for pedestrians refusal to obey traffic signals and adherence to the designation of one side of the road for traffic in one direction erratic driving behaviour and limited effective ambulance services that can quickly administer care and remove traffic victims to hospitals although mortality and injury rates have dropped in most of the developed world there is still room for progress in their cities such as better designed roads and junctions especially at high traffic accident areas effective laws to reduce distracted driving segregated bicycle lanes more public transit and as some cities are showing saving lives by reducing speed limits in residential areas to 30 kmh or below improved transport systems and the use of bicycles also provide more healthy options with the latter in particular providing exercisethe man-made urban environments also affect health through the higher noise levels and the stress that many people feel in these areas often combined with an absence of meaningful supportive relationships issues usually dealt with under the social determinants of heath category more specifically health is also affected by all the pollutants
generated by human numbers and their activities from faecal matter to noxious products of industrial process and in household goods poisonous chemicals and nuclear outputs in some places and to the fumes and particulates from burning fossil fuels epa 1999 these not only cause local health problems but by altering the atmosphere are threatening to alter the climate of the planet many of these have already been described in the sustainable development discussion chap 101007978-94-017-9655-25 a who report 2014a on pollution levels in 1600 cities of the world maintains that air pollution both indoor due to stoves and fires and outdoor because of vehicle and industrial emissions from fossil fuelleads to over 7 million deaths annually from these sources although the indian government disputes the figures the source shows that delhi now has worse air quality than beijing as measured in small airborne particles that are less than 25 micrometers in size pm25 which are associated with increased rates of bronchitis lung cancer and heart diseasehowever not all aspects of a created environment are damaging the addition of parks green spaces recreation trails and nature areas etc have long been regarded as having a positive effects on humans as the discussion on the relationship between green space and health in the chapter on green cities has shown chap 101007978-94-017-9655-24 such areas provide an antidote in at least some cities to the increase in urban densities and indoor livingmany investigators from the nineteenth century social commentators to the present adler and ostrove 1999 have shown that people living in disadvantaged socio-economic circumstances suffer more ill-health and earlier death rates than others  however the adoption of the care and cure medical approach has tended to blame some health problems on life-style choices rather than the wider structural circumstances of their life in the socio-economic environment that negatively affect their health these components of disadvantage are now usually labelled as the social determinants of health with wilkinson and marmot 1999 2003 using empirical research results to identify ten significant factors in causing ill-health summarized as the social gradient unemployment work conditions food stress early life social exclusion social support addictions and transport but it does seem useful to separate the factors into what amount to economic and social factors rather than having one long list while the addictions and transport factors have already been dealt with in the previous discussions on life-style and man-made environment respectivelyone of the most powerful explanations of ill-health among the economic determinants is described by wilkinson and marmot 1999 as the social gradient  this means that people who are in the lowest income brackets have shorter lives than people in higher income brackets as seen in the canadian example in fig 132 features that also apply to more ill-health the pattern is much more pronounced in less developed countries less money for food heating adequate clothing ability to pay for and access to medical care knowledge of how to look after oneself are all contributory factors but the lack of education and hence ability to improve ones position in the social hierarchy is also a major contributing factor to this general trend populations that have higher levels of educational and occupational qualifications tend to have lower levels of dementia  indicating that there is some kind of cognitive reserve that counteracts the effect of this neuro-degeneration prince and acosti et al 2012 however it was previously noted that the modification of other life-style factors such as physical inactivity could drastically reduce the incidence of the disease norton et al 2014 another powerful social determinant of ill-health is the unemployment rate as is limited work satisfaction and difficult work conditions in general people at the lower end of the social gradient also have longer periods of poorer health in their later years due to various causes rates of various mental diseases are also higher in cities

the level of nutrition is also critical in improving health the increasing numbers of food additives such as excessive salt sugar and food preservatives found in many products in supermarkets and fast food outlets have led to higher incidences of heart diseases and obesity in particular certainly some of these issues are a result of poor life-style choices by disadvantaged people but they often lack local sources of healthy food a good diet with a variety of vegetables and fruit and adequate amounts of each is essential to maintaining health for malnutrition leads to ill-health and also vitamin deficiencies which can lead to diseases there is still controversy over these issues but a meta-analysis of research findings confirmed a linear relationship between stroke risk and low fruit and vegetable consumption with latest research suggesting that well over six portions of fruit and vegetables a day are needed to obtain the necessary vitamins qu et al 2014 nutritious food may not be available in disadvantaged areas as shown by the concept of food deserts
 areas in poor inner city areas that are without adequate food outlets that supply healthy and fresh foods a characteristic that was described in chap 101007978-94-017-9655-24 health education may improve the choices made but this is rarely as effective as expected unless it starts at an early age in school but even then family food choices may reduce possible progressthe presence of large social gradients or economic inequality in many countries and within urban areas also means that many people also lack the economic power to improve their shelter or clothing which then affects their state of health for most of the twentieth century better wages welfare measures and social provision led to a decline in inequality levels in developed countries but as chap 101007978-94-017-9655-23 has shown the past 2030 years have seen levels of inequality in income and wealth rising in developed countries while the explosive growth of urban places in the less developed world has led to larger areas of poor squatter settlements progress towards healthier cities requires more attention to the provision of basic needs in food shelter education etc and to improve the capabilities of the disadvantaged population to better their own condition andas addressed by just city initiatives chap 101007978-94-017-9655-23giving more people a voice in decisions that affect their areas some of these needs can be addressed by municipal actions for example in shelter by subsidized housing or community based non-profit housing agencies in nutrition through organizations providing food banks for those in need or through planning decisions that take the health impact of a displaced population into account however the most fundamental changes are probably still made by national or state policy through taxation welfare social provisions and ecological regulations to remove the structural disadvantage of those at the low end of the social gradient that are created by societal not personal factorsa series of interacting factors that may be described as the lived-experiences of people are usually called the social determinants of health a key factor is the presence of strong supportive networks of family or friends which are correlated with better health the opposite applies to those who are subject to social isolation which may be by choice but more likely a result of the absence of friends or family perhaps due to age poverty disability poor self-esteem poorer health is also found in those suffering social exclusion especially discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds indeed loneliness and social isolationwhich is different to depressionhas been shown to increase the propensity to functional decline and ill-health as well as increasing the chances of earlier mortality cacioppo and patrick 2009 perissinotto et al 2012 in addition there is the problem of stress which comes from the workplace as well as in homes and neighbourhoods and is now accepted as having a biological effect
hormones associated with the chronic stress burden protect the body in the short run and promote adaptation allostasis but in the long run the burden of chronic stress causes changes in the brain and body that can lead to disease allostatic load and overload brain circuits are plastic and remodelled by stress to change the balance between anxiety mood control memory and decision making such changes may have adaptive value in particular contexts but their persistence and lack of reversibility can be maladaptive mcewen 2012 p 1
these social determinants create a poorer quality of life with lower self-esteem and well-being but others exist for example it is also being recognised that a healthier life is more likely when there are high levels of positive nurturing such as when children are given a more supportive start to life through good education nutrition and a caring environment with limited exposure to stress or violent behaviour brooks-gunn et al 1993 this means helping mothers as well as their children to develop in such environments in later life worries about safety let alone actual physical violence are also important contributory factors in ill-health in addition some beliefs and values such as refusal to accept certain types of medical care because of religious beliefsprejudices are additional negative factorsthe extent to which there are supportive facilities in an area from quality schools to churches and community associations or the provision of home-help can also create more caring social environments in an area creating the social capital that provides support although these may be considered as part of an areas infrastructure added to such problems from these essentially empirical characteristics are those that come from the affective dimensions which deal with attitudes and feelings areas of high crime with social and health disadvantages have at least 10 types of negative attitudinal characteristics that can negatively affect well-being these were labelled as areas or terrains of social inadequacy despair and limited goals exclusion and discrimination acceptance of decay and destruction anxiety and fear spontaneity of actions and emotions indifference to others low restraint and self-control anti-social attitudes and peer group gang allegiance davies 2004 all these attitudes reduce the well-being and the health of people in areas where these attitudes are found and needed to be countered if progress is to be made in improving the lives of people affected by such featuresmany social commentators from those of the nineteenth century to the present have suggested that being poor and stressed seems to literally make one sick in addition the effects of poverty stress exposure to violence poor nutrition and limited affection is also known to lead to far lower acquisitions of early language skills in children and hence subsequent intellectual progress also fonagy 2003 has argued that the usual socialization of young children out of aggression that occurs in nurturing parenting is limited in disadvantaged areas producing a rapid and irrational response to perceived threats this type of primitive unconscious reaction to stimuli based on previous experiences bypassing any rational evaluation has been identified by the cognitive psychologist aaron beck 1999 as the main basis of an inadequate control of emotions which leads people to violence in subsequent life increasingly it is recognized that these health and behavioural associations are not a matter of life-styles choices although they may contribute to the situation what amounts to a biological embedding of the effects of the early environment occurs through epigenetic processes that affect the influence of genes while it was earlier observed sect 13228 that recent research is showing a strong relationships between vitamin d deficiency in pregnant mothers and increasing rates of autoimmune diseases in their offspringstimulated by the work of professor elizabeth blackburn who was awarded a nobel prize in 2009 for her work on the way that the social environment has embedded biological effects the mechanisms of these connections are now being explored in more detail as seen in a special issue of proceedings of the american academy of sciences boyce et al 2012 and in a book edited by tollefsbol 2014 that reviews transgenerational epigenesis effects one of the ways in which this environmental-embodiment relationship occurs is by the shortening of telomeres which are rather like a cap on the end of chromosomes that protects the dna during replication epel et al 2004 this reduction is associated with higher levels of ill-health and predisposition to many diseases in later life a recent pioneering study of 9 year old afro-american children who had suffered chronic stress from their upbringing in poverty unstable families and who were subject to harsh parenting and maternal depression revealed a shortening of their telomeres compared to children from more affluent and nurturing backgrounds mitchell et al 2014 so these disadvantaged children are likely to experience what amounts to premature aging and morbidity through degraded physical functions that make them more prone to disease but the effect was not uniform this association between the social environment and telomere length tl was also moderated by the extent of genetic variation in the subjects within the neurotransmitter pathways of the serotonin and dopamine genes that control the extent of pleasure and excitement responses so some of the subjects had a genetically influenced higher likelihood of sensitivity it was shown that those with highest sensitivity levels were more affected by their environment having the shortest tl when exposed to these stressful environments but they had the longest tl when exposed to advantaged environments the researchers suggest that this points to the presence of a genetic predisposition in the responses to the social environment the children with high sensitivity levels get even worse off from the poor nurturing and environment but have greater benefits from better conditions yet those with limited genetic sensitivity may not be so affected by the negative social environment which may explain why some people survive the highly disadvantaged area and their resilience enables them to subsequently flourish yet the general effect is that the children have their biological structure damaged by the stressful social environment of their upbringing leading to future health problems these findings mean that children in these areas are not simply disadvantaged because of locally poor educational opportunities to improve their life their negative environment effectively ages them and makes them more liable to ill-health this recent research provides justification for early childhood interventions providing effective nurturing creating less stressful environments to reduce the probability of what amounts to physical damage in epigenetic processes the research has moved the known correlations between childhood disadvantage and future ill-health to causal relationships although not all will be affected to the same extenta final domain of influential factors affecting health is more wide-ranging in the sense that it shows the cultural context-health connection  illustrating how the culture of societieswhich includes political power and relationshipsaffects all of the other determinants figure 131 shows that cultural factors can impede or improve each of the various health determinant categories for example there have been many cases where a religious or sub-cultural group in countries or cities have refused to believe in particular medical treatments while new medical advances have also been resisted by some practitioners the adoption of malaria nets over beds in east africa is a good example of the former the uptake of nets supplied by international agencies in the 1990s was extremely slow at first despite overwhelming evidence showing their effectiveness the white nets however were deemed too similar to the shrouds used to cover the dead so they were not used when the colour was changed from white to green they were quickly adopted by the local population there is also a cultural-political background to the level of medical facilities governments may provide less or more money for medical care in terms of life-style choices regulations on access to addictive substances make it easier or harder to obtain these unhealthy substancesthe impact of each factor varies according to the various circumstances in and between urban places indeed all these factors combine in various proportions to make significant place differences in the health of income groups and areas especially in an urban context between and within diverse towns and cities the intra-urban differences often lead to an ecology of health disadvantage within cities creating what has been called an urban health penalty
greenberg 1991 these unhealthy areas are characterised by limited health care facilities people with poor life-style choices substandard residences and often polluted conditions low incomes few economic prospects and a stressful unsafe and socially isolated life these conditions are made worse by feelings of hopelessness and the negative biological embedding of the harsh social environment increasing concern about the persistence of these pockets of ill-health has been one of the reasons why a new approach to the health care structure of many cities was developedone way in which local governments have become more engaged in health issues can be seen in initiatives that focus on the bureaucratic deficiencies of particular departments with respect to health issues for example planning decisions have rarely taken public health issues into account in reviewing and approving development applications except in zoning decisions and insuring that such issues as roads sewers water and other utilities are provided however towards the end of the twentieth century new interests emerged that stressed the need to assess the health effects of public projects on the residents of cities in particular in part this may be seen as an extension of the increasing use of environmental impact assessments these were designed to investigate the physical and biotic impacts of new developments and were given statutory approval in many countries as relevant issues to be considered in decisions made by government planning authorities initial support for the health impact assessment hia concept came from the whos concerns over the effectiveness of new sanitation projects in developing countries which led the organization to produce a review of procedures for analysing the effects of new development on health birley 1995 a more general impetus came from the gradual realization that health cannot be considered in isolation in some regions it has become a vital consideration in all types of development especially in terms of changes planned for the urban environment this can be seen in article 152 of the 1997 amsterdam eu treaty which states
a high level of human health protection shall be enshrined in the definition and implementation of all community policies and activities et 1997
in europe the specific concept of the health impact assessment hia emerged from worries that public development proposals were not being analysed for health impacts scott-samuel 1996 for example concerns about noise and other health impacts over manchester airports second runway proposal in the 1990s led to guidelines for health assessments soon after the uk government committed itself to using hias as an important strategy in development reviews as part of the need to identifying and reducing health inequalities scott-samuel 1998the so-called gothenburg consensus that emerged after a meeting of the who in the swedish city in 1999 attempted to bring some order into the evaluation process by identifying key features that were essential in the development of a hia who 1999 in addition to the general desire to maximize health outcomes they stressed the need for five values democracy so that all people can participate and help formulate policies equity to involve people from all walks of life sustainable development in the long and short term the ethical and transparent use of evidence which recognizes that qualitative and non-scientific evidence can also be important in assessing impacts and a comprehensive approach to health that considers the physical mental and social well-being of all sectors of society and their involvement many of these values mirror the arguments used by proponents of a just city approach to development within cities chap 101007978-94-017-9655-23 as well as those seeking to create greener more sustainable places chaps 101007978-94-017-9655-24101007978-94-017-9655-26 it was also agreed in gothenburg that a hia should also include four major elements reviews of the evidence that showed the effect of any new development policy or programme on the health of a population consideration of the opinions expectations and experience of those affected recognition of the need for more informed understanding by both decision-makers and the public of the effects of the proposed policies and proposals for adjustment or other options to maximize the positive effects of any policy and to minimize their negative consequences these elements illustrate the seriousness of the desire to take public opinion into account and to consider views from the various stakeholdersa review of 88 hias from 1996 to 2004 davenport et al 2005 revealed that not all were successful it was concluded that only when certain conditions applied were they successful in influencing policy namely when there was institutional support for solving health problems when key decision-makers were involved in the design of analyses and when there was a statutory framework within government procedures for using a hia without these conditions various bureaucratic evaluation procedures just avoided the issues yet hias are now becoming as familiar as environmental reviews in some countries a good example of the way in which health concerns raised by a community obtained crucial institutional support from a citys public health department phd can be seen in the trinity plaza proposal in inner city san francisco in 2003 although it was not technically a hia the planning department supported the proposal for the redevelopment of the trinity plaza area near downtown in 2003 which involved plans to convert 360 rent-controlled housing units into 1700 market-rate units in several high rise towers it ignored the fact that the development was one of the latest gentrification projects that involved a major displacement of low income people who had lived in the area for decades corburn 2009 the project led to a great deal of community anger and a pressure group to oppose the proposals the mission anti-displacement coalition mac created what they called a peoples plan to retain affordable family housing preserve local jobs and asked for community oversight over land use changes fortunately for the communitys case the public health department in the city had moved away from only dealing with its traditional biomedical and sanitation focus and started to address the social determinants of health in the city setting up workshops to learn about community concerns and providing advice about ways of improving areas this led the phd to intervene in the trinity plaza project on the side of the community supporting its view that the displacement of the existing residents would cause financial hardship given higher rents in other locations and ensure the loss of community relationships and stress to the individuals who would be evicted leading to increased levels of ill-health from these social determinants the gradual acceptance of the health consequences of this project eventually led to discussions between the phd developers planners and community activists which led to a revised proposal in which 12  of the project would be allocated to below market-rent housing with existing occupants keeping their homes at current rates in corburns 2009 p 130 succinct phrase the department of public health had entered the world of urban development and staked-out a new space for human health although there are still problems about the continued gentrification of the mission area this san francisco example provides a useful exemplar of the way in which health issues are being increasingly seen as relevant in planning reviews of new developments irrespective of whether there is a formal hia process in the citiesthe need for greater political engagement is another major principle of the whos healthy city movement hopefully this would lead to the allocation of more finance and resources to improve health promotion and care this new emphasis on local political involvement in health care instead of only medical decision-making has often taken time to achieve in many cities often with limited initial results for example liverpool in england moved from setting up a healthy city committee in 1988 to a healthy city team hct in 1994 which produced a new plan for liverpool in co-operation with the local primary care trust otgaar et al 2011 this trust was one of the uks 153 similar bodies under the national health system that forms the first level of health care via family doctors and dentists etc unlike the initial committee the team had the skilled personnel to develop not only a vision statement but a plan for achieving their goals and consulted widely with citizens and medical professions and various other community groups however its plan was not simply about better health care and health promotion but also related to how these would help to achieve greater business prosperity social justice and environmental protection in the city despite its progress the hct was wound up in 2000 in part because it seemed to need the greater involvement of the traditional medical professions it was replaced by a new organization essentially a new partnership which is called liverpool first to plan and monitor health care in the city this is now the joint responsibility of the liverpool municipal council and the local medical primary care trust this organization has a wider range of stakeholders ensuring input from many local organizations from community groups private businesses and various public sector services thereby creating a more coordinated approach involving many people this development in liverpool has been duplicated elsewhere which means that the planning of health care in britain is no longer the domain of only the medical profession in those urban areas that have adopted this model the local authority connection means that there is a more democratic basis while the involvement of many other agencies and groups provides additional ideas and skills to make a more comprehensive approach to improving the health care of residents in citiesnew members of the healthy city network have to create a health profile to show their situation in comparison with other centres this creates greater public awareness of the level of health in particular cities and frequently leads those with poor profiles to take steps to find ways of improving their record for example one of the reasons why liverpool joined the healthy city programme was its recognition that it had one of the worse health records in the uk where life expectancy at birth was 74 years compared to 79 in edinburgh and 78 years in london only glasgow with a life expectancy of 71 years had a worse record among major british cities also over half of liverpools population lived in the bottom 10  of deprived british areas places that were classified by measures of multiple socio-economic deprivation while a quarter of the population had long-term debilitating illnesses lpct 2007 part of these problems stemmed from liverpools decline since the 1930s when its population was over 800000 and the poor health habits of many in the population this poor health profile was not only a problem for its people but also created a negative image which had the effect of repelling rather than attracting innovative migrants or businesses so health promotion and participation campaigns were initiated which involved the general public as well as a range of health care and social service professionals in some ways this decision to attract public attention is another version of the comments made earlier in the chapter about the way that the health of towns association in britain in the mid nineteenth century encouraged discussion of the mortality crises in various towns that often led to major local improvementsthe so-called big health debate  which took place in liverpool in 20062007 provides a good example of this process it began by surveys to find major topics of health concern followed by workshops involving medical professionals and representatives of the general population then focus groups that worked on particular problems that had emerged as well as analyses of the use of health facilities lpct 2007 one of the findings was that the general public felt they lacked the power to take control over many parts of their life especially in health care and were critical of being unable to influence decisions that affected them so there was clearly an unmet need to involve the public in the discussions and the decisions being taken over health carefor most of the twentieth century there were few examples of effective local community engagement in urban health planning under the older top-down approaches dominated by medical professionals usually the so-called community engagement process involved people being informed about the decisions of medical planners after the main decisions had been taken or were invited to attend public meetings which pretended to discuss issues of concern but were really designed to reduce resistance to changes however the healthy cities goal of stressing the need for more democracy and community participation is leading to a different approach to previous practices in the case of british cities such as liverpool the new attitudes were encouraged by a national government white paper called our health our care and our say dh 2006 which outlined
the need for a wider range of community-based services offering patients choice convenience fairness and a much better experience of the nhs the white paper also focuses on prevention and the need for the nhs to work in partnership with local authorities voluntary agencies and local people so we are all working to build the foundations for better health in local communities lpct 2007 p ii
the result was a model in which more community care was envisaged given the fact that many are living longer but often with debilitating illnesses that need local and home care not hospital stays also a new type of participation was proposed to create more transparency and openness to discuss issues of public concern it also anticipated capacity-building in the population by improving their knowledge of the issues and encouraging their contribution to the debates a process in which their opinions were carefully evaluated this led to what was described in liverpool as the big debates  about health care they revealed that a major concern of many people was about their limited access to health care this is a problem found in many cities as decisions about the locations of both the offices of doctors or hospitals were usually made without effective public consultation indeed at a more general level it is remarkable how many hospitals in the developed world seem to be located close to wealthy areas or have limited rapid public transport access since they are in inaccessible locations while physicians offices are few and far between in poor areas illustrating a failure of the market to serve all the population indeed few countries have adopted the dutch model of planning which ensures that the major facilities that serve the public or have large public use such as hospitals have to be located on major transit routes to maximize their accessibilitythe health surveys in liverpool showed that people were prepared to accept the emerging trend of the increasing concentration of specialized medical facilities so long as basic facilities were locally available within a short travel time research results in a major report showed the locations of various health facilities and mapped the travel distances and times to these facilities from various points in the city geographically it demonstrated that many residential areas had either few health care facilities or limited access to them incorporation of these results into discussions on how to solve these problems of access led to a new and comprehensive approach for health care in the region with the subtitle the outside of hospital strategy  which has created a four tiered system of health care in the metropolitan area lpct 2007 at the local level are the general practices with single or multiple doctors serving 180018000 patients above these 2025 neighbourhood heath centres are planned to serve populations of 2000025000 and are located in places that could be reached by public transport in 15 min these centres are anchored by doctors and health care professionals but also contain other social and community services the third level consists of nhs treatment centres serving up 100150000 people that are located so they can be reached within 30 min by public transport these provide primary and secondary care such as minor surgeries diagnostic tests counselling and therapies as well as outpatient clinics the fourth level consists of the main hospitals serving 30050000 people that carry out major surgeries and other specialised medical procedures and care in which some facilities concentrate on particular medical areas such childrens care or mental problems this four-tiered system is designed to create a more integrated and community-based delivery system based on the problems of various areas conforming to the goals of greater choice access fairness and convenience in a national white paper ds 2006 also some of the centres provided a new set of jobs within areas that previously had few medical facilities the second and third levels of treatment centres made access to public transport a major location principle showing the need to cater for people without cars while the addition of these new more local units was designed reduce the growing pressure on the emergency wards of major hospitalsliverpool also showed the way in which more effective public involvement in hospital re-planning can occur as seen in the case of alder hey childrens hospital in the west darby suburb which treats over 200000 patients each year many from other primary trusts outside liverpool freeman 2006 additional new hospital buildings were built and the adjacent decaying and unsafe springfield park was rejuvenatedwith walking trails sports pitches and greater surveillance to improve safetyin addition to creating better connections for pedestrians and cyclists to surrounding houses and retail facilities to the south the design and location of the new buildings both their interior and exterior plans were discussed in public meetings with local citizens providing ideas and modifications of initial ideas which led to a feeling of positive involvement with the sites redevelopment determined efforts were also made to ensure the project would be more sustainable such as in building construction energy use and creating links with local transport facilities moreover instead of the hospital being simply a place of care and cure the hospital trained its staff to help patients and their parents adopt a healthier diet and life-style providing greater health promotion in an area where premature deaths and disability due to poor life-style choices is far too high otgaar et al 2009 pp 4951 these examples show how public engagement moved from the top-down information-imparting style to one of genuine attempts to find out the major problems that concerned patients and the public but also to involve the local residents as well as experts in various aspects of health care design and accessibility in a genuine interactive process of consultation and engagementin a more social context there is also evidence of increasing interest in developing local community interactions for example in helsinki the city developed a series of neighbourhood houses staffed by a core of city coordinators but also by many volunteers they organize physical and social activities primarily but not exclusively for young people to provide them with new opportunities such as sports and in doing so guide them away from anti-social activities lafond et al 2003 in some ways these houses managed by the health and safe city advisory committee in the city provide a contemporary version of older community associations found in many western canadian cities that arose spontaneously davies and townshend 1994 however in these cases there was no anti-crime agenda as in finland most started with sports activities for children but added additional social functions for adults or various youth clubs and often generated funds to build their own community hall with help from city and provincial grants historically of course even older community-based social centres and youth clubs were created by churches where parish halls provided places for local interaction and facilities however the decreasing numbers of church members and rival denominations in many cities has meant that their ability to act on behalf of the local area has been drastically reduced although many still provide support for their church members or space for other groups there can be little doubt that there is a need for more secular local organizations like the helsinki approach or the contemporary ymca and ywca that have evolved out of their christian origin all these local centres provide important places for social and recreational contact not simply for the youth but as centres that may also alleviate the loneliness of many old people in citiesalthough the objective of these more comprehensive health initiatives has been to involve as many stakeholders as possible the contribution of the private business sector in health has not been as widespread as it could be although many of the schemes discussed above do have representatives from private businesses part of the problem is that some firms do provide extra medical benefits for their workers and feel that this is enough others especially in europe provide some employees usually at managerial levels with stays in spas presumably to recover from the stress of decision-making hence such firms are reluctant to also contribute to general health care schemes for which the benefits seem to be beyond their immediate interests in some cities there are signs that private firms see the advantages in participating in schemes to promote better health especially when there are new business opportunities this is certainly the case in helsinki where the promotion of new technology a focus on health and new organizations to promote healthy living has led to many initiatives otgaar et al 2011 for example forum virium fv was established with support from major national organizations and companies to promote and create new digital services in several areas including health care this led to a photo and diary service for day-care centres to provide parents with images of their childrens activities a service that has subsequently spread to many countries creating a new business venture in addition fv helped create the healthy helsinki programme that initiated several ventures to improve health through citizen empowerment such as a mobile health project set up with help from telecom companies it enabled participants to monitor their leisure and exercise levels getting positive feedback through mobile devices if they increased their levels in attempts to change their behaviour elsewhere the development of computerized personal health records together with interactive mobile devices has not only enabled users to store their own data but provide access to training life-style and nutrition advice while in a neighbouring town it led to the monitoring of the growth in children which identified abnormalities more generally there are increasing numbers of smart applications for health-related issues being provided for use by smart or mobile phones such as regular personal contacts to reduce isolation also organizations such as the toronto rehabilitation institute triare not only treating patients with long term disabilities from injury or aging but actively pursue commercialization of their new technical products such as their slingserter and robonurse for lifting patients tri they are also in the forefront of research in providing assistance to people with cognitive impairment through smart alert systems to remind people to turn-off stoves and taps and how and when to complete many regular routines through sensing devices in addition like the japanese they are also building robots to help with these tasks such devices also provide help and relief to carers but enable people to live longer in their homes rather than being forced into homes for the aged or hospitals which dramatically increase costs of carealthough there are clear business opportunities for companies to provide the hardware and software for such new monitoring systems there is always the danger of intruding on personal privacy however municipal bureaucrats are often wary of getting involved since they have their functions to perform and the public benefits of some programmes may not be easy to evaluate nevertheless the new electronic technologies can be used to monitor health more effectively than in the past and more private company involvement is not only possible but needed in healthy city initiatives so long as personal privacy is not compromisedin the last decade of the twentieth century national governments of developed countries often stimulated by the who healthy cities programme started to emphasize policies that compel not simply advise all levels of government and their agencies to help reduce health inequalities  especially in cities for example in london it led to the creation of a london health commission composed of representatives from the various boroughs and organizations such as the nhs transport and the local development agency lhc 2008 this commission was designed to ensure that health concerns are involved in all the tasks of the greater london authority and the 33 boroughs within it that have statutory authority for a wide range of services and functions previously local governments and the primary care trusts of the nhs did not consider the health impacts of their various planning and development projects this change meant there was now a statutory obligation for the mayor of london to act to reduce the inequalities the health commission developed a strategy called living well in london
that ensures that investments in housing and public spaces are made to create an environment that helps people make more healthy choices and promotes links between the many agenciesfrom housing to police social services and organizations dealing with drug and alcohol abuse and homelessnessthat may help to improve the determinants of health in some deprived areas new multi-functional facilities have been developed such as the hub in canning town a large building that houses a health centre with doctors and nurses as well as a pharmacy with many other services indirectly linked to health and community improvement such as a training centre an internet caf community meeting rooms and a safety group etc in other boroughs of london local strategic partnerships have been established to improve the quality of life and health of residents the board of these organizations include representatives from the public sector including the nhs local government and police and the private sector composed of people from citizen groups and various businesses although they have no powers to create actions they are influential in ensuring that health considerations are given a priority in the various plans and actions of the partner organizations they also encourage the establishment of thematic groups to focus on specific health improvements including encouraging local residents to identify and solve health related problems in addition to these partnerships a targeted site approach has identified areas of extreme deprivation and health problems as places for special programmes to improve the local conditions the well london alliance
programme created 14 projects in 20 of the most deprived parts of the city in 2007 dealing with quite small areas of 15002000 people wla 2007 otgaar et al 2011 these are not policies of planning or housing departments alone but involve multiple agenciesincluding the ymca two charities a technology transfer agency the arts council a local university and major hospital trustprogrammes which are funded by grants from the national lottery the various agencies contribute their own expertise to the projects however in an attempt to get more local input the residents affected were consulted about the projects through site visits action workshops and discussions in the community cafes that were established surveys revealed a lack of co-ordination among the existing social services and revealed that the people in the areas were not simply deprived economically but lacked hope and ability to improve their conditions typical problems that affect the development of grass roots organizations davies and herbert 1993 chap 101007978-94-017-9655-26 an important focus of these targeted well london programmes has been to emphasize better nutrition create exercise opportunities and develop a series of other programmes to improve the negative various social determinants of health problems through a series of so-called heart of the community projects these are designed to reduce loneliness and improve community relationships such as involving the youth in the design of projects creating access to healthy facilities in the area from encouraging new shops to finding safe walking routes they also focus on reducing crime developing personal improvement programmes to improve the mental well-being of people in the area and try to create a sense of ownership over local facilities and projects by having control group areas where no intervention has occurred the effectiveness of the various initiatives were measured in the 5 year project period from 2007 in order to create evidence-based policy evaluation in the hope that the programmes that work can be copied successfully in other areas however despite these targeted initiatives there is a pressing need for more social housing in london the influx of capital from overseas rich people combined with the strength of the financial services sector in particular means that land and house prices continue to rise with the result that essential workers such as nurses social workers police and teachers are priced out of the marketthe type of comprehensive multi-agency approach described above is only one of the ways in which attempts are being made to improve the health of disadvantaged people another is the targeting of poor people by giving income supplements on condition the children attend school and keep their vaccinations up to date an approach pioneered by the brazilian bolsa familia
programme which has reduced the poverty level of over 44 million people more specific health care access for the poorest in american cities can be seen by the addition of new community clinics
 either free standing or mobile they provide health care in disadvantaged areas where there are few local physicians or pharmacies creating centres that provide a range of services such as physicians dentists as well as counselling and health promotion units in impoverished parts of american cities school health education and provision
is an increasing trend which often includes the addition of clinics especially aimed at targeting adolescents and their problems fitzpatrick and lagory 2011 a national assembly of school-based health care acts as a co-ordinating and advice centre for these school-based clinics which have grown from 20 in 1980 to currently over 2000 in 44 states research has shown that schools with clinics have fewer disciplinary problems course failures and school absentee rates as well as better health smith 2013there is also a long history of the work of particular individuals acting as the catalysts for change in particular deprived areas for example a venezuelan physician america bracho was influential in establishing latino access  a non-profit organization in the poor mainly spanish speaking area of santa ana an area of a third of a million people in los angeles one of the toughest crime-ridden deprived and unhealthy areas in the country lha 2009 also churches have long had a role in trying to cater for the poor and the disabled in recent years more active approaches have developed such as the communities of shalom cs set up by the united methodist churches initiated by the rev joseph sprague it has now created hundreds of shalom zones in impoverished areas from its beginning in 1992 training local residents to promote health information and social capital in many american cities some churches have partnered with public health departments in local universities to create facilities and programmes to improve the health of people in poor neighbourhoods using trained local volunteers and specialists such as the congregations for public health in birmingham alabama cph all these examples represent the contemporary equivalents of the settlement houses of nineteenth century cities designed improve the educational health and economic prospects of people in impoverished areas although these were mainly secular as seen in work of hull house in chicago and many other citiesadams 1910 another policy has tried to improve to areas of high disadvantage and ill-health by seeking to reduce concentrations of poor families such as by scattering instead of creating public housing clustering  and by removing families to other locations where there are better facilities and more social mixture rubinovitz and rosenbaum 2000 comey et al 2008 although there have been some successful resettlement schemes the scale of the areas of impoverishment means that it cannot be a solution for all areasspace constraints mean that the examples discussed have only focused on developed countries to show that even in areas where there are extensive heath care programmes there is room for major improvements in targeting the most unhealthy places a far far bigger problem exists in the developing world where at least of the third of their population over 860 million in total live in informal shanty towns many of these places desperately need updated and modern versions of the types of services from clean water supply to sewage and other utilities that were created in the european urban improvements of the nineteenth century deficiencies which lead to poor hygiene and debilitating illnesses these informal settlements are characterized by high levels of deprivation due to poverty with flimsy informal housing whose rents often take up a third of the non-food expenditure unemployment limited skills or education low environmental quality often with high crime and with many residents especially the elderly having few social contacts and high levels of loneliness also many of these areas lack proper property rights this situation is often made worse by the presence of toxic outputs from nearly factories that ignore any environmental regulations even where they exist but it is often argued that these slums not all populated initially by rural migrants should be welcomed as they provide the opportunity for improvement unlike rural areas some have shown improvement but the idea of the slum being a temporary way-station on the way to prosperity is increasingly being challenged a large survey of slum dwellers marx et al 2013 has confirmed that many people get trapped in these areas leading to generational poverty and also illness despite the opportunities that enable some to escape even in the cities of middle income countries there are still many slum areas for example in buenos aires about 10  of the population lives in the 56 shanty towns called villas miserias most of them lack schools medical facilities basic utilities and have poor drainage so heavy rain causes flooding and have limited employment and higher levels of ill-health in 2011 the city created the secretariat of habitat and inclusion to coordinate the efforts to incorporate these areas into the city and upgrade their facilities but its efforts are handicapped by a small budget one of its schemes is a so-called urban acupuncture programme that adds sports facilities plazas and community centres to the deprived areas to act as focal and service points however the programme has not been as effective as promised because the secretariat is underfunded and is seen as a top-down agency this often ignores the grass root organizations that have developed in these areas which emphasize that their real need is also for more adequate social housing and basic services including health care elsewhere attempts are being made to provide more community facilities and to connect slum areas which are often isolated on hillsides with few roads with other parts of the city such as by the gondolas in bogota in many other slum areas such as in rio de janeiro the problem of safety is paramount because of their control by local gangs this is being tackled by what amounts to a blanket invasion by security services followed up by stimulation of grass roots organizations the provision of local community and a school facilities and a permanent police presence to guarantee safetydespite occasional attempts to improve the condition of people in these informal settlements there is still an enormous amount of work to do given the scale of these problems and the limited funds and trained personnel of the city administrations indeed at base the older developed world solutions to create healthier man-made environments are still needed although modern medicine especially for infectious disease has kept mortality rates low so far the constant exposure to unhealthy conditions and stress in these slums combined with the new growth of antimicrobial resistance mean that these areas could be the breeding grounds for future epidemics this fear should speed up efforts to improve these often squalid environmentsimproving the health of people in cities is part of their basic needs and a matter of social justice it is one of the most important of the new policies contributing to liveable urban places the old urban health disadvantages were solved by the nineteenth century engineering and regulatory approaches and by the enormous advances in medical knowledge and care yet too many urban places still need basic sanitation safe water supplies and adequate numbers of health care professionals and facilities in addition new concerns have arisen about gaps in the delivery of health care even in the developed world with a need to address the societal structural conditions that lead to high inequalities and poor health the new healthy city programmes are creating positive changes through greater political involvement and community engagement with policies designed to improve access to health care such as spatial targeting and the use of health impact assessments the concept of wellness stresses the need for active health promotion and research into the impact of the many health determinants especially the often downplayed environmental economic and social domainsalthough these new approaches are undoubtedly improving the health of people in many cities they are not enough it has been shown that urban living creates greater risks from such problems as traffic and pollution but also from less time spent outdoors one problem is that some pregnant mothers who have limited exposure to sunlight may be inhibiting the development of their foetuses which seems to account for the recent increases in many autoimmune diseases another comes from an enormous recent rise in levels of myopia in young urban chinese and other asian children in particular with 70  of children affected in some areas studies have discounted the general effect of genetic factors and shown that the children affected are not spending enough time outdoors with too much time studying indoors and exposure to electronic devices control groups of australian children and rural chinese did not have this problem which seems to be a consequence of a lengthening of the eyeball along its main axis due to a lack of exposure to sunlight lougheed 2014 rose and saw 2013increasing challenges also come from the failures of the major antibiotic drugs that counter many diseases which could reverse many medical advances there are also increased risks from new communicable diseases in densely populated and interconnected urban places as shown by the case of hiv but a more recent example is seen by the rapid spread of ebola in west africa with over 5000 deaths and at least 14000 cases by the end of october 2014 40 as rene dubois 1959 observed in many books nature in the form of some microbe will always strike back at human bodies in some unpredictable way for new viruses constantly emerge and existing ones mutate and become resistant to drugs ebolas rapid spread was due to its ability to mutate rapidly and suppress human immune systems but it was also a consequence of several environmental and cultural factors the inability to recognize its initial appearance probably from cross-species infection from the virus-carrying fruit bats its spread in areas of high density poor sanitation high mobility levels and very limited health care systems in personnel and facilities a lack of trust in authorities after years of war and where traditional healing and funerary practices involved a lot of touching which led to greater spread since bodies are especially infectious by extruding the body fluids that spread the virus the heroic efforts of the charity mdicine sans frontires helped many people but did not have the resources to contain the outbreak with an often 70  death rate among infected people unfortunately it took over six months for the who and other countries to start a massive effort to try and contain the disease by providing supplies of soap alcohol swabs and disinfections to help reduce ebolas spread thousands of trained doctors and nurses to attend the sick enough protective clothing building isolation hospitals to treat patients as well as tracing the contacts of infected people which was impeded by the absence of detailed local maps this outbreak showed we cannot be complacent about the threat of new diseases there is pressing need to have enough of the needed facilities available to be sent quickly to areas where new diseases are detected and a necessity to boost research to find vaccines and drugs to combat such new diseases and older ones like malaria that are still endemicmany of these problems go beyond the ability of cities alone to solve them although their density and connections make them more vulnerable especially those with poor sanitation cities rarely have the power or finance to improve health care on their own but they can initiate new programmes to improve their facilities yet their very size means that their politicians and citizen groups should be able to mount successful lobbying of national governments to take the more active comprehensive and multifaceted measures to improve health in urban settlementsin the late months of 2019 leading into january of 2020 a novel virus emerged in
wuhan china and was given the name severe acute respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 figure 1 the associated disease was termed covid-19 co-rona-vi-rus
d-isease 2019 figure 113 the virus quickly spread across europe and into north and
south america leading the world health organization who to declare it as a
pandemic on march 11 2020 with over 118 000 infections in over 114
countries at that time4 seven weeks later the number of cases
exceeded 3 million worldwide5 sars-cov-2 is a part of the
family of viruses known as coronaviridae which have led to
previous coronavirus outbreaks a sars-cov outbreak in 2002 and a middle east
respiratory syndrome mers-cov outbreak from 2012 to 2015369 these three viral outbreaks have
yielded similar symptoms including shortness of breath fever coughing and
headaches although coronaviridae is not new to the human
population sars-cov-2 is a larger threat as it has a much higher reproduction
number r0 than previous coronavirus strains meaning
that the number of cases generated by one infected person is higher than previous
outbreaks913 this coupled with longer
incubations times latent infections and delayed symptoms makes the virus
difficult to containbecause of this there is an urgent need for appropriate disinfection protocols to
slow the spread of covid-19 according to the centers for disease control and
prevention cdc the most effective way to reduce covid-19 infectivity rates is
to practice appropriate hand hygiene specifically employing proper handwashing
with warm water and soap for a minimum of 20 s and avoiding touching ones
face14 in addition the cdc advocates for the use of
alcohol-based hand sanitizers abhs but provides warning about products
containing benzalkonium chloride bac statingas bac and related disinfectants are ubiquitous found not only in soaps but also in
cleaning wipes and hospital sanitation kits knowing their efficacy against
sars-cov-2 is imperative to address the spread of the virus the cdc goes on to
reference a recent review published in the journal of hospital
infection by kampf et al that tabulated the results of previous
studies investigating how long viruses within the same family mers-cov sars-cov
and endemic human coronavirus can exist on surfaces ranging from steel and
plastic to disposable gowns and surgical gloves15 overall it
was reported that this class of virus can persist on inanimate objects with a wide
range of times from 2 to 8 h paper and aluminum to 5 days plastic
ceramic and others since the publication of this and other reports the
scientific community has debated the length of time sars-cov-2 can persist on
inanimate objects with some reporting sars-cov-2 rna on surfaces after 14
days101618with survival times varying among surface types guidelines for best disinfectant
practices are vital most notably for essential work locations including
hospitals grocery stores and delivery centers that together face higher traffic
and risk rate than other locations currently the cdc offers limited guidelines
for surface disinfectants in the face of covid-19 however both the scientific
community and general public have deferred to the article mentioned above for
guidance in best practices as it also includes a table of previous reports on the
ability of common disinfectants to eradicate this family of viruses15 the disinfectants in their literature review include two
alcohols ethanol and propanol sodium hypochlorite peroxides aldehydes
formaldehyde and glutardialdehyde two different types of quaternary ammonium
compounds bac 1 and didecyldimethylammonium chloride
2 figure 2 and
several others it is from this data table that the cdc provided its
recommendations on abhs and regarded bac a common quaternary ammonium compound
qac as ineffective at killing the virus the pertinent data was based on a
suspension-based assay found in an article by wood and payne in 1998 table 1 ref 19beyond the use of bac as a hand sanitizing agent kampf and coworkers also provided
one example of bac as a surface disinfectant from an article by sattar et al in
1989 with an active concentration of 004 wv on a steel surface showing it to
also be ineffective at reducing the viral loading of hcov endemic human
coronavirus after 1 min exposure table 11520 combining this with the suspension assay result has
sparked debate and worry as qacs specifically bac are the active ingredients
found in many household disinfecting wipes and sprays and are also used as
additives in various soaps and nonalcohol-based hand sanitizers this is due to
their ability to eradicate surface bacteria and common viruses such as influenza
by disrupting their phospholipid membrane figure 32127despite the current reluctance of the cdc to endorse a bac-based hand sanitizer
against covid-19 the research backing the stance is neither current nor uniformly
asserted in particular the disinfectant concentrations in the reports discussed
herein are inconsistent with broad ranges of applied qacs from 000175 to 15
wv table 1 figure
4 additionally the type of analysis varied
widely most studies utilized suspension-based assays in which the virus was
suspended in minimal media but the contents of the media varied with
concentrations and types of organic loading added salt concentrations as well as
added antibiotics for surface evaluations some analyses utilized quantitative
carrier tests qcts with stainless steel discs as carriers of viral loads while
others simply described evaluating surface contamination but lacked details for
reproducibility it is the goal of this viewpoint to shed light on more recent
data regarding the activity of bac against coronaviruses point out the
disparities between available research and draw attention to the need for further
research into qacs there is a need to not only broaden our understanding of the
effectiveness of bac against sars-cov-2 but also design and develop improved qacs
for future infection controlbased on another article briefly mentioned in kampf et al the work performed by
pratelli in zoonoses and public health analyzed the effectiveness
of qacs against canine coronavirus ccov another family member within
coronaviridae28 although these results
pertain to ccov it is within the same family as sars-cov-2 and should aid in
evaluating the efficacy of qacs pratelli utilized a suspension-based assay
suspending cell cultures in eagles minimal essential medium and
supplementing with 10 fetal bovine serum the report found that ddac was able to
reduce the viral loading of ccov by 40 log10 after 3 day exposure
corresponding to greater 9999 clearance table 1 conversely bac was unable to reduce the viral
loading 30 log10 but the author does note that both agents caused
significant morphological damage to the viruswithin a 2004 article by ansaldi et al in the journal of preventive medicine
and hygiene the authors analyzed the efficacy of the same group of
disinfectants described by kampf et al against sars-cov within a 1 ml salt
solution concentration or identity of salt not specified with a standard
concentration of cell culture29 each replicate was exposed to
2 ml solutions of disinfectant with recommended disinfectant concentrations eg
bac  1 wv interestingly it was found that bac did not significantly damage
the cell monolayer but was able to reduce the replication of sars-cov after 5 min
exposure table 1 however after 30 min
exposure to bac reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr found
sars-cov rna still present on the surface this result was consistent against each
type of disinfectant analyzed ethanol bac sodium hypochlorite etc as well as
against three types of viruses tested influenza respiratory syncytial virus and
sars-cov therefore it begs the question of whether intact rna alone is an
infective agent of sars-cov or if the reduction of cell replication from bac is
adequate this question remains unanswered and makes it difficult to appropriately
evaluate efficacy of disinfectants across analysesadditionally two articles from 1989 and 2009 present discrepancies regarding bac
alone as well as within provided commercial formulations for example within the
2009 article by dellano et al the authors analyzed effectiveness of common
household disinfectants one being lysol with 01 wv of bac and 70
ethanol against murine hepatitis virus mhv a surrogate vector with structural
similarities to sars but lower biosafety level6 they found
that the bac formulations were effective at inactivating this class of virus after
only 30 s exposure table 1 this result
was echoed in the previous 1989 article by sattar et al when analyzing bac and
ethanol mixtures20 additionally sattar et al analyzed toilet
bowl cleaners with a solution of 004 wv of bac and hydrochloric acid ph 10
this formulation was again proven to be effective at inactivating coronaviruses
although this lower concentration of bac was only able to affect a 3-log reduction
999 reduction in viral load in the absence of additives both articles point
to the difficulty proving if combinatorial formulations lead to efficacy or if
the qacs aid in the viral reductionin addition to bac other commonly employed qacs such as chlorhexidine gluconate cg
3 figure 2 were also
examined in a 2004 editorial by schmidt et al30 it was found
therein that cg at a concentration of 0008 wv was unable to reduce the viral
loading of hcov229e but when added to 70 ethanol reduced the viral load by 3
log10 in qct table 1
in addition the article also examined the effectiveness of combinatorial qacs
presumably cg and bac at a 0066 wv in qcts which proved effective after 10
min exposure resulting in viral reduction of 40 log10 the only
example of bac efficacy alone in this article was with 001 wv against
transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev a common coronavirus known to infect
pigs within the suspension assay bac reduced the viral load by 3
log10 these analyses again display the incongruity of the
reports of qac disinfectant efficacy between research laboratoriesa distinct inconsistency regarding the effectiveness of bac is evident in a 2005
article again by kampf in the journal of hospital
infection31 contrary to the 2020 review this
earlier report evaluated the effectiveness of four commercially available abhs
three surface disinfectants two of which contained bac at 05 wv and one
instrument disinfectant containing glutaraldehyde against sars-cov utilizing a
suspension-based assay with three different types of organic loads 03 serum
albumin 10 fecal calf serum and 03 serum albumin03 sheep erythrocytes
the study showed that each disinfectant evaluated was effective at significantly
lowering the viral load across all types of organic loadings specifically looking
at the bac data one formulation mikrobac forte reduced the viral loading by
613 log10 while the other kohrsolin ff reduced the viral
loading by 375 log10 in comparison to 43 with abhs
all of which had 3060 min exposure times table 1through this brief literature analysis it is apparent that the current research on
the effectiveness of bac and more broadly qacs is inconsistently presented
across a select few reports from the past decade beyond the incongruity between
the assays employed we also hypothesize that the variability in results may be
due to the solution of disinfectant specifically variations in concentrations
analyzed we note that common household wipes are sold with a 03 wv
concentration of a mixture of bac structures within our own research efforts we
have found that outdated solutions of bac have increased rates of micelle
formations rendering high levels of variability in effectiveness between assays
unpublished results furthermore it appears that the reluctance of the cdc in
endorsing bac as a disinfectant against sars-cov-2 is based upon an outlier in one
paper figure 4additionally the question remains if sars-cov-2 rna is an infective agent on its
own it is plausible that qacs are successful in eradicating infectivity if only
the rna is detected after treatment it has frequently been confirmed that qacs
are effective against influenza viruses as well as both gram-positive and
gram-negative bacterial strains2127 in
comparing the outer membranes between these and sars-cov-2 figure 5 we postulate that qacs should be
effective in decreasing the viral load for disinfection procedures against
covid-19 as both contain relatively similar phospholipid bilayers furthermore a
newer generation of multicationic qacs has recently been developed which warrants
further studies against these emerging viruses27these findings coupled with the dangerous trend of inappropriately misusing
disinfectants warrants an urgent need to establish consistency in how we analyze
the effectiveness of qacs against the family of coronaviruses to allow factual
recommendations for use of disinfectants this pandemic serves as an opportunity
for enhanced antiseptics and more specifically qac development as commercially
available disinfectants have room for improvement both with formulation and
concentration as well as effectiveness against both viral and bacterial
contagionsrates of foodborne illness remain at unacceptably high levels despite the efforts of food producers to ensure the safety of the food supply raw meat and poultry and fruits and vegetables bought at retail premises may be contaminated with pathogens good hygiene practices during food preparation in the home are therefore essential in preventing cross contamination of prepared foods from raw foods and preventing contamination of food by infected household members or domestic animalsthe european food standards agency efsa 2005 report8 and the 2007 ecdc report7 cite campylobacteriosis as the most reported animal infection transmitted to humans in 2005 reported campylobacter infections increased by 78 compared with the previous year rising to an incidence rate of 516 cases per 100000 people the efsa states that the source of most human campylobacter infections is related to fresh poultry meat on the other hand salmonella infections fell by 95 in 2005 to an incidence of 382 cases per 100000 176395 reported cases the 2003 world health organization who report9 concluded that approximately 40 of reported foodborne outbreaks in the who european region over the past decade were caused by food consumed in private homes the report cites several factors as critical for a large proportion of foodborne diseases including use of contaminated raw food ingredients contact between raw and cooked foods and poor personal hygiene by food handlers united kingdom data show that food poisoning notifications reached a peak in 1997-1998 and has since declined but remains in excess of 70000 per year10 in reality the burden of food poisoning is much higher because most cases go unreported according to the uk food standards agency11 the true number of cases is approximately 47 million per yearin 1999 mead et al12 reported on food-related illness in the united states using data from a range of sources including national surveillance and community-based studies they estimated that foodborne illness in the united states causes 76 million illnesses 500000 hospital admissions and 9000 deaths each year most frequently recorded pathogens were campylobacter salmonella and norovirus which accounted for 142 97 and 665 respectively of estimated foodborne illnesses data suggest that the total number of reported outbreaks has not declined substantially in recent years ranging from 980 to 1400 outbreaks and between 20000 and 80000 cases per year for the years 2000 to 200513
from recent investigations it is now recognized that a substantial proportion of the total infectious gi disease burden in the community is because of person-to-person spread within households particularly for viral infections where it is most often the cause person-to-person transmission in the home can occur by direct hand-to-mouth transfer via food prepared in the home by an infected person or by transmission because of aerosolized particles resulting from vomiting or fluid diarrhea apart from transmission by inhalation of airborne particles these infections are preventable by good hygiene practicethe 2003 who report9 stated that of the total gi infection outbreaks including foodborne disease reported in europe during 1999 and 2000 60 and 69 respectively were due to person-to-person transmission in the united kingdom it is estimated that up to 50 of gi infection results from person-to-person tranmsission11 a study of united kingdom outbreaks14 suggested that 19 of salmonella outbreaks and more than half of e coli o157 outbreaks are transmitted by nonfoodborne routesnational surveillance systems vary in their methods of data collection but mostly focus on foodborne disease inevitably this means that data on gi illnesses relate mainly to large foodborne outbreaks in restaurants hospitals and others whereas sporadic nonfoodborne cases in the general community go largely unreported in the united kingdom even when household outbreaks are reported they mostly involve home catering for parties and other functions and are therefore mainly foodborne outbreaks15 because milder cases of gi illness often go unreported this means that the overall gi infection burden particularly that which is not foodborne is unknown the most informative data on the overall burden of infectious gi illness both foodborne and non-foodborne in the community come from various community-based studies which have been carried out in europe and the united states and are reviewed belowtwo large community studies have been carried out in europe one in the united kingdom and the other in the netherlands the uk study carried out from 1993 to 1996 involving 460000 participants in the community presenting to general practice estimated that only 1 of 136 cases of gi illness is detected by surveillance the study indicated that as many as 1 in 5 people in the general uk population develop gi illness each year with an estimated 94 million cases occurring annually of which about 50 are nonfoodborne11 16 it was estimated that for every 1 reported case of campylobacter salmonella rotavirus and norovirus another 76 32 35 and 1562 cases respectively occur in the community based on the number of laboratory reports it is possible to estimate the true number of infections occurring in the community 
table 1from the community study carried out in the netherlands between 1996 and 199917 it was estimated that approximately 1 in 35 people experience a bout of infectious gi disease each year campylobacter was detected most frequently 10 of cases followed by ghiardia lamblia 5 rotavirus 5 norovirus 5 and salmonella 4 relative to the population of the netherlands 16 million 650000 norovirus gastroenteritis cases occur annually18
the us study of mead et al12 which also included data from community-based studies indicated that the total number of cases of infectious gi illness annually is approximately 210 million of which approximately 64 are nonfoodborne they estimated that the number of episodes of acute gastroenteritis per person per year is approximately 079 from the available data the authors were also able to estimate the proportion of total episodes that were nonfoodborne as shown in
table 2 by far the most frequently reported causes of gi illness were norovirus rotavirus and campylobacter for campylobacter e coli and norovirus a significant proportion of cases was estimated as nonfoodborne whereas for hepatitis a hav shigella and rotavirus almost all cases were estimated as nonfoodborne for salmonella on the other hand only 5 of cases were considered as nonfoodborne davis et al reviewed outbreaks of e coli o157 related to family visits to animal exhibits19
indications are that norovirus is now the most significant cause of infectious gi illness in the developed world both outbreak related and endemic20 21 currently we are seeing increased outbreaks of norovirus a major concern in japan22 and also in europe23 expert opinion is that norovirus strains now circulating are more virulent and more easily spread from person to person via hands and surfaces or during food handling20
infection with hav is common worldwide24 and adenovirus is also a frequent cause of gastroenteritis c difficile-associated disease now occurs with increasing frequency in the community in which it usually affects persons receiving antibiotic therapy but also healthy individuals25 recently a new strain 027 of c difficile has emerged in north america causing infections in the community among individuals with no predisposing factors25 a recent study26 indicated that exposure to a family member with helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis was associated with a 48-fold increased risk of infection in another family member and that infection most usually involved person-to-person transmission associated with conditions of crowding and poor hygieneusing data from the 2006 e coli o157h7 outbreak in 2006 in the united states associated with contaminated spinach seto et al developed a model that showed that secondary person-to-person transmission was similar to that in previous e coli outbreaks 12 the model suggests that even a modestly effective hygiene promotion strategy to interrupt secondary transmission prevention of only 2-3 of secondary illnesses could result in a reduction of 5 to 11 of symptomatic cases27
respiratory tract infections are largely caused by viruses in the united states viruses account for up to 69 of respiratory infections28 the common cold is reported to be the most frequent acute infectious illness to humans29 data from the united states suggest that the mean number of respiratory illnesses experienced per year in adults is approximately 15 to 30 and in children under 5 years of age it is approximately 35 to 5528
approximately 80 of upper rt infections are caused by rhinoviruses other species causing acute rhinitis are coronaviruses parainfleunza viruses piv respiratory syncytial viruses rsv and adenoviruses30 although colds are generally mild and self-limiting they represent a significant economic burden because of loss in productivity and medical costs furthermore secondary infections produce complications such as otitis media sinusitis or lower respiratory infections including pneumonia with its risk of mortality particularly in elderly adults several studies have demonstrated that colds are also a trigger for asthma31 rsv is the major cause of viral rt infection in young children worldwide child day care attendance in north america caries with it a very high risk of rsv infection within the first 2 years of life and accounts for 05 to 10 of hospitalized infants in the united states32
influenza is a more serious rt illness which can cause complications that lead to increased physician visits hospitalization and death the risks being highest among persons aged 65 years children aged 2 years and persons who have medical conditions eg diabetes chronic lung disease33 34 35 influenza must also be considered in terms of days absent from work and school and pressure on health care services35 an important aspect of influenza is the threat associated with the emergence of novel subtypes capable of causing an influenza pandemic36 according to bridges et al37 influenza epidemics in the united states result in an annual average of 36000 deaths and 114000 hospitalizations among those with influenza who belong to an at-risk group a significant proportion develop pneumonia and up to 1 in 10 can die of related complications in europe the 2004-2005 influenza season annual report38 showed that of 25 countries 15 recorded what is regarded as high activity 150 up to 3000 influenza-like or acute respiratory illnesses per 100000 populationalthough data indicating the role of hands and other surfaces in the transmission of colds have been available for some time it is only in the last few years that there has been any real awareness that hands and surfaces may also be a transmission route for flu viruses32 evidence that measures such as hand hygiene can reduce spread of rt infections comes from the sars outbreaks in hong kong which coincided with the latter part of influenza season when it was observed that as extensive personal and community public health measures took place influenza case numbers fell significantly more so than usual for the time of year39
skin and wound infections are common in the home and community but most are self-limited because these infections apart from s aureus infections go unreported little or no data are available on the burden of skin and wound infections in the community s aureus is the most common cause of infections of skin and soft tissue which in a small proportion of cases lead to the development of bacteremia or pneumonia40 serious infections usually occur in health care facilitiesin patients who are immunocompromisedin which s aureus is mostly usually associated with wounds and intravenous devices and in which the antibiotic-resistant strain mrsa is a major concern infected patients discharged from hospitals and health care workers hcws caring for mrsa-infected patients can bring mrsa into the home and pass it on to healthy family members who become colonized thereby spreading the organism into the community and facilitating the circulation of these strains41 42 43 mrsa colonization in an individual can persist for up to 40 months44 45
in recent years mrsa has been increasingly found to cause infections in healthy members of the community without apparent risk factors25 these ca-mrsa strains are different from health care-associated hca mrsa strains and are a concern because they equally infect children and young adults these strains primarily cause skin and soft tissue infections but can also cause invasive infections such as sepsis pneumonia and osteomyelitis which is some cases can be fatal25 some ca strains are known to produce panton-valentine leukocidin pvl which has been implicated as a virulence factor46 although opinion is however divided as to whether this is the case whereas some studies support this notion47 others do not48 in the united states ca-mrsa is now a significant concern ca-mrsa strains have also now been detected in france switzerland germany greece the nordic countries australasia the netherlands and latvia25 in the united kingdom cases of ca-mrsa and pvl-producing strains have been reported but the number of reported cases is still small25 49
key factors that contribute to changing id trends are the social and demographic changes that are occurring within the global population that affect our resistance to infection at-risk groups cared for at home include not only newborn infants whose immune system is not fully developed but also the rapidly increasing elderly population whose immune system is declining at-risk groups include patients discharged recently from hospital immunocompromised family members and family members with invasive devices such as catheters it also includes people whose immunocompetence is impaired as a result of chronic and degenerative illness or because they are undertaking certain drug therapies all of these groups together with those who carry hivaids are increasingly cared for at home by a caregiver who may be a household member a survey of the united states and 3 european countriesgermany the netherlands and the united kingdomsuggests that up to 1 in 5 of the population belongs to an at-risk group 
table 3 the data suggest that between 12 and 18 of the population of these countries are 65 years of age in an intervention study of 148 patients with aids it was found that patients assigned to the intensive handwashing intervention group developed fewer episodes of diarrheal illness 124  09 vs 292  06 new episodes of diarrhea respectively during a 1-year observation period50
gi pathogens are now implicated as causative or contributory factors in the development of cancers and other chronic conditions examples include hepatitis b virus hepatocelluar carcinoma51
h pylori peptic ulcer disease52 and campylobacter jejuni guillain barr syndrome53 foodborne illness has been estimated to result in chronic sequelae in 2 to 3 of cases54 a european commission report55 cites evidence of chronic disease such as reactive arthritis following 5 of salmonella cases with 5 of e coli o157 cases progressing to serious and even fatal complications even mild viral infections can be predisposing factors to more severe and possibly fatal secondary bacterial infections56
in devising a strategy for home hygiene and producing hygiene practice advice the international scientific forum on home hygiene ifh has developed an approach based on risk management that involves identifying the critical control points for preventing the spread of id in the home risk management also known as hazard analysis critical control points haccp is now the standard approach for controlling microbial risks in food and other manufacturing environments and is becoming accepted as the optimum means to prevent such risks in home and hospital settings57
the key feature of the ifh approach is that it recognizes the need to look at hygiene from the point of view of the family and the total range of problems it faces to reduce id risks including food hygiene personal hygiene particularly hands and hygiene related to the general environment toilets baths hand basins surfaces and others domestic animals and family members at increased risk adopting a holistic approach makes sense because all these issues are interdependent and based on the same underlying microbiologic principles haccp also forms the basis for developing an approach to home hygiene that can be adapted to meet differing needs indeed it is only by adopting such a holistic approach that the causal link between hands and infection transmission in the home can be addressed properly because hand hygiene is a central component of all these issuesthe ifh risk management approach to hygiene starts from the principle that pathogens are introduced continually into the home by people who may have infection or may be asymptomatic food and domestic animals and also sometimes via the water or the air additionally sites at which stagnant water accumulates such as sinks toilets waste pipes or items such as cleaning or face cloths readily support microbial growth and can become a primary reservoir of infection although microbial species are mostly those that represent a risk to vulnerable groups primary pathogens can also be present58 so long as there are people pets and food in the home there will always be the risk of pathogenic microbes in many homes there will also be at least one family member who is more susceptible to infection for one reason or anotherwithin the home there is a chain of events as described in
fig 1 that results in transmission of infection from its original source to a new recipient to an extent we can limit the exit and entry of pathogens from and into the body but the link that we have most control over is that related to the spread of pathogens the spread of infection can be interrupted by good hygiene practice which includes adherence to hand hygiene recommendations and cleaning and disinfecting contaminated environmental surfacesthe risk-based approach to home hygiene is described in more detail by bloomfield and scott59 and bloomfield60 they suggest that sites and surfaces in the home should be categorized into 4 main groups reservoir sites reservoirdisseminators hands and hand and food contact surfaces and other surfaces risk assessment is then based on the frequency of occurrence of pathogenic contamination at that site together with the probability of transfer from that site such that family members may be exposed this means that even if a particular environmental site is highly contaminated unless there is a high probability of transfer from that site the risk of infection transmission is low from this it is possible to determine the critical control points for preventing spread of infection the data suggest the followingfor reservoir sites such as the sink waste pipes or toilets although the probability of contamination potentially pathogenic bacteria or viruses is high the risk of transfer is limited unless there is a particular risk situation eg a family member with enteric infection and fluid diarrhea when toilet flushing can produce splashing or aerosol formation that can settle on contact surfaces around the toilet58 61
by contrast for reservoir sites such as wet cleaning cloths not only is there high probability of significant contamination but by the very nature of their usage they carry a high risk of disseminating contamination to other surfaces and to the handsfor hands and hand contact and food preparation surfaces although the probability of contamination is in relative terms lower it is still significant for example particularly following contact with contaminated food people pets or other contaminated surfaces such as door faucet and toilet-flush handles because there is a constant risk of spread from these surfaces hygiene measures are important for these surfacesfor other surfaces floors walls furniture and others risks are mainly due to pathogens such as s aureus and c difficile which survive under dry conditions because the risks of transfer and exposure are relatively low these surfaces are considered low risk but where there is known contamination for example soiling of floors by pets crawling infants may be at risk cleaning can also recirculate dust-borne pathogens onto hand and food contact surfaces
overall this approach allows us to rank these various sites and surfaces 
fig 2 according to the level of transmission risk this suggests that the critical control points for breaking the chain of infection are the hands together with hand and food contact surfaces cleaning cloths and other cleaning utensils however although this is a useful rule of thumb ranking it is not a constant for example although risks from toilets sinks floors and others relate mainly to the relatively lower risk of transfer from these sites to hands hand and food contact surfaces and cloths this risk can increase substantially during occasions when an infected family member has fluid diarrhea or when a floor surface is contaminated with vomitus urine or feces in the following section we evaluate data indicating the extent to which the hands both alone and in combination with other surfaces are responsible for the spread of infectionas shown in fig 3 exposure to gi pathogens can occur by direct hand-to-mouth contact or indirectly via contaminated food in the home food can be contaminated either directly by an infected food handler or indirectly by cross contamination via hands and surfaces from another source which may be contaminated food another infected household member or carrier or a household pet or farm animal hand-to-mouth contact is a frequent occurrence particularly among children a study of mouthing behavior in 72 young children showed that children 24 months of age exhibit the highest frequency with 81 eventshour for children 24 months of age this was reduced but was still of the order of 42 eventshour63
the potential for transmission of pathogens from hands to ready-to-eat foods is supported by a number of studiesin a model domestic kitchen 29 of food preparation sessions using campylobacter-contaminated chicken resulted in positive campylobacter isolations from prepared salads cleaning materials and food contact surfaces64
bidawid et al65 66 showed that touching lettuce with finger pads contaminated with hav and feline calicivirus fcv used as a surrogate for norovirus for 10 seconds resulted in transfer of 92 and 18 respectively of the virus based on the load for hav in feces 106 to 109 viral particlesg an estimated 1300 particles were transferred to the lettucerusin et al showed that when volunteers fingertips were inoculated with a pooled suspension of micrococcus luteus m luteus serratia rubidea s rubidea and bacteriophage prd-1 and held to the lip area transfer rates were 4099 3397 and 3390 respectively67

as stated above the infection risk from oral consumption depends on the number of bacterial cells or viral particles that are consumed
table 4 shows that for many of the commonly occurring gi pathogens the infectious dose is relatively small
figure 3 illustrates that the risk of exposure to gi pathogens via the hands depends on the extent to which these pathogens are brought into the home either by infected people or pets or via contaminated food and the extent to which they are spread via hands and other surfaces and by airborne transmission relevant data from various sources as summarized below suggest that exposure to gi pathogens via the hands is a frequent occurrence during normal daily activities and that the numbers of organisms transferred by hand-to-mouth contact can be well within the numbers required to cause infectionhousehold members who are infected or who are carriers are a primary source of infection in the home pathogens that can be carried persistently by otherwise healthy people include salmonella species and c difficile approximately 3 of adults mainly those 65 years of age and up to two thirds of babies are known to carry c difficile in their gut although it is not known what proportion are toxin producing25 people or animals that carry gi pathogens shed large numbers of organisms in their feces or when they vomit a single vomiting incident following norovirus infection may produce 30 million viral particles72 and at the peak of a rotavirus infection 1011 virions may be excreted per gram feces74 surfaces in the home may become contaminated by enteric organisms that are aerosolized during vomiting or by transfer of vomitus and fecal matter via hands viruses aerosolized from flushing the toilet can remain airborne long enough to contaminate surfaces throughout the bathroom75
infectious agents introduced into the home via food include salmonella campylobacter listeria and e coli o157 a variety of foods can act as a source of these organisms including meat fish and poultry products dairy products fruits and vegetables organisms in particles and moisture or juices from food will contaminate any surface they come into contact with an efsa survey76 of salmonella in chicken indicates significant differences among eu member states with isolation rates between 0 and 682 the level reported for the united kingdom was 71 to 94 the efsa also reported that up to 66 of samples from fresh poultry were positive for campylobacter77 in the united states more than half of raw chicken is estimated to be contaminated with camplylobacter76 chapman et al78 showed that 04 to 08 of meat products purchased from uk butchers were positive for e coli o157 in a recent study in canada c difficile was isolated from 20 of 60 samples of retail ground meat purchased over a 10-month period and 11 isolates were toxigenic79
the home is frequently a shelter to a range of different pets more than 50 of homes in the english-speaking world have cats and dogs with 60 million cats and dogs in the united states in the united states up to 39 of dogs may carry campylobacter and 10 to 27 may carry salmonella80 cats are also carriers of these organisms carriage of c difficile in household pets is quite common up to 23 of pets are affected although these mostly involve noncytotoxigenic strains25
kramer et al81 sattar et al82 and rzezutka and cook83 reviewed data showing that gi pathogens can survive on surfaces for several hours and in some cases days particularly on moist surfaces although infectivity depends on the numbers that survive 
table 5studies to quantify transfer between hands foods and kitchen surfaces67 84 showed that transfer rates were highly variable ranging from as high as 100 to as low as 1 transfer to hands was highest from nonporous surfaces but lower from surfaces such as carrots sponges and dishcloths 1 rusin et al67 sampled volunteers hands after touching surfaces contaminated with m luteus s rubidea and phage prd-1 activities included wringing out a dishclothsponge turning off a faucet cutting up a carrot making hamburger patties holding a phone receiver and removing laundry from the washing machine transfer efficiencies for the phone receiver and faucet were 38 to 65 and 27 to 40 respectively paulson85 showed that when gloved hands were contacted for 5 to 10 seconds with surfaces such as cutting boards and doorknobs contaminated with fcv log 59 particles the log number of particles recovered from hands was 47 to 54these laboratory studies are supported by a range of field studies showing spread via the hands and other surfaces during normal daily activitiesfollowing preparation of salmonella and campylobacter-contaminated chickens in domestic kitchens these species were isolated from 173 of hands and hand and food contact surfaces isolation rates were highest for hands chopping boards and cleaning cloths 25 35 and 60 respectively of surfaces sampled86
in homes containing an infant recently vaccinated for polio during which time shedding occurs in feces virus was isolated from 13 of bathroom living room and kitchen surfaces87 most frequently contaminated were hand contact sites such as bathroom taps door handles toilet flushes soap dispensers nappy changing equipment and pottiesfollowing handshaking with a volunteer whose hands were contaminated from touching a virus-contaminated door handle successive transmission from one person to another could be followed up to the sixth person88
where fingers were contacted with norovirus-contaminated fecal material the virus was consistently transferred via the fingers to melamine surfaces and from there to hand contact surfaces such as taps door handles and telephone receivers contaminated fingers sequentially transferred the virus to up to 7 clean surfaces89
a study90 with fcv showed survival for up to 3 days on telephone buttons and receivers for 1 or 2 days on computer mouse and for 8 to 12 hours on keyboard keys and brass disks representing faucets and door handles the time for 90 virus reduction was 4 hours on computer keys mouse and brass disks 4 to 8 hours on telephone receivers and 12 to 24 hours on telephone buttonsin homes of infants with recurrent c difficile infection 12 of environmental surfaces were positive for c difficile and 1 of 4 other household members carried c difficile in stool in a control home with no household carriers none of 84 environment samples were positive for c difficile
91
in 4 out of 6 homes in which there was a salmonella case the causative species was isolated from fecal soiling under the flushing rim and scale material in the toilet bowl for up to 3 weeks after notification of infection58 flushing toilets seeded with salmonella enteritidis resulted in contamination of hand contact surfaces such as toilet seats and toilet seat lids
these represent recent examples of studies that have been reported these and other studies are also reviewed elsewhere82 92 93 94
in developing hygiene policies for preventing gi infections one of the difficulties is assessing risks associated with hand transmission relative to other risks such as inadequate cooking or storage of food or inhalation of infected vomit particles gillespie et al15 reported an evaluation of reported outbreaks linked to uk households for 1992 to 1999 that suggested of the 85 of outbreaks designated as foodborne cross contamination was implicated in 20 of outbreaks compared with 30 and 31 of outbreaks for which inadequate storage and cooking respectively were thought to be the cause there were no data to suggest what percentage of cross contamination events involved the hands and gillespie et al15 expressed concern that most of the reported outbreaks were linked to home catering thus not necessarily representative of normal daily routine aerosol transmission can result from settling on hand and food contact surfaces but for norovirus infection can sometimes result from direct inhalation of infected particles of vomit by people immediately adjacent to the person who vomits the potential for airborne transmission of norovirus was demonstrated in studies in a restaurant and a primary school in which close proximity to infected persons in the immediate aftermath of a vomiting attack was identified as a risk factor95 96
as shown in fig 3 exposure to rt viruses can occur either by inhalation of infected mucous or inoculation of the nasal mucosa or eyes with virus-contaminated hands which then cause infection via the mucous membranes and upper rt rhinovirus and rsv are deposited into the front of the nose or into the eye where they pass down the lacrymal duct either on the end of the finger or possibly sometimes in aerosolized droplets99 rubbing the eyes and nose with the fingertips is a common occurrence hendley et al found that 1 in 27 attendees of hospital rounds rubbed their eyes and 33 picked their nose within a 1-hour observation period100
a review of the data94 
table 6 suggests that the infectious dose for respiratory viruses is relatively small alford et al suggest that aerosolized doses of as little as 1 tcid50 tissue culture infective dose of influenza virus could infect volunteers101
evidence for transmission of rhinovirus and rsv infections via contaminated hands comes from a number of studiesa number of studies have demonstrated that self-inoculation by rubbing the nasal mucosa or conjunctivae with rhinovirus-contaminated fingers can lead to infection100 102 over a period of 10 years gwaltny and hayden performed intranasal challenges on 343 healthy young adults who had no antibody to the challenge and infected 321 95103 after handling contaminated coffee cups and other objects more than 50 of subjects developed infection104 hall et al showed that volunteers touching contaminated objects andor the fingers of symptomatic individuals had a higher attack rate of colds if they touched their eyes or nose105
in a 4-year family trial hendley and gwaltney104 found that prophylactic treatment of mothers fingers with iodine reduced the incidence of rt infections when illness occurred in the family mothers were instructed to dip their fingers in iodine upon awakening in the morning then every 3 or 4 hours or after activities that washed the iodine from the skin the secondary attack rate in mothers was 7 in the iodine group and 20 in placebo families no infections occurred in mothers after 11 exposures to an infected index case in the iodine group compared with 5 infections after 16 exposures in the placebo grouphall et al showed that infected infants excrete prodigious amounts of rsv in their nasal secretions for several days105 and that rsv could be recovered from hands that had touched surfaces contaminated with secretions from infected infants99 hall and douglas found that close contact with symptomatic infants who were producing abundant secretions or their immediate environment was necessary for infection106


figure 3 illustrates that the risk of exposure to rt pathogens via hands depends on the extent to which these pathogens are spread from an infected person during normal daily activities relevant data come from various sources and are summarized below taken together the data suggest that when a household member is infected exposure of other household members via hands is likely to occur during normal daily activities and that the numbers of organisms involved are within those required to initiate infection if transferred to the eyes or nosepeople infected with cold viruses shed large quantities of virus-laden mucus droplets of nasal secretions generated by coughing sneezing and talking can travel over a distance 3 m to contaminate surrounding surfaces37 98 107 108 109 up to 107 infectious influenza particles per milliliter has been detected in nasal secretions110 the mean duration of a cold is 75 days viral shedding may occur 24 to 48 hours before illness onset but generally at lower titers than during the symptomatic period titers generally peak during the first 24 to 72 hours of illness and decline within several days with titers low or undetectable by day 5 children can shed virus for up to 3 weeks whereas immunocompromised people may continue to shed virus for weeks to months98
infectious material can also be deposited directly on hands and tissues during sneezing and blowing the nose contamination of hands can occur by handshaking or touching contaminated surfaces pathogens shed into the environment from these sources can survive for significant periods and are readily spread around the home to and from the hands and via handkerchiefs and tissues tap and door handles telephones or other hand contact surfacesgwaltney and hendley demonstrated that most subjects with experimental colds had rhinovirus on their hands and that virus could be recovered from 43 of plastic tiles they touched104 for people with rhinovirus colds virus was found on 39 of hands and 6 of objects in their immediate environment100 reed demonstrated recovery of virus from naturally contaminated objects in the surroundings of persons with rhinovirus colds102
in a recent study winther et al111 recruited volunteers suffering from colds to stay overnight in hotel rooms after checkout but before room cleaning 10 objects identified as frequently touched were sampled for rhinovirus virus was found on 35 of objects including door handles light switches pens faucet and toilet handles and television remote controls some people contaminated none or few sites most contaminated several and some contaminated almost all up to 8 sites in a second study in which the same subjects stayed overnight in a hotel room in which hand contact surfaces light switch phone button and handset had been contaminated with rhinovirus-contaminated mucus 60 of subjects became contaminated with rhinovirusansari et al showed that hands readily pick up rhinovirus and piv by touching contaminated objects112 as much as 70 of infectious rhinovirus has been shown to transfer to a recipients fingers after contact for 10 seconds113 in a study with volunteers who handled contaminated doorknobs or faucets recovery rates from 3 to 1800 plaque-forming units of rhinovirus were obtained from fingertips114
in a study of us day care centers and domestic homes influenza a virus was detected on 23 of day care center surfaces sampled during the fall of 2003 and 53 of surfaces sampled during the spring although no influenza was detected on home surfaces during the summer influenza was detected on 59 of surfaces sampled during march in 5 homes in which there was an influenza-infected child no virus was recovered from 3 other homes in which all household members were healthy influenza virus was recovered most frequently from telephone receivers 80 and least frequently from computer keyboards 40 other surfaces found to be contaminated included refrigerators kitchen faucets light switches microwaves tv remote controls doorknobs and bath faucet and toilet handles influenza virus was recovered from 69 of the day care center diaper changing areas indicating presence of virus in infant feces94

transfer of rt infections via contaminated hands depends on the ability of the virus to survive and retain its infectivity outside the human host the potential for survival varies significantly between nonenveloped rhinovirus and rsv compared with the enveloped influenza virus and piv
kramer et al81 and hendley et al100 review data showing that rhinovirus and rsv can survive for significant periods 2 hours to 7 days for rhinovirus up to 6 hours for rsv on dry surfaces and for at least 2 hours on human skinansari et al115 and brady et al116 showed that although piv can survive on nonabsorbent surfaces for up to 10 hours survival on hands was relatively poor 1-2 hoursbean et al117 showed that influenza virus could survive up to 24 to 48 hours on nonporous surfaces and up to 8 to 12 hours on cloth paper and tissues by contrast virus could be recovered from hands for only 5 minutes and then only if hands were contaminated with high viral titers virus could be transferred from nonporous surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for 15 minutes higher humidity shortened virus survival virus on nonporous surfaces could be transferred to hands 24 hours after the surface was contaminated whereas tissues could transfer virus to hands for 15 minutes after the tissue was contaminated on hands virus concentration fell by 100- to 1000-fold within 5 minutes after transfer
opinion as to the importance of the hands relative to the airborne route for transmission of rhinovirus colds is divided some investigators30 99 103 104 maintain that contamination of the hands followed by inoculation of the eyes or nose is of paramount importance in fact gwaltney et al found that it was exceedingly difficult to transmit virus orally or by kissing and found little evidence of droplet or droplet nuclei transmission100 113 others maintain that the evidence favors droplet and droplet nuclei transmission as the most important mode of spread118 for rsv there is general agreement that the hands are the primary route for the spread of infection32 105 106
for influenza although more data are needed it is increasingly accepted that not only airborne both true airborne transmission involving droplet nuclei 5 m in diameter and droplet transmission involving droplets 10 m that deposit onto surfaces quite rapidly but also surface including hand transmission come into play98 119 120 the relative contribution of each mode of transmission is unknown but appears to vary depending on the circumstances symptoms respiratory tract loads and the viral strain121 data from animal studies and influenza outbreaks suggest that droplets generated when infected persons cough or sneeze are the predominant mechanism of airborne transmission37 although data supporting droplet nuclei spread are also available101 122 123 124 it is possible however that influenza is less transmissible via hands and surfaces compared with rhinovirus and others because of its lower ability to survive outside a human or animal host data suggest that to some extent airborne droplets and droplet nuclei cause infection as a result of settling on hand contact surfaces the frequent occurrence of diarrhea and the detection of viral rna in fecal samples tested suggest that the h5n1 influenza virus may replicate in the human gut and could be a source of transmission via hands and surfaces125 at present however it is thought that this is unlikely the growing evidence base related to the survival transmission and human exposure to rt viruses via hands and other surfaces is also reviewed elsewhere32 35 37 82 94 99
as shown in fig 3 exposure to skin pathogens such as s aureus can occur via the hands exposure can produce colonization andor infection that usually occurs in areas in which there are cuts abrasions and others that damage the integrity of the skin where there are predisposing factors the numbers of organisms required to produce infection may be relatively small marples126 showed that up to 106 cells may be required to produce pus in healthy skin but as little as 102 may be sufficient in areas in which the skin is occluded or traumatized risks associated with exposure to hca-mrsa and ca-mrsa are different hca-mrsa usually affects elderly adults and those who are immunocompromised particularly those with surgical or other wounds or who have indwelling catheters for ca-mrsa those at particular risk appear to be younger generally healthy people who practice contact sports or other activities that put them at higher risk of acquiring skin cuts and abrasions127 us experience suggests that ca-mrsa may be more virulent than other strains and is easily transmissible within households and community settings eg schools day care centers sport teams in which skin-to-skin contact or sharing of contaminated items eg towels sheets and sport equipment are vehicles for person-to-person transmission128 a case-control study129 involving 55 cases of mrsa in a us prison showed that inmates who washed their hands 6 times per day had an increased risk for mrsa infection compared with inmates who washed their hands 12 times per day
figure 3 illustrates that the risk of exposure to skin pathogens via the hands depends on the extent to which people or animals colonized or infected with pathogenic strains are present in the home and the extent to which these pathogens are spread during normal daily activities transfer of skin pathogens to the hands can occur either by direct contact with an infected source or indirectly via hand contact surfaces or the surfaces of clothing or household linens relevant data as outlined below suggest that when there is a person in the home who is infected or colonized with s aureus exposure of other household members as a result of transfer via hands surfaces clothing and others is likely to occur during normal daily activities and that the numbers of organisms involved are within the numbers of particles that could initiate an infection in a susceptible recipienta study by kluytmans et al suggests that s aureus is carried as part of the normal body flora in up to 60 of the general population130 although a 2006 us study131 suggests that the carriage rate is much less 316 in the united kingdom indications are that the proportion of the general population carrying antibiotic-resistant strains of s aureus either hca- or ca-mrsa is somewhere between 05 and 15 the majority being carriers of hca-mrsa who are 65 years of age andor have had recent association with a health care setting132 although cases of ca-mrsa and pvl-producing mrsa have been reported indications are that the prevalence of mrsa and pvl-producing strains circulating in the community is currently very small25
in the united states although it is concluded that colonization rates for mrsa in the community are still low it is nonetheless thought to be increasing127 133 graham et al131 report on an analysis of 2001-2002 data from the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes to determine colonization with s aureus in a noninstitutionalized us population from a total of 9622 participants it was found that 316 were colonized with s aureus of which 25 were colonized with mrsa of persons with mrsa half were identified as strains containing the sccmec type iv gene most usually associated with ca-mrsa whereas the other half were identified as strains containing the sccmec type ii gene most usually associated with hca-mrsa several other investigators have examined the epidemiology of mrsa in the us community differences in the data suggest a sporadic distribution of ca-mrsa with carriage rates ranging from 8 to 20 in baltimore atlanta and minnesota127 up to 28 to 35 for an apparently healthy population in new york134
domestic pets can also be a source of s aureus including mrsa and pvl-producing strains135 136 137 138 139 manian136 described 2 dog owners suffering from persistent mrsa infection who suffered relapses whenever they returned home from the hospital further investigation revealed that the dog was carrying the same strain of mrsapeople who carry s aureus can shed the organism in large numbers most usually associated with skin scales140 kramer et al81 review data showing that s aureus including mrsa can survive on dry surfaces for periods from 7 days up to 7 months scott and bloomfield showed that during a 4-hour drying period up to 50 of s aureus inoculated onto laminate could be transferred to fingertips by contact transfer to fingertips also occurred when a cloth contaminated with s aureus was used to wipe a clean surface141
studies in health care settings as reviewed by bloomfield et al25 show that where there is an infected or carrier individual mrsa can be isolated from environmental surfaces frequently touched by hands including computer keyboards pens television sets clothing mattresses pillows beds and chairs and door handles these data are supported by studies directly related to the home showing the potential for spread of s aureus via hands and other surfaces during normal daily activitiesin studies by reynolds and gerba142 and by scott elizabeth scott centre for hygiene and health simmons college boston personal communication carried out in 27 and 35 us homes respectively including homes containing children and hcws mrsa was identified at one or more sites in 40 and 20 respectively of homes contaminated surfaces included bathroom rugs bed linens furniture draperies pet beds and food dishes kitchen sink countertop kitchen faucets kitchen drain spongecounter wiping cloth and dish towels and infant high chair trayin studies of hcws colonized with mrsa135 143 144 145 146 the hcw was treated to eradicate the organism but subsequently became recolonized in each case mrsa was isolated from environmental surfaces in the home of the hcw including door handles a computer desk shelf and computer joystick linens furniture and in some cases also from other family members143 144 145 146 and family pets135
a number of cases are reported in which family members in the home of an infected person have become colonized147 148 149 150 hollis et al147 found that transmission of the mrsa strain from an index case to 2 siblings and the mother occurred at least 3 times and one family member was colonized for up to 7 months or more
these represent recent examples of studies that show survival and transfer of mrsa around the home these and other studies are also reviewed by bloomfield et al25
both observational and interventional study designs have been used to assess the relationship between hand hygiene and id transmission by definition observational studies are not randomized and must utilize careful methods to preserve internal validity control of confounding and the potential for selection recall and other biases are also a concern for example individuals who wash their hands less frequently are also less likely to report symptoms intervention studies on the other hand compare infection rates in groups in which handwashing is or is not promoted intervention studies employing randomization of treatment groups have been considered the gold-standard in terms of reducing selection biases these studies have the ability to ensure that randomized groups are similar apart from treatment allocation and differences that occur by chance for these reasons we limit discussion to intervention studies focusing on gi and rt illnesses because these are the most common infectious illness symptoms in home and community settingsa range of intervention studies have been carried out to evaluate the causal link between handwashing and id transmission and have been reviewed in a series of papers to assess the consistency and strength of the link151 152 153 overall these studies indicate a strong and consistent link between handwashing and gi disease and a significant link between handwashing and rt illnesses for the most part these studies have been carried out in child day care centers schools and military and other public settings in which the outcome is often measured against a high baseline level of infection relatively few studies have been carried out in household settings in the united states and europe difficulties associated with studying households in developed areas include fewer children under the age of 5 years higher level of hygiene infrastructure and difficulties in collecting data given that there are likely fewer susceptible individuals clustered within household settings the prevalence of gi and rt illnesses is relatively much lower making it more difficult to detect a significant influence of hand hygiene on the occurrence of illnesswhereas some intervention studies are not relevant to this review and have been omitted others give useful insight into the potential impact of handwashing in the home and in the general community studies that are included have been selected on the basis of whether transmission routes are likely to reflect those in the home most particularly whether the relative rates of transmission via these routes as shown in fig 2 are likely to be similar for this reason studies on gi infection in developing countries have been excluded in these settings limited access to sanitation means that rates of direct hand-to-mouth transmission from feces is high relative to other routes of transmission eg person-to-person transmission via hands or inadequate food hygiene compared to settings with adequate water and sanitation in which transmission is more likely to involve person-to-person transmission and transmission via food rather than direct feces-to-hand-to-mouth for gi illnesses we have therefore focused on studies carried out in developed country communities although even for studies such as those in child daycare centers in which food preparation is not undertaken by study participants the data probably reflect mainly the impact on person-to-person transmission for rt infections studies conducted in both developed and developing countries are included on the basis that relative rates of airborne transmission versus transmission via hands are likely to be similar regardless of settingin a recent review aiello et al assessed the relationship between handwashing and gi outcomes154 focusing on studies conducted in north america and europe
table 7 summarizes studies providing an effect estimate risk ratio rate ratio and others as well as 95 confidence intervals 95 ci in all of the studies handwashing with soap was the factor studied although in some this was combined with hygiene education measures all studies assessing handwashing and hand hygiene education were conducted in school or day care settingsamong the studies in table 7 the reduction in gi illness associated with handwashing ranged from 10 to 57 however 3 of the 5 studies were not statistically significant including the study that identified a value of 10 the studies that gave statistically significant results all describe reductions close to 50 overall these reviews suggest a consistent causal relationship between handwashing and reduction in gi illness although the findings are less consistent and of a lesser magnitude than in lesser developed settings in which studies considered statistically significant suggested reductions from 26 to 79154
in assessing rt infections the reviews of aiello and larson151 and aiello et al154 mentioned above examined both rt and gi illness outcomes whereas 3 other systematic reviews focused solely on the relationship between hand hygiene and rt infections a review by lee et al assessing the relationship between several nonvaccine interventions and prevention of acute rt infection160 concluded that the promotion of hand hygiene may be useful for preventing rt disease rabie and curtis in 2006 also published a review of hand hygiene studies involving rt infections161 they reported that hand hygiene handwashing education and waterless hand sanitizers can reduce the risk of respiratory infection by 16 95 ci 11-21 these investigators have now updated their estimate with 2 further more recent studies that when all studies are taken together give a pooled impact on respiratory infection of 23162
based on these studies
table 8 summarizes the results of community-based interventions excluding health care-related and military settings on rt illnesses most studies were conducted in economically developed countries 83 56 the range of reduction in illness was 5 to 53 but only 33 26 of the studies were statistically significant the results suggest that hand hygiene education and promotion of handwashing can reduce rates of rt illnesses but the impact is less than for gi infections although it must be borne in mind that the available data are more limited154
there are also several studies of handwashing that do not distinguish between gi and rt outcomes157 167 168 these studies measure outcomes such as illness-related absenteeism making it difficult to assess the impact on specific disease etiologies of these studies only one reported a significant reduction 25157 two were conducted in day care centers and 1 was conducted in an elementary school all 3 studies were conducted in economically developed areas united states sweden and israel157 167 168
several methodologic issues must be considered for these studies studies that use randomization are more likely to produce study groups with similar baseline characteristics surprisingly 40 of the 11 studies in table 7 table 8 did not randomize in some studies randomization may not be an option eg in community settings because the intervention is too complicated to randomize to multiple groups rather than assigning it to a single geographic area controlling for potential confounding variables is also an important issue for example if a study did not control for age and included adults as well as children the effect of a hygiene intervention may be diluted because adults are at lower risk for diarrheal disease compared with children in randomized studies adjustment for confounding in the statistical analysis may not be required if potential confounders associated with intervention and control groups appear balanced for example randomization of households in the same geographic area may produce intervention and control arms with the same age distributions hygiene habits and health profiles as summarized in
table 9 of the 11 studies only 50 918 reported controlling for at least 1 potential confounding factor although masking also known as blinding can be difficult to implement in hygiene studies because subjects observers and interviewers are usually aware of the intervention status a few studies 218 were able to employ masking to reduce knowledge of the intervention masking can reduce biases associated with knowledge of intervention including changes in behaviors practices and data collection methodsfor intervention studies disregarding clustered sample design may cause bias for example a handwashing program in a day care center may affect a childs risk of disease through its individual-level effect the effect of handwashing of a child on his or her own risk of disease and through its group-level effect the effect of center-wide handwashing on risk of disease even if the child is not following the handwashing program clustered interventions must take into account the grouped data structure in subsequent analyses or must analyze data at the same level at which it was collected if the group or cluster is not controlled for through specialized techniques such as generalized estimating equations or analyzed at the group unit of measurement average classroom illness rate the investigator risks making a type i error eg falsely concluding that the effect of the intervention is significant when there is no significant difference although most handwashing studies employ clustered data structures use of clustered data statistical techniques have only become more prevalent since 2000in europe the efficacy of handwashing is established by panel tests that determine the reduction in the number of organisms released from artificially contaminated hands the test applicable to handwash products is the committee european normalisation hygienic handwash test en1499170 in this test e coli is inoculated onto the hands and dried the handwash product is applied to the hands with a rubbing action for either 30 seconds or 1 minute the residual number of bacteria present on the hands is assessed pre- and postwash by a rinse sampling process and the log reduction determined to make a claim that a product is a hygienic handwash it must produce a log reduction in release of e coli from the hands at least equivalent to that produced by a reference soft soap product mean 276 log in 1 minute range 202-427 in the united states handwashing is evaluated by a similar panel test using serratia marcescens as the test organism the test applicable to consumer handwash products is the american society for testing materials astm standard method for evaluation of healthcare handwash formulations e1174171 the product when evaluated by this method must produce a 2-log reduction after 5 minutesa range of studies based on these methodologies has been carried out to determine the efficacy of handwashing and are reviewed by boyce and pittet172 kampf and kramer173 and sickbert-bennet et al169 from their assessment kampf and kramer estimated that handwashing produced a mean reduction of up to 24 log within 1 minute data from individual studies are summarized in
table 10 and suggest that for e coli the greatest reduction is achieved within the first 30 seconds ranging from 06 to 11 log after 15 seconds to 18 to 28 log after 30 seconds extending the washing time to 1 minute produces a reduction of 26 to 323 log but increasing the process for more than 1 minute does not appear to gain any additional reduction relatively few data are available on the effectiveness of handwashing in removal of viruses but the available data table 10 suggest that handwashing may be less effective for viruses compared with bacteriaalthough panel test data suggest that handwashing efficacy is similar across a range of bacterial species some field-based studies suggest that efficacy can vary quite significantly in some cases organisms can be attached to the hands too firmly and may not be removed by handwashing a study of the spread of salmonella and campylobacter from contaminated chickens via hands during handling and preparation in a kitchen176 showed that although campylobacter were efficiently released from the hands by a 30-second rub and rinse process a 2-minute process was necessary to eliminate salmonella the hand rinsing process is also important cogan et al86 showed that following preparation of salmonella and campylobacter-contaminated chickens in domestic kitchens 153 of hands and hand and food contact surfaces still showed evidence of contamination even after participants had carried out a washing-up routine with detergent and hot water and then used a cloth to wipe surfaces sites contaminated most frequently were hands 20 dishcloths utensils and tap handles 25 and sink surrounds 30 these results were confirmed in further studies176 177 in which after cleaning up with a typical routine involving a bowl of hot soapy water and a cloth although isolation rates from hands of participants were 5 120 for campylobacter 45 920 of participants still had salmonella on their hands and on 3 occasions counts recovered were 103 colony-forming units in a further study in which participants cleaned up in the same way but then rinsed their hands under running water for 10 seconds no samples were positive for campylobacter however 15 320 still had low numbers of salmonella isolated from their hands larson et al showed that the quantity of soap 1 ml and 3 ml used can also have an impact on the microbial reduction achieved by handwashing178
bidawid et al65 66 studied the impact of handwashing in preventing transfer of hav and fcv from artificially contaminated finger pads to pieces of lettuce 
table 11 touching the lettuce for 10 seconds resulted in transfer of 92 and 18 respectively of the virus when finger pads were washed before the lettuce was touched the amount of virus transferred was reduced to 039 and 04 respectively amounts of hav and fcv remaining on treated finger pads were 65 and 7 respectively surprisingly virus transfer to lettuce when the finger pads were rinsed with water alone was between 0 and 03 depending on the volume of water used for rinsingbarker et al showed that a thorough 1-minute handwash with soap was sufficient to eliminate norovirus from fecally contaminated hands to levels that gave negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays89 however schurmann and eggers175 concluded that enteric viruses particularly poliovirus may be more strongly bound to the skin and that the inclusion of an abrasive substance in handwash preparations is needed to achieve effective removal handwashing was also found to be ineffective in eliminating adenovirus from hands of a physician and patients179
for handwashing a hand-rubbing time of 15 seconds with soap is generally recommended although the data in table 10 indicate that 30 seconds to 1 minute is needed to achieve the optimum of 2- to 3-log reduction in practice it is doubtful whether people comply with even a 15-second handwash although there are few data to confirm this a study of 224 healthy homemakers in new york180 showed that a single handwash had little impact with mean log counts of 572 before compared with 569 after handwashing another study with 52 office workers and students showed a mean log prewash count of 481 compared with 507 postwash181 kampf and kramer173 also reviewed studies from health care settings in which increased bacterial counts were found on the hands after handwashing and handwashing failed to prevent transfer of bacteria from hands to surfaces although there are no data available to confirm this increases in contamination may result from sweating induced by hot water which flushes resident bacteria from the sweat glands onto the hand surface or aids detachment of bacteria attached to skin scalesit is important to bear in mind that although soap and water removes contamination from the hands soap itself has a limited antimicrobial effect which means that contamination will be transferred to the sink hospital studies show that pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia cepacia
182 can form reservoirs of contamination in sink waste pipes and can be a source of infection at times when splashes of contaminated water come in contact with hands mermel et al reported that hands of hcws became recontaminated from faucet handles during a shigella outbreak183 soap bars also have the potential to spread contamination from person to person via the hands88
data from in vivo panel tests summarized in
table 12 indicate that abhs show good and rapid activity against bacterial stains such as e coli and s aureus efficacy is at least as good if not better than that achieved by handwashing with soap table 10 log reductions obtained after a 30-second contact period were of the order of 34 to 37 or more compared with 18 to 28 for a 30-second handwashing process boyce and pittet172 conclude that typically log reductions of the release of test bacteria from artificially contaminated hands average 35 log after 30 seconds and 40 to 50 log after 1 minutepaulson et al185 compared the efficacy of abhs containing 62 ethanol contact time 5 minutes with handwashing against s marcescens which showed that handwashing 20 seconds rubbing followed by 30 seconds rinsing produced a log reduction of 229 compared with 383 for the abhs hammond et al186 recorded a 284-log reduction for 62 ethanol against s marcescens in 10 seconds using the astm method sickbert-bennet et al174 however showed that exposure of s marcescens to 60 to 62 ethanol for 10 seconds produced only a 115- to 155-log reduction compared with 187-log reduction for handwashing for 10 seconds when tested by the astm 1147 methodleischner et al187 carried out in vivo tests that showed that alcohol gels were significantly less effective against c difficile spores 168- to 194-log reduction compared with handwashing with chlorhexidine soap 246-log reduction residual spores were readily transferred by handshaking following abhs use187 the reduction in spore counts is higher than expected in view of their known resistance to alcohol and may result from the friction associated with application of the gel rather than a bactericidal action kampf and kramer173 state that water alone can produce a reduction of 05 to 28 log within 1 minute for e coliusing the standard astm 1174 method sickbert-bennet et al evaluated the effect of exposure time and volume of product used on the efficacy of 62 ethanol169 they showed that the use of 7 g of the abhs produced a higher log reduction compared with 3 g 27- to 38-log reduction compared with 10- to 18-log reduction rubbing the hands until dry 3-12 minutes was more effective compared with a 10-second application 10- to 16-log reduction compared with 06- to 11-log reductiontwo recent field studies indicate that an abhs is equally or slightly more effective than handwashing in reducing bacterial contamination on hands davis et al19 compared the reduction of bacterial counts on hands using soap and water or a 62 ethanol-based hand sanitizer contact time 30 seconds after animal handling at a us livestock event there was no significant difference in the distribution of log reductions obtained using abhs compared with handwashing log reductions in total count ranged from 14 to 14 and 30 to 35 for total coliforms traub-dargtz et al carried out a study at 2 clinics in canada to evaluate the efficacy of handwashing compared with use of abhs 62 ethanol contact time 30-60 seconds on veterinary staff performing routine equine physical examinations188 mean bacterial load on hands increased by 036 and 091 log for the 2 clinics respectively as a result of handling the animals whereas the mean log reduction produced by handwashing with soap was less than 06 compared with 129 and 144 log for the 2 clinics respectively produced by abhsa number of in vivo studies have been carried out to determine the efficacy of abhs in reducing the release of viruses from hands test methods were variants of the method of ansari et al189 or the astm e1174 method171 in which the virus is applied to the fingertips and the efficacy of the product in reducing the numbers of viral particles recoverable from the hands determined the residual number of viral particles present on the hands is assessed pre- and posttreatment and the log reduction determined data collated by boyce and pittet172 
table 13 indicate that ethanol at 60 to 80 produces a 08- to 3-log reduction against a range of viruses the extent of the reduction depending on the viral strain the nature and concentration of the alcohol and contact timedata indicate that activity of abhs against viral strains is less than against bacterial strains and that ethanol has greater activity against viruses than 2-propanol however all of the strains referred to in table 13 are nonenveloped viruses which are known to be more resistant to disinfectants than enveloped viruses as far as hand hygiene in the home and community is concerned however this is key because many of the viral strains responsible for hygiene-related id commonly occurring in community settings rotavirus norovirus rhinovirus and adenovirus are nonenveloped that having been said the data suggest that although nonenveloped viruses such as hav and enteroviruses eg poliovirus require 70 to 80 alcohol to be reliably inactivated studies by sattar et al194 suggest that 60 ethanol was sufficient to reduce the titers of rotavirus adenovirus and rhinovirus by 3 log within a 10-second contact period data indicate that fcv may also be relatively susceptible to alcohols compared with other nonenveloped viruses although sensitivity depends on the type and concentration of alcohol using an in vivo test based on the astm 1838-02 method gehrke et al190 showed that 70 ethanol was the most effective agent against fcv with a log reduction of 378 compared with 70 1-propanol log reduction 358 and 70 2-propanol log reduction 215 exposure time 30 seconds however a more recent study by kampf et al191 suggested a log reduction after 30 seconds of only 266 and 153 for 70 ethanol and 70 1-propanol respectivelyin a number of these studies handwashing with soap was also investigated these studies175 189 196 showed that the action of abhs against hav polio and rotavirus was significantly better than that achieved by handwashing with soap however in the test model used by ansari et al189 and mbithi et al196 inoculated fingertips are exposed to soap solution or abhs by inverting them over a vial containing the product in practice handwashing involving rubbing and rinsing is likely to remove larger numbers of organisms from hands in a further experiment ansari et al115 also demonstrated that 2-propanol 70 was more effective 989 reduction after 10 seconds than liquid soap 77 reduction against rotavirusmbithi et al showed that the log reduction of polio and hav virus 089-134 by application of 70 ethanol was sufficient to prevent transfer to another surface via the fingertips196 using similar methodology bidawid et al65 66 studied the impact of ethanol hand sanitizers in preventing transfer of hav and fcv from artificially contaminated finger pads to pieces of lettuce results table 11 show that touching the lettuce for 10 seconds resulted in transfer of 92 and 18 respectively of the virus when finger pads were treated with 62 ethanol or 75 ethanol contact time 20 seconds before the lettuce was touched the amount of virus transferred was reduced to 064 and 046 respectively for hav and 21 and 12 respectively for fcv although both 62 and 75 alcohol produced significant reductions in virus transfer significant amounts of virus were found to remain on treated finger pads in all cases treatment with ethanol was less effective than handwashingkampf and kramer172 and boyce and pittet173 suggest that to achieve satisfactory activity against nonenveloped viruses higher alcohol concentrations and extended contact times are needed absolute ethanol reduced viral release from hands by 32 log 80 ethanol by 22 log and absolute 1-propanol by 24 log197 but with a contact time of 10 minutes schurmann and eggers175 concluded that high alcohol-concentration products are effective against enteroviruses only under favorable conditions large disinfectantvirus volume ratio low protein load other studies also demonstrate superior activity of high ethanol concentrations against nonenveloped viruses such as polio hav and adenovirus198 199
alcohols have excellent and rapid activity against gram-positive and gram-negative vegetative bacteria and fungi when tested in vitro172 173 a study by fendler et al200 
table 14 shows the efficacy of an abhs containing 62 ethyl alcohol against a range of bacterial and fungal species giving 4- to 6-log reduction in 15 to 30 secondsdata as reviewed by boyce and pittet172 confirm that enveloped viruses such as herpes influenza piv and rsv are very susceptible to alcohols data from individual studies 
table 15 suggest that activity against enveloped viruses is equivalent to that against bacterial strains however in agreement with in vivo data alcohols tend to be less effective against nonenveloped viruses although this is not the case for all strains fendler et al200 confirmed good activity for ethanol 62 against piv and herpes viruses 4-log reduction in 30 seconds and some but relatively less activity against the nonenveloped rhinovirus cocksackie virus adenovirus and hav 1- to 3-log reduction in 30 seconds hammond et al186 showed 5-log reduction against herpes and influenza virus but also 425-log reduction against rhinovirus type 16 there are no data on efficacy against rotavirus in vitroin vitro tests suggest that alcohols are relatively effective against fcv although gehrke et al190 table 15 found that 1-propanol was more effective than 2-propanol and ethanol it was also found that these alcohols were less effective against fcv at 80 than at 50 and 70 at this concentration 80 1-propanol 2-propanol and ethanol produced log reductions of only 19 135 and 216 respectively by contrast duizer et al201 showed that 70 ethanol produced less than a 2-log reduction for fcv after 8 minutes and a 3-log reduction after 30 minutesthese data are confirmed by a further study mcneil-ppc unpublished using in vitro suspension test methods as used to generate data in table 15 the data 
table 16 show that 62 ethanol gave a 3- to 6-log reduction in 30 seconds against a range of nonenveloped viruses including not only rsv piv and influenza a and b but also against some strains of rhinovirus and echovirusalcohols are considered inappropriate when hands are visibly dirty or soiled because they fail to remove soiling however in a number of in vitro studies in which the efficacy of abhs was determined in the presence and absence of soil 10 fetal calf serum or 03 bovine serum albumin soil produced little or no loss of efficacy198 202 larson and bobo showed that in the presence of small amounts of protein material eg blood ethanol and 2-propanol were more effective than soap in reducing bacterial counts on hands203 using the astm 1174 method sickbert-bennet et al169 showed that applying protein to hands did not produce any significant reduction in efficacy of abhs or handwashing but produced a modest but significant increase log reductions for handwashing were 118 to 139 and 156 to 187 in the absence and presence of protein respectively log reductions for abhs were 018 to 107 and 135 to 155 in the absence and presence of protein respectivelyone of the problems in developing hygiene promotion policies is the lack of quantitative data on the relative health impact of different hygiene interventions although intervention studies yield quantitative data on health impact as discussed in section 42 the reliability of these estimates is difficult to confirm by contrast in vivo and in vitro tests are more economic to perform and can be used to determine relative efficacy of different procedures but give no assessment of how the contamination reduction on hands correlates with health impact in an attempt to overcome these problems haas et al have applied the technique of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra to estimate the relative health benefits resulting from use of different hygiene procedures204 this approach involves using microbiologic data from the published literature related to each stage of the infection transmission cycle to calculate infection riskin a recent study205 these investigators developed a model for studying the effect of hand contact with ground beef during food preparation which was used to study the impact of handwashing and use of abhs in preventing subsequent transference from the hands to the mouth compared with no handwashing pathogenic e coli and e coli o157h7 were selected for this study because it is known from other investigations206 that handling ground beef during home food preparation poses a risk of infection with e coli to perform the risk assessment data on the density of pathogens in ground beef transference from beef to hands removal by handwashing or abhs rate of transfer from hand to mouth and infectivity of ingested pathogens were obtained from the literature and after screening for data quality were used to develop probability distributions for assessing log reductions produced by hand hygiene procedures only in vivo panel testing data were considered the median log reduction used in these calculations was 03 range 02-30 for handwashing and 43 range 26-58 for abhs
table 17 shows the estimates of the infection risk from handling raw beef as obtained from the analysis the authors note that these risks are conditional in the sense that they quantify the risk to an individual who has handled ground beef and who engages in hand-to-mouth activity the probability that an individual will engage in such behavior is not known and therefore a direct comparison with actual disease rates cannot be made however with some plausible assumptions it was assessed that assuming that there are 100 million individuals in the united states each of whom handles ground beef once per month this results in 12  109 contacts per year assuming that 10 of these individuals contact hand to mouth after handling ground beef this amounts to 12  108 incidents per year for e coli o157h7 using the median risk this would result in an estimate ranging from 0014 infections per year if all individuals washed their hands with soap following contact with ground beef to 07 infections per year if no handwashing is done this would equate to a 98 median risk reduction for handwashing compared with no handwashing if an abhs was used this would result in an estimate of 000005 infections per year if all individuals used abhs following contact with ground beef this would equate to a 999996 median risk reduction for use of abhs compared with handwashingthis study follows an earlier study by haas et al207 to calculate risks associated with hand-to-mouth transfer after diaper changing of a baby infected with shigella based on this model it was calculated that the probability of acquiring infection was between 24 of 100 and 91 of 100 for those who used handwashing with soap after changing diapers this was based on panel test data indicating a mean log reduction of s marcescens on hands because of handwashing of 256 the authors calculated that by using a hand hygiene formulation that increased the log reduction to 291 the infection risk would be reduced to between 15 of 100 and 90 of 100haas et al205 conclude that quantitative microbial and id risk models offer a useful tool to assess the relative extent to which different hygiene procedures can impact on id risks they concede however that although risk modeling represents a promising approach there are limitations to most models because of the multifactorial nature of infection transmission the dynamic environment in which transmission takes place and the paucity of data to specify model parametersin an earlier section we evaluated intervention study data to assess the strength of the causal link between hand hygiene and id transmission in this section we use these data to evaluate the effectiveness of handwashing as a hygiene measure and in relation to the effectiveness of using abhs as an adjunct or an alternative to handwashingdespite the methodologic limitations the collective weight of evidence from intervention and microbiologic studies described earlier suggests that handwashing with soap can have a significant impact in reducing the incidence of gi and rt infection the data however show that the health impact from handwashing promotion varies significantly according to the setting and outcome statistically significant reductions ranged from 48 to 57 for gi illness and 20 to 51 for rt illness although all studies were carried out in settings such as day care centers and schools we believe that the modes of transmission in these settings and the relative rates of transmission of rt and gi infections are likely to reflect those occurring in the homein 2004 meadows and le saux published a review of the effect of rinse-free hand sanitizers in elementary schools over a 20-year period208 they concluded however that the data were of poor quality and that more rigorous intervention trials are needed in a more recent study aiello et al examined the epidemiologic evidence for a relationship between waterless hand sanitizers and infections in the community setting over several decades154 in
table 18 we present the studies that specifically examined abhs only studies with an effect estimate and 95 ci are presented the type and content of the abhs varied across studies for example one study reported the use of a 60 isopropyl alcohol rinse and another study utilized an alcohol-based foam sanitizer however most studies used alcohol-based gels or other alcohol-based emollients the alcohol content included ethanol and 2-propanol at concentrations ranging from 60 to 90of the 8 intervention studies 7 were conducted in the united states 88 78 and 1 in finland 13 most were conducted in child day care centers elementary schools or universities 88 78 and one was conducted in the household 13 18 outcomes included gi-related illnessessymptoms andor upper rt-related illnessessymptoms examined as separate outcomes or in combination with other infection-related symptoms as part of a school absence-related definition of infectious-illness of the 8 studies 88 78 reported significant results for at least one age group or outcome the effect was stronger in younger compared with older age groups for studies providing age stratified datathe reduction in gi illness ranged from 0 to 59 for the 4 intervention studies that examined gi illnesses as separate outcomes209 210 211 215 of these all but one showed statistically significant reductions210 the study by uhari et al showed a significant reduction in gi illness only among children 3 years of age211 all but one of these studies was conducted in child care settings215 when evaluated separately reductions in gi illness appeared more robust compared with the findings for upper rt illnessfor upper rt illness the reduction in infectious illnesssymptoms ranged from 6 to 26 only 2 of the 5 studies 44 examining upper rt illness as a main outcome reported a statistically significant reduction uhari et al reported a 13 reduction in rt illnesses among children 3years of age but no significant effect in older children211 white et al reported a 20 reduction in upper rt illness among students using abhs in residence halls213 however this study suffered from several methodologic shortcomings including lack of control for clustered units no randomization no masking and no monitoring of product useall but one of the intervention studies included a hygiene education component but in 7 of these studies this was only provided in the intervention arm the level of education varied widely ranging from basic information on when to use the abhs ie after sneezing and coughing after use in the restroom before lunch to in-depth education programs214 and biweekly instructional material designed to educate families on hand hygiene and infection transmission215 in all studies abhs was promoted as a supplement to handwashing or as an alternative to handwashing when soap was unavailable and it is likely that the hygiene education would have had the effect of encouraging more frequent handwashing as well as use of abhs although almost all studies indicated that hygiene education combined with promotion of abhs can reduce the risks of gi or rt illness only 2 studies allowed any assessment of the independent effect of the abhs of these 2 studies the study by hammond et al186 did not provide any educational component to either arm and the study by morton and schultz214 provided education to both intervention and control arms both studies showed a significant reduction in illness-related absences 20 and 44 respectively but it is not clear whether the illnesses were predominantly gi or rt because these studies used a loose definition of absence-related illnessessandora et al215 was the only study carried out in the household setting and of all the studies reported the highest reduction for gi illness the trial involved 292 families with children enrolled in 26 child care centers intervention families received a supply of abhs and biweekly hand hygiene educational materials for 5 months control families received only materials promoting good nutrition a total of 252 gi illnesses occurred during the study 11 were secondary illnesses the secondary gi illness rate was significantly lower 59 in intervention families compared with control families see table 18 a total of 1802 rt illnesses occurred during the study 25 were secondary illnesses although rt illness rates were not significantly different between groups families with higher abhs usage had marginally lower rt illness rate than those with less usage 19 reduction sandora et al215 suggested that the difference may be due to heightened diligence associated with using abhs after a gi-related incident compared with an rt incident such as sneezingoverall based on relatively limited data available the results in table 18 suggest that the impact of abhs promotion as part of a hygiene education and promotion program in reducing the incidence of gi infections in young children is similar to that observed for promotion of handwashing with soap promotion of abhs in this manner also produced some reduction in the incidence of rt infections which was less than that associated with promotion of handwashing alone assessing whether there might be an added health benefit of using abhs above and beyond the effect of hygiene education is hampered by the fact that most studies used hygiene education and abhs in the intervention arm but did not provide an educational component to the control armseveral important methodologic issues were evident although more recent studies have improved designs and conduct in most studies either parents or school personnel provided information on id among children in the study populations in all but one study34 the parents participants or personnel monitoring and reporting infections were not masked as to their own or their childs intervention status although masking of participants and interviewers to the intervention status is important because it might influence reporting it is often difficult to conduct masked hygiene interventions and may not be ethical sandora et al determined that it was neither feasible nor ethical to mask subjects or interviewers because it is difficult to devise a formulation that could act as a placebo for abhs and using a placebo abhs product might endanger the control group via inadequate hand hygiene215
in many of the abhs studies especially the recent ones efforts were made to control for potential confounding factors however many of the studies did not collect information on baseline hand hygiene practices nor methods and frequency of cleaningdisinfecting soiledcontaminated environmental surfaces in homes as well as abhs use the studies also excluded participants who reported current abhs use in the home furthermore participants were asked to refrain from using abhs in settings outside the home these are all important design strategies minimizing bias associated with noncompliance or differential usage two of the 8 intervention studies failed to use systematic monitoring for hygiene practices such as frequency of hand-sanitizing episodes frequency of handwashing or duration of handwashing212 213 this is especially concerning because the study by sandora et al suggests that the quantity of abhs influences the risk of infection in a dose-response manner215 moreover if frequency of handwashing and abhs use is not recorded it is impossible to isolate the independent effects of abhs from that of handwashing on infection rates in these studies of abhs use surveillance measures included calculating use from monthly demand total amount supplied observation by research assistants participant report and reported use by primary caregivers in households186 209 212 214 215
although panel tests carried out under controlled conditions showed that handwashing can reduce the numbers of bacteria and some viruses on the hands by up to 2- to 3-log within 30 seconds to 1 minute in practice it is doubtful whether people wash their hands properly even for the prescribed period of 15 seconds to achieve this at present there is a paucity of data on the efficacy of handwashing in relation to how people actually wash their hands on a day-to-day basis both in the duration of handwashing and handwashing technique in most of the intervention studies described earlier no attempt was made to time handwashes or to determine residual levels of contamination on the hands after handwashing microbiologic data suggest that for some pathogens eg salmonella mechanical removal by handwashing alone is inefficient these data together with the results of in vivo panel testing of the effectiveness of handwashing and of abhs as described above question the efficacy of handwashing in community-based groups and suggest that more work is needed to determine the efficacy of hand hygiene procedures under conditions normally encountered in the home and how hand hygiene procedures could be improvedfor abhs in vivo and in vitro testing suggest that these formulations are highly effective against bacterial pathogens and can produce a 35-log reduction on hands within 30 seconds and 40- to 50-log reduction after a 1-minute application against a wide range of species including salmonella it is possible however that the potential for increased benefits against bacterial infections compared with handwashing may be offset by reduced efficacy against important nonenveloped viruses such as rotavirus some strains of rhinovirus and possibly also norovirus it has been argued that the higher impact of abhs interventions against gi compared with rt infections is due to the fact that rt infections are predominantly viral however because the intervention data indicate that handwashing also supports a stronger reduction in gi diseases compared with rt diseases this seems unlikely some studies suggest that to achieve satisfactory activity that includes all types of viruses higher concentrations up to 80 ethanol should be advised other studies suggest that the efficacy of abhs may be increased by increasing the volume of agent applied to the hands215
in formulating policies for hand hygiene it would be convenient to be able to define what represents a safe residual level of contamination on the hands after hand hygiene ie sufficient to prevent infection transmission but because the infectious dose varies from one species to another and is dependant on the immune status of the recipient this approach is untenable the qmra approach as outlined earlier in this review however demonstrates that strategies that produce an increase in the log reduction on hands from 2 to 3 to 4 are accompanied by a significant incremental reduction in the risk of infection in a given population and could thus be worthwhile this suggests that the health impact from promoting hand hygiene could be increased by developing and promoting procedures for use in the home and community that increase the log reduction of contamination on the hands this involves identifying products and procedures both soap-based and waterless products or wipes that achieve high levels of removal andor kill alone or in combination of the full range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and enveloped and nonenveloped viruses and that deliver hand hygiene under conditions that people are prepared to employ in their busy and mobile daily lives it also suggests that particularly for high-risk situations as outlined below there is advantage to be gained by promoting handwashing followed by use of abhs to increase the log reductionthe data presented in this review suggest that the favorable health impact from promoting hand hygiene could be further increased by getting people to practice hand hygiene not just more frequently but also at the right time a number of studies show the relatively poor understanding of the principles of hygiene that is present in the community this may be one of the factors responsible for the higher risk reductions observed in intervention studies of gi compared with rt infections for example knowledge regarding the need for handwashing after coughing or sneezing may not be as pervasive as knowledge about handwashing after defecation and it may be that people understand better when to wash their hands during food-associated activities but not for example while handling contaminated tissues although some intervention studies described in this review involved a component of education it was not possible to determine the extent to which hygiene education that enhanced peoples understanding of infection transmission also enhanced health outcomebecause visible soiling is an unreliable indicator of the presence of pathogens on the hands people are unlikely to wash their hands at the correct time unless they have been taught to do so or have some awareness of the chain of infection transmission in the home ie they are aware of when their hands may be contaminated whereas risks associated with food handling are largely confined to defined periods of time for rt and skin infections and person-to-person transmission of gi infection the risk is ongoing and involves a large proportion of our ongoing daily activities thus whereas it is possible for hand hygiene advice associated with food hygiene to be rule based this is not the case for other types of infections in the event of a flu pandemic the advice issued by the uk health protection agency216 to wash hands frequently is unlikely to be effective unless people have some idea of the times when their hands are likely to be contaminated with flu virusalthough current thinking about hygiene promotion tends toward a view that the most effective way to change behavior is by mass social marketing of single rule-based hygiene messages4 the data presented in this review suggest that the complexity and shifting nature of the id threat is such that a rule-based approach to hygiene is inadequate to meet current public health needs the need is for an approach founded on awareness of the chain of infection transmission and how it differs for different groups of infections hygiene education needs to be consistently incorporated as part of hand hygiene promotion programs if people are to properly understand the risks and adapt their behavior accordinglybased on the data presented in this review we propose that in promoting hand hygiene significant improvements in health impact could be achieved by giving better guidance to people first on how to choose the best methods for hand hygiene handwashing andor use of abhs based on the situation and showing them how to apply it properly and why this is important secondly it means stressing when it is important to apply hand hygiene ie what are the risk situations or critical control points at which hand hygiene needs to be appliedalthough the level of risk varies according to the occupants of the home eg presence of children pets ill people and their immune status based on the risk assessment approach as outlined earlier in this review the critical control points or situations in which hand hygiene is indicated are as followsafter using the toilet or disposing of human or animal fecesafter changing a babys diaper and disposing of the fecesimmediately after handling raw food eg chicken raw meatbefore preparing and handling cookedready-to-eat foodbefore eating food or feeding childrenbut alsoafter contact with contaminated surfaces eg rubbish bins cleaning cloths food contaminated surfacesafter handling pets and domestic animalsafter wiping or blowing the nose or sneezing into the handsafter handling soiled tissues self or others eg childrenafter contact with blood or body fluids eg vomit and othersbefore and after dressing woundsbefore giving care to an at-risk person andafter giving care to an infected person
in choosing the appropriate option for hand hygiene there are 3 possibilities either handwashing with soap use of abhs or other effective waterless-based sanitizers or handwashing followed by use of abhs a possible framework for informing appropriate choice according to the particular situation is outlined in
fig 4 this suggests that in situations in the home and community that are standard risk perhaps better described as situations not specifically regarded as high risk either handwashing or use of abhs may be chosen within this however there are factors that advise or in some cases dictate choice for example handwashing is only an option when there is access to soap and water whereas use of abhs is not an option when hands are heavily soiled although people are likely to choose handwashing in this situation prompted by the need to clean their hands as discussed previously there will always be situations in the home in which there is increased risk either because there is a known source of infection or someone who is at increased risk of becoming infected these situations are summarized in
table 20 these situations may relate to activities that are carried out routinely in the home such as handling of raw meat and poultry or involve household members such as pregnant women or young babies who are otherwise healthy but at increased risk of or from infection they also relate to nonroutine situations such as a person in the home who is infected with a cold or norovirus or other gi infections or to situations in which there is someone who is at increased risk of infection as a result of underlying illness immunosuppressive drug treatment or needing catheter or wound care although much of the health care carried out at home is done by trained caregivers increasingly there are situations in the home in which simple but risky actions are carried out by household members in all of these increased risk situations as outlined in table 20 it is suggested that handwashing followed by use of an abhs should be encouragedin persuading people to change behavior one of the key factors is removing barriers to action217 lack of convenient access to a sink is a significant barrier to compliance and time pressure is a barrier to getting people to wash their hands thoroughly a key benefit of abhs is that they offer the means to apply hand hygiene in situations in which there is limited or no access to a soap and water in home care situations abhs offer an alternative to handwashing in situations in which other pressures mitigate against finding the time to visit the bathroom for handwashing for example when caring for a baby in the nursery or a sick person they also offer a substitute for handwashing in out of home settings such as offices and public places such as public transport or animal exhibits at which access to soap and water is a particular problem and all of which offer frequent opportunities for hand transmission of infection promoting use of abhs has the potential to get people to undertake hand hygiene more frequently and at critical times in response to concerns about the possibility of a flu pandemic the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of abhs for use as an alternative to handwashing218 in the event of a flu pandemic it seems particularly important to encourage people to adopt good hand hygiene in public places in health care settings links between use of abhs and increased hand hygiene compliance and reduced infection rates has been observed219 in applying the framework outlined in fig 4 our intention is that this should not be regarded as an either handwashing or abhs situation the fundamental aim should be to encourage more people to undertake hand hygiene procedures wherever possible at critical timesin view of the fact that hands are part of a complex system of infection transmission pathways it must also be considered whether hand hygiene can or should be promoted in isolation because people are reluctant to comply with handwashing together with the microbiologic data showing the potential for transfer via hand and food contact surfaces and cloths to hands which increase as the frequency occurrence of contamination of these surfaces increases it would seem that to maximize the health impact from hand hygiene promotion it should be combined with promotion of hygiene in general including hygienic cleaning of critical surfaces if nothing else this could raise awareness that hand contamination can arise from touching apparently clean surfaces we are concerned that emphasis on handwashing alone without putting it within the context of other aspects of hygiene is encouraging the perception that handwashing is all that is required ie if you wash your hands you wont get sickthe aim of this report has been to review the evidence base for hand hygiene and develop a practical framework from it for promoting an effective approach to hand hygiene in home and community settings provision of detailed guidelines for hand hygiene is outside the scope of this review for such guidelines the reader is referred to the ifh guidelines and training resource on home hygiene as part of its work in promoting home hygiene the ifh has produced guidelines for prevention of infection and cross infection in the domestic environment and recommendations for selection of suitable hygiene procedures for use in the domestic environment220 221 these documents are based on the concept of a risk-based approach and give detailed guidance on hand hygiene in the context of all aspects of home hygiene including food hygiene general hygiene personal hygiene care of pets and others most recently the ifh has also produced a teachingself-learning resource on home hygiene222 this is based on the ifh guidelines and recommendations but is designed to present home hygiene theory and practice in simple practical language that can be understood by those with relative little infection control training or backgroundinfectious diseases circulating in the community remain a significant concern both in developed and developing countries the global burden of id accounts for over 13 million deaths annually but whereas the majority of deaths occurs in the developing world infection also causes approximately 4 of deaths in developed countries223 although mortality from id has declined in the developed world trends in morbidity suggest a change in the pattern of id rather than declining rates several demographic environmental and health care trends as reviewed in this report are combining to make it likely that the threat of id will increase in coming years rather than decline one such factor is the rising proportion of the population in the community who are more vulnerable to infection an important part of current european and us health policy is commitment to shorter hospital stays a key requirement is to ensure that the increased health provision at home is not accompanied by an increase in id risks otherwise the cost savings gained by care in the community are likely to be overridden by costs of rehospitalization even for the healthy community id represents a significant economic burden because of absence from work and school and added health care costs secondary infections can produce complications and some infections may be associated with the development of diseases such as cancer or other chronic conditions which can manifest at a later date those responsible for ensuring that the public are protected from infection in health care facilities are now realizing that their ability to manage the problem is hampered by spread of pathogens such as mrsa c difficile and norovirus in the community and the home and the number of infected people or carriers who come into their facilities and are looking for ways to address this by engaging the public to adopt more rigorous standards of hygieneone of the things that is apparent from newly emerging data and that is reflected in this review is the extent to which common infections circulating in the community are hygiene related this suggests in turn that hygiene promotion could have a significant benefit in terms of improved public health and well-being in particular the data highlight the extent to which viruses norovirus rotavirus rhinovirus influenza and other viruses are responsible for hygiene-related diseases now circulating in the communitythe main conclusions from this review are as followsid circulating in the home and community is a serious public health problem in the developed as well as the developing worldgood hygiene practice is key to reducing the burden of id in the home and communityhand hygiene is a key component of good hygiene practice in the home and community and can produce significant benefits in terms of reducing the incidence of infection most particularly for gastrointestinal infections but also for respiratory tract and skin infectionsdecontamination of hands can be carried out either by handwashing with soap or by the use of waterless hand sanitizers which achieve a log reduction in bacterial and viral contamination on hands by the removal of contamination or by killing the organisms in situ the health impact of hand hygiene within a given community can be increased by using products and procedures either alone or in sequence that maximize the log reduction of both bacteria and viruses on handsthe impact of hand hygiene in reducing id risks could be increased by convincing people to apply hand hygiene procedures correctly eg wash their hands correctly and at the correct timeto optimize health benefits promotion of hand hygiene must be accompanied by hygiene education and should also involve promotion of other aspects of hygiene for example surface and cloth hygiene
this report highlights a number of areas in which additional data are neededfurther studies are needed to characterize the frequency of and factors associated with id transmission in noninstitutional settings such as the homefurther studies are needed to assess the relative efficacy of hand hygiene procedures in reducing hand contamination handwashing with soap and use of abhs involving different contactapplicationrinsing times and others this includes the following 1 in vivo panel tests to determine the reduction in bacteria and viruses on hands under controlled conditions committee european normalisation or astm tests now provide standard test models for comparing the efficacy of handwashing with the use of waterless hand sanitizer products under defined conditions they provide an economic approach relative to intervention studies that can be used alone or in combination with qmra to inform hygiene policy andor the design of intervention studies 2 field studies to determine log reduction in counts on hands in relation to how people actually wash their hands or apply abhs in their homesadditional data are needed to understand how when and why people practice hand hygiene at home and how this relates to their understanding of id transmission and risksintervention studies are needed to determine the health impact of hand hygiene promotion with hygiene education compared with hygiene promotion without education this should also include understanding how hand hygiene combines with surface hygiene to influence health outcomeintervention studies are needed to determine the potential for an increase in health impact from promoting use of abhs in conjunction with handwashing ie handwashing followed by use of abhs or as a supplement to handwashing in situations in which access to water is limited compared with the promotion of handwashing alone
along with social distancing handwashing has been repeatedly advised as a strategy for controlling the spread of sars-cov-2 the coronavirus behind the covid-19 pandemic12 a new study in environmental health perspectives reports that billions of people lack access to the handwashing resources needed for protection against this and other viruses3 the most acute shortages are in sub-saharan africa south asia and the caribbean according to study leader michael brauer a professor at the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington and the university of british columbias school of population and public health in vancouverhandwashing is known to disrupt the transmission of respiratory diseases4 soap molecules disrupt sars-cov-2s outer lipid membrane killing the microbe running water then flushes away the viral fragments5 for many people handwashing is a routine activity that is taken for granted but thats often not the case for people in low-income countries brauer sayseven some populations in wealthier countries lack access to handwashing for instance almost 19 of the occupied dwellings on the navajo nation lack complete plumbing facilities according to the latest data from the american community survey6 as of 24 june 2020 the navajo nation which occupies more than 17 million acres across arizona utah and new mexico had the highest covid-19 rates in the united states with 347 deaths and approximately 4137 cases per 100000 people7for the current study brauers team set out to estimate how many people in the world have access to handwashing facilities with soap and water they reviewed surveys conducted between 1990 and 2019 at 1062 locations in 88 countries many of the 153 surveys they assessed were observational meaning that investigators had visited households and seen handwashing stations for themselveswhere observational data were lacking the team predicted access to handwashing stations based on surveys that documented the presence of piped water they also considered demographic surrogates that correlate with access to handwashing such as per capita income and education levels households were weighted according to the number of inhabitants to estimate access at the individual levelbased on these analyses the investigators estimated that approximately 2 billion people globally lacked handwashing access in 2019 which is a stunning number and a call to action says stephen luby a professor of infectious disease and geography at stanford university who was not involved in the study however as high as it is that number may actually be quite conservativethe joint monitoring program for water supply sanitation and hygiene put the estimate at just over 3 billion people in 20178the brauer teams model which also estimated long-term trends over the 30-year study period did show expansion of access in some locations this reflects progress toward improving sanitation and reducing childhood mortality brauer says yet the study showed access is still limited overall particularly among rural populations and informal urban slums in the developing world modeling suggested that more than half the population in the provinces of addis ababa ethiopia and nairobi kenya lack access to handwashing facilitiesshould the covid-19 pandemic coincide with water shortages in such areas the study authors wrote access will be further restricted and will disproportionately harm those who can least afford to pay for water hand sanitizers may provide a temporary alternative and evidence from prior epidemics shows they can slow viral transmission9 however the potential toxicity and flammability of alcohol-based sanitizers10 plus the cost of these products11 have been cited as barriers to their usesoap and water offer more equitable and lasting protection before a vaccine for sars-cov-2 becomes available and where theres too much crowding for social distancing providing access to water and soap in slums and low-income communities can save lives says lubybrauer says that approach could pay long-term dividends even after the covid-19 pandemic subsides we should think of the current crisis as an opportunity to address longstanding problems with limited access to handwashing that also impact on diarrheal infections and pneumonia he says we can implement a patchwork of temporary solutions for now such as bringing in water tanker trucks and making sure people have isopropyl alcohol and hand sanitizer but our hope is that we will also implement strategies that are more sustainablecoronavirus disease also known as covid-19 continues to spread throughout the world in turkey the first case was diagnosed on march 11 2020 a date somewhat later than other european countries as of 28 april 114 653 people have been diagnosed as covid-19 positive and 2992 people have lost their lives about 1621 patients have been treated in an intensive care unit icu the mortality rate due to covid-19 was 26 in the country ministry of health 2020 in turkey which has a strong health system most hospitals have been turned into pandemic hospitals elective procedures have been postponed and doctors have been reassigned to treat covid-19 the first case was detected late due to the strict supervision of people who came from abroad a policy was quickly established for covid-19 treatment the icu bed number was approximately 32 000 a figure deemed sufficient for the countrys needs for these reasons there was no period when resources were exhausted or when health services could not be offered due to covid-19 even in istanbul where the virus was most intense the occupancy rate for icus was 595 while the maximum bed occupancy rate was 502 by april 10 habertrk 2020  moreover in recent days there has been a decrease in the number of new cases bbc turkish 2020 of course behind this success was not only the intrinsic strength of the health system but also the strict changes to everyday life necessitated by the pandemica scientific committee was set up to establish covid-19 precautions in turkey schools and universities were closed on march 12 the day after the first case was reported online education for students was quickly put in place on march 13 transportation restrictions including the closing of borders and halting of flights began and quarantine measures for people returning from other countries were applied two days later public places such as restaurants cafes bars libraries and places of worship were closed on march 21 10 days after the initial case a curfew was imposed on people over the age of 65 and those suffering from chronic illnesses on april 3 a partial curfew was extended to cover those under the age of 20 and it became mandatory for all citizens to wear masks in public places finally on april 11 a general curfew was announced covering everyone at weekends this practice will continue for the foreseeable future anadolu agency 2020 what measures are taken beyond that are as yet unknown however it is an inescapable fact that such drastic change in peoples lives will have a significant effect on the mental health of the general populationwhen the virus started in china the public thought that it would be limited to china as the virus spread to other countries there were claims on social media that the virus would not come to turkey and that even if it did there would be no transmission due to genetics sabah 2020 these misguided claims prevented people from preparing adequately for the effects of the virus moreover the rapid spread of the virus in europe began to cause anxiety and shopping for cleaning supplies and basic foodstuffs quickly increased with the outbreak of the virus in the country extreme scenes were witnessed in pharmacies and grocery stores as an air of panic took hold protective face masks medicines food supplements and cleaning supplies were all well stocked and stores never ran out of necessary supplies again due to excessive speculation on social media excessive anxiety took hold among the general publicbefore the outbreak turkey had traditionally high standards of hygiene practices the high tendency to hand wash among people was both cultural and religious in origin the cultural behaviors of turks on cleaning date back to the anatolian seljuk and ottoman periods the pursuit of cleanliness which was prioritized by islam led to the reputation of turkish baths disli  ozcan 2014 besides the historical curative and sanitizing effects of vinegar were introduced during periods of plague and epidemics bulmu 2012 the plague treatment included prescriptions using vinegar in ottomans great attention was taken to the use of vinegar in cleaning traditionally vinegar was declared a piece of cleaning equipment everything from outside the house was kept in water with vinegar or was taken home after waiting for one day on the balcony as a precaution as a disinfectant cologne kolonya one of turkeys national symbols was in great demand european cologne was first used in the ottoman empire during the reign of ii abdulhamid 18701909 had been a part of daily cultural life with its sanitizing and perfume features yentrk  yentrk 2001 the cologne in every turkish home was served as a tradition to cool guests since cologne contains 70 alcohol an accepted virus-killing agent it was stocked in every home bbc travel 2020 with the recommendation of the world health organization that the use of masks should only be used to prevent the ill person from infecting others masks have become an indispensable part of life in turkey some people even began to sew their own masks this problem was solved when the government began distributing free five masks per week to each person it also became unacceptable for people to enter indoor spaces without a maskthe most encouraging part of this process was the public applause to support frontline health workers from balconies every evening at 2100 this communal expression of support made healthcare workers extremely proud of their profession while all other employees were given the message stay home the applause was a great boost during this period when healthcare professionals had no choice but to work hard in demanding conditions health workers also emphasized the importance of social isolation by sending posts urging the public to stay at home over time this practice has evolved such that 2100 now marks a time of celebration and fun in every homeduring the lockdown people began to experience tension in their inter-personal relationships due to increased anxiety anecdotally a range of different behaviors have been reported as people try to adapt to the new conditions such as communication problems between spouses tension between parents and children increased irritability and anger outbursts depressive and anxious mood excessive use of social media and binge eating with a lack of opportunities to engage in social activities outside the home families have been forced to spend more time enclosed leading to increased tension and acrimony in the home on the other hand the fear of parents of infecting their children with covid-19 has had negative effects on them leading them to take extra precautions with their children children were kept inside often against their wishes and were not able to communicate with their friends and relatives children were no longer given access to their typical social support networksafter the closure of the schools children could not envisage the full extent of the situation and saw it as a holiday from school and an opportunity to spend more time with their families however fears began to emerge that covid-19 could kill their parents or close relatives in addition parents behaved differently and more inconsistently than usual due to elevated stress levels invoking confusion among the children who expected more attention from them mental health professionals recognizing the fraught nature of the new conditions developed materials for parents and their children and made them available free of charge these psychoeducation materials were mostly made up of drawings stories and cartoons furthermore they broadcasted live on social media in an effort to prevent misinformation from less reliable sources helping people to solve these problems as well as offering advice on how they should continue their lives under lockdown increases in similar problems created a greater demand for online therapy in order to avoid people having to attend hospital in person telepsychiatry services were offered to people who required such interventionthe psychological toll on frontline healthcare workers directly exposed to the burden of the pandemic became even more imperative on returning home after work they could not allow their children give them a loving hug and had a difficult time explaining to them why they could not do so medimagazin 2020 additionally after encountering very sick patients healthcare workers also experienced an acute stress response at home easily becoming angry emotional and behaving erratically sleeping and eating patterns also became significantly disturbed the possibility of future post-traumatic stress disorder is also something that healthcare workers must contend withthe effect of the pandemic on children has also been acute terrified of covid-19 infecting their family and the possibility of their parents dying children acted out and began exhibiting more oppositional behaviors again mental health professionals recognized the difficulties being faced in families first offering their expertise and support to healthcare workers and their children following this initiative both psychiatrists and psychologists began to offer therapy free of charge allowing healthcare professionals only to make a telephone appointment the ministry of health has also developed unique software to allow mental health professionals to provide support to healthcare workers and their children ministry of health health services general directorate 2020 moreover professional associations have developed a fairy tale reading project in order to support children celebrities and relatives of children who were not physically in contact with their parents were asked to read and record fairy tales for the children of healthcare professionals the children started to listen to these tales every evening before going to bed so they could feel the support of the people they wanted to hug and embrace turkey association for child and adolescent psychiatry 2020one of the biggest pandemics in the history of turkey was the cholera pandemic first seen in 1822 and which continued in different cities from time to time until 1910 during the rule of the ottoman empire in order to prevent the spread of cholera the ottomans set up teams to oversee cleanliness in cities by keeping hygiene at the forefront they distributed brochures to inform the public about the disease and the necessary precautions to prevent its spread clerics imams preached about cholera to the community in mosques provincial borders were closed and those wishing to enter cities were quarantined for at least three days gke 2001 ylmaz 2017 bolaos 2019 in this period when modern psychiatry was not yet developed the cholera epidemic was brought to an end after the necessary precautions were taken and treatments were applied however sufficient information about the psychiatric sequelae arising from this pandemic was not recorded in the literaturein the current crisis although taking similar measures to the ottomans the faster and more effectively they are imposed has resulted in reducing the local spread of the virus with the advent of globalization not only has covid-19 spread faster than all previous diseases but covid-19 anxiety has also infected the mental state of populations all over the world although coronavirus-related diseases will end soon it is predicted that serious psychiatric disorders will be a lasting legacy of the pandemic modern psychiatry must address the psychiatry of pandemics as a matter of urgencytherapy services in child psychiatry and in adult psychiatry during the present crisis have been temporarily postponed while inpatient and outpatient services continue with greatly reduced numbers the reasons for this reduction were that many people avoided hospitals to reduce transmission and a number of mental health professionals were reassigned to work in outpatient covid-19 clinics and services our colleagues who experienced great panic at the beginning of the crisis due to the onerous responsibility brought on by the state of emergency have been proud to serve covid-19 patients by adapting to the process over time and taking the necessary protection measures at the end of this pandemic and beyond mental health services will be in great demand by giving priority to these services it will be essential to provide psychiatric support to all of those in need especially to healthcare professionals working on the frontline for this to happen it is essential to ensure the continuity of the government institutions and voluntary initiatives already established despite the many negative effects of covid-19 it has led to a greater unity of purpose between healthcare professionals and the general public given the risks to healthcare professionals own health at this time a huge debt of gratitude is owed to the healthcare professionals working on the front line during this hugely challenging periodone of the themes permeating this volume which explains partly the problems of the african health care system is that corruption plays a major harmful role in africa and not the lack of financial resources to fix it writing on the failure of primary health care in nigeria omar massoud has found indeed that things are not done well not because of the lack of resources and says 2012 21the ineffectiveness of local government in nigeria to provide basic services to local communities has been mainly attributed to the lack of sufficient financial resources financial inadequacy we believe is not a key constraint or obstacle to effective service delivery this is because although local governments do not receive as much both in terms of absolute revenues per capita and in terms of the total share of public expenditures vis--vis the state and federal governments their functional responsibilities are correspondingly limited
the major culprit in the debacle is lack of transparency accountability and integrity of the personnel responsible for health and the absence of a working relationship with the community and traditional neighborhood organizations to know what the needs might be and how they can be addressed the corrupt ways at african hospitals clinics health centers and other health facilities is widely known not only among the governmental and ministerial authorities but also by the people seeking treatment themselves and is a subject of daily conversation lack of accountability in the use and disappearance of the patrimonial resources and some of the practices by doctors and auxiliaries make a mockery of the system that spends millions of dollars without enforcement against abuses and with virtually no one being incarcerated when irregularities are foundthe drawback over corruption which means in most peoples minds illegal or unethical appropriation of public or donor private funds also called official thievery or unauthorized use of public property such as vehicles and gasoline or the conscious contravening of regulations or laws for personal gain or convenience is that accurate data on expenses are difficult to find and record as they are often based on hearsay suspicion and innuendo and lack the actual information on the scope and method of transaction when it occurs invariably it is mired in secrecy especially at the high levels of authority where great amounts of funds are channeled to a person a president a government minister or a group of individuals who swear secrecy what is frequently easy to detect and record are the hundreds of daily petty corruptive practices one encounters on the road on the part of the police a government office where lower and higher level officials are required to dispense an original official document such as a visa to citizens quick and effective treatment of a patient unfairly ahead of others at a hospital hiring at a government establishment or payment of funds to get a favor often dubbed bribery even though the latter may not involve money but sex false testimony and other subtle demands political corruption usually refers to paying people secretly to vote for a certain party or candidate rigging or stealing an election through unfair and non-transparent practices that may alter the results of a political process thus the invisible hand as the shady transactions agents are known can be found in every sector of lifeat times however kleptomaniacs of government and national property have been caught red handed in africa corruption is a daily practice and sometimes involves millions of dollars there have been instances for example where some portion of the public budget a percentage of international donations or investment funds have gone to government officials or researcherssay 10 of 300 millionto facilitate approval by the local authorities very rarely though have such thieves been denounced and imprisoned transparency international defines corruption as the abuse of public resources for private gain studies have been conducted on corruption especially in the developing world and the opinion of the experts is not too disparate in their view of it as a detrimental practice to everyone involved mavuto kalulu has provided a summary of the major findings of the studies conducted on the subject which we briefly note here mauros 1995 study for example found that corruption slows and stifles economic growth by lowering national or private investment in his research mauro showed that corruption has a negative and significant relationship with human capital measured by the average schooling years in the population over age 25 kalulu 2015 while tanzi and davoodi 2001 claimed that corruption is detrimental to the quality of public investments gupta et al 2001 in one of the few studies focusing on its impact on the quality of health care services conclude that child mortality rates in highly corrupt countries are about one-third higher than in the less corrupt countries kalulu 2014yet interestingly even though other studies have shown the negative impact of corruption on the poor and its immoral deprivation of other peoples rights and livelihood there are veiled expert defenders of corruption out there the well known samuel huntington 1968 seems to defend corruption and bribery as he sees it as a way of breaking the red tape barriers of highly centralized bureaucracies and making the delivery of services efficient and rapid another scholar ft liu 1985 defended the proposition that corruptive practices often reduce the time one spends on queues finally some view corruption as beneficial by stressing the key economic assumption that self-interest enhances prosperity because competition ensures that a product is purchased by those who value it the most thus firms that are willing to pay more in bribes are awarded contracts this sounds like a twisted way of looking at unethical transactions kalulu 2014 511 because one wrong immoral or unethical behavior cannot justify the ends even if its results might benefit certain people just like when the benevolent bank bandit who distributes all the money robbed from the banks to the poorstill we agree that he needs to be incarcerated or proportionately punished the corrupt practices in cameroon hospitals for example which are well known and have become partly responsible for lack of appropriate care for the cameroonian citizens especially the poor and the illiterate are highlighted by cameroonian scholar victor bayemi in his study of the two main hospitals lanquintinie and deido in doula cameroon where there was one doctor per 7023 people one nurse for every 1784 people and one pharmacy for 5016 inhabitants some decades ago in 1998 and 1999 consecutively cameroon was classified by transparency international as being among the most corrupt countries in the world with unbelievable inequities where the poor do not have access to basic health services and the care provided is one of the worse in quality bayemi 2008 34 these conditions worsened after the government reduced doctors salary calling them a tripolar corrupt organization bayemi classifies health care facilities in douala into public hospitals private hospitals and informal health centers corrupt practices he says can be found in every sector related to the hospitals be it in radiology testing laboratories pharmacy screening medicine purchase and consultationsat the hospitals for example the crooked doctors present any reason to charge extra for the treatment or consultation eg dysfunctional equipment that needs repairing and may demand further payment desperate the patient cannot but comply and pays the fee under the table if not he may have to wait for days or discouraged by the delay simply give up and leave in the lab and radiology it is the same story equipment is not working or a film or a reactor is needed the doctor claims and at the end the patient will have to pay 2008 even though the test is supposed to be free at the pharmacy the practice is for the pharmacist to sell the samples he is supposed to provide free to customers these are designed for testing or advertisement during consultations some doctors falsify the results of the diagnosis and ask the patient to buy and write prescriptions that benefit them and not the patients doctors might write prescriptions for the free medicine they have in their possession and make a profit out of it in many cases the doctors personally ask for a sum of money before they can treat the patient beyond what the patient must pay officially to the hospitalother times the doctor does not ask whether the patent has paid the official fee and may simply ask for a certain amount what schleifer and vishny have called thievery with corruption or corruption with thievery bayemi 2008 3738 frequently the doctor receives the patient at his informal health center which is usually his house or someone elses residence and might force him or her to pay the sum to the proprietor because the latter does not have a license to open the center in other words almost anywhere in africa the doctor is expected to be at the public facility during business hours but he often practices on weekends and evenings at his own private clinic perhaps located in his home attending on a fee-for-service basis to make more money from his services spielberg and adams 2011 14 as john ngosong morfaw puts it this means the public sector ends up subsidizing unofficially private practice morfaw 2008 249often the doctor works at the informal center when he is expected to be at the public hospital where he is officially employed his house becomes a place where people come informally and pay him whatever amount of fee he asks for here he may be assisted by a nurse or even by a relative of the patient he also works at his private office or at a private hospital he may leave his public service for several hours to attend the patients at the private establishment no matter what goes on the person that is managing the business is the doctor the doctor may also refer the patients to his private facility or to the informal center and collects all the proceeds thereof as proof of corruptive practices at the public hospital the extra compensation he forces the patients to pay is not recorded by the official treasurer this results in confusion in the minds of the patients and the treasurer bayemi explains all informal and formal office payments to the doctor carry no receipts the doctor is always trying to find a way of making more money from the patients making it appear legitimate thus creating another ethical confusion between corruption with thievery and thievery with corruption obviously the person that suffers from all the deceitful machinations is the patient especially the poor and the public hospital the result is that the health facilities which are supposed to be free or cheaper for the patients become more expensive forcing many to try to receive treatment at private hospitals and the informal centers as a result bayemi saysdans la mesure o la corruption suscite laccroissement des prix des soins mdicaux elle empche  lhpital public daccomplir sa mission qui consiste  faciliter laccess de la majorit des patients de la population aux soins de plus cette corruption interfre sur la confiance des patients vis--vis des hpitaux publics et la crdibilit du systme doffre public des soins dans le but damliorer la sant des populations de douala il est ncessaire dengager une rflexion profonde pour combattre lorganisation hospitalire de la corruption a douala bayemi 2008 42
in other words the doctors play all kinds of schemes of thievery and corruption to make money out of vulnerable people who have no way but to pay or leave or go to the doctors private or informal center which often works in collusion with the pharmacies the public hospital becomes in a true sense the recruiting ground for the doctors private practice can one find more despicable unethical behavior than the one witnessed at some of the hospitals in africa one other consequence of the corrupt practices is peoples distrust of the public hospitals it is also common in cameroon hospitals that the doctor will hire hustlers or brokers who stay around the entrance to the hospital throughout the day and ask the patient which doctor they would like to see with a fee paid to the broker which is split with the physician the patient is able to see the doctor quickly bypassing other patients who might have been waiting for hours people know this but no one has the courage to denounce the physician involved for fear of retaliation those who refuse to pay may be waiting indefinitelyfinally we might say that once trust in the leadership is lost nothing significant can be accomplished commenting on the leadership crisis in africa and using the recent ebola virus outbreak in west-central africa remy adenoma wrote in the guardian in september 2014 that trust is in short supply in africa today the reason why people refused to believe what the leaders including their own presidents were telling them about the epidemic which they considered to be a hoax in nigeria for example despite promises of an infusion of millions of dollars to treat the sick and pay the daily wages of the health care givers nurses and doctors people took the leaders words as a bunch of lies as adenoma points out given that the government is still owing medical personnel overdue allowances it seems unwilling to pay so people fear risking their lives with no back up adenoma 2014 2 the mistrust and cynicism he says is not caused by the actions of the politicians alone but of virtually all strangers citizens or not who are said to rob and steal the property of some and kidnap others policemen do not seem to care about enforcing the laws and are constantly seeking bribes to perform their duties while many government officials embezzle state funds at all cost for themselves and their families adenoma concludes by notingthe worst legacy of the current crop of crooked african rulers is not the poor infrastructure the lack of proper healthcare or even corruption it is the seed of doubt and mistrust that their actions have sown in peoples minds road and highways can be built in the space of a few years and ebola outbreak will most likely be curbed within a few months but the deep mistrust and cynicism pervasive in many african societies will continue to impede progress on the continent for decades to come adenoma 2014 3
adenoma is quick to point out however that corruption is not unique to africa it occurs in the western world and other parts of the globe as well but not in the magnitude or the obvious and widely known level of corrupt behavior as on the african continent people in other parts of the world know that when there is a serious crisis they can count on their government to protect them not in africa says adenoma adenoma certainly has a point but cynicism and distrust to this author are not only based on corruption and lack of follow-up on the promises conditions that have created a leadership crisis especially in health in africa more important is the apparent lack of commitment to the welfare of the people especially in health the lack of clear priorities that place citizens at center-stage the lack of vision of the future and a sense of entitlement among our leaders the lack of investment of resources the prevailing sense of utter powerlessness among the african people and the blatant misuse of the national treasuryas is the case in angola equatorial guinea gabon nigeria chad and liberia resources are siphoned daily on behalf of the leaders their families relatives friends fellow kin and their crony supporters who may not even realize what is going on unfortunately when they assume political responsibility leaders seem not to realize that their position is a sacred trust and a privilege and not an entitlement or a birth right in his short but brilliant chapter on the poverty of health politics in africa are governments doing enough binna innocent hunan writing from his own living experience on the continent first refutes david baileys insinuation that corruption in developing countries is not necessarily antipathetic to the development of modern economic and social systems that corruption serves in part at least a beneficial function in developing societies 1966 719 he then mercilessly concludes by laying bare the unclothed emperors of africa calling their governance pathologic one that breeds only pain for the african people then he goes on to note that his chaptersituates the question of african ill-health in social terms and insists that this has arisen as a result of leadership proclivities to pursue parochial interests disguised as the collective good consequently policies have had to be tailored to suit leadership interests rather than focus on easing the pains of the downtrodden masses it pontificates that orchestrated wars and official thievery can only contribute to the problems of african people mired in structural dependence the need for positive in africa is strong leadership which is not only seen but expresses genuine concerns in acting to remove africa and its people from these crippling problems of war and conflict power economics de-industrialization squalor and disease the new dawn may well begin to save africans of such odd epithets as predatory prebendal parasitickleptocratic venal or vampire state ihuna 2008 312
ihuna views africas leadership as laced with corruption and mismanagement straddling economies in collapse and indebted mired in wars that have decimated populations where poverty is entrenched through increasing denial of opportunities as happens in the realm of educational attainment with a high profile of unemployed among the employable youth suffering from economic crisis africa cannot be saved from either rural or urban anarchy as these become ready tools for mischief and mayhem claire wendland notes the same problems in malawi medical schools even though they are not related directly to private practice which anger the medical students who focus their conversations on the waste of funds resulting from corrupt practices continuing to create a wave of unrest due to official corruption these crooked financial practices wendland noticed not only diverted resources away from the health sector but also could divert resources within the health sector toward certain favored constituencies or patients there were cases including where an mp hoarded medications and had his relatives sell the hospitals scarce resources in the public market and even though complaints were formally leveled against him but the involved doctor who was posted in the rural area as a district officer was not punished wendland 2010 141141 another expert notes that the hospitals and health facilities often do not have the workforce needed or the latter may be reserved just for the elite as niang notes where public control of the public structures does not exist that is there is no accountability to the people resources reserved for the hospitals are constantly reduced or reserved for the powerful and the wealthy and investment in hygiene is never considered to be a priority niang 2008 29 one should then rightly ask quo vadis africa cameroon is just an example but corrupt practices in the health sector are widespread in africa and successful because they focus mainly on the sick the illiterate the poor the disadvantaged the disabled and ethnic minorities who are the most vulnerable citizens in the countrywe cannot end a discussion of global health without mentioning one of the fastest growing health care businesses in the world medical tourism which gained added significance during the mid-2000s medical tourism has been described as a new global economy in which technology is erasing geographical boundaries and companies are taking advantage of the lower costs and greater efficiency they can find abroad thomas friedman 2005 it means traveling across continents to get the best medical treatment possible as perceived by the patients at the most affordable price the aging baby boomers and therefore the growing number of the elderly who are more prone to ill health have been forced to travel to such places as india singapore thailand turkey and even to eastern european countries the movement has also included people from the industrialized countries who are so proud at least in public of their own health care systems they too are looking for treatment bargains in the developing world unfortunately in africa only south africa with its tourist packages has been able to attract this wave of medical tourists in sum medical tourists are not necessarily seeking the lowest cost but quality treatment of their ills along with short waiting periods to satisfy those needs that are hard to meet at home unavailable procedures new and old health products as well as privacy opportunities for vacation and relaxing spots away from homein 2007 for example some 270000 americans sought medical treatment abroad it is estimated that 90 of medical tourists go to the us canada great britain western europe australia and the middle east here and even in the developing countries india being the best example medical tourists are able to get transplants dental surgery rare and cheaper medications more affordable insurance coverage and procedures not allowed or unavailable in their countries stolley and watson 2012 10 india is the most sought-after destination since medical establishments there are viewed as technologically advanced and cheaper and perform the most sophisticated operations with little interference from the government however despite the increase in the search for treatment abroad the medical tourist movement raises several questions since it is an intrinsic part of globalization the questions most relevant refer to its impact on the poor in the receiving countries and on the fact that in the end medical tourism favors the rich from the originating countries who are able to fly or drive and pay for the treatment sought such conditions would therefore tend to increase the worlds inequalities and health disparities in addition possibly problematic is the impact of this type of globalization on the local culture and the issues of privacy liability and ethics in healthoverall as illustrated by such experts as neil lunt and russell minion 2014 medical tourism even though it may alleviate the worlds health misery presents several problems of its own which governments and health systems are grappling with these include who is actually travelling and how many and where are they going what is actually the purpose of the trip that is what is the nature of the disease physical or mental disorder how successful have the clinical treatments been over the years have there been any follow-ups on adherence resulting complications lapses of safety side effects infections what is the quality of the health care provided all these questions need further assessment and interdisciplinary studies unfortunately it has been difficult to gather data to evaluate this fast growing health industry since most of the journeys and treatments are private more questions what have been the costs associated with it which governments and health care institutions both in the originating and receiving countries benefit or lose does medical tourism increase the quality of domestic health care does it tend to increase or decrease access to health to the poor on both ends is the phenomenon contributing to the diffusion of new technology for all or just for the rich is there much regard for medical ethics does this movement contribute to the commercialization of medicine how does one take it seriously when medical miracles are being touted by both the patient and the receiving medical institution and the country can medical tourism be monitored assessed and evaluated for quality of product out of the information provided by the patients or intermediaries who insures and how are the medical tourists insured and is there a major insurer in case things go wrong only time will provide the answers to these questions yet if medical tourism is to become the health care business of the future governments and health systems throughout the globe must be concerned and establish clear guidelines that are internationally approved see lunt and mannion 2014 155157 the answers are not yet known but they are important especially when the international community except the us believes that health is the right of all peoplethe issue of brain drain in africa noted earlier is serious in fact notwithstanding the fact that 24 of the global disease burden occurs in africa the continents share of the workforce is only 3 and has the following infamous distinction worldwide of the 57 countries that have a severe shortage of the workforce 36 are found here worse sub-saharan africa home to some 900 million people is only training some 6000 doctors yearly similar to oecd countries where the population is only 60 million better said sub-saharan africa is besieged by widespread shortages mal-distribution and poor working conditions omasiva 2014 1 the most recent statistics show that between 25 and 50 of african-born physicians choose to practice abroad particularly in the us where the ratio between doctor and population is 1 to 500 experts estimate that one-fifth of physicians and one-tenth of nurses born and trained in africa migrate to the western world the us the uk and canada mozambique and angola are said to have more doctors abroad than at home see our africa 2013the international organization for migration iom noted in 2005 that annually some 23000 health professionals leave africa and that from 1993 to 2002 ghana lost 60 physicians 410 pharmacists 87 laboratory technicians and 11325 nurses in 2002 alone the number of health professionals leaving ghana included 70 doctors 77 pharmacists and 214 nurses cooper and kirton 2013 6 listed as the 10 countries with most desperate workforce needs in africa are chad burundi ethiopia tanzania somalia liberia mozambique sierra leone malawi and niger where the ratio of doctor to population ranges between 1 to 30000 and 1 to 600000 the who estimates that in africa the threshold for adequate provision of basic primary health care is 23 health workers per 1000 tanzania whose performance in health is better than many other countries in sub-saharan africa had a workforce of 92000 in 2009 but to meet the health needs of its people it needed a health labor force of 140000 more than three times the size of its workforce accordia global health foundation 2009 1 the flight of the health workforce to the west and other parts of the world causes africa to lose billions of dollars a year while simultaneously robbing the african populations of resources they need most to improve their health conditionthe magnitude of the financial loss is illustrated by the cost of educating and training one student to become a medical doctor in kenya approximately 65997 from primary school to undergraduate medical studies in 2012 kenyas total investment for one medical student reached about 517931 kenyas total financial loss from the brain drain is estimated at 126 million a year yonga 2012 4 the us canada and the uk have the lions share of the african workforce exodus in the us this occurs despite its unwillingness to accept african immigrants compared to other populations of the world the same applies to the uk which in the 1970s passed strict laws on african physicians immigration or further training requests for even those graduates coming from its own former colonies lack of specialization in certain fields which forces many physicians to leave their home for further training constitutes other traps from opportunities in the west even within african countries that have a good number of medical schoolsin 2006 nigeria for example with a population of over 130 million had only 35 trained pediatric physicians with one or two qualifying in this specialty each year muula 2006 3 dermatologists injury specialists immunology pathogenesis experts maternal care providers qualified mental health personnel hiv virologists diagnosis specialists emergency medicine researchers and administrators and managers in several fields which have been given emphasis at some institutions such as kwame nkrumah university in ghana makerere university and mbarara university in uganda university of zimbabwe university of durban university of nairobi university of malawi and university of zambia are not producing the number of doctors africa currently needs for the preceding institutions funding from the obama administration through what has been called the medical education partnership initiative mepi which at the same time resulted in decreased funding of the presidents emergency program for aids relief pepfar in 2010 has allowed the pursuit of some needed specializations mepi has also attracted funding by other international donors who are dedicated to global health prompting some observers to note that the gold age and scaling up on arv of global health has come to a close crane 2013 173the good news however is that according to the who out of the 66 million people that receive antiretroviral treatment in low- and middle-income countries more than five million live in sub-saharan africa this means that those taking arvs are now capable of having normal and relatively longer healthy life span in which their hiv infection may never progress to aids even though global health enthusiasm is still high at american and canadian universities crane 2013 173 mepi funds totaling 130 million for five years beginning in 2011 were to be used for new medical school programs specifically targeted to the recipient countrys needs for acquisition of more top-of-the-line laboratories hands-on experience programs using advanced technology and the training of some 20000 nurses who would receive their diplomas or degrees at their work stations rather than having to travel to the medical school such as the university of nairobi the capital city to attend classes the funds are provided with virtually no strings attached allowing the universities to manage them for purposes they deem essential to the advancement of science and the countrys workforce needs christiansen 2012the brain drain and the scarcity of physicians and well trained allied service providers exert undue pressures on those who are faithful to their mission of caring for the sick for caring doctors therefore the present shortage conditions do not afford them enough time to know their patients explain the treatment they provide and diagnose the nature of the illness properly frustrated they too may appear to throw in the towel ample disturbing anecdotal evidence claims that most physicians get irritated when a potential patient especially a woman suffering from breast pain or suspected female-related cancer hints at the need for a second opinion one often hears also that when a patient complains of fever for example physicians are quick to dispense or prescribe malaria drugs or antibiotics that when someone seeks treatment and comes in coughing physicians or nurses tell him or her that he or she suffers from hivaids or tb and therefore prescribe anything that will make him feel good and that if a woman is admitted complaining of severe headaches some doctors may ask her to undress completely if she dares to question the reason the physician will ask her whether or not she wishes to be diagnosed and treated the defenseless woman ends up following the unethical orders of the crooked physicianpatients frustration and the sometimes rude or seemingly uncaring treatment people receive at the health center or the health clinic send many women to the village or now urban traditional healer and midwife memory of the history of the coercive and repressive colonial biomedical physicians and administrators and their negative attitudes toward traditional medical practices in africa in the combat against infectious diseases and epidemicsoften equating hospital personnel and missionary attitudes in the prevention and treatment of disease as one and the samecontinues to drive most africans to the psychological safety of the village health care setting rubi robinson estimates that to deliver essential health services africa needs to increase its health workforce by 140 and not lose any to the outside world and that right now the continent must secure a minimum of one million health workers including 700000 physicians to meet the mdgs and provide basic health services as pledged robinson 2013 13 however having many doctors should not be necessarily equated with better health which is a major mistake sometimes made in africa even among international donors the same applies to the introduction of new technologies it is a grave error to conflate biomedical technologies with health more doctors more nurses more hospitals and more drugs mean better health critical medical anthropologists commonly charge this error to doctors and health policymakers many of them doctors as well especially in the global south a policy focus on health careas opposed to healthminimizes the role of the economy and the state in the production of health and illness wendland 2010 213of course it is assumed that the workforce will receive the best training possible given that best practices prove that well-resourced healthcare workers are the best asset of any health system because of the technical skills management abilities and institutional capacity they are able to use to help populations effectively cooper and kirton 2013 10 most of the physician and the health care workforce losses have primarily been a result of frustration over the low salaries as well as the inadequacies of the infrastructure and africas professional personnels inability to copy with the volume of patients who present at the crowded hospitals seeking treatment daily the issue of low physicians salary has often created a major friction between the medical associations and the government on the continent as medical doctors argue that they are often on call 24 hours a day but are paid as low as 250600 a month like the other civil servants who may have never gone to school in the first place the problem is that they compare their salaries to those of their colleagues in the west as noted earlier forgetting in the process that they entered the profession well aware of the compensation system and that most were entirely sponsored by the government for the completion of their degrees otherwise they would have never been members of the glamorous profession which john iliffe called the elite of the elite in africa iliffe 1998 84 a club to which many other fellow citizens are not fortunate enough to belong hippocrates was clear when he wrote that serving the people was a privilege and a call as is the case of the priest and the teacher rather than a business designed to make one wealthy as iliffe adds quoting eliot freidson physicians tend to forget that the professions privileged position is given by not seized from society and it may be allowed to lapse or may even be taken awaythe march 2012 doctors strike in tanzania mentioned earlier which paralyzed the public hospitals for a week demanding that monthly salaries be raised threefold immediately was a clear example of the physicians dissatisfaction with their services compensation by the government they demanded that their pay be raised from 620 to 2200 a month plus allowances and bonuses the impact of the strike was devastatingas told by dar-es-salaam newspapers unfortunately no study has been conducted to ascertain how many patients may have died as a result of the strike especially in dar-es-salaam obviously the issue of doctors strikes has ethical and moral implications since they have sworn to faithfully uphold the hippocratic oath while the state upholds the view that health is a right of all citizens furthermore strikes contribute indirectly to death and cause unnecessary pain to patients if the strike is just for salary increases when the state believes that doctors are paid on a scale equal or even higher compared to most salaried civil service employees then it is easy to side with the sick who know that most of the doctors their received their degree through the use of taxpayers money people therefore do not understand why the strikes are allowed to take place if these are held to improve the quality of health services renovating buildings guaranteeing hot water electricity sanitation and hygiene and adequate functioning equipment then one might understand the situation but strikes like these must constitute the last resort and be reasonable in their demands no other civil servants strike to demand that their pay be tripled or quadrupled it stands to reason therefore that there must be an overwhelming reason to prove that without a lethal strike there is no other way to improve the situation and that without a strike the state would not respondthe doctors involved in the strike who are usually practicing in government institutions often hope that the private health facilities will temporarily provide the care the patients need this is unrealistic as private clinics are few and are much more expensive than government hospitals and health clinicsthe reason why citizens except family members never side with the striking physicians who are seen by many as acting selfishly as guilds or unions that must get their demands at all cost as one commentator put it before the strike doctors must exhaust all possible alternatives to avoid the strike and strikes should only be undertaken if it is the only option available mass awareness campaigns on the service delivery framework are necessary during the doctor-government negotiation phase to avoid grave negativism from the public should the strike be the only option to influence the government at any rate continues the commentator of the tanzanian 2012 doctors strike both parties involved in the strike must ensure the continuity of health services to preserve the individual right to quality health service singular 2012 7 this seems to be one element that has been missing in all doctors strikes in africa as a result it is the innocent powerless patients who end up being hurt a slow down may be acceptable but not a total halt to services to the people whose health the physicians have sworn to protect day and night as us president harry truman once said if you cannot stand the heat get out of the kitchenover the past 20 years developing countries have made sure that environmental pollution would be reduced to protect the health of their citizens this push for an environment that does not constitute a direct or indirect cause of certain diseases such as respiratory ailments and cancers has been accepted by africans at least in theory in fact when one travels across the continent and sees the prevailing polluted conditions in the cities the roads and the villages one easily gets the impression that the leaders are sleeping behind the wheel while smoke plagues the cities of africa from east to west and north to south there seem to be no regulations on harmful gas emissions from vehicles trucks in particular and motorcycles and water and soil contaminated by chemical and industrial waste some of which can be seen oozing above the ground and in the waters people rely on for survival while kenyans have seen on their own the need to wear smoke hoods in the city of nairobi to protect their health from polluters the state simply looks on at the environmental degradation lead is generously used in gasoline and other materials as if scientific warnings about the hazards this metal poses to children in particular mean nothing environmentalists point out that in africa towns and houses are often built at former waste disposal sitesafricas unclean environment is worsened by indoor pollution in windowless village houses as is the case with maasai dwellings for example which carry particulate levels 100 times higher than those accepted by the international community coupled with poor ventilation and low lying smoke that can cause respiratory diseases and eye irritation especially among children furthermore food safety especially for items cooked along the dusty streets and in the stands of city markets almost all over sub-saharan africa should constitute a major concern for the authorities yet only a few countries are making an effort to inspect the markets at some point in the food chain the dangers of contamination and toxicity are real under such circumstances for example insufficiently prepared cassava or manioc is known to cause paralysis yet cassava is a major food staple in parts of africa that is not inspected in kenya ingestion of contaminated corn maize killed 125 out of 317 reported cases in 2004 it was apparently caused by an infectious disease locally called konzo finally we might note that 72 of the people in sub-saharan africa do not have waste disposal facilities who african region health report

a major weakness that must be overcome by african states and institutions including all medical schools on the continent is the realization that without research undertaken by the african themselves who know their milieu more than anyone else in the world innovation development and implementation of new technologies is as important as other components of health and the wellbeing of the people ecosoc 2009 23 indeed without data hypotheses and experimentation there will be no better health in the long-term and the continent will be forever dependent on western researchers even if they collaborate with them as they will remain appendages in the process and embrace already-formulated theories and practices that fit the foreign researchers culture and needs african leaders are quick to point to lack of resources for social programs about which their leadership is challenged by citizens at home and abroad we reproduce below the figures on oil and gas production in 19 african countries provided by the us department of energy and ey estimates for 2010 the figures refute the excuses presented especially if they are considered along with other resources africa has to offer six or seven countries are the largest owners and producers of oil in africanigeria equatorial guinea libya algeria angola oil sudan oil and egypt gas but the prospects for a bright economic future that end or reduce poverty by half in such countries as ghana tanzania mozambique uganda sierra leone mali and kenya where oil fields have been found or are suspected to exist are not promising the question is how are these resources being used or will be used in the years to come for the benefit of all people while ending simultaneously poverty as we know it table 31

regarding hospital beds one can ask how leaders tolerate putting two to four patients who might carry infectious diseases in the same bed and sleep in their palaces with a clear conscience this deadly practice is widely known all over africa but nothing is done to prevent what one could call in epidemiological terms the moral equivalent of a sacrilege the author can vouch for this occurrence at the beira municipal hospital in mozambique the maternity wards at mwananyamala hospital in dar-es-salaam and arushas best known national hospital mount meru in tanzania here pregnant women at times using the same single blanket have to take shifts in using the beds which are shared by more than one woman at this national facility as well two mothers and their new born babies share the same bed for days in a row regardless as to whether the babies are sick without a curtain separating the various beds in the wardit is no wonder that the who stresses the point that studies have shown that 53 of childrens deaths in africa occur due to underweight malaria pneumonia and measles while 25 are the result of malnutrition and diarrhea among the under-five deaths studies indicate that about 53 can be attributed to underweight and 36 to the effect of under-nutrition for diarrhea pneumonia malaria and measles the who also notes that even though there was a reduction of child mortality in such countries as lesotho malawi mozambique and namibia and under-five mortality fell in 10 countries of the african region  under-five death has since increased and during the 13-year period there has been no overall reduction in mortality in this african region who african region health report

in almost every one of these health system requisites sub-saharan africas health systems are either dysfunctional or simply weak it is hoped that this verdict from the who serves as an overdue wake up call for african leaders ministries personnel health practitioners communities intellectuals politicians and decision-makers because people are clamoring and demanding at least the most basic health services embodied in the concept of primary health care they all embraced in 1978 and 2000 in support of this assessment of the future of africas health care the economist intelligence unit 2012 stresses thatnot only are the absolute levels of all indicators low but progress on almost every indicator is slower than in any other region maternal mortality in africa for instance decreased 27 over the past two decades which is certainly a good outcome but the global figure over the same period was 35 and in south-east asia it was 58 mortality in children under five is declining by 25 a year in africa compared to 27 worldwide and 56 in the european region maternal mortality in africa is declining at a rate of 17 a year against 23 worldwide and 5 in south-east asia kpmg africa 2012 2

the economist concludes its assessment by noting that africa will lag behind the rest of the world on health indicators for many years to come it is important to consider the reason why this is so by far the most important reason is the way health care is funded which is a patchwork of meager public spending heavy reliance on foreign donors and a large dependence on out-of-pocket contributions and user fees that place the greatest burden on the poorest members of society kpmg africa 2012 1 this chapter wishes to add to the reasons the mismanagement of the national resources for personal ends and lack of clear priorities which should focus on food sustainability for all citizens education for all health for all as a right and the rebuilding of the infrastructure all stemming from and based on the goals and strategies of primary health care that stresses prevention over treatmentstudies on substance abuse in africa became more common during the late 1990s and they are overwhelmingly focused on the prevalence of alcohol drinking and drug abuse the issue of alcoholism and drug abuse in africa and elsewhere is often controversial because whoever writes about it consciously or unconsciously views it from the religious social political economic psychosomatic and physiological angle this makes it difficult to present an argument defending or condemning it completely that is one that is acceptable to all ironically colonial administrators and concessionaire companies tended to consider africans to be intrinsically uncontrollable intoxicated people while they themselves spent their evenings indulging in hard whisky cognac wine or beer and losing control over their own actions and words dancing at times for hours in their kaki short pants white hats long socks or white trousers in the evening they would wake up the next day or after the daily afternoon siesta with hangovers just before going to the office if they felt like going to work at allthe first colonially commissioned anthropologists as noted in this work viewed drinking among africans as a cultural and social phenomenon that linked them to the world of their ancestors which cemented the role of the rites of passage and often constituted a way of enjoying the gifts of life while surrounded by kin and guests however colonialists stories of chronic drinking among africans were usually exaggerated the missionaries looked at drinking as an evil tendency inherent in africans which the natives could not resist theirs were moral judgments based on religion which africans had no obligation to follow given that the holy missionaries themselves were not models either in alcohol consumption which they claimed they did in moderation when necessary echoing the hypocritical stand of the colonialists and many of their missionaries in africa frederick lugard twice governor of nigeria considered using proceeds from liquor as a scandal in the eyes of civilization when the administration of a british colony has become almost wholly dependent for revenue on the sale of intoxicating drink heap 2012 143144rarely did colonialists make the point that like the europeans most of the drinking was done at home or at social gatherings for relaxation almost never during the work hours and that women and children were not expected to indulge in it most importantly much of the drinking did not result in quarrels and violence as they claimed if any most of the violence was verbal rather than physical excessive drinking was always condemned invariably also the colonizers disregarded the fact that drinking was often a visible expression of the misery caused by the colonial system conveniently forgetting that the production of alcohol was one of the few sources of cash that would allow them to pay taxes the colonial government had imposed on them for others such as the poor it was the only way to enjoy some of the easy pleasures of life and forget at least for a fleeting moment their destitute condition the same phenomenon was observed during the 1980s as a result of the global economic down turn bryceson reminds us that alcoholically joyful creative exchanges have been described as poor mans opera for those who do not have the financial means to procure more expensive aesthetic experiences or exhilarating pastimes 2002 7 some of the factors that enhanced the drinking of alcohol say the experts was and still is in africa the attractive packaging and the slick advertisement of the bottles by the big corporations or mass beer brewers despite the abundance of colonial alcoholic beverages africans never stopped drinking their own traditional alcoholic creations while gladly embracing the imported new varieties such as gin and rum this was true both during the colonial period and in post-independence africa as one colonial administrator accurately put it yet to some colonial commentators there was too much consumer choice the african has his palm wine and corn beer to him spirituous liquor is a superfluous and dangerous luxury he does not want it he needs it no more than a cat needs two tails heap 2002 140within certain social circles drinking certain types of alcoholic beverages was and is still seen as a symbol of success and wealth in life indeed as the cited author adds since independence drinking clear bottled lager has been the hallmark of membership in the educated urban middle class this writer recalls vividly how some assimilated africans in mozambique would drink their wine with their meal in the open veranda simply to show the passers-by how civilized they were as they thus emulated the colonial masters drinking habits the popularity of strong alcoholic beverages was made the easier as africans had become very adept in fermenting their own products at home thus sunday rest funeral occasions social gatherings and the heavy advertising by companies have made whiskey wine even vodka beer gin and other spirits popular with african males particularly among those with enviable jobs including many civil servants presidents and university professors perhaps with some exaggeration one health clinic in harare zimbabwe reported during the early 2000s that 66 of men and 48 of women attending ritual ceremonies communal planting and harvesting and spirit media celebrations were inebriated during each functionfor the post-colonial governments of africa passing stringent laws against drinking as europeans did without success where village brewers including women would actually be arrested and incarcerated would curtail their own love for lager and gin and reduce the amount of tax collections which sustain part of the national budget the alcoholic consumer citizens and constituencies made these spirits quite popular on the continent which are often still associated with high social status bryceson seems to be right when he writes that alcohols imputed value varies in form from culture to culture in some cultures institutional efforts have been made to deny or denigrate its perceived worth nonetheless its psychoactive qualities lend it added value above and beyond its thirst-quenching utility and the cost of the labor and raw materials to make it 2002 45 there is no denial however that excessive drinking is harmful to any society and those who abuse it are most often scorned and ridiculed in public and are counseled against itunfortunately today africa is no longer the innocent place where children and adults were shielded from the use and abuse of drugs such as marijuana the most used drug followed by amphetamines cocaine and opium on the link between drug use and health the un office on drug and crime estimates that 35 africans ages 15 years and older had used marijuana at least once the agency also predicted that by 2030 seven out of 10 deaths in africa will be caused by drug use and that in the low income countries of sub-saharan africa tobacco-related ill health and death in the form of cancer will increase nain 2008 1314 there is also indisputable evidence that drugs in the form of marijuana stimulants and all kinds of tranquilizers are heavily used in some countries especially in cities along the coast with the most popular being cocaine and heroin these are also injected intravenously and are responsible for many hiv transmissions alali 2014 5 alkali notes that the un estimates that 35000 africans die every year from issues associated with substance abuse south africa is the worst abuser of tobacco in sub-saharan africa here studies have shown that during the 1990s among 831 of those suffering from coronary heart diseases were heavy cigarette smokers mickbin 1994apparently tobacco use which can lead to lung cancer is declining in africa today after 39 of the 46 african members signed the framework for tobacco products control act targeting school children it appears that as a result of the prohibition of its use by minors tobacco smoking among the young is declining thus while in 1999 185 of the youth revealed they had been smoking before the age of 10 by 2002 the number had been reduced to 162 if one believes the figures governments have used higher taxation on tobacco use to reduce smoking while banning advertisement of cigarettes to minors and educating people on the perils to their health of course to the chronic diseases death toll in africa must be added the number of casualties and injuries caused by vehicles and motorcycles as noted above it is predicted that vehicular mortality which now ranks as number 10 among the continents deadly public health threats will be among the top three causes of death and injuryand accidents are also associated with infections and disabilities that cripple the patient or the victim of a crash cooke 2009 3 as the who estimates by 2020 road injuries will represent the third leading cause of disability in africa as the per capita ratio of automobiles and motorcycles rises azevedo et al 2014 59 besides dying from unprecedented vehicular crashes on the roads 85 of the deadly world crashes occur in africa many africans particularly the poor as studies in south africa have demonstrated die daily from falls fires drowning collapsing structures seasonal flooding intermittent droughts that result in famines pipe accidents and explosions at refineries as has been the case in nigeria volcanoes when they erupt gas emissions from gasoline refineries spewing toxins in the air and earthquakes trauma from accidental falls burnings and other types of wounds are the primary cause of the deaths of children from one year-olds to older ages see niang 2008 12as noted throughout this study infectious diseases can be defined as those that are spread from one individual to another or from an animal to man that is by a vector or carrier such as a mosquito fly louse flea helminth worm germ or microbiological agent such as a bacterium virus fungus protozoa parasite tick or an arthropod to humans the carrier of the parasite or microorganism is known as the vector which attaches itself to the host man or animal all occur in a definite environment hence the so-called epidemic trianglenamely the vector the host and the environment usually an infectious disease is acute sudden and symptomatic even though it can also be chronic such as hiv and therefore taking longer to manifest itself in the host a major outbreak of an endemic disease becomes epidemic when it reaches unusual proportions in terms of spread and impact affecting individuals in a given population and a certain geographic location more severely than ever before or pandemic when it affects communities throughout the world as has been the case with hivaids h1n1 sars and the spanish influenza of 19181919 if deadly pandemics tend to decimate millions of people worldwide while some infectious diseases such as malaria can be deadly others like polio can leave the victim disabled or paralyzed blind physically and intellectually stunted or it may simply incapacitate the host to the extent that he or she is unable to function as a normal human beingmalaria yellow fever diarrhea pneumonia respiratory ailments tb and hivaids are known as killer diseases and account for almost half of childrens deaths globally even though they may also be fatal to adults the annual cost associated with malaria treatment alone in africa is 12 billion on average while it also slows the economic growth by 13 a year during the past three centuries infectious diseases have ravaged the african continent by killing millions of people annually the discovery of vaccines emphasis on hygiene and preventive measures such as killing the vectors or keeping a safe distance from insects and rodents have all made a difference rodents are responsible for the terrible plagues that have hit the world including africa as discussed in this work however recent progress against infectious diseases has been so dramatic that a us surgeon-general declared in the late 1970s that infectious diseases were a thing of the past and urged the world to tackle chronic diseases instead whereas this may have been true in america and europe in africa it was far from the truththe world is now witnessing an era where chronic diseases which are slower to inflict damage to the victim and are often asymptomatic at first latent or inactive until the long incubation period elapses or some external or internal agent triggers their virulent course becoming full-blown diseases eventually appearing as deadly or malignant benign or simply debilitating currently most of africa is primarily affected by infectious or communicable diseases but chronic or non-communicable diseases are advancing at an alarming speed and have thus been called africas second disease burden and the cost to treat these diseases is astronomical a few years ago it was predicted that the cost of heart diseases and diabetes for the african continent would reach 1184 billion by 2012 representing between 1 and 5 of gdp we cannot emphasize enough the role the government can play in controlling chronic diseases as it is the only major social and authoritative compact that can exert meaningful pressure on people to change their behavior and enlighten the citizens on a mass scale against the dangers of such habits as cigarette smoking drug abuse and careless sexual behavior only the state has the resources to initiate and sustain disease prevention programs and only the state is able to attract substantive international or global assistance in the fight against illness and pestilenceoverall africas major success stories include decrease in malarial deaths by 33 since 2001 and child mortality by 30 since 1999 mainly due to routine immunization interestingly malaria can be reduced by 50 with bed nets use especially if these are already insecticide-treated effectively repealing the mosquitoes for up to three years unfortunately people sell the nets to get a few pennies for themselves in june 2014 for example the ugandan government distributed free nets to two districts but instead of using them in the home people began selling them within two weeks of the distribution to businessmen who lingered around to buy them for 3000 shillings or 200 in turn the buyers would sell one net for double or triple the price they paid some use the net to cover football goal posts and others to catch black ants daily mirror june 25 2014 22 the government threatened to prosecute those who sell the free bed nets as well as those who buy them overall so far six african countries have reduced under-five mortality by two-thirds within the time recommended by the who 16 have made no progress only 13 achieved maternal mortality rates lower than 550 per 100000 and 32 in sub-saharan africa showed death rates of either 550 per 100000 or higherunfortunately even though africa bears 66 of the global hivaids burden the who noted that only one-third of the population with advanced infection had received antiretroviral medicines by 2007 most prominent and most deadly among the infectious diseases ravaging africa are the big three hivaids malaria and tb which have attracted most external funding the focus on one or a few specific diseases leaving the others as secondary is known as a vertical approach when contrasted to an approach that targets all diseases infectious or chronic at the same time a process known as horizontal views from experts differ as to whether or not populations should choose one approach over the other as a policy and a strategy to improve the health of the public other infectious diseases include measles smallpox and polio the latter two now eradicated from the continent except perhaps for a few cases of polio in nigeria sleeping sickness or trypanosomiasis chagas or american trypanosomiasis dengue hemorrhagic fever fascioliasis rabies soil transmitted helminthic diseases leprosy bilharziasis or schistosomiasis river blindness or onchocerciasis dracunculiasis trachoma buruli ulcer visceral leishmaniasis ebola and many others that do not garner continuous focused attention from government and international funders unless they turn epidemicthe fight against onchocerciasis has resulted in a major victory for international organizations such the who working to eradicate it especially from west africa the onchocerciasis control program started in africa in 1974 using chemicals and biological larvicides to kill the black fly larvae the campaign was so successful that 12 million square miles in west africa were freed from the fly allowing some people to resettle while preventing 40000 new cases of blindness per year the african program for onchocerciasis initiated by the who and other international organizations in 1995 has treated 34 million people in 16 countries to date but the majority of the people do not receive treatment for it it is important to mention here that upper volta now burkina faso used to be one of the preferred habitats for the simulium damnosum fly which causes river blindness as far as we know there was no coordination between britain and france in their attempt to rid the two areas from the disease during the colonial period unfortunately sleeping sickness and cerebrospinal meningitis were the most threatening diseases in the areain the case of trypanosmiasis for example the situation was exascerbated by lack of communication the situation was exacerbated by lack of communication among the colonial departments and there was little knowledge among the british administrators and public health officials of what the french in upper volta were doing to contain or control sleeping sickness in their territory in nigeria concern about the serious ravages of trypanosomiasis came much later than in ghana but by that time thousands of people had been either been disabled or killed by the disease this was also true in chad gambia nigeria cameroon burkina faso mali and congo eventually drugs insecticides and forest clearance reduced its devastating effect considerably sadly in africa these are common deadly diseases that often cause severe pain and suffering and even death or leave their victims disabled for life as a result some epidemiologists call them the neglected tropical diseases mariani-constantini 2011 245 these neglected infectious diseases on the continent tend to affect children and the poor most hitting a billion others worldwide and are mostly attributable to well known factors notably unsafe water poor housing and poor sanitation see also stein et al 2007to recapitulate this chapters comments on the subject of infectious diseases the following brief paragraphs may help the reader remember their etiology and impact on africa and its people malaria is transmitted by the anopheles mosquito which breeds all year round in hot and humid climate and is common to most swampy areas of the continent leishmaniasis is transmitted by sand flies living in scrubland whereas river blindness is transmitted by black flies that thrive in fast river currents the tsetse fly carries parasites that cause sleeping sickness while ordinary flies are causes of an eye disease called trachoma river snails penetrate the human skin in snail infested water and are responsible for a debilitating disease called bilharziasis or schistosomiasis and children and women are most vulnerable to it as they tend to be more often in contact with rivers lakes and streams schistosomiasis affects mostly children as noted and is not deadly but adversely impacts the quality of life of adults and infects 160 million people in africa annually contributing to anemia among pregnant women 39 since it affects mostly children ages 514 years studies have shown that heavy infestations may impair the cognitive function of these children

2013 39 rabies which cannot be transmitted from human to human comes from mad dogs cats and bats and is deadlyyellow fevers vector is a mosquito called aedis aegypti mosquitoes are also responsible for lymphatic filariasis and hemorrhagic fever in african urban areas in particular hepatitis typhoid and diarrhea occur quite often cholera bacillary dysentery and worm diseases are caused by roundworms hookworms and tapeworms or helminths which are soil-transmitted to humans neglected infectious diseases contribute to severe pain suffering and lifelong disabilities and are responsible for enormous loss of individual and household productivity businesses slowdown and lowering a countrys economic output such as the gdp despite the ubiquitous nature of the parasitic worms they have been reduced by 96 globally since 1986 however most of the remaining cases occur in 13 african countries in which the final phase of its eradication has proven difficult leprosy is another infectious disease that has almost been eradicated globally except in africa where 96 of the cases were contained 20 years ago but the remaining 4 have been extremely problematic and resilient currently at least seven african countries are struggling with the incidence of leprosy where the global goal was to reduce it to one case per 1000 people by 2003 nigeria is one of the countries that along with botswana mali burkina faso rwanda zambia niger and tanzania seems to have achieved the goal but the stigma of leprosy is still strong here in mozambique the prevalence rate for leprosy was 127500 in 1991 but the number was reduced to 51200 or 60 by 2003 with 800000 cases been cured through use of effective drugs fortunately physicians have reported that it is not drug-resistant in endemic environments such as car tanzania angola mozambique and madagascar where it is endemic but it has almost been eradicated who african region health report
2013 42africa has had remarkable success in eradicating or controlling the spread of some infectious diseases following independence during the 1960s and 1970s however a much more daunting task is left unfinished this includes an unexpected increase of blindness from diseases and associated risks expected in the near future from the current nine million cases of blindness to 15 million by 2020 of which 80 are totally preventable or curable mental health is simply a disaster of epidemic proportions in sub-saharan africa as alluded to in this chapter the un population program notes that of the 800 million living in sub-saharan africa during the first decade of the twenty-first century 50 suffer from one form or another of handicap but only 2 receive specific rehabilitation care also 90 of children with mental health disorders die before the age of five and the majority of the affected are the poor people and the unemployed niang 2008 11 unfortunately researchers have not shown much interest in the problem of mental health on the continent a study conducted by turshen in 1989 showed that the number of references in the literature is sparse and that none of them referred to the disease in women who tend to be the most affectedmeasles virtually eradicated in many parts of the globe by now still hits 11 million children in africa annually with consequences that contribute to deaths and a weakened immune system a condition that is preventable through vaccine during the first years of life mixed results on disease control or reduction in africa include the big three hivaids malaria and tb in kenya for example despite the countrys touted health care system in sub-saharan africa still faces 80000 deaths per year from aids and 15 million people still live with hiv even though the incidence was reduced to 6 in 2009 from 8 in 2001 the number of orphans who lost one parent or both has reached 12 million malaria on the other hand affects eight million kenyans every year and the so-called rift valley fever and chikungunya a disease similar to dengue continue to cause thousands of unnecessary deaths notwithstanding the various effective treatments now available the conditions are not much better in other african countries despite the major effort made by the government and its enviable hospitals south africa has a population of at least 55 million who live with hivaids at the rate of one per 10 people resulting in some three million related deaths since the discovery of hiv during the mid-1980s smith 2013it is important to note here as well that the fight against hivaids is not over even though several experimental vaccines are being conducted through clinical trials especially in east africa unfortunately these have not been as promising for africans who have borne the brunt of the experiments the disconcerting aspect of the development of hiv drugs and vaccines is that the hiv sub-type b is predominant in north america and europe and not africa where the c sub-type is the most common especially in sub-saharan africa here the rate is between 70 and 88 and more than 95 in south africa says professor yasien sayed expert in hiv at the university of witwatersrand johannesburg where he is focusing his studies on sub-type c one of the reasons why pharmaceuticals target the b sub-type is that they feel that there is no market for c sub-type drugs even though in two of the most populous countries in the world india and china the predominant types are a and c whitehead 2013 1 this discrepancy makes the developing world feel that it is being used as a guinea pig for the benefit of white america and europesuspected origins of hiv and the ebola virus africathis leads us to discuss briefly the controversy over where in the world hiv began africans get defensive when the continent is blamed as being the original place of several diseases a point that cannot be proven as has happened with hivaids the issue of the origins of hivaids is still being debated today more than three decades after its discovery during the 1980s a theory advanced and published in the journal of science in 2006 attributes the origins to southeastern cameroon the result of a team study led by professor beatrice hahn of the university of alabama at birmingham and dr paul sharp from the university of edinburgh the projects aim was to search for the simian virus in chimpanzees feces collected across a vast swath of southeastern cameroon the team traced the carrier to an african porter employed by the french sometime between 1890 and 1900 or thereabouts the researchers claimed that one hungry man went hunting and killed a blood infected chimpanzee the blood subsequently infected the hunter probably through a cut during butchering this tragedy occurred amid massive infusion of new people and technology into a land where ancient ways still prevailed as the european powers engaged in a feverish race for wealth and glory in blazed routes up muddy rivers and into dense forests that had been travelled only sporadically by humans before timberg and halperin 2012 13it appears that the porters had cut a path right through the area where the chimps lived enhancing the transmission of the virus to man the team found in the chimps feces the virus strain known as hiv-1 group m which can be carried by simians such as gorillas and monkeys this was a lightly developed southern region where relatively few people live even today scientists say the study conclusions seemed to confirm what many scientists had known or speculated before namely that a blood sample from 1959 indicated that kinshasa the capital of the drc had been the virus habitat many decades prior to its discovery during the 1980s in 2008 michael worobey an evolutionary biologist working in a laboratory at the university of arizona published his own findings in the journal nature after discovering a second sample of the virus trapped in a wax-encased lymph node biopsy from 1960 he compared the genetic structure of the two samples and concluded that the hiv-1 group m was much older than thought at the time he was convinced that he had proven that both samples had come from the same ancestor sometime between 1884 and 1924 however the most probable year seems to be 1908 the hiv-1 group m is said to have been hatched somewhere along the banks of sangha river which flows toward central africa an area where kinshasa is also located timberg and halperin add that this section of the sangha was not ideal for navigation because of its ribbons of sandbars and the dense vegetation along the banks timberg and halperin 2012 2 the reason why the virus did not spread as fast this international team had set up 10 stations spread over a wide portion of southeastern cameroon and found the hiv-1 group m virus samples in two of the stations which were completely remote from any population and were almost a perfect match of the hiv-1 group m whose impact has been since the 1980s so devastating to mankindadding to the theory about the alleged origins of hiv just discussed is the controversy over the transmission of the ebola virus and its possible links with the great apes in parts of west africa as argued in this volume the cohabitation of animals including chimpanzees and men goes back centuries and it appears that west africa was aware that the big apes could transmit the disease to men even prior to the most recent outbreaks during the 1990s hunters in the region are also said to have been aware of the disease and recognized the phenomenon from the new outbreak but were not convinced that ebola had come from the chimps in other areas such as gabon people were not only aware of the disease but knew that chimps could also suffer from it just as man could thus in their minds the disease could come from either man or chimp this a plausible reason why the epidemic broke out in gabon in 1997 hunters had detailed knowledge of the index casea hunter who had found a dead gorilla in the forest and had brought it back to his village to share with others giles-vernick and rupp 2013 128130in africa the mentally ill interest the authorities only when they disturb the public order when that occurs authorities send them either to an asylum if there is one or they incarcerate them although this was a common practice in french colonial west africa niang 2008 1213 it is similar in other parts of sub-saharan africa in senegal the prevalence is 8 however unlike the developing world 85 of it is not treated here epilepsy goes virtually untreated in africa whereas in the industrialized world the treatment rate is 80 unfortunately again very little research has been done on these disorders in africa the african sub-continent has virtually no mental health programs worth mentioning and no facilities that would pass a rigorous test even though ghana is planning to introduce a robust program in the near future until now sudan and south sudan for example have not had a single psychiatry training institution or psychiatrists at work families and ngos are expected to fill the gap something that is not happening because in part the stigma the cost the difficulty of proper diagnosis and the impact of abject poverty seen in african cities and rural areas are a deterrent ignorance of the etiology of mental disorder and the means to provide effective control against it lead people to explain it as a result of social deviance and ancestors curse mental illness accounts for 5 of the disease burden

2013 6who notes that with the coming of chronic diseases africa is experiencing a double burden of disease currently estimates on chronic diseases in the form of diabetes in africa are that more than 10 million people suffer from it with 85 of the cases likely going undetected predictions are that this number will double to 203 million adult cases in sub-saharan africa by 2030 more than hivaids in real terms and surpassing the number of cases from infectious diseases the economist intelligence unit 2009 11 the problem with chronic diseases or degenerating illnesses such as diabetes cancer asthma and stroke is that they creep in often asymptomatically seem less severe at first and may appear to recede at times we are not sure of most of their etiology which may be associated with risk factors that act independently or synergistically and from undiscovered multiple sources may have long latency and cause prolonged illnesses and usually result in severe functional impairment disability or death fortunately we know the general and specific culprits of chronic diseases many may be a result of lifestyles as is the case with tobacco use alcohol abuse high cholesterol from fatty foods consumption sugary and salty intake inadequate diet physical inactivity obesity stress environmental occupation air and water pollution and even low socioeconomic status and its social and physical consequences brownson and remington 1998 currently scientists tell us that seven of the top 10 causes of death are attributable to chronic risk factors are a major cause of disabilities and will remain extremely costly for the individual and societymany of the chronic conditions are also a result of globalization and are impacted by individual and social lifestyles and the unscrupulous behavior of major global corporations that dump chemicals in the lakes contaminate waters leave industrial waste untreated abandon carcinogenic sewage systems pollute rivers and air and fight the efforts of the environmental protection agencies that have been created to protect peoples health currently sub-saharan african governments spend only about 20 of the small budget they allocate from the gdp to chronic diseases while the remainder goes to infectious illnesses despite the rise in non-communicable diseases there is hope that further awareness of their impact in some areas of health is having a positive effectfinally for any meaningful advance in health to occur in africa africans must tackle the problem of official corruption what others have called the looting of africas treasury and the problems of rapid urbanization seriously which siphon billions of dollars annually and prevent the workforce from responding adequately to the critical needs of the people of the continent indeed as omar massoud writes of nigeria for the problems of slums lack of access to basic services such as housing clean water primary health care sanitation and essential drugs africans must enact policies specifically aimed at reducing corruption through community driven checks and balances which ensure effective citizen participation yet the local governments should have as well the skilled manpower to deal with the problems of urbanization 2013 1 consequently african leaders and their ministries of health have a major task to perform use resources to ensure people are able to feed themselves provide equal opportunities for all citizens to attain education make the health of the people one of the top priorities develop agriculture improve the physical and social infrastructure and adopt transparency in every major transaction end political and economic corruption and embrace democratic governance short of any of these goals the future of health on the continent will continue to experience insolvable problems that will make africa the worlds laughing stock

readers of this chapter willdevelop a brief understanding of population and public healthconsider why it is important for medical managers to have an understanding of the field of public healthappreciate that a medical managers work may require consideration of its public health impactrecognise a range of traditional and more recent public health initiatives in australia including targeting of communicable diseases as well as tobacco alcohol and drugsgain an understanding of particular population health issues including chronic disease health management regional and rural health and indigenous healththere has been a renewal of interest in public health since the turn of the century in disease prevention communicable diseases health protection and health promotions this is partly due to the realisation that continued investment in acute care brings diminishing returns and is simply not sustainable and an increased focus on upstream interventions is required to keep the population healthier it is also due to recognition that problems in the last century tackled by public health actions have provided ongoing benefitsthe most recently published public health expenditure in australia report from the australian institute of health and welfare in 2011 suggested that australia spends 21 of the total health expenditure on public health 1 questions will arise as to whether this is sufficient in the longer termthe role of public health is to contribute to the health of the public through assessment of health and health needs policy formulation and assurance of the availability of services public health practitioners are constantly required to relearn old ways of tackling newer patterns of diseases in order to face traditional and newer challenges that threaten the publics healthwhile they are not trained as public health physicians in the strictest sense medical managers will often find that their work overlaps with public health practitioners medical managers make their largest contributions through the development of health systems which include personal health care public health services and other inter-sectoral initiatives it is important that medical managers take a balanced approach in developing a health system which contributes to a fair and healthy societya broad range of skills is required to practice successfully as a medical manager who is involved in public and population health in the same way as performing a root cause analysis the process starts off with understanding and analysing the actual issues questions and challenges before too much effort is spent on solving the wrong problem there are often conflicting priorities for improving the health of populations and it is ever more important that solutions are not only viable but cost effective tooin the end decisions always need to be made and these are usually difficult but important choices by using evidence and quality data decisions may eventually become more apparent the subsequent implementation of any policies that arise from these decisions will require other interpersonal and organisational skills such as influencing communicating and collaborating which are key skills of a competent medical managerit is impossible to describe all facets of public health in one textbook let alone a chapter this chapter then seeks to identify the challenges a medical manager would commonly come across in his or her daily practice and aims to be a reminder that it is important to consider what is happening beyond the four walls of ones immediate organisation that to be a good health service manager one often needs to be a competent population health managera widely adopted definition is that public health is the science and art of preventing disease prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society 2roger detels in 2003 defined the goals of public health as the biologic physical and mental well-being of all members of society regardless of gender wealth ethnicity sexual orientation country or political views 3this is very similar to the world health organizations definition of health as a state of complete physical mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity 4what is immediately obvious is that public health involves achieving health goals from not just an individual but also the collective efforts of society and this is more than merely the elimination of diseaseconceptually public health can take a population health approach in order to identify measure and monitor community health needs through surveillance of disease and risk factors in other words it is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population analysis public health interventions are then aimed at prevention of diseases or improving the overall health of societyin the last decade or so there has been significant debate about the definition of population health population health has been variously defined including the study of health and disease in a population as specified by geographical cultural or political guidelines 5 or the health outcomes of a group of individuals including the distribution of such outcomes within the group 6 concept of health informed by the study of its determinants and including subsequent interventions while it is difficult to determine which is normatively right or wrong in this chapter the latter definition is usedexamples of populations include regional and rural populations sufferers of chronic disease indigenous populations or refugeesaccording to the australian institute of health and welfare aihw average life expectancy of australians at birth in 2012 is 821 years with boys born in 20112013 being 801 years and 843 years for girls 8 this puts australias life expectancy at one of the highest levels in the world which also has health policy and management implications as the population ages fig 101the structure of australias population has changed significantly over the past few decades and will continue to do so over the next 40 years the relative portion of population aged 65 and over is growing indicating a decrease in the proportion that signifies the traditional working age between 15 and 64 yearsprevious depictions of the population pyramid with the younger population forming a large base and narrowing towards the top representing the elderly are thus changing with the structure looking more cylindrical than before fig 102this is significant for the health workforce as it means that there will likely be a growing demand from diseases of the elderly with relatively less workforce to support itthe social gradient of health is a phenomenon that suggests that in general the higher the persons income and education the healthier they are daily smoking rates are a clear example as the higher the socio-economic status ses group the less likely it is for the person to be a daily smoker in the lowest ses group the rate in 20112012 was 23 as compared with 10 in the highestdifference in harmful levels of alcohol consumption is also evident with 22 in the lowest ses groups compared to 17 in high ses groups other examples include sufficient physical activity 3452 women and children overweight and obesity 64 and 48 respectively for women 33 and 19 for children 9there are other health measures and risk factors with known social gradients which include life expectancy self-assessed health status oral health end-stage kidney disease and mortality and 5-year relative survival from all cancersinfrastructure for public health is provided by state and local government departments and agencies and is closely aligned to housing and environments policy and services also provided by governmentpublic health provision is also supported by other agencies such as health service providers and academic health science institutions where medical managers are often employed having an understanding of the overall picture and issues across these sectors is important to provide context to the management of the individual person or individual organisationone might ask why are the housing and environmental sectors involved in health care this is because the concept of health is much more far-reaching than the usual health services that medical managers are accustomed toit is not difficult to conceptualise that clean water good sanitation education or even employment contribute to better health for an individual these are the social determinants of health and it is important to understand that public health is intricately linked to themthe scenario below is an example of social factors affecting the daily management of a health service
a 42-year-old man with a mental health history is brought to the emergency department with suspected drug overdose and acute psychosis he had recently been evicted from his home for repeated violent behaviour towards his neighbours and damaging the rented property he has no known family and is unemployed
you can imagine that while the doctors and nurses can potentially treat the patient back to pre-event health status it is clear that the social issues such as his accommodation and social supports need to be considered early on in the admission because they impact on the longer terms outcomes for the patient otherwise one might come across the familiar situation where the patient is medically fit for discharge but the care team however will flag post-discharge concerns that should have been addressed earlier in the treatment processfailing to identify these issues may potentially lead to suboptimal utilisation of acute beds while they are being addressed or discharging a patient who is at high risk of being readmitted a health service manager may need to consider working closely with the housing sector in the situation above to prevent downstream issues adversely impacting on the health services operationsa medical manager is often confronted with challenges associated with communicable diseases these range from routine in-hospital practices of infection prevention to the involvement in planning and response to epidemic outbreaks at the health service levelin the last two decades prominent emerging infectious diseases that spring to mind are the outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars influenza a virus subtype h5n1 avian influenza or the influenza a virus subtype h1n1 swine flu pandemicthese influenza outbreaks originating from asia were highly contagious and claimed many lives especially in the at-risk populations such as the elderly or pregnant women australia was not significantly affected by sars and h5n1 as compared to the rest of the world however the swine flu pandemic in 2009 saw over 37000 reported cases in australia claiming 191 lives it was fortunate that comparatively the fatality rates in australia were lowmore recently the 2014 outbreak of ebola virus disease evd from west africa also caused significant consternation as the disease reported very high mortality rates of between 30 and 70 amongst those infected the personal protective equipment required for health care workers was significantly more comprehensive than normally required including full body suitsin these situations the medical manager often plays a significant leadership role in coordinating the responses within their health service as well as being involved with emergency planning and preparation work such as training exercises working parties are convened with representation from relevant parts of the organisation usually including infection control and infectious disease specialists intensive care and emergency physicians nursing occupational health and safety staff and potentially media and communication representativesescalation procedures will need to be in place to support staff on the ground with considerations for separate triaging and treatment areas including negative pressure rooms vaccinations for staff and dogged use of personal protective equipment it is important to have good communication channels with the state health department to ensure appropriate notification escalation and mobilisation of resources it is also pertinent to have a clear media strategy with the community as well in order to ensure that fear is managed and simple prevention messages communicatedwhile not prevalent in australia another communicable infectious disease that has been on the watch-list recently include the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus which has spread through to parts of asia with south korea the most adversely affecteda simple way of preventing infections is through good hygiene practices and in health services the most effective and simple way is to have good hand hygiene practices policies procedures and guidelines should be developed and in place to ensure staff are aware of what is expected of them both for the protection of the patients and themselveswith preventing and controlling healthcare associated infections being one of the national safety and quality health service standards standard 3 control measures applied in the hospital setting include establishing hospital infection control committees providing isolation areas use of personal protective equipment regular cleaning and sterilising requirements or restriction of activities such as working while infectious hand hygiene compliance requirements are more in the spotlight and medical managers should be leading the charge for it by mobilising support and driving the agendarelated is the all-important function of antimicrobial stewardship increasingly bacteria are developing resistance to antibiotics and multi-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre or the deadly carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae cre are increasingly found in the community while this has been attributed to overuse of antibiotics in the community hospitals are often found lacking in adherence to antibiotic best practices leading health services are now actively tackling this issue with antimicrobial stewardship programmesalthough such programmes are usually managed by infectious diseases teams it is important that the medical manager provides visible support for this many doctors see the approval process of antibiotics as cumbersome but compliance has been shown to be beneficial for the community in the longer term standard 3 makes mention of the need for an antimicrobial stewardship programme and in a similar way to mandatory hand hygiene compliance key performance indicators medical managers could use this argument to facilitate adherence to the antimicrobial stewardship programme within their health servicestaff vaccinations are also an important way to prevent the spread of infections to health care workers and in between patients the vaccination process not only provides an active immunisation benefit to the individual it also creates passive herd immunity benefits to the community which provides relative protection of the population group by reducing or breaking the chains of transmission of an infectious agent because most of the population is resistant to the infectionoften being in key leadership positions medical managers play an important role in promoting the importance of immunisationsthe concept of one health is worth noting and that the movement to link physicians veterinarians and other scientific-health and environmentally related disciplines is gaining momentum one health is particularly important when we consider communicable diseases as there are more connections between human health animal health and the environment than was initially perceivedexamples of these include transmission of zoonotic diseases from animal to human beings like evd or the indirect ingestion of antibiotics through animals that have been injected with antibiotics to increase growth and subsequent development of antibiotic resistance with increasing globalisation it is worth acknowledging that an environmental issue affecting livestock in central and south america europe or asia could affect australians who have unwittingly consumed itin medical school students would have been taught the physiological harm that tobacco alcohol and drugs cause to the individual such as lung cancer liver cirrhosis or brain damage in fact these substances can cause harm much further beyond the individual as they often affect the relatives and friends around them as well as causing a unique set of challenges for health care professionalsfor decades now governments have spent significant efforts trying to reduce smoking rates this has led to the rates of daily smokers in adults essentially halving between 1993 and 2013 from 261 to 133 11tobacco is not only hazardous to the smokers but also to those around them through the inhalation of second hand smoke smoke-free environments are becoming increasingly popular and legislatively required including restaurants bars and all indoor areas these policies are important from more than one perspective because they protect non-smokers to the exposure of tobacco smoke reduce smokers consumption of cigarettes and even induce some smokers to quit 12australias low smoking rate is the result of sustained concerted and comprehensive public policy efforts from all levels of government and action from public health organisations since 1973 when health warnings were first mandated on all cigarette packs a combination of further restrictions and bans on advertising and smoking in restaurants and increases in taxes have been progressively introduced 13 a look at the australian department of healths website will show that it has taken significant effort and time to achieve current rates table 101it is important that this effort is sustained as each year smoking kills an estimated 15000 australians and although over 75 of the cost of tobacco for the consumer is in taxes the social and economic costs of 315 billion for australia outstrips tobacco sales of 34 billion by ninefoldthere have been significant public health efforts in reducing the harm caused by alcohol particularly associated with binge drinking driving under its influence and alcohol-related violencealcohol as a public health issue is challenging not least because drinking is largely seen as a social activity and the rates of alcohol-related problems tend to rise and fall with changes in the level of consumption of the population thus controls on the availability of alcohol including taxes affect the level of consumption and subsequently rates of alcohol-related problems 14the development of the national alcohol strategy 20162021 is being undertaken currently and it is common to see police conducting random breath testing weekends and public holidays in all states and territories advertising campaigns aimed at both educating the general public and highlighting policing efforts are common recently alcohol-related violence has also received significant media attention as there have been a number of high-profile deaths caused by unprovoked single acts of violenceat the same time sporting clubs are encouraged to promote a culture of safe drinking and to reduce their affiliations with alcoholic beverage sponsors in an effort to change behaviour and attitudes around alcohol consumption 15most would have read of the recent challenges posed by crystalloid methamphetamines colloquially termed by the media as the ice epidemic while the total rate of methamphetamine use has remained steady recently the use of its crystalloid form known as ice has developed into a significant health issue users of the drug are prone to experiencing hallucinations and can be particularly agitated and violentcommunities in regional australia are twice as likely to use methamphetamine than those in major cities along with smoking daily and drinking excessively 11this is particularly challenging for health care professionals in emergency departments who treat them following an overdose as they not only have to treat the physiological sequelae but also the violence and aggression that often accompany them within 3 years from 2010 ice has grown to be the illicit drug thought to be of most concern for the general community and in 2013 became the second highest cause of death from illicit drugs 11 however it still lags behind heroin as the single largest cause of illicit drug deathsthe significant problems associated with the use of ice is not an issue that law enforcement agencies can police or arrest its way out of it requires a coordinated effort from multiple sectors including health care education as well as law enforcement in order to be able to stem its growing abuse and harmoccupational health deals with the interaction between health and work it encompassesthe prevention of occupationally related illness or injury resulting from exposure to workplace hazardsensuring workers with pre-existing illnesses or disability are able to continue working without undue risk to their health or third partiespromoting general health and safe working practices in the workplacewhen one considers the total proportion of people who go to work it is clear that even a small percentage of this large number can be an important public health consideration and maintenance of their health is important to the well-being of their colleagues family employer and consumersthe medical managers approach should include identifying hazards in the work setting determining at-risk populations and assessing the risks associated with exposure to the risk and then taking appropriate preventive actions such as elimination substitution or containment of the hazard and limiting exposure it is also important to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the preventive measurespromoting general health in the workplace include advice and information on alcohol intake smoking diet physical activity or safe driving health promotion activities in the workplace can include measures such as serving healthy food products in cafeterias having a no-smoking policy or providing subsidies to join sports and exercise facilitieschronic diseases have become the most common cause of death in high-income countries such as australia overtaking communicable diseases which are still the leading causes of death in low-income countries 16 indeed 68 of global deaths were caused by non-communicable diseases ncd in 2012 an increase from 60 in 2000 communicable maternal neonatal and nutritional conditions accounted for 23 while injuries caused 9 of all deaths in high-income countries the proportion of deaths caused by ncd is even higher at 87 as compared to 37 in low-income countriesin australia eight out of the nine national health priority areas which are diseases and conditions that australian governments have chosen for focused attention are chronic in nature these includecancer controlcardiovascular healthmental healthdiabetes mellitusasthmaarthritis and musculoskeletal conditionsobesitydementiathe other priority area is injury prevention and controlchronic diseases impose an increasing burden to health care systems and health services have needed to focus on the management of patients who suffer from chronic diseases through intense care coordination programmes such as the hospital admission risk program in victoria important components of chronic disease management programmes are the proactive upstream care that improves quality of life as well as reducing the risk of the patients condition deteriorating to the extent where they require an acute admissionthere are many variations of how this is provided to the patient and innovative health services have incorporated approaches such as using mobile technology graded escalation protocols and intensive self-care education into their programmes because the aim is to keep the patient well in the community often the patients gps play highly important roles in managing their conditionsa well-designed and executed chronic disease management programme achieves the following outcomesa net financial benefit to the health care system through fewer acute admissionsimprovement in the patients quality of lifebetter management of disease markersco-decision improved buy-in and adherence to agreed therapieschronic disease management requires a population management approach 17 the segmentation of population groups by many health systems are variations of the kaiser pyramid fig 103level 1 are those patients who make up 7080 intervention seeks to encourage patients to be activated active participants in their own care learn to live with their conditions and manage it this aims to help them prevent complications and slow down deteriorationlevel 2 are patients who are considered to be high risk and their condition has progressed to a stage where active care management is required this usually involves a multidisciplinary team that provides high-quality evidence-based care to the individuals through following agreed protocols and pathwaysthe highly complex patients are designated level 3 where they have developed multiple co-morbidities and their care becomes disproportionately complex for them as well as the health system a case worker is often required to actively manage the patients health and help navigate through multiple health social and community systemsthere are many who would argue that another level should be added to the kaiser pyramid and this is at the level of health promotion for the general public to prevent the whole of population even getting to level 1 these sort of primary preventions include aiming to increase physical activity reduce smoking rates having a healthy diet or increasing uptake of immunisationsthe components of disease management includepopulation identification processes including the increasing use of predictive modelling and pattern recognitionevidence-based practice guidelinescollaborative practice models that include physicians and support service providerspatient self-management educationprocess and outcomes measurement evaluation and managementit is important to ensure that disease management programmes are put in place not just to manage costs considerations but just as importantly quality of care otherwise they will have a high risk of failingaustralia with its vast land and low population density creates some interesting challenges that are quite unique to health care there are often challenges that medical managers face which are different from those encountered while working in metropolitan areasit is recognised that the overall health status of populations in regional and rural australia is poorer than their metropolitan city counterparts health outcomes as seen with higher death rates tend to be poorer outside major cities 18 this is most likely due to a multitude of reasons including higher concentration of the socio-economically disadvantaged lack of infrastructure challenges with access to timely medical care and the difficulty of attracting high-quality health care staff to the regionaccording to aihw compared to major city dwellers people in outer regional and remote areas are more likely tobe a daily smoker 22 compared with 15be overweight or obese 70 compared with 60be insufficiently active 60 compared with 54drink alcohol at levels that place them at risk of harm over their lifetime 24 compared with 19have high blood cholesterol 37 compared with 31there are clear differences that exist in health service usage between areas for example lower rates of some hospital surgical procedures or gp consultations but higher rates of hospital admissions there are differences in risk factors such as the population in regional and remote areas being more likely to engage in harmful activities such as smoking or drinking alcohol in harmful or hazardous quantities environmental risks also play a part such as having more physically dangerous occupations or factors associated with driving long distances or at speedbeing in regional and rural areas means that health services are unlikely to be able to provide high complexity services such as neurosurgery or cardiac surgery due to a lack of scale the decision for health services to provide these services is not taken lightly even if they could physically and financially afford to do so as the low number of procedures means that the risk of poorer outcomes for patients is much higher this invariably creates access difficulties for the communities but could be mitigated to a certain degree by establishing strong partnerships with referral hospitals to facilitate access when requireda significant challenge medical managers face in regional and rural areas is the difficulty of recruiting specialist medical staff often this can be costly both in terms of one-off recruitment costs and remuneration many health services still offer fee-for-service remuneration models and medical managers need to be aware of the risks associated with such models such as over-servicing and performing unnecessary procedures or trading safety for perceived efficiencydoctors who move to the region will also need to be supported in a variety of ways initially this may be in the form of relocation assistance but will also include ensuring that there is sufficient peer support opportunities for ongoing professional development and ability to participate in clinical reviews and auditswhile residents of more inaccessible areas of australia are generally disadvantaged in their access to goods and services educational and employment opportunities and income a unique characteristic of regional and rural populations is that they often have a very strong sense of belonging within the community and if this community spirit can be harnessed it can often contribute to the betterment of the regions health serviceswhile historically it has been challenging to get accurate data to identify the extent of the problem there has been significant progress in the availability and quality of statistical information on aboriginal and torres strait islander atsi peoples over the last decade in australia through the census specific surveys of atsi peoples have been conducted regularly to address gaps in health and welfare information to allow for monitoring changes over timewhat is clear however is that health and social outcomes for the indigenous population are much poorer than the rest of australias populationsan indigenous boy born between 2010 and 2012 can expect to live more than 10 years less than a non-indigenous boy 691 years compared with 797 years and an indigenous girl about 9 years less 737 years compared to 831 across all age groups the indigenous population has higher death rates than non-indigenous australiansin addition to poorer life expectancy there are other measures of health in which indigenous australians fare much worse when compared to the non-indigenous population this is referred to as the health gap some examples are listed below where indigenous australians after adjusting for differences in age structure 19had incidence rates of end-stage kidney disease 7 times that of non-indigenous australians in 20072010had 33 times the rate of diabeteshigh sugar levels of non-indigenous australianshad 3 times the hospitalisations for respiratory conditions and more than twice as many hospitalisations for mental and behavioural disorders as non-indigenous australianshad an obesity rate 15 times that of non-indigenous australianswere 15 times as likely to die from cancer in 20072011 as non-indigenous australianshad higher youth suicide rates than non-indigenous australiansdeath rate in the 3544 age groups is 5 times that of non-indigenous australians and within the 04 aged groups death rate is more than doubleit is important to acknowledge that social determinants such as unemployment lack of education or increased behavioural risk factors contribute to this health gap and there are also complex interactions between social determinants and risk factors of the social determinants household income highest level of schooling completed and employment status have the largest estimated impact on the gapaustralian governments have acknowledged this issue through the close the gap statement of intent signed by the prime minister in 2008 and at the december 2007 coag meeting at which the australian governments committed toclosing the life expectancy gap within a generationhalving the mortality gap between atsi and non-indigenous children under 5-years of agehalving the gap in reading writing and numeracy within a decadewhile progress has been slow 20 it is important to remember that the closing the gap strategy was only operationalised in july 2009 and the latest progress and priorities report 2015 only had data from 2012 to 2013 21 the magnitude of the goals will require time and a larger focus on access to appropriate primary health care services to detect treat and manage treatable and preventable chronic conditionswhile health is the final common outcome desired its achievement is contingent on the good functioning of many other processes and sectors historically there has been an implicit assumption that through the implementation of narrow disease-specific interventions broader health systems will be strengthened more generally however evidence of benefit for these selective health system interventions have been mixed 22 systems that are weak and fragmented may be further compromised by the over-concentration of resources in specific vertical programmes leaving other areas under-resourcedin australia the fragmentation of the health system with different governments funding different health programmes can lead to duplication of work processes service disruptions in existing programmes and distraction from core work activitiesit is also important to recognise the importance of sound governance leadership and political will in order to improve the health of communities whether from a national state or organisational perspective governments and organisations need to bridge the gaps between policies and their implementation and address deeper sources of policy failure that can undermine health developmentenlightened policy-making brings coherence to the delivery of health services and outcomes it is important that the health of populations features as the principal concern of all health managers through inter-sectoral engagement a platform must be created for coordination and consensus building across mutually reliant sectors such engagement will need to address multi-sectoral issues such as social determinants of health macroeconomic policy or health-related human rightsmany medical managers may not consciously realise that they work in public health directly or indirectly however irrespective of whether one works in the public health unit of their local health department or a private hospital the work they are involved in often has a direct impact on public and population health while governments have spent considerable efforts improving public health legislation will always have a significant lag time behind accepted knowledge and quality initiatives and it is essential that medical managers have an understanding of the challenges of contemporary public health issues so that the solutions to problems that they implement take a more systemic approach and benefits not only their health service but also the wider community
public and population health concerns itself with preventing disease prolonging life and promoting health through the organised efforts of society vulnerable populations often require a more specific focusmedical managers need to be aware of what challenges the general public are at risk of and the public and population health policies implemented in response to them these policies affect health services and health care systems and medical managers often play a significant role in moulding these policies and implementing them effectivelyaustralia has an ageing population with associated increases in chronic diseases it also has an ageing health workforce with implications for the supply of care in the futurehistorical public health interventions include public sanitation clean water and food supplies and immunisation programmes recent efforts can be seen through tobacco and seatbelt legislationthe spread of communicable diseases can overwhelm health services quickly and the management requires a structured approach with good command procedures and clear communication channels in place medical managers also play a critical role in ensuring best practice infection control processes developed in health services including antimicrobial stewardship programmes increasing hand hygiene compliance rates and encouraging staff vaccinationsthere has been significant effort by governments to reduce smoking rates mainly through taxation and legislation and improvements are starting to be seen attempts to promote a safe drinking culture are still ongoing but one of the largest challenges the health system is facing is the abuse of illicit drugs and in particular methamphetamines recently it will require a coordinated approach from relevant sectors to change this tidechronic diseases pose a significant burden to australia and other developed countries it requires novel ways of managing these patients including use of risk stratification predictive analytics encouraging self-care and case managementregional and rural populations have a different set of challenges compared to metropolitan populations due health conditions associated with lower socio-economic status and access to general and specialist carethe indigenous population in australia have much poorer health outcomes than their non-indigenous counterparts this has much to do with social determinants of health and lack of access to early identification and interventions
the two major thrusts of infectious disease biosecurity are 1 reducing the likelihood of introduction of an infectious agent into a group external biosecurity and 2 reducing the likelihood of its transmission when present internal or within-herd biosecurity or biocontainment when approaching the control and prevention of neonatal enteric infections knowledge of several general infectious disease epidemiology principles is useful essential information for designing a herd-specific control program for any infectious disease includes 1 the reservoir 2 the modes of transmission and the agent characteristics related to each 3 the incubation period and 4 the period of communicability the minimum incubation period along with the infectious dose and the age of the calf is critical because for example it establishes the maximum length of time a susceptible calf can be present in a critical calving facility before it could begin to contaminate the area if it were infected at birth the most important reservoir for these enteric agents is previously or currently infected cattle which is critical for producers to recognize when they are considering purchasing animals and when they are managing contact between different age groups within a herdmost of these agents transmit predominately by the fecal-oral route from the feces of infected animals to the mouths of susceptible animals and do so efficiently immediate transmission occurs when infected animals are housed with susceptible animals in conditions that allow nose-to-nose contact or inhalation of aerosols produced by coughing urinating or defecating indirect contact transmission requires that the infectious agent survive in the environment most agents of neonatal calf diarrhea survive well in nearly all environmental conditions remaining in the environment where they can be transmitted indirectly by contact with contaminated feces fomites such as equipment or mechanical vectors such as flies for enteric agents transmitted by indirect contact key factors include the number of organisms shed in the feces and their survival characteristics in the environment compared with the infectious dose required to initiate infection in susceptible hosts information on the environmental survival characteristics of an indirectly transmitted agent is needed to determine how long that agent is likely to remain at an infectious dose once the area is contaminated with it all of this is critical information for determining how to manage livestock flow through an existing set of facilities and to otherwise minimize disease transmission through management practices the relationship between infecting agents and the environment is complex involving factors such as the physical characteristics of the substrate material eg feces water milk manure slurry dust temperature ph water activity and competing microorganisms as a consequence these relationships are not well defined for many combinations encountered in the farm environmentwith the rare exception it is likely that most infectious enteric agents of cattle co-evolved with their bovine hosts long before their domestication thousands of years ago 51 52 if an agent was able to survive under the free-range conditions of the wild bovine it is likely that transmission occurs relatively easily in the environment of the intensively managed domesticated bovine of today indeed these agents are shed by infected animals in numbers several logarithms higher per gram of feces than the total number required to infect the typical susceptible calf additionally these agents have been shown to be extraordinarily flexible with regard to their genetic make-up and through survival of the fittest can rapidly take advantage of new environments and management systems consequently intervention strategies devoted to a single control point may be successful in the short run but are likely to prove unsuccessful over the long runan important concept that is often overlooked particularly in the midst of clinical disease outbreaks is the iceberg principle this concept is in effect both within and between herds between herds clinical disease is normally seen in only a minority of herds in which its occurrence implies significant suboptimal management conditions within herds generally only a small proportion of affected animals are clinically affected with most being subclinically infected for most diseases both infectious and noninfectious the ratio between clinical cases and subclinical cases is typically 15 to 120 in some circumstances a herd can be widely infected with an agent yet few if any clinical cases occur consideration of the iceberg principle helps prioritize efforts because in most outbreaks attention is typically but erroneously focused only on individual animals displaying clinical signs to wit if isolation and sanitation practices are to be an important component of a disease control strategy the iceberg principle suggests that to be effective such measures must be applied to all exposed animals and not just those that exhibit clinical signsappropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures are critical to breaking fecal-oral transmission cycles of enteric agents that contaminate housing feeding or treatment equipment or other vectors and fomites because personal hygiene is crucial to stopping the transmission of these agents in the human hospital environment it is also a critical component in the intense livestock production environment as well this personal hygiene includes frequent effective hand washing of sufficient duration with soap followed by an alcohol-based hand disinfectant 50 cleaning and disinfecting boots and washing work clothes with bleach followed by hot air drying cleaning and disinfection procedures are not without pitfalls however and adherence to a sound protocol covering all of the infectious agents of concern is critical for long-term success procedures that do not affect a resistant agent such as cryptosporidia oocysts or rotavirus may spread it from areas of high concentration across previously uncontaminated surfaces where it can then contaminate materials such as water and feed at sufficient levels to provide an infectious dose the most important first step is thorough cleaning to remove organic material eg feces milk film before applying disinfectant 46 vigorous cleaning scraping scrubbing flushing cannot be replaced by applying disinfectants in larger quantities or with higher pressure for any protocol or in nature destruction of microorganisms initially follows a first-order logarithmic decay process and then slows 74 in relation to the amount of time required to destroy one half of the initial population approximately three time periods are required for a one-logarithmic 90 reduction six for a two-logarithmic 99 reduction nine for a three-logarithmic 999 reduction and so on in addition to contact time the concentration temperature ph water content water hardness and amount of organic material present are critical variables determining the success of chemical disinfection importantly the relationships between these factors are not straightforward 54 for example halving the concentration of formaldehyde requires a 2-fold increase in contact time to obtain similar microbial destruction whereas halving the concentration of phenolics requires a 64-fold increase in contact time a 10c rise in temperature increases the activity of alcohols 30-fold yet increases the activity of formaldehyde only 15-fold iodophors are highly active at low ph but are inactive at an alkaline ph in general effectively applied live steam inactivates the broadest range of microorganismssodium hypochlorite bleach naocl at a sufficient concentration contact time and temperature combination is effective against the bacterial and viral agents of neonatal enteric disease 87 but at practical levels is not effective against cryptosporidium oocysts it is readily available as 525 household bleach and 1275 solutions and it is cost effective and environmentally safe because it begins dissipating on dilution however the centers for disease control recommends that diluted solutions should be used within 24 hours and that they should be stored in opaque containers sodium hypochlorite is rapidly inactivated by the presence of any appreciable organic material for example 1 albumin reduces its effectiveness by six logs and increasing concentration or contact time does not recover this loss bacteria in biofilms are 150 to 3000 times more resistant in solution hypochlorus acid is the active form of the free chlorine it is most available at a ph level of 6 dropping to 80 of the free chlorine at ph 7 and to 25 at ph 8 suggesting that the ph of disinfectant solutions should be monitored regularly as part of disinfection protocols below ph 6 it is more corrosive to metals and more chlorine gas is released testing kits can be used to monitor free chlorine as part of disinfection protocols however because these kits measure both hypochlorus acid and hypochlorite ion nonactive form ph must also be considered recommended concentrations for use in human environments range from 500 ppm 1100 dilution of 525 household bleach and 10-minute contact time at room temperature to 5000 ppm 110 dilution of 525 bleach and 1-minute contact time at room temperature the higher concentrations being used in more critical areas for viruses in veterinary hospitals and kennels a recommended dilution of household bleach is 132 which results in a 0175 sodium hypochlorite solution and a 10-minute contact time at room temperature 93 at ph 6 to 7the characteristics of environmental surfaces targeted for disinfection in the farm environment also influence the success or failure of various procedures 62 for example unfinished plywood retains 15-fold more microorganisms than varnished plywood which supports 15-fold more microorganisms than plastic surfaces on smooth ideal surfaces physical removal of visible contamination by thorough washing with soap and water removes 99 of the microbial load two logs on typical housing surfaces however washing only removes 90 one log proper disinfection removes an additional 6 to 7 and terminal fumigation removes 1 to 2 disinfection after washing is an important step particularly if the surface remains damp because remaining bacteria can proliferate in the minimal nutrients leaching from wet wood and because washing can disperse an infectious agent from limited areas of high concentration broadly across other surfaces the application of high-pressure sprays can aerosolize organisms allowing dissemination to distant sites and posing a risk to operators if zoonotic organisms are presentsubsets of salmonella enterica serovars such as s typhimurium and s dublin are important causes of diarrhea in dairy and veal calves whereas infections in single-suckle beef calves are infrequent the pathophysiology of enteric salmonella infections is complex involving inflammation and necrosis increased fluid secretion and decreased absorption and digestion in addition to enteric manifestations of disease infected calves are frequently septicemic which results in more severe clinical signs bacteremia is common in calves less than 1 month of age and is often manifested systemically as polyarthritis meningitis or uveitis in addition to shedding the agent in their feces calves developing septicemia often shed the agent in their urine and oronasal secretions even before the onset of clinical signs the lack of awareness about the potential for shedding from the oronasal area is particularly dangerous because this source leads to spread through contamination of feeding and treatment utensils and hands severely compromising internal biosecurity programs hardman and coworkers 38 found that in natural outbreaks of individually penned calves approximately 60 of transmission was by direct contact whereas 40 was by indirect routes including aerosols fomites and vectors this finding suggests that emphasis should be placed more broadly on controlling all means of transmission including aerosols 105
salmonella spp are hardy organisms that are well adapted to surviving in the environment 31 they are able to proliferate rapidly at high ambient temperatures in waste milk colostrum and moist feeds in the absence of direct sunlight or predation by other microorganisms salmonella spp can survive in wet or dry substrates or on surfaces for years particularly if they are protected by biological films such as dried saliva milk or fat biological films also protect organisms from the action of chemical disinfectants in an experiment that simulated a barn floor under defecating cows salmonella spp were shown to survive for 55 years 72 these researchers also found s typhimurium in an empty slurry pit that had not been used for 4 years because salmonella spp that infect cattle can infect and proliferate in the intestinal tracts of most other animals in a farm environment including other livestock humans domestic pets rodents and birds these other species may also be involved in disease transmission for example allowing cats access to stored feeds has been identified as a risk factor for salmonella outbreaks 26 serotypes that frequently infect cattle are typically introduced into a herd by subclinical or incubating carrier animals and only occasionally in feedstuffs many of the other serotypes imported onto farms in purchased feedstuffs appear unable to establish viable transmission cycles between cattle instead causing only sporadic infectionsof special note is that salmonella spp and c parvum infections in livestock present significant zoonotic disease risks to in-contact people and in turn to their contacts particularly young children the elderly and the immunocompromised because of these significant health risks indirect and direct contact between susceptible individuals and livestock potentially infected with these agents should be minimized hands should be washed well using soap and warm water and scrubbing for 15 seconds followed by an alcohol-based antiseptic hand rub 50 before eating or returning to the household inhalation of potentially contaminated dusts or aerosols particularly those generated by cleaning procedures such as high-pressure washing should be minimized to reduce the likelihood of introducing these agents into the household and their transmission to susceptible humans or domestic pets equipment outer garments and footwear exposed to potentially infected animals and their discharges should not be brought into the householdas a major bacterial component of feces from warm-blooded animals e coli are ubiquitous in the environment of neonatal beef and dairy calves all e coli types can cause colisepticemia but relatively few can cause enteric disease enteric e coli infections are classified into several forms including enterotoxigenic enteropathogenic enteroinvasive enterohemorrhagic and enteroadherent 53 enterotoxigenic e coli are the most common form associated with disease in calves the ability of enterotoxigenic e coli to cause severe herd outbreaks of diarrhea in calves results from the expression of virulence factors including adhesins pili fimbria and enterotoxins adhesins eg k99 f41 k88 are surface molecules that enable the bacteria to attach to specific receptors located on the intestinal epithelium of calves less than 3 days old once attached to intestinal cells via adhesins bacterial expression of enterotoxins triggers intestinal fluid secretion in excess of absorptive capacity in addition to enteric diseases caused by e coli systemic invasion by certain strains can result in septic shock and low-grade diarrhea diarrhea observed in these calves is generally thought to be due to endotoxemia secondary to bacteremia rather than production of enterotoxinsalthough not as hardy as salmonella spp e coli survive well on typical farm environmental surfaces and in feces and dust protected from moisture and direct sunlight 8 58 in experimentally inoculated cow manure or fresh slurry under common farm environmental conditions both organisms decrease by one log in 1 to 3 weeks 42 depending on the surface characteristics the numbers of organisms decline at about 025 log per day generally the rate of decline is slower at lower humidity but proliferation can occur on surfaces under saturated conditions with minimal organic nutrients 05 mgl exposure to ultraviolet components in direct sunlight rapidly kills the organism 24rotavirus is a double-stranded nonenveloped rna virus rotaviruses are the most common cause of bovine neonatal diarrhea the incidence of infection often approaching 100 in herds and up to one half of infections resulting in clinical disease infection usually occurs between 4 and 14 days of age although younger and older calves can be affected 66 because the median infectious dose for rotaviral infections in other species is 10 infectious particles or less 36 103 the infectious dose for neonatal calves is likely similar viral invasion of small intestinal villus epithelium occurs through the luminal surface resulting in cell destruction and shedding of damaged cells into the intestinal lumen as a consequence of this infection route the incubation period is short and large numbers of virus particles are produced rapidly within 48 hours of initial infection the virus can reach 11010 ten billion virus particles per gram of feces villous atrophy and cellular damage result in maldigestion and malabsorption maldigestion results from the loss of hydrolytic enzymes produced by mature villous cells failure to hydrolyze milk lactose results in lactose transit into the large intestine where it acts osmotically pulling water into the intestinal lumen in addition to decreased enzyme activity sodium and water transport processes are impaired resulting in malabsorption some rotavirus strains are pneumotropic replicating in the respiratory tract and transmitting via inhalation and by the fecal-oral route rotavirus is carried in adult cattle through nonclinical infection with intermittent fecal shedding 47 shedding increases coincident with later stages of gestation and for up to 4 weeks postpartum in some management situations this maternal shedding may account for most virus exposures to neonatal calves 28being a nonenveloped rna virus rotavirus is relatively stable in the environment being infectious in feces for up to 6 months at 25c in smears of human feces human rotavirus was more stable at lower temperatures and at humidity extremes 59 infectious particles declined by 1 log in 29 days at 4c and 93 relative humidity in 16 days at 4c and 13 relative humidity in 22 days at 20c and 55 relative humidity and in 15 days at 37c and 13 relative humidity some research suggests that bovine rotavirus may be more resistant than human rotavirus virus stability in water varies with water quality and temperature ranging from being very stable in clean water at 4c to falling 2 logs in 10 days in typical river water at 20c 84 as temperatures above 60c are lethal to the virus 68 standard milk pasteurization procedures are effective against it rotavirus is susceptible to sufficient concentrations of sodium hypochlorite 1750 ppm but is relatively resistant to many common disinfectants such as chlorhexidine under the same exposure conditions because as a nonenveloped virus it is not affected by soaps washing with soap alone may actually spread the virus around on the washed surface 23coronavirus is an enveloped single-stranded rna virus and is not as stable in the environment as rotavirus 27 serologic studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of serum antibodies to coronavirus approaches 100 in adult beef and dairy cattle calves are typically infected by coronavirus between 4 and 30 days of life 66 although they may not be the same virus strains evidence is mounting that a respiratory form as well as the enteric form occurs 97 similar to rotavirus infection results in damage to intestinal villous epithelium however infection by coronavirus often results in more severe disease manifestations because the degree of villous atrophy is greater and both the large and small intestines are affected as described for rotavirus coronavirus is carried in adult cattle through nonclinical infection and is shed in fecal matter because of their envelope these viruses retain infectiousness better at lower rather than higher relative humidity 24 and are considerably more sensitive to soaps and common disinfectants than are nonenveloped viruses this virus is more active in the colder climates and has been reported to cause winter dysentery in adult cattle 16 27 control of coronavirus and rotavirus infections in calves relies on continual presence of a protective antibody within the gut lumen which can be achieved by allowing neonates to ingest colostrum or milk containing these specific antibodies from their dams lactogenic immunity 19
cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of neonatal calf diarrhea between 7 and 21 days of age rarely causing diarrhea at less than 7 or more than 28 days of age 22 similar to rotavirus and coronavirus infection the incidence of infection with cryptosporidia often approaches 100 in the first month of life infection often occurs concurrently with rotavirus and coronavirus infections and a respiratory form may occur unlike most other enteric protozoa cryptosporidium are immediately infectious when passed and can infect other susceptible hosts through direct contact because cryptosporidium can autoinfect the original host the infectious dose can be exceedingly small for example the median infectious dose for humans is only 87 oocysts 29 and some researchers suggest it is even lower for neonatal calves cryptosporidia infect and invade enterocytes in the distal small intestine causing villous atrophy and fusion that result in malabsorption and maldigestion infected calves may shed 105 to 107 oocysts per gram of feces beginning with the onset of clinical signs importantly fecal shedding can continue days after clinical signs subside in california beef cowcalf herds atwill et al 7 found that higher stocking densities longer calving periods and wetter seasons were associated with higher fecal shedding prevalences in calves research findings on the adult carrier state are conflicting because some have found that adult carrier animals are common 92 whereas others have found that few if any asymptomatic adult cattle apparently shed cryptosporidium parvum in appreciable numbers 6 55 undoubtedly infected calves are likely the most important reservoir for continuing the fecal-oral cycle on most farms because of the large numbers of oocysts that they excrete in close proximity to susceptible calves 22in the environment cryptosporidia are extremely resistant to most veterinary disinfectants except 5 ammonia 6 hydrogen peroxide or 10 formalin 14 86 107 they survive well in water requiring 4 to 11 weeks to decline by 1 log 15 because the oocysts adhere in large numbers to the plastic and rubber surfaces of common calf-feeding and treatment equipment such as nipples bottles and buckets er atwill dvm phd 2001 personal communication common sanitation procedures are not likely to prevent fomite transmission by these items a portion of the oocysts still retain their infectivity after mild freezing 30 on the other hand complete drying in thin naturally infected fecal smears on wood kills the oocysts within 1 to 4 days 2 finally because moist heating at 45c for 20 minutes kills the oocysts 3 standard pasteurization procedures eg 63c for 30 minutes 72c for 15 seconds are effective
eimeria bovis and e zurnii are the species of coccidia most commonly associated with calf diarrhea with a prepatent period of approximately 17 days calves exposed to an infectious dose shortly after birth can present with bloody diarrhea and anemia by the third week of life diagnosis is easiest in calves with acute infections because many shed large numbers of oocysts in the feces chronically infected calves may only shed small to moderate numbers of oocysts in the stool however making diagnosis more difficultthe presence of developmental congenital or heritable abnormalities in a calf can be a risk factor depending on the character location and degree of the defect certainly any abnormality that prevents a calf from functioning normally eg ambulating or obtaining adequate nutrition can increase the chance of a severe enteric infectionfailure of passive transfer of maternal immunity through colostrum ingestion is a major risk factor for development of neonatal diarrhea 21 56 in the 1992 us department of agriculture national dairy heifer evaluation project wells et al 108 found that feeding a sufficient amount of colostrum soon enough after birth prevented 31 of the dairy heifer mortality that occurred in the first 21 days of life colostrum provides the necessary components of immunity during the time when a calf is immunonaive yet exposed to pathogens in its environment consumption of colostral immunoglobulin from resident cows in a herd is likely to provide immunologic protection specific to the strains of pathogens found within that herd importantly even if colostral immunoglobulin specificity is appropriate for specific pathogens maximum protection is ultimately dependent on the ingestion and absorption of an adequate mass of immunoglobulin by the calf immunoglobulin concentration varies from breed to breed however as well as from cow to cow within a breed such differences are well illustrated by the fact that the average concentration of immunoglobulin in beef cow colostrum is 2 to 3 times greater than that of dairy cow colostrum 73 106 as expected the most important factor involved in failure of passive transfer in dairy calves is low immunoglobulinconcentration colostrum whereas in beef calves delayed suckling is a leading cause 12 for dairy cows colostrum that is not from first milking from cows that leaked milk or from cows that weighed more than 20 lb should not be used for passive transfer 73 in certain situations beef calves may be provided alternate sources of colostrum including colostrum obtained from nearby dairies again it is imperative to appreciate that because the average immunoglobulin concentration of dairy cow colostrum is low compared with beef cow colostrum an adequate volume 4 l of appropriately selected dairy cow colostrum must be fed in addition one must also consider the risk of introducing novel pathogens when supplementing calves with an off-farm source of nonpasteurized colostrum unless properly pasteurized dairy colostrum purchased for administration to beef calves in place of their dams colostrum may be contaminated with infectious doses of undesirable infectious agents such as mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis as well as the enteric agents of concern described in this articlethe nutritional status of the dam particularly during late gestation when the fetus is active metabolically and growing exponentially is often of concern in relation to the immune status and health of the calf after birth 21 the effect of nutrition and other factors such as dystocia on passive transfer in dairy cattle was recently reviewed by quigley and drewry 75 there is little evidence of a direct link between gestational cow nutrition and immunoglobulin concentration of the calves 71 the weak calf syndrome however has been reported in beef cattle when prepartum cows consuming diets deficient in protein or energy protein-energy malnutrition either because of improper feeding practices or other factors such as severe weather events in late gestation subsequently calve in environments in which the temperature is below the thermoneutral zone of the calf 67 69 therefore it is only logical to recommend that producers provide feeds adequate in quantity and quality to meet national research council requirements for beef cattle and dairy cattle during gestation and lactationin comparison with beef calves dairy calves are often fed milk replacer diets because the cost is lower than that of cows milk the composition and quality of milk replacers varies considerably however much to the detriment of very young calves with limited digestive capabilities some milk replacers contain heat-denatured milk-origin proteins poorly digestible vegetable-origin proteins or nonlactose carbohydrate sources that the intestinal enzymes of neonatal calves cannot digest consumption of such products frequently results in inadequate nutrition poor growth rates and high morbidity and mortality due to enteric diseases 83 often the feeding recommendations for even high-quality milk replacers are designed for 60-lb calves rather than the average 90-lb holstein calf placing the larger calves into a negative energy and protein balance until their starter consumption increases sufficiently nutrition of the neonatal calf is an active area of research much of which has been summarized by davis and drackley 21 and changes in nutritional guidelines often reduce the risk of neonatal disease in addition excellent reviews on the relationship between neonatal digestive physiology and the different ingredients contained in milk replacers are available 37 82if nonsaleable milk is fed it should be pasteurized before feeding to reduce the likelihood of transmitting these and other infectious enteric agents a recent study found that raw milk and mixed milk replacer often contain high numbers of bacteria ranging from 103 colony-forming units cfusml for mixed milk replacer to more than 106 cfusml for hospital milk 94 another study found that calves fed pasteurized waste milk perform better in terms of weight gain mortality morbidity and health costs than those fed the same milk raw even in the absence of the specific enteric agents of concern discussed in this article 45 pasteurization controls their milk-borne transmission as wellfinally the source of calves is a risk factor for enteric diseases when calves have been commingled from several sources or origins certainly calves purchased from sale yards are more likely to have been exposed to higher concentrations and to a wider variety of pathogens compared with single-source calves or calves on pasture frequently calves are purchased from market sources to graft onto cows that have lost their own offspring such purchased calves often introduce new strains of infectious agents that then spread through the herd in an outbreak fashion making the situation considerably worse in addition to increased exposure to pathogens calves transiting through sale yards are likely to be under more severe physiologic stress and more likely to have had failure of passive transfer 106 a study of beef cowcalf herds found that purchasing such calves at less than 4 weeks of age increased the likelihood of a high-mortality diarrhea outbreak over four-fold 91the primary risk factors associated with infectious agents that cause enteric infections include specific virulence factors the size of the inoculum or pathogen load and whether single or multiple infections existas mentioned previously virulence factors associated with bacteria include structural elements such as pili that allow bacteria to attach to the host as well as bacterial products that augment bacterial cell growth enhance host cell damage or negate the immune response of the host both exotoxins and endotoxins can have adverse effects other virulence factors of enteric bacteria include those that enhance bacterial ability to resist antimicrobial agents through expression of drug resistance plasmids or integronsvirulence factors associated with enteric viruses or protozoa are less well described different strains or serotypes of viruses have been identified however most strains of a particular virus appear to act similarly the challenge load of enteric bacteria protozoa and viruses from periparturient cattle is high because of the aforementioned physiologic immunosuppression 28when considering biosecurity or biocontainment it is critical to realize that the size of the inoculum or the pathogen concentration exposure dose is a major factor in determining the degree of clinical disease and the rapidity of its onset rather than whether exposure occurs this is especially true when considering the ubiquitous agents involved in bovine neonatal diarrhea because none are extraordinarily virulent in their own right it is logical to conclude that a large enough exposure dose such as that likely to occur during outbreaks will undoubtedly overwhelm even the best passive transfer of immunity and lead to an expanding outbreak in previously unaffected calvesrisk factors for neonatal diarrhea associated with the environment of the calf are likely to be the most amenable to the implementation of specific biosecurity measures specific risk factors include the atmospheric conditions temperature humidity wind chill ventilation air quality and so forth housing individual calf hutches enclosed group pens dispersal on pasture the physical environment calving area bedding other animals cleaning protocols and so forth stocking density general hygiene and hygiene related to feeding practices and miscellaneous stresses due to handling surgery transportation and the likemany of these potential risk factors are under management control because of the difficulty of executing rigorously designed large-scale studies with sufficient herd numbers to evaluate all potential risk factors reasoning from biological plausibility is often the only basis for developing interventions when sufficient evidence is not available although some findings are conflicting a limited number of field studies of different size and rigor do provide guidance for some of these risk factors for example bendali et al 11 found that cleaning of the calving area immediately before calving was associated with an increased risk of neonatal diarrhea in beef calves compared with not cleaning it whereas cleaning it after calving was associated with a decreased risk they also found that greater cow cleanliness was associated with decreased risk based on data from the 1997 us department of agriculture national beef cow-calf study sanderson and dargatz 88 reported that although 41 of birth-to-weaning mortality was attributable to dystocia 11 was due to confined calving in the 1992 us department of agriculture national dairy heifer evaluation project wells et al 108 found that separating heifers from their dams within the first 24 hours after birth prevented 16 of the dairy heifer mortality that occurred during the first 21 days of life quigely et al 76 found that calves administered sufficient amounts of colostrum and housed in individual calf hutches shed fewer enteric pathogens in their feces than calves left to nurse their dam and housed in an enclosed space with mechanical ventilation schumann et al 91 found that increased risk of neonatal diarrhea in beef calves was associated with wintering cows and primigravida heifers together providing limited shelter to nursing pairs and an increased percentage of poorly drained ground in the nursing area although the occurrence of diarrhea was not affected sivula et al 95 found that increased gain was associated with all-in all-out group management of weaned dairy calvessufficient ventilation is important to the health of housed calves 5 104 besides being critical for removal of transpired water vapor and reducing humidity sufficient ventilation in enclosed housing also removes infectious aerosols reducing humidity can also reduce the survival time of aerosolized and surface-borne infectious agents although more important for respiratory disease these factors in turn have an effect on the risk of enteric disease because salmonellosis cryptosporidiosis rotavirus and coronavirus agents can be transmitted by aerosols procedures that produce aerosols pressure washing housing flush systems considerably increase the risk of transmission 9 for example mohammed et al 60 found that dairy calves raised outside or in mechanically ventilated buildings were five-fold less likely to shed cryptosporidia parvum oocysts than those raised in nonventilated barnswithin the calfs environment other animal species may function as mechanical or biological vectors of enteric infectious agents particularly if they are present in large numbers and no control efforts are in effect these species include domestic pets humans and vermin such as insects rodents and birdsone of the most overlooked vectors that presents a significant disease transmission risk is the nuisance fly particularly the house fly musca domestica
35 during summer months before severe frosts fly populations typically increase to high numbers around concentrated livestock operations such as dairies and calf-raising operations liquids such as diarrhea and milk or materials containing soluble components such as dried molasses and solid feces are attractive to nuisance flies because the larvae require greater than 90 humidity to develop dampened organic calf bedding materials such as straw and sawdust provide an ideal substrate 89 90 the ability of these insects to transmit enteric pathogens from feces is well documented 18 49 specific physical characteristics of flies including mouth parts body hairs and spines and sticky foot pads can carry infectious agents in large numbers some pathogens pass through the fly digestive tract and remain viable in its feces when feeding the fly frequently moistens surfaces by regurgitating a vomit drop from its crop that contains residue including infectious agents from its previous meal fly spots are either such vomit drops or feces both of which contain high numbers of infectious agents studies have determined that flies are attracted to diarrheic feces that they can transmit cryptosporidia in numbers higher than the minimal infectious dose for healthy humans and that they can harbor this agent for 3 weeks after exposure 34 methods for controlling fly populations at different points in their life cycle have been reviewed 99 however it is important to point out that control methods based on chemical means alone are usually inadequate because flies readily develop resistance to such chemicalsrodents are also a frequently overlooked source of enteric pathogens in the farm environment they have been implicated in the transmission of salmonellosis in dairy 98 and beef herds 44 and even in poultry flocks 20 41 because the feces from infected mice typically contain up to 1104 salmonella per pellet 20 a single pellet may exceed the infectious dose for a susceptible calf current work suggests that rodents are a significant nonlivestock reservoir of cryptosporidium because approximately one third of rodents of any age even in nonlivestock ecosystems shed c parvum at an average of 1103 oocysts per fecal pellet 77 101 importantly significant rodent populations can be present long before their signs eg rodent droppings and runways are obvious or noticeable raccoons have also been reported to harbor s typhimurium 64those calves that are known to be particularly susceptible either because of age or other reasons should be isolated from each other and the rest of the herd as much as possible once infected particularly if infected clinically such calves essentially act as biological amplifiers amplifying a small but sufficient infectious dose into a much higher level of environmental contamination in their immediate surroundings and providing a high risk for transmission through direct contact because this increased environmental load likely exceeds the infectious dose threshold of individuals that were resistant to the prior environmental level more individuals become infected the infections are more severe because of the markedly higher dose the environmental level increases even more and an outbreak is underway evidence of such a cascade is provided in one study of herds in which calves that were born after the median calving date were twice as likely to develop diarrhea than those born before it 17 once started such a cascade is much more difficult to stop as compared with preventing its initiation in the first place evidence that members of larger groups are at increased risk of diarrhea is contained in a study of michigan dairies which found that the incidence of calf diarrhea was approximately proportional to herd size 32 this finding suggests that group sizes should be minimized as much as feasible some researchers suggesting that the ideal group size is 50 70all the common agents causing neonatal calf diarrhea are often present to some degree in the calves environment all of the agents are primarily transmitted by fecal-oral contact so the collective strategy for minimizing exposure of calves to pathogens should be focused on decreasing exposure to fecal contamination realizing that every ranch or farm has its own peculiarities regarding facilities and equipment the following comments and suggestions should be read as general statements specific modifications should be individually designed to fit each production systemregarding dairy or beef herds calving in confined areas such as barns the following biosecurity measures should be practiced to minimize pathogen exposure1remove late-gestation cows from areas heavily contaminated with feces such as winter feed grounds 1 month before calving to reduce hair coat carriage of enteric infectious agents shed by carrier cattle2separate cows requiring more intensive monitoring and thus closer confinement such as first-calf heifers or particularly valuable stock from those that do not3avoid moving cows into calving areas until immediately before delivery or as late as practical4ensure that calving pens are sanitized and well bedded before and between successive calvings5clean the perineum and particularly the udder of cows before delivery6harvest colostrum from clean sanitized udders into clean containers refrigerate it immediately or freeze in volumes no larger than a gallon if not administered to a calf promptly do not pool between dams7remove dairy calves immediately after birth and raise them in separate individual pens isolated from other calves and stock until they are older than 4 weeks8remove beef cowcalf pairs to a separate nursery area after bonding has occurred approximately 24 hours after birth
during the liquid-feeding phase from birth until weaning dairy calves should be housed in individual pens or hutches to avoid contact with one another and they should be isolated from other livestock their airspace and their effluent ideally individual housing should be designed to prevent suckling and licking behaviors as well as fecal cross-contamination so that transmission of enteric pathogens is minimized the specifics regarding the construction and area requirements for dairy calves have been reviewed 57 calves should continue to be housed individually until 7 to 10 days after weaning this separation allows calves to lose their suckling urge avoids the stress at weaning of changing social structure and interactions facilitates monitoring of feed intake during the weaning transition and allows more accurate observations of fecal characteristics and general health 63biosecurity of dairy or beef herds calving at pasture is approached with the following strategy1group primigravid heifers separately from cows during at least the last trimester of gestation2use designated calving grounds and calve heifers separately from cows such areas should not have been used by animals since the prior years calving season and should have been groomed shortly after the close of the calving season it should be well drained and situated away from bottomlands which tend to collect contaminants particularly in any standing water3minimize the population density of cows as much as practical and reduce group size 50 animals suggested areas per cow range from 1000 to 2000 square feet 794remove beef cowcalf pairs to a separate nursery area after bonding but within 24 hours of calving exercise one-way flow regarding animal movement5rotate feeding areas during the calving season to avoid fecal contamination and pathogen build-up
calves demonstrating signs of lethargy or diarrhea should be removed from the group as soon as possible and placed into an isolation area recall the iceberg principle and consider its group of cows and calves and their area contaminated placing subsequently calving cows and new calves into a separate clean area treatments should be instituted based on physical signs and if possible laboratory data diagnostic procedures such as fecal cultures fecal flotation and viral identification strategies can be performed these tests are especially important when infection with salmonella spp is a major rule out for diarrhea identification of rotavirus and coronavirus infection and cryptosporidiosis are arguably less essential for diagnostic purposes because in most outbreaks of acute undifferentiated diarrhea calves frequently shed one two or all three of the agents simultaneously detection of an infectious agent in a herd known through laboratory testing to be previously free of it however indicates that there has been a breach of herd biosecurity recovering calves should be quarantined away from other animals until after the shedding of pathogens has decreased to minimal levels or for at least 3 weeks aside from salmonella spp the neonatal enteric pathogens with the longest shedding time are rotavirus and coronavirus which some individuals may shed intermittently for lifepurchased animals should be placed in separate quarantine areas before mixing with existing herd animals especially if animals are purchased from public auctions because the likelihood that these animals have been exposed to high doses of multiple pathogens is great explosive outbreaks of calf scours in beef herds are often associated with the prior purchase of a dairy calf from a sale yard to replace a calf lost because of dystocia or some other reason a quarantine period of 21 days should be adequate to allow clinical identification of animals that are incubating any infection due to these enteric agents at the time of purchase quarantine of older animals for a similar period is justified because of the likelihood of increased shedding of enteric pathogens during periods of stress diagnostic procedures such as bacterial culture viral detection by electron microscopy and fecal flotation for parasite eggs can also be considered although it is unlikely that these tests will give a significant advantage compared with clinical observation and isolation they can determine the etiologic agents involved use of such tests in older animals is less beneficial because with the exception of salmonella spp many infected older animals shed low levels of enteric viruses because of the potential for false-negative results testing may lead to a false sense of security and management practices that are more important for establishing biosecurity may not be established and maintainedthe flow of personnel and livestock flow are important components of within-herd biosecurity 39 40 70 100 the critical first step is to establish infection control protocols preferably with input from those who will be responsible for executing them routine training and monitoring of personnel to ensure that they understand infection control protocols and that they are properly executing them are critical to biosecurity success because some aspects of these protocols involve significant additional effort an understanding of why the additional effort is necessary will likely result in better adherence personnel and equipment flow as well as livestock flow and its effluent flow should be one-way away from the youngest most susceptible calves toward older more resistant animals on farms with sufficient personnel and equipment tasks should be divided up between those personnel who remain clean for such tasks as mixing and delivering liquid feed and those who are potentially contaminated by performing tasks such as picking up empty milk bottles treating sick calves and so on personnel who are potentially contaminated through working with older or sick calves and their equipment should not return to areas with susceptible calves until they have changed their outer clothes and used appropriate procedures to thoroughly disinfect their hands boots and equipment some have recommended that calves that leave young susceptible groups such as for hospitalization should not return to that group for at least 3 weeks 100strict control of farm visitors must be maintained because many pathogens can be carried by humans or inanimate objects such as automobiles tractors livestock handling equipment or livestock feeding equipment for both their own and the animals health visitors should be discouraged from coming into contact with them or their effluent if animal contact is necessary visiting individuals should be provided with the means to wash their hands and footwear before and after contact barrier clothing should also be worn to prevent cross-contamination of separate facilitiesneonatal diarrhea is a multifactorial disease process infection alone is not sufficient to cause disease because although almost all calves are infected shortly after birth most do not develop clinical disease as mentioned previously the single strongest factor influencing the risk of death caused by neonatal calf diarrhea is the passive immune status of the calfthe concept of failure of passive transfer has largely been used to describe situations in which the neonate does not absorb adequate levels of colostral immunoglobulins this concept is undoubtedly attributable to the fact that immunoglobulins are such a large constituent of colostrum and they have been thoroughly studied it is clear however that colostrum is a complex fluid that in addition to immunoglobulins contains various immune cells immunoactive substances such as cytokines and nutritional elements consequently the risk of a calf contracting an enteric pathogen is a complex equation in which serum immunoglobulin concentrations are an important factor albeit a single onelow immunoglobulinconcentration colostrum with the resultant ingestion of an inadequate mass of immunoglobulin is the primary cause of failure of passive transfer in dairy calves in a study of 900 first-milking colostrums from holstein cows only 29 contained sufficient igg1 concentration to provide an appropriate mass of igg in a 2-l volume 73 it is currently recommended that dairy calves be fed 4 liters of dairy colostrum in the first 12 hours of life to obviate the risk of failure of passive transfer caused by a lack of adequate immunoglobulin mass to ensure intake soon enough esophageal feeders are often used to administer these volumesin contrast with dairy calves failure of passive transfer in beef calves is less likely to be due to low colostral igg1 concentration but rather to a failure to physically ingest and subsequently absorb the colostral immunoglobulins beef calves should be provided with adequate shelter during and after calving to avoid environmental stresses that lessen the calves drive to rise and nurse ideally calving should be monitored to ensure adequate mothering which is especially important with first-calf heifers calves that do not rise and successfully nurse their dam within 1 to 2 hours should be assisted with nursing or alternatively force-fed either their dams colostrum or frozen dairy cow colostrum if dairy cow colostrum is used its low average immunoglobulin concentration must be mitigated by feeding 4 liters within the first 12 hours of life the producer must be aware that such colostrum may also be contaminated with enteric and other infectious agents eg mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis
stress is defined as any adverse stimulus event or condition either internal or external that disturbs an animals physical or neurogenic homeostasis although there are likely numerous biological consequences of stress a well-documented response involves the rapid and immediate increase in corticotropin secretion by the anterior pituitary gland followed by greatly increased secretion of cortisol by the adrenal gland some of the beneficial effects of increased cortisol secretion include mobilization of labile proteins and fats from cellular stores for cellular energy needs as well as numerous anti-inflammatory effects that aid in the resolution of inflammation one of the more notable consequences of increased cortisol secretion however involves its extensive effects leading to immune suppression in general cortisol-induced atrophy of lymphoid tissues throughout the body leads to a significant decrease in both cellular and humoral immunity it is this broad-ranging immune suppression that can lead to an increased incidence and severity of diseasecommon stresses incurred by neonatal calves include dystocia crowding exposure to environmental extremes such as heat cold or wet conditions excessive or inappropriate handling and exposure to pathogens 48 even the process of a normal parturition is a stressful condition as the fetal animal undergoes transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life fetal plasma cortisol levels double within minutes after uncomplicated parturition but typically decrease within the first days of life the natural increase in plasma cortisol is necessary for normal pulmonary intestinal and brain development pulmonary surfactant production and preparation of liver glycogen stores for energy needs calves with dystocia are likely to have temporarily increased plasma cortisol levels and other significant laboratory abnormalities including metabolic and respiratory acidosis and hypoglycemia 13 current studies indicate that the increased incidence of failure of passive transfer in calves with dystocia is not caused by a failure to absorb colostral immunoglobulins but rather is due to the severe metabolic derangements that make these calves less likely to nurse in a timely fashion 106 alleviation of the stress of dystocia therefore should be directed toward correcting metabolic derangements and ensuring appropriate colostral intakeexposure to environmental extremes is likely to affect calves adversely by inhibiting normal nursing behavior and producing prolonged elevations in serum cortisol levels both of these factors clearly have an adverse effect on the calves immune status so newborn calves should be placed in sheltered environments that are free from wind and moisture and extremes of heat or cold providing calves with dry bedding is a critical factor in preventing problems associated with cold temperatures 69 however these shelters must be managed appropriately to minimize the concentration of enteric pathogens within themcrowding and mishandling of calves should be minimized to lessen the effect of neurogenic stress although limited research in this area has been undertaken in calves it is logical to assume that calves would react similarly to other mammals in such stressful situations with resultant increased plasma cortisol levels and subsequent immune suppression finally it is logical to presume that minimizing crowding will likely not only decrease the neurogenic stress of calves but also will unquestionably decrease exposure to enteric pathogenswith either confined or pasture calving it is important to keep adequate records records are useful for determining the timing of animal movement and for identifying the epidemiologic factors associated with sick animals as well as recording what diagnostic tests were performed when and what treatments were administered and their results particularly on larger operations complete records maintained in a computerized database are crucial for initially determining what risk factors are associated with a neonatal diarrhea problem and then for monitoring the success of interventionsbiosecurity as it relates to neonatal gastrointestinal disease should be approached as a fluid concept adequate records markedly enhance a producers and a veterinarians ability to regularly evaluate and revise neonatal disease control and prevention protocols in response to changing conditions actual risks and new knowledge and tools for dealing with neonatal enteric diseaseinfectious diarrhea is an important cause of neonatal calf morbidity and mortality that results in significant economic losses in the beef and dairy industries although numerous risk factors related to the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea have been identified they can all be categorized into those that are related to the calf the pathogens involved or the environment of the calf the immune status of calves specifically the level of passively acquired immunity through colostrum is the major risk factor related to the calf and the occurrence of diarrhea although numerous pathogens have been implicated in the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea only a relatively limited number are commonly involved most should be viewed as secondary opportunists rather than primary pathogens because none are extraordinarily virulent and with the exception of salmonella spp most are present within the gastrointestinal tract of many healthy mature cattle important risk factors related to pathogens involved in neonatal calf diarrhea involve the size of the inoculum and the occurrence of multiple infections finally when considering the environment and housing conditions in which beef and dairy calves may reside it is clear that tremendous variations exist despite these variations the risk factors associated with the environment of the calf are also those that are the most amenable to the implementation of general environmental control and monitoring strategies as well as specific biosecurity measuresa disinfectant is an agent that will destroy or eliminate from inanimate objects all pathogens except bacterial endospores a sterilant will destroy or eliminate pathogens including bacterial endospores from inanimate objects disinfectants include products that are virucidal bactericidal and fungicidal sterilants are biocidal because by definition they will kill all living organisms both pathogenic and nonpathogenic the term germicide is synonymous with disinfectantmicroorganisms have different levels of resistance to chemical disinfection resistance varies with the type of organism for instance bacterial spores are very difficult to kill whereas the hiv virus is rather easy to eradicate on hard surfaces infectious prions eg the causative agent in bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease are not included in this group because the prion is technically not a cellular microorganism but rather a protein at this time there are no documented chemical or physical agents that will inactivate these infectious proteins similarly there is no registered germicide that can with certainty kill pinworm eggs although a simple ammonia solution will kill the ova of other parasites eg cryptosporidium parvum2table 1 lists types of microorganisms in descending order of resistance to chemical germicides a germicide at a given level of effectiveness should inactivate or kill all organisms located at that level and on the lower levels of resistance apart from prions and parasite ova bacterial spores are the life form that is most difficult to kill so the food and drug administration fda uses biological indicators that contain bacterial spores to prove sterilizing efficacy notice that this list does not contain protozoan cysts pinworm eggs are very persistent in the laboratory animal facility and are usually able to tolerate chemical germicides to rid a facility of the cysts it is advisable to consider cooking them with steam heat like an egg they will harden and become inactive when heatedin the us the environmental protection agency epa registers commercially manufactured disinfectants under regulations set forth in the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra as amended3 chemical disinfectants are referred to as pesticides in these federal actsthe first fifra enacted in 1947 was essentially a truth-in-advertising law because its goal was to protect the public from false or exaggerated claims made for certain products that were sold across state lines in 1972 the government extensively modified the fifra so that it now requires a manufacturer to submit not only an application but also a label clearly stating all claims test data from an epa-certified laboratory supporting these claims toxicology data a confidential statement of formula and precise use directions the confidential statement of formula will include specific ranges for every ingredient included in the product as well as a description of that ingredients function in the formulation the confidential statement must also list chemical abstracts service cas numbers and approved raw material vendors a pesticide label must include a list of active ingredients with their amounts storage and disposal information the label must also have precautionary statements first-aid instructions the manufacturers complete address and an epa registration number if a product does not have an epa registration number then it should not be used for disinfection in an animal-care areain 1982 the government once again amended the fifra to clarify terminology before this clarification a sporicide and a sterilant were two separate classifications a sporicide could have one failure out of 60 replicates in a sporicidal assay and the sterilant could have no failures in the same assay these new regulations considered sporicides and sterilants as the samethe fda classifies differently products that disinfect surfaces and those used to sterilize medical devices the fda registers products that are liquid sterilants and the epa registers products that are disinfectants epa-registered disinfectants may not be used as terminal sterilants on any surface or instrument that is introduced directly into the human body or that comes in contact with normally sterile areas of the body or the bloodstreama sterilant sporicide is capable of destroying all forms of microbial life sterilants are the most potent and are effective against all forms of vegetative bacteria bacterial spores fungi fungal spores and viruses an fda-registered liquid chemical sterilant will completely eradicate all of the microorganisms listed in table 1a high-level disinfectant should eradicate all microbes except for bacterial spores an intermediate-level disinfectant should eradicate enveloped viruses and all the less-resistant microbes a low-level disinfectant must kill only three species of bacteria salmonella choleraesuis staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa incredibly there is also a category of disinfectants below that of a low-level disinfectant these products called hospital disinfectants must only kill s choleraesuis and s aureusiodine compounds are disinfectants that can kill many kinds of microorganisms including both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses iodines appear to work by penetrating the cell wall of the organisms causing a disruption of the cell metabolism and function secondarily free iodine may bond in solution with the cell proteins to form salts4 iodine compounds are poor cleaners requiring the use of another chemical to clean the surface in addition iodines are relatively unstable in terms of contact time and light exposure and can permanently stain surfaces if not used properly extensively used during the 1960s iodines imparted a permanent brown discoloration to floors and walls perhaps most importantly of all iodophors are only active within tight brackets of concentration increasing the concentration may actually reduce the available iodine in the aqueous solution5 additionally microorganisms specifically pseudomonas cepacia have been cultured from full-strength povidoneiodine products6phenolic compounds are broad-spectrum disinfectants that can kill both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses as well as mycobacteria phenolics appear to kill microorganisms by penetrating the cell wall and acting as cell poisons or by denaturing the cells proteins4 these compounds are extremely corrosive and require exceptional precautions in handling phenolics are extremely hazardous to cats cause skin depigmentation and have posed human health problems47in the past the phenol coefficient has been the standard against which all other disinfectants were judged this standardization included comparing germicidal chemicals and provided an index to the concentration of other products the errors inherent in converting phenol coefficient numbers to effective dilutions of products for practical disinfection are so great that the procedure must be considered unsatisfactory particularly for nonphenolic compounds currently the association of official analytical chemists aoac use dilution test remains the standard for determining the efficacy of disinfectants however the government has provided funding to establish alternative assays each with an exact number of microorganisms per challenge these assays should soon be adoptedsodium hypochlorite sodium hypochlorite the active ingredient in bleach is perhaps the best example of a chlorine compound used as a disinfectant if used within some rather stringent parameters bleach is a very effective and relatively inexpensive virucidal product the mode of action of chlorine compounds is not fully understood chlorine compounds may actually cause cell death by a two-step process reacting with the cell protoplasm after forcing entry through the cell wall or perhaps by inhibiting the cell enzyme reactions and denaturing the cell proteins47people have used bleach as a disinfectant since the early 1800s ref 8 during world war i hd dakin advocated the use of a 050 solution of sodium hypochlorite for skin and open wound disinfection many contemporary primate laboratories have a prepared bottle of dakins solution in the emergency monkey bite kit the electro-alkaline company later the clorox company began the american production of commercially available sodium hypochlorite solution in 1913 hospitals and critical care facilities today accept sodium hypochlorite solution as an inexpensive disinfectant9concerns about the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite have involved the percentage of active chlorine required to provide antimicrobial properties reports from the field have shown that prepared bleach solutions rapidly lose potency under ambient laboratory conditions an organic soil load reduces sodium hypochlorites effectiveness as a disinfectant necessitating a precleaning step before disinfection bleach has an inherent corrosive effect on certain metals concrete and clothing and can pose problems for animals and personnelamong these problems is bleachs reactivity with acids releasing chlorine gas which is highly toxic it also reacts with organic soils eg feces to produce potentially carcinogenic compounds one resulting compound trihalomethane can be released as a toxic gas therefore supervisors must carefully consider the use of bleach and ensure when making up a bleachwater solution to maintain adequate chlorine concentrations ie 100 ppmsodium hypochlorite is highly reactive and degrades rather quickly thus as fig1 shows bleach rapidly loses its effectiveness as sodium hypochlorite degrades the quality assurance laboratory of pharmacal research laboratories conducted a test that simulated normal laboratory storage conditions we stored a simple solution of 180 sodium hypochlorite in an opaque bottle that was capped and left on a countertop in the laboratory to simulate a bleach bottle stored on the shelf at room temperature the overhead lights were turned on in the morning and off at night 5 days a week allowing for 9 h of illumination per day we locked the laboratory and left it vacant during the weekends for a 70-day period we analyzed daily samples from the bottle and recorded the percentage of active sodium hypochlorite in the sample our results showed an initial decelerating curve of degradation of the percentage of active sodium hypochloriteat 5 days the solution measured 1568 sodium hypochlorite at 20 days it was 1372 at 35 days the percentage was 1274 with the rate of degradation substantially decreased the shelf life of commercially available sodium hypochlorite mixtures bleach will depend on the storage facility temperature controls light controls etc facility managers should label and check the product regularly using available chlorine detection strips or test kitschlorine dioxide chlorine dioxide is available as a high-level disinfectant that has wide applicability not only in the animal-care field but also in the manufacturing and paper industries health officials used chlorine dioxide to remove the anthrax contamination in the hart senate building in 2001 manufacturers use it in toothpaste for instance as well as in paper and pulp manufacturing it is necessary to mix the product on site and its shelf-life is inherently short and of mixed product efficacychlorine dioxide is a free radical and a powerful oxidant that kills microbes by reacting with bacterial and viral amino acids chlorine dioxide requires a very short contact time but does not have inherent cleaning ability necessitating a precleaning stepall chlorine dioxide products currently available have inherent acidity and corrosive properties chlorine dioxides entry into the animal-care area has allowed supervisors to use one product rather than two or three different disinfectants to carry out the same process in a short period one should not confuse chlorine dioxide with chlorine gas they are two completely different chemicalsof the many disinfecting compounds currently available the quaternary ammonium compounds are the most widely used in animal facilities there are five possible modes of action for quaternary ammonium products denaturing cell proteins influencing cell metabolic reactions affecting cell permeability stimulating cell glycolysis reaction and affecting cell membrane enzyme activity710 they are relatively cost effective easy to use and if handled properly safer for animals and people than the other currently available disinfectants these compounds are generally not tuberculocidal the newest quaternary ammonium compounds generally meet most of the cleaning-disinfecting requirementsthe first generation of quaternary ammonium compounds became available in 1935 dilution with hard water or with the wrong type of soap or detergent can inactivate these earlier generation quaternary ammonium compounds therefore it is extremely important to obtain a quaternary disinfectant that has been properly compounded with compatible nonionic detergents which will not affect its disinfecting properties the newest generation quaternary ammonium compounds are generally blends of alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride adbac quaternary ammonium compounds rather than the old single-chain compounds a good quaternary ammonium compound should remain active as a virucidal fungicidal and bactericidal agent when subjected to the aoac use dilution test in 400 ppm hard water plus 5 organic serum the epa registration number on the label certifies only that the product is a disinfectant not that it is a cleaning product while quaternary ammoniums have inherent cleaning abilities the addition of a cleaning agent increases the ability of the product both to clean and to disinfectthe newer generation of quaternary ammonium compounds will kill some nonenveloped viruses as well as enveloped virusesa member of the aldehyde group that includes formaldehyde glutaraldehyde has limited use in the animal-care facility glutaraldehydes work by alkylating amino acids to alter rna dna and protein synthesis47 the necessary contact time required for high-level disinfection is quite long and there are several questions concerning the safety of these products for people and animals glutaraldehyde is tuberculocidal the tendency of glutaraldehydebased sterilants to induce contact dermatitis has led health care facilities to limit its use in recent years because of liability issues49alcohol products denature cell proteins to cause cell deathhowever they can quickly become ineffective in protein-rich environments because of their volatile characteristics the use of alcohol products as primary disinfectants has declined contact time for alcohol products can range up to several hours which can be difficult considering their highly evaporative nature also alcohols can damage rubber and plastic components4the search for the perfect disinfectant may lead to peroxygen products such as hydrogen peroxide which is a sterilant at the appropriate concentrations peroxygen compounds act as rapid oxidizers to cause cell death or inactivation once known as oxidized water or peroxymonosulfates peroxygen compounds have come to the laboratory animal care field as part of a search for products that are environmentally friendly and relatively low in toxicity for use around animals many of the peroxygen products leave no residuals and have excellent germicidal activities peroxygen products came to the forefront when foot-andmouth disease appeared in the united kingdom in 2000 these products are very strong oxidizers and their germicidal activity occurs quickly that is only a short contact time eradicates microbes peracetic acid is a peroxygen product hydrogen peroxide when used in the vapor phase is a sterilanta germicides epa registration number is a stamp of authenticity for the product under fifra the epa issues registration numbers for chemical disinfectants after reviewing the products claims of efficacy these claims result from testing in strict compliance with the requirements set by the epa which thoroughly reviews the data submitted about the product the epa will issue a registration number specific to the particular product only if all the necessary data have been submitted to support the claims once the epa issues a number the manufacturer may not alter the products chemical composition unless it provides the epa with test data proving the product still retains the capabilities to support the original claimsthe aoac use dilution test is an extensive evaluation of germicides that employs hard water with organic serum added in an attempt to simulate real-world worst-casescenario challenges this test assesses claims that a given germicide will kill vegetative bacteriatesting a product for its ability to deactivate spores is more extensive after inoculation of penicylinders porcelain cylinders and surgical loops with specific microorganisms one vacuum-dries them making the pathogen even more resistant to penetration and killing by the disinfectant then one exposes the cylinders or loops to the specific product in the proposed use dilution after a specified period which follows the manufacturers claims for kill time the testers are removed and placed in a culture medium the literature that the manufacturer submits to the epa will include the recommended exposure time for the product to achieve a complete kill the sporicidal test involves either b subtilis or c sporogenes analysts examine the resulting growth for the specific microorganism they repeat this process extensively and the chemical being tested must prevent growth in 60 of 60 tests for a total of 12 sets of tests involving 360 penicylinders and 360 surgical loops and three lots of each productcritics have questioned the efficacy of these tests in recent years inconsistencies are common within a testing lab and between various laboratories11 scientists have cultured the microorganisms in laboratories for generations and the cultures freshly isolated from the field the tests specify a minimum but not a maximum number of microorganisms per assay and this can of course drastically affect the test results the result has been perhaps a false sense of security about the effectiveness of particular products since 1991 the epa has been reevaluating the specific claims of many germicides some products that had been listed as sterilants before 1991 were reclassified as high-level disinfectants after these reevaluations see
wwwepagovpesticideswhen evaluating disinfectants for animal-care facilities the first concern should be finding the epa registration number claims for disinfectants that are unregistered may not be substantiated for instance household bleach is a common product found in many laboratory animal facilities only a few manufacturers of household bleach have epa-registered numbers for their products the other companies are manufacturing a product that will clean and brighten your clothes but may not disinfect your facility in fact the percentage of active ingredients in these products may be too low for effective sanitizingwithin the field of laboratory animal science the same registration numbers can appear on different chemical vendors products the vendor from whom you are purchasing the product may not hold the master registration number companies can subregister the formulation from the company holding the master label therefore a registration number or part of a registration number may be used on products with different names the epa must approve any subregistration and the subregistrant designs its own label after having received epa approval these labels cannot add any claims that the master label does not have and must be submitted to the holder of the master registration for approvalan epa registration number can look like this 1234-56 this number tells us that the company holding the master registration has an establishment number of 1234 and the 56 identifies the product a registration number of 1234-56-789 indicates that the product is subregistered the first set of numbers 1234 is the establishment number for the holder of the master registration the 56 identifies the product and the 789 is the subregistrants establishment numbera products epa registration number allows the user to obtain any necessary information on the product by consulting the list of registered pesticides in the united states from there one can determine who holds the master registration whether it is subregistered contact addresses and phone numbers and all active ingredients and their percentagescoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses from common cold all the way up to more severe diseases such as the middle east respiratory syndrome mers and the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which are known to cause severe respiratory and intestinal illnesses most of the coronaviruses live in animals however the sars outbreak in china between 2002 and 2003 had changed this fact when a coronavirus jumped from an animal reservoir and infected individuals from china at first and then exploded into a global pandemic of about 8000 cases and 774 deaths over a period of several months 1according to the center for disease and control prevention 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 are the most common human coronaviruses out of the seven viruses identified 2 covid-19 first identified in china is a new strain of coronaviruses that has not been previously identified in humans but was linked to animal sources the virus is believed to be transmitted from animals to humans at first and then from humans to humans through airborne droplets of infected patients fluids which has led the virus to infect and kill thousands of people and to raise international concernthe global distribution of covid-19 is expanding day by day fig 1 as per the world health organization situation report 3 according to the data updated on february 18 2020 the total number of confirmed cases has reached 72528 with 1870 deaths from china onlythe who risk assessment for acute public health events and disease transmission classified the risk of covid-19 transmission as very high high and high in china at a regional level and at a global level respectively 3 the european center for disease prevention and control has also reported high covid-19 transmission and potential outbreak impactsthe incubation period is estimated to be between 2 and 15 days and transmission from asymptomatic cases has been reported 4 more covid-19 cases are expected in the upcoming days due to the increase in screening and detection methods and the biggest threat to be considered here is the mobility of these infected individualsin order to understand the disease characteristics and outcomes huang et al 5 collected and analyzed data from 41 covid-19 confirmed patients according to them many of the early cases identified were linked to the huanan seafood and animal market in wuhan as 27 of the patients reported market exposure which suggests that a likely source of the new virus might have been an animala centers for disease control and prevention report explained that there is still unclear clinical picture about covid-19 as some of the infected patients will show no or mild symptoms such as shortness of breath cough and fever while others will start developing more serious complications like pneumonia and kidney failure 6 huang et al 5 also pointed out the similarities between the clinical presentation of covid-19 and sars as both diseases caused clusters of fatal pneumonia although the whole spectrum and pathophysiology of the new disease is still unknown the current evidence suggests that there is a high likelihood for patients to have intensive care unit admission or end up dyingli et al 7 addressed the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 cases by collecting and analyzing data from the first 425 laboratory-confirmed cases in wuhan the results showed that most of the infected cases were elderly males and with reported exposure to huanan seafood market or to another person with respiratory symptoms in addition most of those who died from the virus had underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes 7 the studys findings provide an overall useful look at the characteristics of covid-19 patients however they cannot eliminate the fact that some reported cases were females young individuals and with no previous contact or exposure which should also be addressed and considered in future studiesonce a suspected case is identified whether it is symptomatic or asymptomatic immediate isolation and multiple tests are required to detect covid-19 the who recommends clinical assessment for the signs and symptoms laboratory testing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and radiological examination to confirm the results and other associated complications 8 many researchers who traced confirmed cases reported the use of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test serological testing and metagenomics sequencing analysis 9 10 11transmission dynamics for covid-19 were assessed in different studies the initial assessment indicates that the source of this third zoonotic human coronavirus was the seafood and animal market in wuhan city china as they were selling live animals specifically bats where the virus was living and then crossed into a human being 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 although the studies confirmed the relationship between the animal market exposure and the infection li et al 7 pointed out the importance of considering human-to-human transmission as positive cases were confirmed from other geographical areas who have not been exposed to the seafood marketthe investigation of human-to-human transmission started later as transmission cases were reported from individuals within the same family members and from healthcare workers who were in direct contact with suspected or confirmed cases an article by phan et al 14 explains the possible human-to-human virus transmission as one family cluster of covid-19 was being reported the 65-year-old man with underlying health conditions had flown with his wife from wuhan to hanoi after the outbreak the man became ill with fever and fatigue 4 days after traveling and was tested positive for covid-19 after hospital admission his son who lives in another city and with no history of traveling to these regions was found to be positive as well and the investigation showed that he met his parents after they had traveled and stayed with them for 3 days this article explains the time frame of events very precisely and the possible transmission of the virus from the father to the son after the contact although the son has got the infection the mans wife and the 28 individuals contacted by the family during their travels were found to be healthy and tested negative to the virus which requires further explanations and studies to investigate the possible risk factors and the modes of transmission furthermore sequencing of strains from the father and son is needed to confirm the transmission between the twoanother study by chan et al 15 gave information about the risk of infection from close personal contact and estimated the disease incubation period by tracing the travel history of 5 family members who made a visit to wuhan city from december 29th until january 4th the studys clinical epidemiological laboratory and radiological findings confirmed covid-19 infection in the 5 members in addition to the sixths member who did not visit the city but was found to be infected as well suggesting a human-to-human transmissionthe basic reproduction number r0 for the disease transmission was calculated according to the european center for disease prevention and control 6and li et al 7 r0 for covid-19 is estimated to be 22 95 ci 14-39 which is more than 1 indicating infection transmission to the population and estimating that each covid-19 patient is transmitting the virus to 22 individuals another study by tang et al 4 estimated the basic reproduction number using multiple methods and reported large-scale outbreak with r0 equal to 647 95 ci 571-723 indicating higher transmission of covid-19 this high reproduction number supports the beliefs of disease transmission between 3 and 4 generations as for the modes of transmission the centers for disease control and prevention explain that covid-19 can spread by close contact from an infected person to another through respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing transmission by touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching the eyes or nose is still unclear and requires the collection of further data 16the director-general of the world health organization doctor tedros ghebreyesus announced on january 23rd that the emerging covid-19 is an emergency in china only and not considered as public health emergency of international concern pheic 17 until that date what was known about the disease is that it causes severe respiratory illness symptoms and that more than 500 cases have been confirmed in china and other countries like south korea japan the usa and thailanddue to the previous experience in facing the sars pandemic the chinese government did a great job by meeting the international standards in terms of the isolation of suspected cases diagnosis and treatment and educational campaigns but despite this fact the virus continued to spread due to the mobility of infected cases and lancet explained that there were concerns due to the daily increase in the number of cases and the many gaps faced as a result of the incomplete and rapidly changing epidemic 17gralinski and menachery 12 illustrated the emergence and outbreak of covid-19 in their study showing the timeline for the key covid-19 events from december 31st when the cluster of pneumonia cases was reported until january 23rd these events include isolating the virus releasing the genomes reporting positive cases among travelers from wuhan as well as reporting the new cases and deaths in china and globallyon thursday january 30th the world health organization declared covid-19 as a global public health emergency of international concern which indicates the international spread of the disease requiring a coordinated global response 18the local government in wuhan has made many attempts to contain the virus firstly they imposed a nationwide ban on wildlife trade in markets restaurants and e-commerce platforms secondly they closed the seafood and animal market in wuhan in order to collect environmental specimens and to perform environmental sanitation and disinfection in addition chinas national health commission announced on january 23rd the suspension of public transportation with closure of airports railway stations and highways in the city to prevent further disease transmission 19after cases have been reported from the european union and european economic area eueea countries and due to the high level of movement between china and these countries the european center for disease prevention and control emphasized the importance to have an entry and exit screening for travelers including symptoms and thermal screenings as a method to detect and isolate positive cases 20 even though this method can reduce the global spread to other countries it might not be very efficient as some infected patients are not showing any symptoms and others are having symptoms similar to those of the coronavirus but are actually caused by the common influenza virusthe centers for disease control and prevention have responded to the outbreak by establishing a covid-19 incident management system activating its emergency operations center to provide ongoing support and responses issuing updated travel guidance for china to prevent nonessential trips to china publishing guidance for healthcare workers on the clinical care of covid-19 patients and posting a guidance for appropriate assessment and management of patients exposed to covid-19 21in order to prevent infection to the population and healthcare workers the centers for disease control and prevention encourage following simple everyday preventive actions such as to avoid close contact with sick people to avoid touching the eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands to wear a face mask and to frequently wash the hands with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand sanitizers 22 health promotion campaigns are encouraged in china and globally as part of educating the people to reduce the risk of infection transmission by educating the people it is less likely they will get the infection thus reducing the risk of transmitting the disease to othersup to date there is no vaccine to prevent covid-19 and the work on treatment is ongoing 22 23 after the person gets infected the treatment and recovery will be dependent upon the severity of the symptoms and associated complicationsby comparing the number of deaths to the total number of cases we can see that most of the infected cases are recovering which is quite promising china is performing an ongoing clinical trial in order to find a treatment for covid-19 one of the anti-viral drugs being tested is chloroquine which has a promising profile against covid-19 as patients treated with this drug demonstrated a better drop in fever improvement of lung ct images and required a shorter time to recover compared to parallel groups 24another anti-viral drug investigated by gilead sciences is remdesivir the drug is believed to have potential activity against covid-19 as it has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against mers and sars coronaviruses gilead initiated two clinical trials on positive covid-19 patients with mild and severe clinical manifestations separately patient enrolment started in february and it is anticipated for the results to be received in april 25the third and last anti-viral drug tested in a 70-patient clinical trial in shenzhen guangdong province is favilavir which demonstrated efficacy in treating covid-19 and with minor side effects this drug was the first to get the approval to treat covid-19 from the national medical products administration of china 26the work on vaccination is ongoing and many researches and vaccine development plans have been announced from pharmaceutical companies and agencies 27 ramaiah and arumugaswami 28 reported a detailed analysis of covid-19 genome evolution and potential universal epitopes for subunit vaccine development the study recommended continuous surveillance of coronavirus strains in live animal markets in order to have a better understanding of the viral adaptation to the human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of more novel pathogenic coronavirus strainshuman-to-human transmission is occurring meaning that more covid-19 cases are expected to be reported in the future which can potentially cause disruptions of global public health systems and economic losses 29 although sustained human-to-human transmission is expected in china this transmission cannot be quantified with the current epidemiological data available prevention measures are implemented globally and investigations are ongoing to find the source of the disease and to understand more about the viruss characteristics illness severity and transmission routes major gaps are presented as the majority of what we know about the virus is based on similar coronaviruses but the work on treatment is promising in order to have a better understanding of the new virus countries should work on providing reliable data through openness and data sharing as well as conducting further researches on the reported cases in addition countries should keep working on improving the preventive measures implemented to reduce the number of infected patients and transmissions at the same timethe author has no ethical conflicts to disclosethe author declares no conflict of interestno funding sourcesthe author worked on this review during her personal time and with high commitment this review contributes to the current work available as it gives a clear picture of the current situations summarizes the key points from each article and gives a recommendation to be fulfilled by future studiesin september 2014 an editorial in businessweek proposed that the ebola crisis could only be contained by deploying military forces the authors painted a grim picture of ebola in africathe situation is desperate hospitals have become quarantine zones for the dead and soon-to-be-deadliberias government is incapable of managing a response even elected officials have fled the nation doctors and nurses have either perished from ebola or have left the country due to a lack of support and concern for their safety amid the collapse of health-care infrastructure it is only a matter of time before total chaos descends the number of infected people is spiraling out of controlthe ebola crisis is a natural disaster like a tsunami or earthquake but unlike natural disasters with limited global consequences ebola is perpetual with far-reaching implications brozak and noronha 2014
this depiction of unending nature-induced disaster shapes how social institutions approach and react to pandemics the apocalyptic language used to describe the disease paves the way for pleas to solve the crisis and respond to a disaster in 2014 the united nations security council declared unanimously that ebola was a threat to international peace and security and the united states pledged military support to establish a command and control center un news centre 2014 governments instituted quarantine as part of a militant effort to contain the spread of the virus the outbreak of ebola evoked a global desire to contain command and control 3 cs the virus in order to mitigate a new type of global human disasterachieving these 3 cs demands broad scientific knowledge and social power the failure to solve disease problems through scientific fixes leads to managing human behaviors in ways that propose to optimize the effects of the technological interventions at the core of the political response to infectious disease lies a pervasive belief that the spread of germs can be contained and the risk of infection can be mitigated by intervening in the cycles of microbial life disease scientists primarily have worked to develop and prescribe solutions to disease outbreaks including technological medical interventions that seem to overcome human political barriers and predictive modeling of disease behaviors that can be used to plan social interventions vaccines antibiotics and other drug therapies overlie the sociocultural dimensions of contagion and cultivate the idea that individuals are culpable for disease prevention using techno-scientific fixes the consequences of the belief that microbial nature can be managed exclusively for human health extend broadly into the human social life creating a wicked socio-scientific problemtoday the fear of germs permeates public debates over vaccination and public schools global travel and airline safety immigration and border security and the regulation of science laboratories in these debates as well as in abundant social acts to control infection people present disease as a problem for science and technology to solve in part this is because scientists made the modern microbe virus and bacteria are unseen in the environment but science-derived technologies like the microscope render them visible microscopes showed the world to be covered with miniscule organisms generating in humans a desire to understand how those microbes interact with the world around them and affect their lives in particularmicrobes complicated our knowledge of the world but even as scientists work to understand and explain the complexity society demands that they simultaneously control it the rise of the science and profession of microbiology bestowed authority upon trained individuals to explain what is seen through the lens including how these organisms cause disease because people can see microbes using simple microscopic technology they legitimize the need for knowledge and the authority of scientists to generate it governments and social institutions vest the scientists who peer at microbes with power to interpret the workings of this invisible world for an audience who have quite narrow concerns about the organisms centering on their own health comfort and survivalmoreover the work of scientists binds humans to microbes in a biological system that is simultaneously human and nonhuman and where ever-blurry line renders the differences indistinct microbiologists transformed the scale by which life was known and demanded that the notion of nonhuman nature expand to include microscopic organisms they also showed that these forms of nature could be located within the human body itself disrupting boundaries between human and nonhuman and nature and culture this dissolution of boundaries challenged a human political system predicated on humans as a distinct species outside of nature finally this knowledge of microbes significantly changed how humans understood their own lives and the interactions that introduce death into human life as a result not only was the modern microbe brought into existence by science and technology but the modern human was remade through this knowledge particularly in terms of risk and the relationship between humans and the world around themin the nineteenth century the germ theory of disease presented microbes as the cause of human illness supplanting notions that diseases manifest individual moral failing or were contracted through miasmas or bad air this transformative theory located the origins of disease in living creatures that could be brought from the environment into the human body to cause harm managing disease was less a moral question and more a concern of how to avoid disease-bearing organisms the germ theory of disease made it possible to mitigate disease by managing unclean spaces and empowered people to act upon their environment to manage their individual health by transforming a moral shortcoming into a failure to act the germ theory reallocated the responsibility for disease control to individuals and public actiongerm theory also delocalized disease expanding the scale of threat to include the world broadly even as a further scientific study showed that specialized environments enable microbes to flourish if associating microbes with humans transformed human identities connecting microbes to environments gave humans a new form of responsibility for managing the world around them this management applied to individual homes as well as communities towns and citiesfrom the moment the microscope lens rendered microbes industries of science and technology set about eliminating the disease by sanitizing the environment communities drained swamps as a measure of disease control and as part of broader river management plans civic sanitation systems offered another technological fix separating humans from disease-bearing waste tomes 1990 argued that the late-nineteenth-century cult of domesticity created the moral imperative for homemakers to maintain high standards of cleanliness primarily by consuming goods such as ceramic toilets water filters and chemical disinfectants such consumer products and public health works seemed to bring disease solutions within the grasp of any individual who could afford to consume or community who had capital to build even as harmful associations between disease and the impoverished immigrant and unclean segments of society strengthened the promise of disease-free living through consumption and cleanliness swept through society made possible by pinpointing unseen microbes as the originators of diseaselocating the source of infectious disease in pathogens outside the human body raised questions of how the body itself might resist infection the proposal that humans have an immune system further defined the body as separate from and in opposition to its environment immunologists theorized that taking action upon the body itself could create immunity from disease in the late eighteenth century edward jenner a scientist working with poxviruses like smallpox and chickenpox observed that people seemed to have varying levels of resistance to disease possibly due to prior exposure to viruses he injected healthy humans with fluids from cowpox lesions into dairymaids hands and then exposed them to the smallpox virus a disease that ravaged human society in that era his test subjects experienced increased immunity to smallpox this new vaccine technology promised another way to combat disease by creating human bodies that were inhospitable environments for disease-bearing microbes though the earliest vaccinations transferred living matter from one body to another concoctions created in laboratories facilitated the wide-ranging dispersal of vaccines spreading hope that disease could be eliminated through a simple prick in the arm the promise that the application of science and technology could solve the human problem with disease seemed evermore attainableindeed within two centuries of creating the first vaccine against smallpox humans had eliminated from nature this disease that killed more than 300 million people in the twentieth century alone henderson 2009 the eradication of smallpox however also testifies to the role of human cultures in disease management for though scientists had proven vaccination to be effective in increasing smallpox immunity containing smallpox required the physical circulation of the technology along with manifold social acts to convince people to be vaccinated technology and scientific discovery cannot contain command and control no matter how simple the solution seems scientists have developed vaccines for a number of deadly diseases that persist in the population including measles polio whooping cough and yellow feverin part because disease eradication requires a cultural system that can broadly manage human behavior disease persists as a wicked problem moreover because microbes are living entities that strive to survive and reproduce they continually evolve in order to stay alive new diseases emerge as microbes adapt to survive the assault of the immune system like a river continually changing over time which cannot be restored to a singular past moment the pathogens on the planet that have the potential to harm humans are constantly changing and cannot be targeted at a static moment efforts by scientists or technologists to solve the disease problems of the present become outdated as microbes persistently evolve to find new ways to survive on the planet and in the bodies of human hostsfurthermore the social systems that mediate the distribution of vaccine technology disperse its effects unequally through society the continued experience of polio or measles in poor communities is a problem of social origin as vaccines have dramatically reduced the occurrence of these diseases worldwide in the global campaign to eradicate smallpox health workers realized that distributing vaccines around the globe not only required ratification from numerous nation-states but also social strategies that would convince people to allow foreigners with needles to act upon their healthy bodies in public controversies over vaccination in the current moment social systems have again made it easier to blame individuals for disease now framed as a failure to police oneself against pathogens using the technological fixes provided by modern sciencefor example when a 2014 measles outbreak in california appeared to spread through unvaccinated populations a ucla professor argued the event was 100 percent connected to popular sentiment against childhood immunizations which had increased the percentage of unvaccinated individuals within the population saying there are some pretty dumb people out there nagourney and goodnough 2015 the california center for infectious diseases issued statements directly asking unvaccinated individuals to be vaccinated against measles and county health officials authorized schools to send home students who could not verify vaccination this governmental response placed responsibility for the health of the population upon each citizen not only blaming unvaccinated individuals for the outbreak but vilifying their actions and insulting their intelligence here broader questions about global health economics and demographics paled beneath debates about individual choices to use vaccinations even when officials acknowledge the social and political systems that shape contagion at the moment disease erupts in a population the public response tends to focus on individual behaviors like hand washing public sneezing and the use of vaccines solutions-based thinking connects vaccines to the promise of a disease-free society without examining the assumptions and politics of the vaccine itselfthroughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries disease science gained credibility because the study of microbial nature led to disease containment both through sanitation and public health works and the eradication of diseases like smallpox this science has also brought broader social effects for example disease intervention relies upon separation and containment such as the use of quarantine during the 2014 ebola outbreaks and the forceful management of environments these practices materialize a deep-seated belief that the human body separates people from each other and the world around them cohen 2009 not only do we imagine the immune system as a filter to prevent harmful external natures from entering the body but through disease we think about interpersonal interactions in terms of riskthe global response to contain ebola attempted to manage how the virus moved between people by managing people themselves intervening in centuries-old mourning rituals and scrutinizing travelers bodies with temperature scanners such activities may be rational in the face of death but must also be understood as the outcome of certain ways of knowing the human-microbe relationship these actions have consequences in how humans understand their connections to each other and the world around them to create futures where complex understandings of the human place in the world can operate we must embrace our bodies as permeable entities that bind us to our biophysical environments and to each otherlocating the source of disease outside the human body widened a perceived gap between humans and their environment strengthening the cultural belief that problems can be solved by managing nonhuman environments as a wicked problem disease presents complexity because it is so entwined with the corporeal self every living body faces a ceaseless problem of boundary maintenance cohen 2009 as its immune system works to ward off invasions from the world in which it moves new scientific knowledge however overturns the presumption that all microbes constitute a threat and that vaccines can create a perfect barrier against diseaseresearch on the complex relations between organisms and their microbes challenges dichotomies of good and bad with new ideas about mutualism adaptation and co-survival of species a century ago the scientific germ theory of disease created microbes as a primary threat to human health and wellbeing but scientists have since posited that microbial life contained within the human body is integral to health and even that individuals are constituted by unique communities of microorganisms the microbiome clemente et al 2012 shreiner et al 2015 consequently microbes are receiving new scientific and cultural attention as bearers of human lifecorporations government agencies scientists and medical professionals have presented antibiotics and consumer products that kill germs as science-derived solutions to infectious disease despite growing evidence that unmoderated use of these agents creates new disease problems the evolution of antibiotic-resistant superbugs is an outcome of the problem-solution-problem cycle of disease control in the twentieth century antibiotics provided a miracle-like cure for bacteria-caused infections and were widely used to treat disease this solution however generated new problems as microbes evolved to avoid harm from anti-microbial treatments while antibiotics reliably kill bacteria they also change the worldwide theater of disease entering a cycle of problems and solutions because the actors on the stageboth human and microbialare living organisms with the ability to adapt and change in biophysical systems the mutable qualities of actors eliminate the possibility for a single large-scale solutionhousehold products and pharmaceuticals with anti-microbial properties provide consumers a seemingly immediate technological fix for the problem of disease hand sanitizer for example was once used primarily in hospitals but appeared on consumer shelves in the mid-1990s effective marketing opened a niche for the glossy gel and sales grew in 2002 the cdc reported in the guideline for hand hygiene in health-care settings its scientific conclusion that instant alcohol sanitizers were more effective for hand antisepsis than antimicrobial soaps and were better at killing drug-resistant pathogens than soaps and detergents such claims in the hands of marketers built public support for using hand sanitizers as a solution to the spread of infectious disease owen 2013 sales climbed steadily for the new product before plateauing in the early twenty-first century sales have stayed relatively flat for years with the notable exception of 2009 during the h1n1 swine flu epidemic because flu viruses are primarily picked up through the air spread by coughing and sneezing scientists questioned the effectiveness of the gel in combating flu yet sanitizer sales still rose 175 percent during the swine flu outbreak fottrell 2013in order to be effective anti-microbial fixes to disease problems must be applied in a society on a scale that cannot be matched by the distribution of consumer products moreover product marketing may misrepresent the effectiveness of an antibiotic in preventing individual infection a product like antibacterial soap may kill germs in a controlled environment but disease exists in a complex changing environment with countless unique biological agents people also have unequal access to consumer products and limited understanding of how these products impact vectors of disease and human health more generally when the us food and drug administration banned several antibacterial ingredients found in over-the-counter soaps in 2016 they also called for further study of antimicrobial products focusing on how the broad use of these products by consumers often multiple times a day diverges from occasional exposure usfda 2016 studies to assess the safety of these products to humans did not anticipate the ways they would be used in practice and how the microbes targeted by these products would adaptwhile antibiotic technologies offer an effective method for killing pathogens the spread of these products created new disease problems because biophysical systems are dynamic and evolutionary microbes quickly evolve and adapt to survive the overuse of antibiotics as an attempt to solve the most inconsequential health problems has fostered the evolution of antibiotic-resistant organisms through the process of natural selection the microbes most resistant to antimicrobial products survive the application of antibiotics and live to replicate their genetic properties in creating the next generation of microbesin 2009 the world health organization named antibiotic resistance as one of the three greatest threats to human health and the cdc estimates it to cause more than 20000 deaths and 2 million illnesses in the united states annually who 2011 cdc 2013 these adapted microbes have been named superbugs evoking the evolution of an organism with exceptional abilities while retaining the negative association with bugs and other undesirable creatures the term affirms our cultural expectation that bacteria will succumb to antibiotics identifying microbes that resist antibiotics as super or exceptional we expect antibiotics to destroy microbes and when they do not the disease problem shifts now it is resistance that must be controlledwhen well-adapted superbugs survive a perceived fix new scientific practices or other cultural interventions must again try to mitigate the spread of the newly mutated germ recognizing the rise of antibiotic resistance health workers are reaching out to prescribers and consumers of antibiotics to limit the overuse of antibiotics this new awareness of unintended consequences of antibiotic use has the potential to ripple into many areas of social life not only in health and consumer systems but also through food systems as the prolific use of antibiotics in agricultural systems is a primary influence in the evolution of superbugsin 2015 the obama administration announced the us national action plan for combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria promoting nontraditional therapeutics probiotics and an international research agenda the language of the press release and fact sheet accompanying the plan exemplify the enduring myth that solutions exist antibiotic resistance is a global problem that requires global solutions white house 2015 the promise cultivated alongside penicillin that antibiotics vaccines and other scientific interventions would create a disease-free world has subsided as scientists and practitioners consider complexities in the lives of microbes that were previously unknown this political initiative reaches beyond national politics and emergency events to frame a problem global in scope even as a us president asserts a continued pursuit of solutions the scientific community and public at large have gradually opened up to the possibility that a direct war on microbes may not solve disease problems and indeed may cycle back to create a new equation of diseaseone indicator that the problem-solution-problem cycle has generated new ways of thinking about human-microbial life is the hygiene hypothesis first put forth in the late 1980s scientists propose that exposure to microbes in childhood is essential to the development of the bodys ability to fight infection strachan 1989 2000 in a discourse eerily echoing progressive era class-oriented associations of disease and cleanliness the hygiene hypothesis argues that the overuse of antibacterial agents in developed nations has led to higher rates of asthma and digestive disorders the high value on cleanliness first accessible to those who could afford it then taken up by the government through sanitation and public health projects effectively sanitized much of the world inhabited by the wealthy while achieving the goal of disease suppression for a generation this work may have unintentionally weakened immunity among the populations living in the disease-free environments they createdthe creation of a healthy and immunity-producing microbiome during childhood may require exposure to a diverse and broad spread of friendly microbes particularly bacteria and parasites originating in dirt water and vegetation the widespread use of individual and communal technologies to sanitize and solve the problem of disease created new problems for people living in a germ-free or germ-lessened world in the last decade scientists have explored the role of microbial exposure in immunity spurring a social movement to increase childhood exposure to germs olszak et al 2012 the first-world return to dirt exemplifies the ongoing effort of individuals to manage their own relationship to disease intriguingly framed in a new global perspective of dirtthe concept of a microbiome places a peculiar responsibility upon people including parents of young children to manage the concoction of microbes in their bodies which will through replication of countless generations be with them through life in books like eat dirt and healthy food healthy gut happy child medical professionals encourage parents to expose their children to dirtspecifically the microbes associated with dirtthrough diet and activities arguing not only that this practice will protect against asthma and allergies in the long run but also that it can bring physical and behavioral changes in the short term managing exposure to microbes not eliminating them becomes the work of daily livingwhere once marketers took up antimicrobial science to sell products that sanitized the world from viruses and bacteria now the market holds a place for products that help users feel like they are cultivating beneficial microbes within them a marketable solution to the new problem spurred by probiotic assertions products like yogurt grew in sales in the early twenty-first century despite controversy over the immune-producing claims that eventually led to the ban of the term in european marketing in 2015 probiotics were a billion-dollar industry in the united states and the worlds largest yogurt company danone sold 27 billion in probiotic yogurts mitchell 2016 aobiome under the brand mother dirt markets a biome-friendly body spray that replaces essential bacteria lost by modern hygiene and lifestyles mother dirt 2016 it seems the probiotic craze is poised to repeat the pattern of the antibiotic craze a century ago capitalizing upon a new popular awareness of the microbiome to promote the idea that individuals can control the microbes within their body through consumption and behaviorsmeanwhile public and private organizations from the white house to the bill  melinda gates foundation have increased funding for microbiome research through the national microbiome initiative spending hundreds of millions of dollars to develop approaches to reliably alter microbiomes to benefit individuals communities and societies white house 2016 this initiative particularly directs the study of the microbiome towards social gain placing foremost the idea that science must study microbes primarily to understand how they benefit humans an idea that assumes both human centrality in biophysical systems and the ability of humans to control microorganisms the 3 cs appear as reliably in discourses about managing good microbes as in battling bad ones aside from pandemic events like ebola the nuanced understandings of the human relationship with disease are growing but the belief persists that humans can alter nature wholesale to a perceived human benefit without cycling around to further problems and desires for solutions defining disease control as a human problem necessitates recruiting citizens to respond while individuals bear the primary responsibility to govern their biological and social selves to promote healthy human-microbial systems when scaled up to the level of society disease control becomes the work of nations and governmentsalthough disease is experienced by individuals it is also calculated on larger scales a disease can be calculated at the scale of a population the number of cases of infection among otherwise healthy bodies this number fluctuates as new infections take place and other bodies recover from illness but even as individuals heal the disease remains present in a population still disease is never omnipresent within a population it continually ebbs and flows geographically and temporally because disease exists on global national and communal scales citizens ascribe responsibility to contain command and control to the social institutions they establish to govern collective life then because liberal citizens have the right and responsibility to govern their social interactions as they relate to the risk of contracting a disease they join in the work of disease control becoming willing participants in upholding the social goodin the twenty-first century the fluidity of microbial disease compounds with the continually evolving nature of microbes and global communications systems to create a world where people can think about their individual risk of infection on a vast scale rapid transportation of humans and goods provides vessels that move microbes to new environments as never before a mosquito carrying the zika virus might cross the globe in a suitcase in an afternoon rapidly spreading a disease that might otherwise be tamped down seasonally even temporarily entering into habitats where the vector insect cannot long survive the speed with which people and goods can move today creates a sense of risk that often seems immediate even among those who do not move this global social system exposes disease as much more than contact with a germ an outbreak is created through human interactions that cannot be eliminated at the scale of the individual and up to the globalwhile microbes have always moved around the world knowing microbes as agents of a disease has also changed how microbes are positioned on the globe desired microbes such as those used in vaccines or probiotics are distributed through global laboratory systems or manufactured en masse while others such as smallpox are eradicated critics point to the role of laboratory scientists in creating new antibiotic-resistant microbes sometimes a result of their very work to study antibiotic resistance people also manipulate the qualities of microbes both to increase health and knowledge and to cause harm and spread death primarily for social purposes derived from human values from the time of those first glances of microbes beneath the microscope eyepiece people have engineered microbes for particular social objectives including the use of microbes in weapons of war in the modern world healthy bodies are continually at risk not only from the somewhat-predictable movements of disease through the population such as the annual flu cycle but also from the unpredictable behavior of humans attempting to bend germs to their bidding to inflict harm and terror a microbial disease is a wicked problem because the mutating and evolving nature of microbes presents citizens with an unending number of threatsthrough human-caused and microbe-originating evolution germs contain the ability to perpetually harm human life techno-scientific approaches even when coupled with social-cultural approaches fail to eradicate disease and recent studies of the microbiome and bacterial resistance cast doubt upon the desirability of environments cleansed of microbes ever-growing knowledge of the ecological function of disease raises the possibilities that microbes even disease-causing viruses can be good fulfilling a vital ecological role for example studies of the role of viruses in gene function show that mutualistic viruses were the key to the domestication of bell peppers and the cold tolerance of rice roossinck 2015 xu et al 2008 annihilating these viruses deliberately or not might severely impact the ability of these crops to survive centuries after their existence was known the role of viruses and bacteria in broad ecosystem health is only beginning to be studied and will likely challenge the very notion of disease and its negative associationseven the perfect management of microbes however would operate through human social systems in a world where a body is continually at risk of contracting an infectious disease both sick and healthy bodies must be managed in order to contain infection the technologies that destroy microbial life create effects within populations because they operate through social acts and political systems vaccines and antibiotics entered society via newly created public health systems which gave governments as a mediator between individuals nations and the world responsibility for creating healthy environments bioterrorism and pandemic preparedness activities have further affirmed the governments role in managing human behavior to minimize disease risk to contain the spread of disease from so many quartersfood air travel and even terrorismgovernments require that citizens be aware of their behavior on a daily basis thus the search for solutions to disease problems leads to assigning public institutions with authority over peoples health and bodies recognizing these outcomes as discussed in the concluding section of this case becomes more possible when breaking out of the cyclical search for solutions and scrutinizing the motives that underlie disease governancedisease transforms society through the shared experience of risk and the human desire to mitigate harm bennett 2010 argues for thinking of publics as human-nonhuman collectives that are provoked into existence by shared experience of harm a public cohering around shared vulnerability to disease may then create a government or assign responsibility to the existing government to manage that risk people who govern have a range of disease responses available to them ranging from allocating research funding to the scientific search for cures to managing human bodies and biophysical systems to contain and control disease transmission most governments respond in manifold waysthe rise of public health more than a century ago established the prevention of disease as the work of government scientists create knowledge about how microbes can be contained but governments work to ensure that the population participates in prescribed behaviors to fight disease this governance can be local national andor international in scale but notably is always intimate focused on the individual body and on the interpersonal behaviors that make us human and affirm our cultural relations sneezing and shaking hands become suspect in a world covered with germs if we wish to protect ourselves from disease we must moderate those behaviorsone form of infectious disease management has been to focus on how a disease is transmitted daily by human behaviors for example in the 1980s a chinese public health advertisement posed and answered a question where should you spit in your handkerchief tissue paper the spittoon similarly a modern australian ad reminds citizens in rhyme the spread of flu is up to you flu doesnt spread itself people spread it such campaigns recognize that techno-scientific interventions alone cannot contain a disease for people must continually regulate their own behavior to protect the population this language taps into communal values and individual citizenship to motivate people to perform certain behaviors in turn citizens bestow a degree of trust upon their governments to identify and promote best practiceshealth promotion campaigns turn disease control into a psychological exercise in redirecting human behavior relying upon individuals to police themselves against new social mores these work in tandem with governmental interventions to manage environments such as water and sanitation systems governments also have broad authoritative powers available such as the enforcement of quarantine or mandatory vaccination programs infectious disease challenges us to consider the extent to which we wish for governments to intervene in personal liberties to create a healthy populationfoucault 2007 theorized a changing relationship between people and disease based upon the new conceptualizations of a population a collection of beings defined by common biological and pathological characteristics and sharing governance a population attains security by maintaining a normal condition and the liberal state functions when all citizens work to attain that normalcy an outbreak of disease threatens the normal health of the population and must therefore be mitigated to maintain the security of the population for this liberal government to function the state must define normal for its population and then govern deviance citizens must assume the responsibility to moderate their own behaviors that relate to the risk of contracting a disease in turn the public health system can operate as a tool of the security state working to contain command and control disease within the population to control deviance and secure precious human life because there is no solution subjects and governments continually negotiate the risks and costs of interventions to the individual and population often in heated debates over ethics rights and responsibilitiesin the modern united states this debate is exemplified in contestations over government-imposed requirements for childhood vaccinations and parents claims for the right to decide whether their children should be vaccinated an infectious disease like measles cannot thrive in a population where most bodies have been vaccinated against diseases allowing a small percentage of citizens to remain healthy even when unvaccinated however as the aforementioned 2014 outbreak of measles in california demonstrated lower rates of vaccination render all unvaccinated bodies vulnerable when a critical number of citizens refuse vaccination because of a perceived risk to themselves individually they create a security risk for the population which must be addressed by government and then public officials plead for individuals to be vaccinated for the collective good when public health posters and politicians from the pulpit cry its up to you they employ a language that locates the problem and a perceived permanent solution with individuals the educational message lacks the nuances and complexity that scientists see in human-microbe interactions establishing instead the expectation that disease can be contained by socially responsible behavior and conversely implying that irresponsible behavior is part of a disease problemat the core of the debate then are human rights to govern our own bodies that must be separated from the scientific knowledge of how to kill microbes what for example should governments require of individuals by rule of law in order to secure a communityor demand of a community in order to secure the nation these questions can only be addressed through public debate and cultural politics scientists cannot determine the ethics of disease control practices but may provide some insight into how science-based knowledge and subsequent technologies might be applied to control a diseaseduring the crisis response of the ebola virus in 2014 a full quarantine of healthy bodies was called for by nation states exercising authoritarian rule to maintain the health of the nation there is a long history of using quarantine to contain the disease but it is a history tainted by racial injustice and government acts that correlate health cleanliness and fitness with skin color and social class stern 1999 a court declared a 1900 plague quarantine in san francisco to be racist in closing nonwhite businesses and in roping off chinatown but allowing white residents to leave while quarantine was never enacted a 1985 poll by the los angeles times found that the majority of the 2308 survey respondents favored quarantine of aids patients a decision to use quarantine during epidemics masks but cannot separate associations between disease and impurity under a call for health security when governments impose on human rights in the name of health security they often shirk vital ethical discussions and broader social discourses that would expose injustices and systemic discrimination in these acts neutral nonsocial responses to disease are not possiblethe apparent urgency created by pandemic disease serves a particular social function in affirming the role of the security state to respond to and even solve disease problems consider the words of president obama at the cdc reported in usa today during the 2014 ebola events the newspaper quotes the president saying the solution is within grasp even as he described a downward spiral of events in west africa scientific knowledge coupled with a rapid militant response offered the apparent solution the world knows how to fight this disease its not a mystery we know the science we know how to prevent it from spreading we know how to care for those who contract it we know that if we take the proper steps we can save lives but we have to act fast we cant dawdle on this one korte 2014 scientific and public health knowledge promised to contain ebola and end the crisis but that knowledge demanded swift application in this case deploying us troops to africa the us president promises a solution in words that assure the public that scientists have done their part now the rest is up to the citizensobamas language calls people to actioncaring for victims taking proper steps and acting fast without dawdling by this articulation the promise of a scientific solution seems to be achievable if the public cooperates in 2014 as nations debated closing their borders to global travelers the politics of disease control met the limits of scientific knowledge governments shifted blame from science to citizens displacing culpability away from scientists and onto human subjects may change the framing of infectious disease as a problem but does not make it solvable as a wicked problem the ebola crisis could not be solved though social decisions made on multiple scales of government and in individual lives could manage its immediate social effects even eradication of a disease like ebola does not break free of the problem-solution-problem cycle despite centuries of work in microbiology people are still learning how complex their relations with microbes are recognizing that managing disease brings unintended consequences to human and ecosystem health and vitalityby ceasing the fruitless quest to solve disease problems and opening new discourses that do not rely on solutions-based language everyday politics of disease can more fully center on the individual and collective rights and values inscribed in public health questions concerning how societies will use the knowledge generated through the scientific study of microbes to address disease outbreaks of all sorts must be discussed prior to emergency events such that the political response can be brought in accordance with social ideals that emerge during public debate cultural politics and careful evaluation of our ethical valueseven as the hopefulness of a swift global conquest of disease fades in the modern era the successes of applying science and technology to managing infectious disease are apparent ebola h1n1 and sars faded from the population sanitation increases health and vaccines save lives smallpox virus exists only in secured biological laboratories with lowered disease stressors however populations continue to grow and move as humans gather into tighter urban spaces but also travel increasingly longer distances on a regular basis they create new paradigms of contagion and risk germs are adapting to survive in these new environments becoming the germs of the future these microbes have their own evolutionary impetus to grow and change and their endurance may be inextricable from human survival microbes are being remade for another generationin societys search for a solution to the human struggle with diseases people have created new microbial realities and new cultural ideas and political systems are taking shape around the superbugs and engineered microbes of the twenty-first century these politics demand a security apparatus that governs the environments where microbes and humans live together because infectious disease management blossomed around the impossible static goal of eliminating disease it has created microbial environments which are all environments as places awaiting a seemingly endless series of technological fixes paired with calls for specific behaviors by continuing to manage diseases as a problem of nature to be solved primarily through species eradication we have waged a scientific and political fight for knowledge of how to destroy germsthe goal to create a society that does not fear disease is admirable but work to overcome the fear must accompany any fight to eradicate organisms that may sustain human life in the present and future recognizing disease as a social condition and an unending condition of nature not a problem awaiting a singular solution opens the possibility of addressing both the cultural conditions and biological processes that create and spread disease living with our social microbiome means we can recognize germs as an inextricable part of our social institutions just as we know they permeate biophysical systemspoor

                revisions were made to the original protocol due to both external and local issues
                that arose after the original protocol had been fundedthe original design was a randomized longitudinal subject-blinded
                        placebo-controlled community-based crossover trial the primary aim was to

                        advantages of the crossover design the first was the ability to control for
                        the strong seasonal variation in respiratory illnesses that was expected
                        the second was the ability to maximize school support and participation
                        because all schools would eventually receive the intervention instead of

                        important consideration was the availability of a placebo without
                        antimicrobial effects 17both alcohol-based and nonalcohol-based hand sanitizers were initially
                        considered but community concerns regarding alcohol-based products and
                        their flammable nature 1435 and the potential for misuse made them a less desirable choice
                            36 there
                        were also preliminary data to suggest that alcohol-based products might be
                        inferior to nonalcohol-based products 3334 for example the antimicrobial
                        activity of benzalkonium chloride had been shown to increase over multiple
                        consecutive washes whereas the antimicrobial activity of ethyl alcohol
                        tended to decrease over time 3334 both had better degerming
                        activity than soap and water 3334 but 50 of those using ethyl
                        alcohol reported hand pain or discomfort whereas no one using benzalkonium

                    events occurred that required major modifications to the original study
                    protocol 1 concerns arose regarding the safety of benzalkonium chloride 2
                    no nonalcohol-based hand sanitizer substitute was available and 3 community
                    standards changed regarding typical hand hygiene practices in the schools
                        while responding to an irb requirement to re-review product safety data following
                    grant awards we found new data indicating that benzalkonium chloride 1
                    induced moderate genotoxic effects in eukaryotic cells 37 2 produced histological changes

                    possibly caused allergic contact dermatitis 40 these concerns prompted a search
                    for another nonalcohol-based product but no substitute could be found the only
                    viable option was to switch to an alcohol-based product while this alleviated
                    many of the safety concerns related to benzalkonium chloride it prevented the
                    use of a subject-blinded design because there was no placebo for an
                    alcohol-based productbetween the time of the grant development and its award the schools typical
                    hand hygiene practices changed substantially due in large part to changes in the
                    communitys perceptions regarding disease risk school principals faculty and
                    parents had become convinced that hand sanitizer was necessary for good hand
                    hygiene within the schools there was considerable fear that hand washing alone
                    was not sufficient to prevent the spread of germs this perception was
                    reinforced by a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus
                    mrsa outbreak in several schools prior to the study because of these
                    concerns hand sanitizer use increased dramatically such that many schools
                    required parents to purchase personal hand sanitizer as a supply item despite
                    reassurance by the local health department that hand washing remained the best
                    option for hand hygiene community perceptions were so strong that a hand
                    washing only arm was no longer a viable optionthe decision to change a study protocol after a grant award is a difficult one
                    that involves many important stakeholders for this trial important
                    stakeholders included the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and
                    its designee project officer our data safety and monitoring board dsmb our
                    institutional review board and the community as represented by school
                    administration faculty and staff and parents our goal was to maintain the
                    scientific integrity of the study while adapting to safety concerns and changes
                    in the communitys preferenceschronologically the first major decision involved the change from the original
                    hand sanitizer with its corresponding placebo to an alcohol-based product
                    without one while the safety concerns that prompted this decision were mostly
                    theoretical we agreed that ensuring participant safety especially among
                    children warranted erring on the side of caution the principal investigator
                    and key study personnel made this decision in close collaboration with the nhlbi
                    project officer and dsmb over the course of multiple teleconferences the
                    primary goal was to ensure that the redesigned study addressed an important
                    research question using a methodologically rigorous design without compromising
                    student safety the school system administration superintendent and chief
                    nursing officer were appraised of the rationale for the proposed changes and
                    were asked to approve them prior to implementationbecause there was no placebo for the alcohol-based product it was no longer
                    possible to conduct a subject-blinded design for a direct test of the
                    effectiveness of hand sanitizer as a supplement to hand washing instead we
                    chose to compare the effectiveness of a standardized two-step hand hygiene
                    process hand washing plus hand sanitizer with handwashing only schools would
                    be randomly assigned to use study-provided hand sanitizer and hand soap
                    intervention arm or to hand washing only usual care arm crossover would
                    still occur after the first yearwhen we met with school principals and parent advisory groups to discuss the
                    revisions including randomization of some schools to hand washing only we
                    learned that personal hand sanitizer use had become ubiquitous in many schools
                    we asked schools to discourage personal hand sanitizer use eg removing hand
                    sanitizer from their required supply lists by arguing that hand washing was the
                    preferred method of hand hygiene the local health department reinforced this
                    message on our behalf but parents and school faculty countered that personal
                    hand sanitizer use was surmounting existing barriers to adequate hand washing
                    and that they were reticent to restrict its use they also pointed out the
                    difficulty of enforcing restrictions against personal hand sanitizer use while
                    at schoolunfortunately we were unable to secure any restrictions which meant that instead
                    of the usual care arm being a hand washing only arm it would now also include a
                    variable amount of personal hand sanitizer use as well the unexpected increase
                    in personal hand sanitizer use presented a potential bias to the null effect to
                    control for this possibility we developed instruments to monitor the schools
                    hand hygiene practices more carefullyall of the revisions occurred prior to participant enrollment therefore no
                    changes to the consent process were necessarythe revised protocol was a randomized longitudinal community-based
                        crossover trial that compared the effectiveness of a standardized two-step
                        hand hygiene process hand hygiene education plus study-provided hand
                        sanitizer and hand soap with that of usual care a variety of
                        school-specific hand hygiene practicesno changeno changeno changethe revised intervention consisted of a two-step hand hygiene practice that
                        included regular hand washing with soap and water supplemented by hand
                        sanitizer use to overcome potential resource barriers to adequate hand
                        hygiene practices in intervention schools the study provided intervention
                        schools with alcohol-based hand sanitizer hand soap and needed refills
                        hand soap dispensers were installed by study personnel and hand sanitizer
                        was made available in disposable bottles in all intervention restrooms
                        health rooms and classrooms with a sinkto our surprise the installation of dispensers became an important issue
                        originally we used the installation of permanent hand sanitizer dispensers
                        as an incentive for schools to participate since the hand sanitizer
                        dispensers would hold product with either an active ingredient or placebo
                        installing them at the beginning of the study in all schools did not pose a
                        problem following crossover after the redesign the lack of a placebo
                        created the potential for a carry-over effect if year 1 intervention schools
                        were to continue using the dispensers during year 2 when assigned to usual
                        care we proposed eliminating permanent dispensers altogether but
                        discontinuation became an issue with the schools as they wanted us to honor
                        our original commitmenta compromise was reached by installing hand soap dispensers instead of hand
                        sanitizer dispensers in each school prior to the start of their
                        intervention year schools were concerned that removing dispensers after the
                        intervention year was over might damage walls so we agreed to leave them in
                        place but we would no longer supply refills we deemed that the potential
                        use of the hand soap dispensers during the usual care year posed less of a
                        carry-overcontamination risk than the use of hand sanitizer dispensers
                        wouldin the revised design the always be clean hand hygiene curriculum was

                        hand washing and personal hand sanitizer use of differing quality and
                        frequency some of this variation was attributable to the inconsistent
                        supply of hand hygiene resources among some schools because of this

                        availability that is liquid or bar soap hand drying mechanism hand
                        sanitizer and hand hygiene instructions are recorded general cleanliness
                        and structural condition also were noted data were used to describe hand
                        hygiene resource availability in the usual care schools and to monitor
                        implementation of the two-step hand hygiene program in the intervention
                        schoolssince hand sanitizer was recommended as a supplement to standard hand washing
                        in a setting of limited school resources it was deemed important to
                        estimate the incremental value of hand sanitizer use therefore an economic
                        analysis was added as a study aim to estimate the additional costs of hand
                        sanitizer use a careful cost accounting of the usual care and intervention
                        activities is being conducted cost and effectiveness data will be combined
                        to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the two-step hand hygiene
                        intervention with usual care using dollars per averted asthma exacerbation
                        as the primary outcomepower calculations were revised based on the updated study design using the
                        monthly frequency of episodes of poor asthma control epac as the primary
                        outcome table
                        2 two general scenarios were assumed one where there was no
                        carryover effects data from both years and one where there were such
                        effects each year evaluated separately gee was used to account for the
                        correlation within a child over time as well as the correlation among
                        children within the same school carryover or residual effects occur when the effect of an intervention
                        during the first time period persists into the second time period the
                        persistence of the effect may bias the measured effect of the second
                        intervention it is possible that educational intervention could lead to
                        sustained changes in hand hygiene practices at interventions schools that
                        might persist into the second year however the presence of a summer break
                        provides a 10-week wash out period that should minimize any carryover
                        effect since no reinforcement is provided to original intervention schools
                        during the second year research has shown that changes in behavioral
                        practices typically decline by 4080 after 6 weeks without reinforcement
                            41 a
                        recent review of hand hygiene interventions in health care workers noted
                        that without reinforcement the changes in hand hygiene behaviors were
                        sustained for less than 1 week 42 a 1 month baseline period at
                        the beginning of each school year was planned to measure potential carryover
                        effectsno changeenrollment was completed in may 2009 with a total of 527 students enrolled in 30
                schools mean  176 per school the enrollment per school exceeded the estimate
                used to calculate the studys power the intervention began in august 2009 and will
                end in may 2011one of the most difficult aspects of the academic-community partnership is the lag
                time between study development funding and implementation during this interval
                key stakeholders perceptions and standard practices within the community can
                change often in an unpredictable manner which is outside the control of the
                research team at the same time new scientific discoveries may emerge that render
                the original study assumptions obsolete because of this dynamic environment the
                community-based researcher must be responsive to changes that may undermine the
                original study design or collaborations with community partnerswe have found that a study team with a broad range of skills talents and interests
                is well positioned to respond to a quickly changing environment not all team
                members are equally suited to serve as liaisons with community partners in
                school-based research team members with prior work experience in the schools eg
                former administrators teachers or coaches often can establish more effective
                collaborations with school personnel than academicians these team members can use
                their previous relationships to identify and gain access to the key stakeholders
                within the school system additionally they can navigate a cultural work
                environment that is often quite different from the academic setting having team
                members with this background is critically important for school-based researchin retrospect the most crucial decision that impacted our original research design
                was the decision to abandon the nonalcohol-based hand sanitizer containing
                benzalkonium chloride without this product and its corresponding placebo we were
                unable to conduct a subject-blinded design initially we felt confident that the
                product was safe and effective however the in vitro data that
                subsequently emerged cast doubts on the products previously established safety
                record the new data emerged at a point in the study cycle where little time was
                available to contemplate the decision without substantially delaying implementation
                we also were sensitive to safety concerns given that we were working with a
                vulnerable population children in a challenging research setting schools we
                believed that a smaller body of in vitro findings questioning the
                products safety trumped a larger body of in vivo findings
                demonstrating safety that were obtained through industry-funded manufacturer-led
                researchthe impact of eliminating the subject-blinded design was magnified by the abrupt
                change in community hand hygiene practices within the schools if personal hand
                sanitizer use had not been prevalent in usual care schools the crossover design
                would have been a robust test of hand sanitizer as compared with hand washing alone
                however the ubiquitous nature of personal hand sanitizer use forced us to rely on
                what had been reported previously to be substandard hand hygiene practices within
                the schools due to significant structural barriers by supplying the education and
                resources to ensure that the barriers to effective hand hygiene in the intervention
                schools were eliminated we were able to evaluate the best possible hand hygiene
                practice hand washing plus hand sanitizer use against a variety of usual care
                practices unfortunately the study no longer can measure the effectiveness of hand
                sanitizer use directly as a supplement to traditional hand washing practices if the
                trial results are negative the possibility of bias created by personal hand
                sanitizer within usual care schools may be the primary contributing factorcommunity-based clinical trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of
                interventions under real-world conditions 43 a methodologically rigorous study
                design is important to achieve this goal but the community-based researcher must
                also respect community beliefs and practices 44 failure to address them satisfactorily
                may compromise the ethical conduct of research particularly in vulnerable
                populations it also may be counterproductive as the community partners are vital to
                the translation of research knowledge into sustainable practicesthe corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 had originated from china as the first case was reported in wuhan china in december 2019 eventually it started to spread in various regions throughout china and on 30 january 2020 world health organization who declared covid-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern pheic who 2020a which later became a global pandemic as of 7 april 2020 the who situation report-78 indicates more than 12 million confirmed cases and deaths greater than 72000 globally who 2020b the infection is spreading day by day and the healthcare system struggles to take care of every infected individual especially in excessively infected countries such as usa italy spain and the list goes on though the characteristics of this novel coronavirus are not well known we can infer its behavior from the statistics such as rapid rate of spread vulnerability is higher for low immune diabetic and aged people widely different pattern of recovery rate and other information we have is that it spreads by a human to human transmission through droplets or by direct contact and the incubation period for the infection has been estimated as 214 days lai et al 2020to encounter the situation healthcare systems have put their tremendous efforts in treating the infected individuals and also for testing the public for coronavirus diagnosis governments are doing their best to mitigate the infection and also to meet the requirements for the healthcare system moreover unfortunately there is neither a medicine for the cure nor a vaccine for prevention of this novel coronavirus as of 10 april 2020 but countries have been trying various treatment methods and usage of different suitable medicines without proper confirmation the preventive measures defined by the who is to wash the hands frequently with soap and water or with an alcohol-based hand rub following social distancing and practicing respiratory hygiene who 2020c masks will also play a role in safeguarding people from infection and it is mandatory to know when and how to use the mask apart from it the only way to stop the infection from spreading is by staying at home and avoiding social gathering following social distancing and isolating us from infected people or people subjected to quarantine hence to stop the spread it requires a combined effort from all social bodies such as the healthcare system government and more importantly from the public and they can be controlled only to a limited extent besides the extensive utilization of potential technologies together with effective healthcare treatment and strong governance will be astonishing that would strengthen the defense line to fight against covid-19technologies have been consistently developing day-by-day but during an unexpected circumstance as of covid-19 pandemic the role of these technologies to support humanity in various means is substantial it is ofcourse acknowledged that the credits for the healthcare system is exceptional in tackling the situation but the part of technologies in supporting the healthcare system government and also public remains unnoticed the contribution of these technologies in fighting against novel coronavirus may be either directly impacting or indirectly impacting the former refers to the technology by the implementation of which the spread of the infection is mitigated or the difficulties of the healthcare system have been buckled down the latter involves those technologies that have been helpful in supporting the government and the public to deal with the situationthe prime objective of our study is to investigate various technology-based strategies that assist the environment in controlling the pandemic and also other viable technologies that have the potential to be used the outcome of our study is to make the readers professionals and scholars to understand the contributions of the technologies in controlling the epidemic and further to encourage the implementation of these technologies in near-future the novelty of our work is presented in subsequent pointsinvestigation of the various implemented technologies and their influence in controlling the pandemicpresenting prospective viable technologies that can be used in the current or future epidemic situationdiscussing the technological changes that the environment and the society have undergone in tackling the pandemic crisissuggesting few drafted pioneering systems in mitigating the spread
this work mainly consists of seven sections apart from the introduction the first section shows the framework of our study and the following section explains the changes that the environment and the society have been through in handling the pandemic situation from different social bodies aspects such as government healthcare system public industries and also from an environmental and energy point of view the next section deals with the technological strategies that are implemented to control the pandemic which includes information communication artificial intelligence and machine learning and supply chain strategies and the subsequent section gives an insight of indirectly impacting technological strategies whose purpose is to support the confinement of the society during pandemic crisis this section comprises the sub-domains such as work from home distance learning and surveillance these two sections altogether cover the directly and indirectly influencing technologies in controlling the pandemic and are also backed up with few practical illustrations then the prospective technologies that are less used but have immense potential in supporting the society during epidemic difficulties is also discussed then the subsequent section gives some essential guidelines to follow during this pandemic period as defined by the world health organization who and at last a critical discussion of the influence created by these technologies the existing challenges and predicted future impacts accompanied by the conclusion is presentedwe authors decided to contribute our support to the society to tackle covid-19 by investigating various implemented technologies as well as the potential technologies that would help in controlling the pandemic and subsequently presenting our investigation as a manuscript we sought guidance from medical and technical professionals as a result of which the topics need to be covered in this study is figured out in order to write the manuscript in this novel theme one need to know what is happening around and requires tedious surveying of online information from verified sources together with literature survey for supporting the feasibility of the approach disclosed in the online sources the literature survey is primarily done by using platforms such as google scholar elsevier pubmed and ieee firstly the initial screening is done by analyzing the title of the work and then according to the sections in our study the identified work is sorted the scrutinizing stage 1 is performed by scanning the abstract of the work sorted and decision of scrutinization of each work is carried out jointly by the authors the scrutinizing stage 2 filters the irrelevant work which is done by skimming the whole content of the work further while writing the manuscript if the scrutinized work content doesnt seem to fit or the information in the work is already covered in some other considered study then the work is eliminated for instance to gather the information in the field of artificial intelligence the keyword artificial intelligence in healthcare is used for searching in elsevier platform from which the initial screening is performed by analyzing the title whether it is relevant to our study or not then the abstract of the identified works is scanned to scrutinize it and further the content of the work is skimmed to scrutinize it as well as to grasp the necessary information which constitutes the scrutinizing stages 1 and 2 respectivelythe online sources from which information is extracted mainly include world health organization who and reputed information reporting sites such as world economic forum stats mit technology reviews and news reports for online sources we provide keywords as an input to google search engine from which the initial screening is done by analyzing whether the source provides trustable pieces of information then the scrutinizing stage 1 is done by scanning the content of the source whether it is relevant to our study or not besides the stage 2 scrutinization is performed by analyzing the quality of the information as a whole out of around 1500 works resulted from the searches using different keywords we sorted 806 works after initial screening from which 172 work is finalized after subjected to scrutinizing stages so after shaping the manuscript we obtained a total number of references of about 155 that include 32 online sources and 123 journal papers the fig 1
shows the framework flow process for this manuscriptthe pandemic situation demands a certain way of shaping the society to reduce the spread and is the only way to safeguard humanity from breaking the chain of covid-19 infection in this section we will discuss the changes that the society had undergone to mitigate the spreading of the infection the changes can be broadly viewed from healthcare government public industries environment energy and also its impact in future the fig 2
represents the various changes each social bodies and environment undergone during covid-19from the health care point of view technologies have been upgraded a lot to meet the clinical requirements starting from testing to treatment various innovations have been implemented and experimented for instance the testing procedures for covid-19 have been carried out in different phases from short time results with less accuracy to high accuracy testing in tradeoff with time generally polymerase chain reaction pcr test is used for the diagnosis of covid-19 which is quite an accurate method as it detects the presence of viral rna other techniques include serologic testing antigen testing etc verdict medical devices 2020 testing a voluminous population is necessary to give a big picture of the infection status and thus the demand for the testing kits is in peak the technique adopted for testing might vary from place to place for populous countries antibody tests can be effective for initial screening to know the immune nature of the population and to map the infection moreover they can yield results in a short period and rapid antibody testing would consume around 1530 min to give the results india today 2020 bosch developed an innovative quick test to produce the results in two and a half hours and claims that it is one of the worlds completely automatic molecular diagnostic tests verdict medical devices 2020 ai and ml have been contributed in many ways which is discussed in upcoming sections they changed the way of approach in interacting and handling the patients provides insight in predicting the infection spreading rate innovative approaches in diagnosing the disease and identify those who would develop serve symptoms and whatnot another new approach by a group of researchers and engineers of san-francisco called cough for the cure which uses trained model to identify covid-19 with the audio samples of the patients cough verdict medical devices 2020 though it might not seem to be effective as it is not clear whether covid-19 cough is unique but the approach is novel and the usage of telehealth services has exponentially risen during the pandemic periodthe point of view from the government is not easily perceived as much complexity prevails in every action they take the decision making managing public satisfying the requirements of the healthcare system and to have a future plan are the prime functions of the government during the pandemic period the changes that are commonly seen in governance is that they are guiding other tech giants to collectively focus on covid issues and imparting broad awareness among the people these social bodies can control the extent to which technology can be used like experimenting with new techniques for diagnosis at a certain point the privacy of an individual is at stake in order to track the super spreaders in the society and these measures are carried out for the sake of people health governments is also launching schemes supporting scientific projects and initiatives that will assist in communication with the public regarding health crisis world economic forum 2020aregarding the public cooperating with the government is the only way to reduce the infection during the quarantine period people might have been psychologically depressed from the constant exposure to the same environment the streaming industries cellular technology broadband connectivity is some without which the public cannot consistently follow quarantine orders work from home strategies and e-learning makes the society to function as quite normal during the quarantine period but the whole system from healthcare to the public themselves depends on the actions of the people and their cooperationfrom an industry point of view the factories have been closed to mitigate the infection spread but some industries and companies have been indulged in producing products that are required for health care system by following strict social distancing automotive industries have modified their production lines to produce ventilators plastic face shields 3d printed products and so on ns medical devices 2020 fashion brands have changed their manufacturing from clothing and fashion products to prepare masks and other products they are capable of producing alcohol-based companies distillers have indulged in producing disinfectants hand sanitizers plastic products and so on also many other tech companies are providing a helping hand in terms of developing software to improve computing power and supporting the research groups autodesk-redshift 2020 the table 1
shows the various manufacturing industries producing key medical products that are required during pandemicother societal changes can be viewed as an economic impact due to pandemic vendors and small business are suffering from short-term revenue losses the major problem that every brand is facing now is the shipping problems a report on covid-19 survey klaviyo 2020 shows 40 of the brands encounter shipping problems and 56 of the brands are having problems in their supply chain and increased number of brands are spending more on ads yet still 28 of the respondents have claimed to have increased sales another study shows us unemployment fillings had peaked and spain had almost cut 900000 jobs as the country imposed strict enforcement of social distancing to fight against the coronavirus as on 2 april 2020 world economic forum 2020c also air traffic has been tremendously reduced owing to covid-19 pandemic the data from the flightradar24 website shows a 64 reduction in air traffic from 6 march to 6 april 2020 flighttradar24 2020considering the environmental aspects the lockdown has made the public to stay at home which resulted in less air pollution owing to less industrial activities and vehicular movement india houses about 21 cities of the 30 most polluted cities in the world and have reported a reduction in air pollution as well as the people are experiencing cleaner air during the lockdown one day curfew in india have resulted in lowest average levels of nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants such as pm 25 and pm 10 had also dropped significantly according to the experts at center of research on energy and clean air crea crea 2020from energy aspects we can expect a drop in power consumption due to lockdown as many companies shops have been shut down only residential load and industries running for supplying basic needs for the society would draw power from the grid as a case study we have analyzed the power consumption data for the southern region of india from 20 march to 29 march 2020 posoco 2020 the reason for choosing this period is that only during this period india announced the complete lockdown in two stages initially on 22 march one-day curfew was established and then a complete lockdown for 21 subsequent days was executed from 25 march 2020 the graph below fig 3
 shows the variation of power consumption in the southern region of india from 20 march to 29 march 2020 from the graph we can notice a drop in power demand on 22 march corresponding to the one-day curfew and similarly the power demand decreases during complete lockdown period which was initiated from 25 march as a whole on 20 march 2020 the power demand was 53301 mega units mu whereas on 29 march 2020 the power demand was 39467 mega units mu which is almost 26 reduction in the demand powerthe people in a pandemic-circumstances need to have clarity on government decisions policies travel bans quarantine periods and other such important updates the communication should impart awareness among the public for such an emerging infection and should be clear regarding what the health care system knows and that does not about covid 19 the information must be updated as soon as verified by the authorities and at the same time risk perception of the public should also be considered depending on the dose of the information the challenge can be overcome by carefully addressing the information to the mass public in such a way that the information does not increase the panic among the people for example if the quarantine period is extended for an additional 2 weeks then the information should also carry a solution for by how people can access the basic need this will favor in reducing the panic among the people when the update is small to report the mass media can add the basic infection control information and other pieces of information which will impart awareness among people ratzan et al 2020the epidemic outbreak has gained broad media attention and is subjected to social media discourse which might have induced the risk perception among people which in turn would trigger their behavior sjoberg 2000 weinstein 1988 the optimistic people might be easy to control but the pessimistic people will have increased panic this would result in ineffective cooperation from the public side for the health policies which will lead to grave danger weinstein 1988 slovic 1987 hence the risk perception is a factor depending both on the information from the government end and also on the digesting capacity of whole society huynh 2020for effective risk communication a simplified model of government-expert-public-healthcare system risk communication is presented in fig 4
 this is an upgraded communication model of one presented by zhang et al 2020 with a message  centered approach the model comprises of four interaction medium that is the healthcare system  experts government  experts government  public and expert  public here the government is the supreme decision-maker in controlling the activities and the decision will have an impact on the public which can be observed from their behavior as feedback the governmentpublic communication is typically an external communication and the information to be conveyed must be complete and accurate the public must remain optimistic to cooperate with the government and perceive the importance of the information conveyed by the government the actual public response is compared with expected one and needs to be evaluated for effective communication charlebois and summan 2015 and often the government is frustrated by unrealistic public demands covello et al 1987 also the publics feedback would help the government to reshape its communication strategies covello et al 1987 european food safety authority 2017 the government  expert communication is the key for the whole risk management and decision-making policies and it acts as internal communication the expert panel consists of expertise in professional knowledge management and technology they are empowered by the government bodies and they give the data evidence for the risk communication they assess the risk and help in making a rational decision which best benefits the society renn 2008 savage 1951 french 2012 expert  healthcare system communication is the source for assessing the risk or potential impact the identified problem would cause and is regarded as internal communication healthcare system is the one which accurately knows the seriousness of the epidemic what health facilities it requires how much time it needs precaution steps to tackle the situation this is communicated to experts which in turn to government to raise the fund towards the need making decisions or informing the public the expert  public communication is required to bridge the gap between them and it depicts an external communication the public usually fails to understand the complexity of the risk analyzed or involved thus experts can play a role to convey the issue in a more simple and explicit way to make the public understand and act according to the facts gesser-edelsburg et al 2015 in general risk communication management should neither be too centralized nor be too de-centralized conrow 2003another important lesson learnt from affected countries like china and italy is that the risk communication should initiate as soon as possible from the instant the risk is identified and evaluated lundgren and mcmakin 2013 for a case of an unknown disease the communication should be abrupt without any sort of conclusions and once the proper shreds of evidences are gathered to prove it as a novel case the information should be disclosed immediately to the public with appropriate remedial strategies any delay in such instances will cause an unexpected consequenceeven though effective communication is important the false information would result in an unpredicted consequence the filtration of false news especially in social media is impractical but steps have been taken consistently to reduce the same moreover its a decentralized way of information communication and hence its control on spreading false information is in the hands of users it is highly recommended to the public to follow a reputed or official page where verified information is provided it is reported that facebook blocked all the health pronouncements related to covid-19 except official sites and pinterest made all of its search related to covid 19 posts created and approved by who ratzan et al 2020 matteo cinelli et al analyzed mainstream platforms such as instagram twitter and youtube and also some regulated social media platforms and from their analysis they suggest that the spreading of information is due to the interaction of specific patterns of a group of users engaged with the topic cinelli et al 2020 thus study related to social dynamics caused by the consumption of false content is needed to control the misinformation spreading among different mainstreams a piece of evidence also shows that the high exposure to and sharing of fake news in the us has been identified to be concentrated on comparatively sub-sections of the population guess et al 2019 allcott and gentzkow 2017 another study suggests that the government and social media companies should develop and test interventions combined with independent behavioral scientists van bavel et al 2020the widely used application of ai and ml are forecasting and classification of data it is reported that an ai-based start-up bluedot uses an infection-surveillance system all around the clock which scans for more than 100000 online articles across the globe in 65 languages for every 15 min on 30 december 2019 the algorithm noted an unusual bump in pneumonia cases with unknown reason in wuhan china and it alerted the outbreak of disease much before it has officially identified as covid 19 diginomica 2020 thus these eye-opening technologies can predict such epidemics and alert humanity to take the necessary advanced measures companies like bluedot and metabiota employs natural language processing nlp algorithms to perform analysis of health-care reports in different languages and their predictive tools can also be employed to trace the potential infection hubs from the air-travel data for instance public report of metabiota listed the countries which include china italy iran and the us will likely to report new cases and the reality isnt differed much mit technology review 2020a a data-based analysis by constantinos siettos et al forecasted the outbreak in hubiei china up to 29 february 2020 considering the data reported between 11 january and 10 february 2020 they forecasted that a minimum infection would be 45000 and the death count will be around 2700 and the infected number was around 67000 and the death count was in the 2800 s which is close itn 2020a from these incidents we can infer that ai and ml can be used for predicting the situation and based on which we can act accordingly to reduce the intensity of outbreaks data classification along with prediction is significant because it can give a clear idea of how to deal with the data for example during the outbreak there is a demand for identifying the extent of infection cases from mild to critical illness one such analysis was carried out by xiangao jiang et al in which the ai framework was used to find the covid outbreak and the patients at critical illness based on the data from two hospitals in wenzhou zhejiang china jiang et al 2020 the predictive model developed was 70 to 80 accurate with the predicted critical cases such an analysis would have helped the clinical infrastructure to meet the upcoming healthcare product demand also lishi wang et al had developed a patient information-based algorithm to predict and estimate the mortality caused by covid-19 wang et al 2020anumerous factors influence the clinical outcome of the patient which includes the disease the treatment methods and its effect patients intrinsic characteristics noorbakhsh et al 2019 supervised learning techniques are employed in prognosis and biomarkers prediction ml approaches are used in the design of prognostic markers include regression models and classification and regression trees zlobec 2005 artificial neural networks ann are employed in the analysis of marker studies zafeiris et al 2018 bertolaccini et al 2017 unsupervised learning is widely used in identifying biological samples and classifying them it is useful in identifying homogeneous subgroups within the heterogeneous clinical outcomes this type of learning is helpful in treating breast cancer patients perou et al 2000 sorlie et al 2001 dai et al 2015 dente et al used machine learning algorithms to recognize the predictive profiles of bacteremia and pneumonia in the patients treated for combat wounds dente et al 2017 and another utilized ml to design preliminary test models whose role is to predict whether a patient would be tested positive for a specific respiratory virus mai and krauthammer 2017 ai and ml have been significantly boosting the discoveries in genetics and molecular medicine field which also impact on developing vaccines hamet and tremblay 2017 so the role of these technologies in prediction and classification of data is vital in any situation and also one should not blindly believe the outcomes the predicted outcomes should be evaluated along with cognitive thinking to yield a better solutionartificial intelligence application in identifying the infected people and disease is phenomenal in the healthcare system and would transform the medical practice the implementation of ai in visual tasks has significantly growing in the medical field machine-learning models designed to examine the medical images to detect the disease at an early stage is revolutionary this is fueled by large digital dataset and deep learning algorithms to train themselves to attain a specific task the potential application where this vision-based learning can be implemented is radiology ophthalmology pathology and dermatology kulkarni et al 2019 the ai is employed in the diagnosis of melanoma fuller et al 2016 dementia bhagyashree et al 2017 diabetic retinopathy gargeya and leng 2017 tuberculosis lakhani and sundaram 2017 and glaucoma kim et al 2017in a circumstance of rapidly spreading disease like covid-19 the screening of public to pathogenic testing is essential to mitigate the infection but it is a time-consuming process and also accuracy matters a study by shuai wang et al developed a clinical diagnosis for covid-19 based on radiographical changes in ct images by employing deep learning method the method attained an internal evaluation accuracy of 895 and an external validation showed an accuracy of 852 wang et al 2020b companies like delft imaging and thirona together developed a cad4covid screening solution built on the cad4tb software this is now employed by ministries of health and tuberculosis-focused institutions for screening covid-19 itn 2020bartificial intelligence role in treatment is put to limited use and they can help to frame novel methods for diagnosing and monitoring of diseases which will eventually simplify the task for healthcare professionals for instance researchers in japan utilized ai for sequencing genomes of cancer in order to find the patients having hematological malignancies and also to identify the appropriate drug details tojo 2017 heinson et al used ml in reverse vaccinology whose purpose is to distinguish the bacterial protective antigens bpas from non-bacterial protective antigens and this would boost the progress of developing vaccines heinson et al 2017 studies also suggest that ai will assist in the drug development field to analyze the possible outcomes in using a clinical trial drug doyle et al 2015 and also to identify the response in the patient body vidyasagar 2015 hall et al 2017 another problem in the medical field of intensive care is the individual ventilator setting for each patient steven ganzert et al presented a solution for this problem using ml based on data obtained from intensive care they analyzed various methods of determining pressure-volume curves in artificially ventilated patients suffering from adult respiratory distress syndrome ards and implemented ml in recognizing the method for the given pressure-volume curve and also in predicting the volume with the given pressure method and patient data ganzert et al 2002 this would help in assisting the treatment of respiratory illness of the patient and have huge potential in futuremachine learning has the ability to serve the work of clinicians by processing and organization huge pile of patient data stored in electronic health records and is implemented in clinical applications which include identifying patients having high risk who needs icu escobar et al 2016 detecting early symptoms leading to lung cancer ardila et al 2019 determining the respiratory condition of the patient from chest x-rays rajpurkar et al 2017 thus ai and ml enhances the performance of diagnosis prognosis and also in management decisions in healthcare domain ben-israel et al 2019 also deep-learning techniques have a significant impact on the state-of-art speech recognition hinton et al 2012 and visual recognition techniques krizhevsky et al 2017 which has a potentially bigger role in future these deep learning methods employ neural networks to predict the relationship between input and output data another potential aspect of ml is its ability to reduce the service and product costs automation yang 2020 and better customer services lee and shin 2020 intelligent fault diagnosis ifd is another domain of ml where models are designed to diagnosis the machine fault and it frames a relationship between the health state of the machines and growing monitoring data lei et al 2020 this would help human labor substantially and automatically detects the health status of the machine these are the budding technologies that can help a number of sectors for the betterment of societyin covid situation such technologies have already assisted humanity to encounter the circumstances in a much better way a data analytics company stratifyd situated in charlotte north carolina employs ai to scan the posts on the social media streams such as facebook and twitter and cross-references the same with descriptions of diseases extracted from official sources such as national institutes of health world organization for animal health etc mit technology review 2020a ramesh raskar and team at mit media lab developed an app called private kit safe paths that would track ones travelling path and can see whether the person has come in contact with an infected individual without knowing who it is by means of this one can perceive whether the infected person is near them along with other features mit technology review 2020b also other dimension of security issues prevails and apart from it this app alerts us where the infection has been and might make users believe that the certain places arent safe these can be effective only when the people use it and tracking coronavirus hotspots have proven to be effective in countries like south korea artificial intelligence is also indulged in creating tools for patients rather than only focusing on clinicians such as chatbots they belong to special application of ai and employs natural language processing nlp to interpret with the general medical literacy and diagnostics gruson et al 2019 these chatbots can be extended as an application to act as an interface medium for the people to buy basic necessities which can allot timings and order numbers to collect their billed things during quarantine period such that it will assist in maintaining social distancing the table 2
summarizes the reported al and ml technologies that are utilized for controlling covid-19another important aspect of the use of ai and ml in extensive search and gathering of scientific literature related to covid and making them accessible a report says that the several organizations had released covid-19 open research dataset that contains over 24000 peer-reviewed research papers from various reputed journals and also from sources like medrxiv and biorxiv where researchers can publish non-peer reviewed preprint papers it provides an extensive collection of scientific literature regarding current pandemic and updated as and when new research is submitted mit technology review 2020c this is the situation of life and death for numerous patients and improving the healthcare research on the coronavirus its treatment is the need of hour scientists are racing against time to answer crucial questions about the virus and to fasten the development of vaccines and these are the little help we can contribute to enhancing their workthe supply chain includes the production and distribution of a product here we will focus on products that are prime important in encountering an epidemic situation as the active cases of infection is raising it is necessary that the health care system must have a required number of medical equipment testing facility protection equipment in case of covid-19 the infection mainly spreads through tiny droplets carried in air or any surface from the cough produced by the infected person so as a preventive measure masks and hand sanitizers are required in large amount to satisfy the need of the public also to treat infected persons hospitals need ventilators in a massive quantity to meet such demands several solutions have been carried out dyson ltd a british tech company has partnered with the technology partnership ttp designed a brand-new ventilator named covent and it meets the standards of the clinical specification techcrunch 2020 it might be challenging for industries using complex technologies for manufacturing their products to adapt for producing ventilators but several automotive industries have successfully repurposed their factory to produce different products to strengthen the health care system brewers and distillers were restructured their production system to produce hand sanitizer and alcohol-based disinfectants and other suppliers purchases new injection molds for producing test kits autodesk-redshift 2020 fashion brands such as gucci prada zara have transformed their production lines to make millions of masks ns medical devices 2020 all these infer the adaptable nature of manufacturing technology used and their crisis response is satisfying the health care system needs also 3d printing techniques have provided support by manufacturing some key small parts for instance isinnova an italian 3d printing company was able to 3d print a valve designed by decathlon that connected the mask to the conventional hospital respirator world economic forum 2020b in the hospital purchasing of medicines stocking of medicinal products handling waste all have to be managed by health care workers as the number of patients rises it is better to apply ai technology to handle the data jordona et al 2019in the view from peoples end technologies such as telehealth services have been helpful and in this pandemic the health system is reported to have an exponential increase in the use of telemedicine technology stat 2020 and the health system is also using technologies such as chatbots video consultations etc to minimize the load on the hospital during the quarantine period there exists a problem of getting basic needs for the people in order to survive especially food ingredients this can be dealt with by opening the markets at a specific range of time in which limited people at a time can buy things they need by strictly following social distancing for severely affected area the supplies can be provided by the workers with protective equipment we propose a system that can be effectively followed by the people to support social distancing initially the information of available markets in an area should be collectively gathered and uploaded in a website run by some private public or government agencies the people can access the website and choose the market and then can give a request for their need the people will be allotted a slot with specific time range like between 9 and 10 am along with a token number corresponding to the slot the shopkeeper will be in touch with the website request and act accordingly to pack the listed things after verifying the token number and slot timings the things can be handover to the buyer by implementing this one can run the market throughout the day and this will help the mobs to effectively follow the social distancing for the areas prone to serve infection service may be extended to deliver them to the address provided the fig 6
represents the workflow for the proposed supply chain systemalso robots can assist the healthcare workers in providing food taking care of the needs of the patients and other related works within the hospital this can help in reducing the frontline healthcare workers from the possibility of getting infected countries like china india have been implemented robots for sanitizing the hospital delivering foods and medicines the economic times 2020the covid-19 spreads easily and moreover an infected person doesnt know whether he or she is infected since the people might be sick with the virus ranging from 1 to 14 days before developing the symptoms who 2020c so if the society functions as usual the spreading will be at its peak and hence every company which doesnt necessarily need the presence of employees at the working spot is shut down during quarantine period and these companies can get the job done by implementing work from home strategy which is widely employed all over the world the basic requirements for an individual to work from home are a computing device internet accessibility and cam if needed meeting and conferences can be conducted remotely through video conference with the advancement of communication technology and network connectivity remote working has been functioning well when considering security the calls can be encrypted and firewall software can be usedthe rapid spreading nature of covid-19 has also caused to shut down all educational institutes so students staying at home needs to be addressed with some solution to continue their learning e-learning represents an innovative form of education which provides rich learning experience e-learning is a web-based technology where sources can be provided by variety of means zoroja et al 2014 babu and reddy 2015 the countries leading the chart of online education include us uk india china south korea edtechreview 2020 many platforms have been developed for distance learning such as google classroom coursera udacity etc in covid situation coursera have offered many free courses to enhance the learning experience of the students from home numerous initiatives have encouraged the e-learning during the quarantine period to keep the students in line with education in certain cases the online session was live-streamed through video conferencing by the professor for a group of students all these technologies have indirectly contributed in helping people to stay at home also online competitions are conducted by the government in the covid topic to stimulate young minds to think about a solution in some countries like indiakeeping in track the infected person and their travel history would be helpful in controlling the spread many governments follow different methods to achieve this in china cctv cameras were installed at the apartment door for those need to be in 14-day quarantine to make sure that they follow it in singapore the government launched a mobile application namely tracetogether it utilizes the bluetooth technology of the cellphones to identify any potential carries of coronavirus that they might have been in closer contact with other people whereas in hong kong specific persons were made to wear a wristband that is synced with smartphone app so that if they leave the place of quarantine it would alert the authorities cnbc 2020 in india people in the southern state of kerala have been tracked to determine who have been in close contact with an infected person through a mixture of cctv camera footage and mobile phone location data while in south korea authorities employ cell phone technology and satellite technology to track down the individuals thomson reuters foundation news 2020 bluetooth technology is more precise than gps technology as it can be located up to six-foot precision at a given time also drone technology has been helpful in surveillance they can be used to tell the public to a wear mask and other awareness sentences they are also used to deliver medicines and food to the public cnbc 2020when compared to other areas ai is limitedly used in surgical fields moreover surgeons and doctors are efficiently capturing the data and integrating them with ai and it has a promising future for providing quality healthcare by assisting doctors during surgery because it promotes evidence-based clinical decision to carry-out the workflow it might not possible at present to implement ai in the surgical field to treat covid-19 infected patients but at least in the near future we can make use of ai to treat the patient and also for adjusting ventilator parameters for individual patients ganzert et al 2002ai technology is proficient for clinical trials and provides effective monitoring to attain a precise result medicine and vaccine development are some crucial areas where ai can be implemented to accelerate the process further the effects of a drug when used in a human body can be predicted with the given input dataai can be effectively utilized to maintain medical records and perform general administration works in the health care facility in an epidemic situation ai can support the hospital management systems to automate the customer and patient data storage maintaining the medical records and other essential details they can track and analyze the patient data and can provide real-time data to the healthcare workers as well as to patients family members haleem et al 2019 these are small efforts which can deliberately ease the work for health care workers the table 3
shows the various potential applications of ai that can be implemented to diagnose treat predict and make decisions regarding covid-19apart from these aspects ai can be helpful in making wise decisions in many situations furthermore it can manage patient bookings and provide a reminder to the doctors buch et al 2018 kulikowski 2019 upadhyay and khandelwal 2019 these technologies also led to the development of virtual interaction with doctors through various platforms thus by deploying ai in the medical field the manual load for doctors can be reduced such that they can focus on planning decision making and identifying treatment patel et al 2009 wahl et al 2018the emergence of the internet of things iot has influenced every field and the advancement has been skyrocketed in recent years dohr et al 2010 miorandi et al 2012 chen et al 2014 iot in healthcare is expected to influence a substantial improvement and hence enhancing the quality of healthcare service to humans domingo 2012 yan et al 2015 fan et al 2014 these technologies are of utmost use when the machine to machine communications and automation is involved according to the study ying et al 2020 in china one of strategy utilized to resolve drug delivery issues during the epidemic period was by implementing iot based service platform fig 8
indicates the workflow the platform generated orders automatically based on the data of previous sales from the hospital information system his this can be updated and submitted by the pharmacists and then the orders are sent to suppliers from where the medicines are delivered within a stipulated time this had mitigated the spreading of infection during drug purchase and also saved the resources and laborthis can be viewed from two perspectives delivering medicines goods samples to the health care system from the local hub poljak and sterbenc 2019 another aspect includes delivering basic needs such as food items and medicines for the healthcare system masks disinfectants and other lightweight goods can be transported from local hub on a truck-and-drone delivery system which is claimed to be effective crisan and nechita 2019 drones in logistics and first aid are regarded as emerging technologies with enormous potential and many experiments were investigated to analyze such possibilities cision pr newswire 2016 also in populous countries collection of samples for testing can be done in localized approach reducing the load on the healthcare system space and the samples can be sent to nearby testing facility by adopting drone technology for faster transportation certain reports showed the viability of transportation of biological samples by the deployment of the drone at room temperature and it was seen that no considerable influence on the accuracy of hematology coagulation analysis and routine chemistry amukele et al 2015 amukele et al 2016 also drones have been successful in delivering life-saving materials to the healthcare in a stimulated austere territory in which the vehicle access is far-fetched drones have accurately delivered medical supplies weighing 45 kgs to the target within a one-mile range quickly than any other means mesar et al 2018 another potential drone technology includes lab-on-a-drone concept which is especially suitable for regions where the laboratories are located at remote places and the regions where delivery of diagnostic instruments is arduous in this lab-on-a-drone the sample preparation strategies and molecular diagnostic platforms are coupled with the drone and it also helps in reducing the time taken for testing the sample priye et al 2016 this usage of drone technology approach can be also used in supplying food and basic needs in especially highly infected area to prevent people coming outside but it requires a proper system of getting the public requirements which should be communicated to the supplier from which the delivery of products will happen from a localized hub though this involves many complications mostly due to public engagement it might be promising in near-future the new york times 2018 the development of information and communication technologies ict has increased the possibilities for implementing drone technology with the aid of telecommunication
surveillance drones are best suited for surveillance application and are in practice for a while vacca and onishi 2017 mishra et al 2020 in covid-19 circumstances surveillance is particularly needed for monitoring the public whether they are following the lockdown and social distancing and also for imparting awareness through drone communication for this purpose a commercially available drone can be utilized to monitor society this can help patrols to focus on other important issues that need action the table 4
shows the potential applications of drone technology that can be implemented during the pandemic situationrobotics can provide assistance in an innumerable way and it is a proven technology in many respects nursing and healthcare receiving are a labor-intensive work and robotics in the healthcare system is an encouraging solution with the support of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms a robot can learn itself from massive data and acquire immense intelligence these robots can be more effective in providing diagnosis and treatment when compares to a human caregiver further mobile robots have tremendous advantages in healthcare facilities wan et al 2019 yi et al 2008 in an epidemic outbreak the healthcare facilities will be flourished with patients in such situations the help of robots is highly favorable and it can assist in data analysis to treatment in diagnosis a well-trained robot can perceive information from the scans and can interpret whether the person has got a certain disease this can also be applied in detecting coronavirus by training the robot with many infected individual ct scan images a simplified robot for communication purposes or for providing foods for patients even scanning every person working in health care facility and asking them to wear masks or gloves if they werent would provide a great support for healthcare individuals in an advanced level robot to identify stress levels of health care workers using facial recognition to monitor their health status will be fortunate to improve healthcare services effective communication between the robots and data centers are required hence a concerned framework needs to be designed for maintaining edge computing and centralized computing which is essential for both robotics and communication communities liu et al 2017 sahni et al 2017 wan et al 2018 finally a robot is good at performing repetitive tasks with less error relative to humans and will strengthen the healthcare facilitiesthe development of information technology has created widespread application in various means and is rapidly growing in the presence of internet further the smartphones have paved a way to access these technologies in much simpler way in the present world smartphones play phenomenal role as they are embedded with interactive high-quality displays high resolution cameras widespread connectivity to the internet and supporting for various software mobile application software is vital since they have the potential to connect with the world from just a hand sized device and can perform various tasks in the pandemic situation they can assist in number of ways ranging from offering mobile health m-health facility to helping farmers in logistics m-health applications can provide clinical assistance at any time and any location thus overcoming the geological restrictions and it helps the healthcare workers to provide optimum service via cellular technology pinem et al 2020 as the world is heading towards 5g cellular communication the m-health application would get a tremendous boost another perspective regarding healthcare lies in giving therapies and a study reported the use of mobile application for hand therapy valdes et al 2020 mobile applications also act as a guidance for many activities such as for performing exercise cooking monitoring the habits task management and what not integration of technologies in market production and supply chain handling can be effectively improved by the development of mobile applications which also influences the digitalization to some extent farmers are mostly affected by the logistics problem in pandemic crisis proper connectivity with the market with the aid of government can help the farmers to identify the demand location for their products and the subsequent supply chain requirements can be met all these can be controlled through a mobile application effectively nuanmeesri 2019 as an advanced application the usage of augmented reality is encouraged even shopping can be assisted with the utilization of augmented reality during lockdown period mclean and wilson 2019here we will provide some essential guidelines to follow for various social bodies to encounter the novel coronavirus these instructions and guidelines have been extracted from the who official website who 2020d and also we present our suggestive guidelines along with itgeneral instructions on preventive measures dos and dontsfrequent cleaning of hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water and the wearing of the mask are the only and simple preventive measures that can prevent the infection of the novel coronavirus the disinfectant will pave a way for rapid killing of the coronavirusknow the procedures for wearing using and disposing of the mask it is advisable to wear a mask only when exposed to an infected environment or when taking care of an infected person and it is fundamental to cover your mouth or nose when you are coughing or sneezingthe common symptoms that an affected individual experience is dry cough tiredness and fever the only best way to diagnosis covid-19 disease is through a laboratory test hence if symptoms are perceived voluntary approach for testing is entertainedfrequent consumption of alcohol could potentially increase the health problemsthermal scanners are not an effective method for diagnosis of covid-19 because it can only detect people having higher temperature ie fever and moreover people might remain infected for 114 days before developing actual symptoms thus it cannot detect people who are infected yet are not sick with a fever
guidelines for governmentcreate awareness educate and communicate with the public actively through risk communication and communication engagementfind active case by testing trace the infected person history of travel quarantine of contacts and isolation of infected person adapt an existing surveillance system to monitor the infection spreadtest all the individuals who meet the suspected case definition
guidelines for publicfollow the government and coordinate to fight against covid-19 show support kindness and compassion for those who are affected and avoid the social stigmaget exposed to adequate information about covid-19 too much watching listening and reading the news about the situation can make one feel anxious or distressed also focus on facts and avoid misinformation or rumors get information only from trusted sources who or local health authority platformprotect yourself by adopting proper preventive measures and also help others who are in need find a way to enhance the positivity among the family and societyhonor healthcare workers clinicians and others supporting in this pandemic fight which also includes you
guidelines for healthcare workershealthcare workers should follow established protocols and safety procedures to diagnose triage and treat the patientsmake sure that the admitted patients should have covered their nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing also patients with suspected covid-19 should be provided with masks while they are waitingfollow hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions the fig 9
shows the five moments of hand hygiene for health care workersmaintaining your mental health is as significant as your physical health try to stay connected to loved ones through digital communications and also with your colleagues take necessary rests afterall this is a marathon and not a sprint
the outbreak of coronavirus 2019 covid-19 has widely affected people all over the world and radically changed the routine functions of humanity as a species on this earth we have to use our gifted intelligence to encounter this novel coronavirus using technology proper governance healthcare service coordinated public behavior can help a lot in mitigating the risk the support of technology in handling this situation is irreplaceable so in this section we will summarize the key aspects of each section and analyze the current challenges associated with itthe first section presents the technological changes that the society and the environment have been through from different aspects the healthcare facilities have rapidly been modified for increasing their patient intake capacity and also improving the telehealth facilities to reduce the load on the hospitals the testing methods and facilities are technologically enhanced to diagnose a large number of test samples in this pandemic situation government role in a society is important and it satisfies the needs of the healthcare system and simultaneously helps the public in accessing the basic needs and monitoring them public viewpoint is to coordinate with the government and follow the social distancing and other preventive measures correctly industries have aligned themselves to help in meeting the demands of the healthcare system and regarding energy aspects the power consumption by the people during the lockdown was significantly lower when compared to the time of before lockdown period other insights about the economical viewpoint of the society and environmental changes involving a drop in air pollutants are discussedthe core investigation is presented in the sections of technological strategies to control the pandemic and support the society during pandemic which is followed by viable prospective technologies the technological strategies that aids in controlling the pandemic play around information communication ai ml and supply chain technologies that have a direct influence on mitigating the spreading when considering communication information transfer to the public is much more important to control the mass public for which media and social media creates a pathway then risk perception by the people will affect the societal response to the pandemic hence proper communication should be conveyed by the government to the people and it is mandatory to eliminate the rumors or false information that is potentially taking place in social media streams for which many steps have been taken by companies and government jointly artificial intelligence and machine learning are the promising technologies that can help in numerous ways in tackling the situation they are being adopted in the prediction of outbreaks and in the healthcare systems for the diagnosis of disease through scans classification of medical data handling big data of patients assisting in treatments and so on other aspects where ai is implemented in covid-19 period are for supporting chatbots developing apps for tracking infected people and in creating a huge database for accumulating all published sars-cov-2 related researches in this situation supply chain technologies address the production and transportation issues of prior products required by the health care system this explains how different industries adapted their production lines to produce ventilators masks hand-sanitizers and other products and this is possible only by use of technology further supply chain of the basic needs required by the public also has some vacant space where tech can be implemented to avoid crowding in certain places the technological strategies supporting the society during pandemic focusses on the implemented strategies that are helpful in supporting the public government and health care system to make them stay at home these strategies include work from home distance learning and surveillance work from home and distance learning gives people some purposes for staying at home whereas the surveillance technologies help the government to monitor the general public and track the same the section viable prospective technologies deals with the potential technologies that are used less and their utilization can effectively enhance the various processes in healthcare facilities surveillance and in avoiding direct contact with the infected persons these technologies comprise of ai ml and iot drone technology and robot technology the various application of ai has been listed in the table along with the discussion of the possibility of their use in the current situation also iot is a crucial technology in automation which can assist in supply chain technologies to transform it to be completely automatic with the given requirements drone and robot technology are high tech field which had tremendously improved in recent years drone technology will be most appropriate for applications such as the delivery of goods samples surveillance and so on whereas the robot technologies can have a significant impact on the healthcare facilities in numerous aspects which have been discussed briefly and finally we provide some essential guidelines for various social bodies to mitigate the spreading of the infectionthe emergence of covid-19 has pushed the limits of the technologies and many alternatives have been proposed to encounter the pandemic this had accelerated the innovations taking place in technologies in almost every field the online experience that the people come across during this period might have a long-term influence in online shopping e-learning digital payments telehealth facilities and mobile entertainment the core technologies that would get a boost include artificial intelligence machine learning internet of things location and navigation technologies augmented and virtual reality drone technology robotics cloud and entertainment technologies the situation has caused to search for alternatives and innovative technologies for instance the ban of biometrics for the welfare of the people during pandemic have a potential to shift the tech to other options such as facial and iris recognition technologies gcn 2020 the data-driven applications and responses regarding the ongoing situation will encourage the development of it systems to enhance the tracking detection and analysis the telehealth technologies have been improved to handle telehealth consults which have gone up multiple folds since the pandemic global quarantine has put a strain on the maintenance of energy and water demands and other utilities hence these utilities need monitoring of the variations in the usage patterns and thus the supply can be redirected wherever required apart from it these data can be useful to take advance actions in future outbreaksthe innovations are rolling out using various prospective technologies and many start-ups have come up with different solutions but these need robust testing before deployment in a practical environment apart from these the government has to give approval for such innovations financial express 2020 it is neither possible to survive with existing technologies nor to analyze the full potential of such an innovative approach as the infection will get worse with the delay hence there should be a balance in considering these innovations some reports suggest that digital transformation will accelerate and the cybersecurity risk might be a problem within a shorter term cio 2020 also the adopted changes might have an influence on how we will live and work in near-futureto conclude it is certain that humanity will fight its best and heal from the pandemic but the concern is regarding how soon we can eradicate this viral infection meaning that the humanity is racing with time thanks to the healthcare workers and researchers the utilization of technologies will strengthen the defense line against the infection but it is purely in the hands of humans to mitigate the spread the government should deploy tech-based solutions apart from the technologies management and governance are key factors in facing this crucial situation and how we deal with it will showcase the intelligence of human species the technology will be a pioneering weapon in this war against the unexpectedthis work did not receive any external funding

the authors declare no conflict of interestwe are witnessing the spread of the most deadly and devastating virus attack of the last one hundred years this virus is known as the novel corona virus or sars-cov-2 and the disease resulting from this virus has been named by as covid-19 by 1 where a historical background of the corona virus can also be found figure 1 shows a visual of a viruscovid-19 was first detected in december 2019 in wuhan city of the peoples republic of china as the virus spread the world health organization who 1 declared it to be a pandemic on 12th march 2020 2 signaling the significance of its global spread during the first 4 months of spread this deadly disease has infected about three million people resulting in about two hundred thousand deaths in more than 209 countries these figures are mostly of the hospital admissions of a handful countries as reported by the media real numbers would never be known the united states of america has the maximum number of casualties as well as infections followed by italy spain france and the united kingdom these figures are largely reported by a handful of developed countries however there is limited information of fatalities reported from developing countries many of which do not have adequate testing facilities andor hospital beds to treat all the patients therefore the extent of actual damage by covid-19 would be limited in its accuracyundoubtedly covid-19 is causing the most severe economic crisis after the great depression of 1930s as the virus continues to cause havoc the extent of the global damage resulting from it cannot be counted until it subsides in this article we shall discuss damage which it has already caused to different walks of life and speculate further damage it could inflictin recent years we have witnessed an increased growth and spread of communicable and highly contagious viruses and diseases like ebola 3 hiv aids 4 swine influenza h1n1 h1n2 5 various strands of flu 6 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 7 and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers 8 in africa the middle east and several other parts of the world wiping cleaning and treatment of some of these viruses is a very challenging job 9 and so it is very difficult to assess the spread of some of these viruses eg ebola which could create havoc in the societyin this article we shall analyze issues associated with and impact of covid-19 in different walks of life in particular we shall describe the devastation and damage it has caused to economic social cultural and political fabric of the society globally particularly in different regions indeed some industries have benefited from the crisis caused by covid-19 which we shall also analyzethe coronavirus disease covid-19 is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 fig 1 which is resulting in a heavy toll on peoples lives and colossal economic damage some reports eg 10 suggest that covid-19 would cause the worst recession since the great depression of 1930s it is said the pandemic had plunged the world into a crisis like no other although covid-19 is being dubbed to be very destructive to the human lives and economies it is currently not as lethal as many other pandemics have been there have been more destructive epidemics in the past the most deadly of all pandemics occurred in 191819 which is known as the spanish influenza pandemic causing acute illness in about thirty percent of the worlds population and claiming the lives of at least 40 million people 11 according to 12 it caused up to one hundred million deaths but the best estimates seem to be fifty million 13let us glance at some of the earlier pandemics and diseases the archaeological sites called hamin mangha and miaozigou in north-eastern china suggest that it was an epidemic which devastated the entire region around 430 bc an epidemic in athens went on for about 5 years killing an estimated one hundred thousand people 12 during 165180 ad the antonine plague is thought have killed more than five million people in the roman empire during 541542 the bubonic plague named as justinian after the name of the emperor killed up to one tenth of the worlds population 12 the black death during 134653 killed more than half of the population of europe 12 during 154548 the cocoliztli epidemic took the lives of fifteen million people of mexico and central america the great plague of london during 196566 killed about one hundred thousand people and the great plague of marseille during 17201723 wiped out thirty percent of the population of the area 12 the russian plague during 17701772 took the lives of about one hundred thousand people in and around moscow and flu pandemic during 18891890 took the lives of about one million people globally 12the 2009 swine flu pandemic was caused by a new strain of h1n1 that originated in mexico in the spring of 2009 before spreading to the rest of the world in one year the virus infected as many as 14 billion people across the globe and killed between 151700 and 575400 people according to the centre for disease control and prevention cdc a vaccine for the h1n1 virus that caused the swine flu is now included in the annual flu vaccine ebola ravaged west africa between 2014 and 2016 with 28600 reported cases and 11325 deaths there are other pandemics and diseases including the philadelphia yellow fever of 1793 american polio epidemic of 1916 for which a vaccine was developed in 1954 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov of 2012 which has accounted for thousands of livesto date there is no vaccine or medicine to prevent or treat covid-19 however many health centres are treating patients with some antibiotics erythromycin and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine these drugs neither provide a definitive treatment nor are approved by who or any credible organization nevertheless 16 claims based on clinical trials in china chloroquine phosphate is apparently shown to be effective with acceptable safety level to cure pneumonia in covid-19 patients according to 17 combination of the chinese medicine interferon lopinavir ritonavir and corticosteroids was helpful in the recovery of 50 out of 51 patients according to 18 administration of moxifloxacin lopinavir interferon and methylprednisolone to non-icu patients was successful in treating icu patients26 patients were discharged from the intensive care unit icu and sixteen were relived from the hospitalthere are some unconfirmed success stories of treatment of covid-19 with herbal ingredients like black seeds ginger and honey etc these ingredients are indeed recognised as good for health in general pain relieving medicines like panadol are of course used to bring down the body temperature caused by virus in severe cases when patients cannot breathe by themselves ventilators have to be used there are many myths surrounding the treatment of covid-19 which we shall look at nextthe world health organization has framed some guidelines and measures to check or slow the spread of covid-19 to the community some of these measures are also summed up in 19 here we provide a summary of these measuresfirst and foremost it is highly recommended to wash hands properly and regularly whenever the hands are exposed to any surface the hands should be washed with soap for at least 20 s use of hand gloves is helpful in preventing exposure of hands to contaminated surfaces and places protective gears for medicos are a necessity but the case of medical and medical workers will be dealt elsewhere frequent and regular use of sanitizers creams gels sprays is also recommended there seems to be some controversy about the effectiveness of face masks various outlets have frequently reported the shortage of medical grade masks n95 due to high demand for medical professionals and general public globally the centers for diseases and prevention cdc has also advised people to use face masks and even use cloth masks if proper ones are not available studies have revealed that even the best face masks cannot prevent some unfiltered air getting through in order to make them highly effective social distancing is recommended to reduce the risk of contaminated droplets being spread from an infected person to other people through coughing or sneezing self-isolation is also a very useful technique to prevent the spread of covid-19unfortunately there are many myths about curing covid-19 patients some of them are astonishing the world health organization 20 has refuted many of them we provide a summarythe following acts or practices do not prevent covid-195g mobile networkexposure to temperatures more than 25 degrees celsiushot and humid climatesconsumption of alcoholcold weather and snowhot bathhand dryersspraying alcohol or chlorine all over the bodyvaccines used for pneumoniaregularly rinsing your nose with salineantibioticsspecific medicinesthe following are also clarified in 20 if one is exposed to coronavirus the virus would not stay in the body for the rest of life holding the breath for 10 s or more without coughing or feeling discomfort does not mean that the body is free from covid-19 mosquito bites cannot transmit coronavirus there is no evidence that eating garlic prevents coronavirus although garlic is considered very healthy for the body people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus 2019-ncov but those at greatest risk of infection include the elderly people with compromised immune systems and people with chronic health conditions eg asthma diabetes and heart diseasethermal scanners are only effective in detecting people with fever but cannot detect people with coronavirus one should not use uv lamps to sterilize hands or other areas of skin because uv radiation can cause skin irritation some people have claimed that cow urine can prevent coronavirus there is no evidence to support their claim on the contrary 21 and 22 have categorically stated that the cow urine doesnt help prevent the virus in 22 it is stated that experts have repeatedly asserted that cow urine does not cure illnesses like cancer and there is no evidence that it can prevent coronavirusthe covid-19 is causing the most severe losses to the economies of many nations recently we have witnessed the oil prices to hit the subzero territory for the first time during the history of the mankind we are already witnessing some very serious impact in china where the virus first emerged in december 2019 seems to be coming out of the pandemic according to 23 china has suffered loss of 135 in its industrial production 21 in retail sales 92 in car sales and 95 in restaurants according to 24 worlds working class estimated to be more than three and a quarter billion strong is being severely impacted by the sudden and unimaginable slowdown in the world economy causing unprecedented loss in employment in all countries one of the reasons cited for the heavy toll lies in the fact that more than four-fifth of the workforce lives in countries which are under severe restrictions of distancing and lockdown due to curfews and other mandatory closures according to 26 decline in working hours by 1st aril 2020 is estimated to be equivalent to two hundred million fulltime job loss many developed countries are facing a two digit unemployment rate forcing people to seek unemployment benefits severely impacting the economies of those countries if the pandemic is prolonged the loss of jobs could be many folds goldman sachs has predicted that the us economy in the april-june quarter of 2020 could shrink to about three fourth more than twice worse of any previous setbacks 23 the pandemic has the potential to cause the worst recession everpoliticians in many countries have responded to salvage their economies the us has come up with a stimulus package of more than us 2 trillionone of the hardest hit economic sectors is civil aviation most of the air travel has been suspended for weeks now forcing many airlines to slash their staff by up to 90 and asking their government to salvage the industry preliminary estimates according to 25 for the period of january to june of 2020 suggest the loss of over five hundred million passengers amounting to about fifty percent of the seats available causing loss of revenue of more than one hundred billion dollars if the pandemic was prolonged we should expect even more severe economic losses to the economy in general and civil aviation in particularthe oil producers are reeling on the face of the current pandemic due to lockdowns and severe restrictions on all modes of transportations the demand for oil has drastically depleted despite the reduction in oil production the price of crude oil has gone to under twenty dollars a barrel this will severely impact the economies of the oil exporting countries like saudi arabia and other countries of the arabian peninsula and africa as well other oil producers like russia brazil venezuela mexico and kazakhstanon the face of covid-19 many countries had debated whether closing down educational institution was in their interest many countries like australia delayed their action plan but in eventually they had rightly decided to close down or limit attendance to all educational institutions to prevent the spread of covid-19 due to these closures millions of children and adults in many countries have suffered not only the loss of education but also the mental health educational institutions mostly in the developed countries with the help of online tools have managed to impart education in this situation but mostly in the higher education sector some developing countries like saudi arabia have also done a remarkable job to provide education through learning management systems or open access internet tools like teams skype etc but in many other developing countries there has been a virtual wash out of educational activities at all level since march 2020 the pandemic has forced many countries to invest more in the online teaching delivery however the online teaching would not be very helpful at the school level many other activities like conferences symposia have adopted online mode due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and the disrupted educational sector the admissions to the academic year in the northern hemisphere face a difficult task to manage authors in 26 and 27 have assessed the impact which covid-19 has caused so during the first 3 months of its spreadsadly social and religious setbacks arising from covid-19 have been heart-breaking most death have occurred to the elderly disabled and indigenous people the highly contagious virus has not only killed tens of thousands people but have also prevented their loved ones to be with them in their last moments an account of social carnage is presented by the un 28 the daily loss of lives in some cities have caused severe difficulties in in their last rites mass graves like one in new york fig 2 are very sad realities of our livesthe pandemic has caused severe setback to religious practices which has no parallels in the history many religious institutions including mosques were closed in march 2020 in efforts to limit the spread of virus this closure also included the grand mosque in makkah which houses kaaba fig 3 the most sacred site for muslims kaaba is center of hajj and umrah pilgrimages 29 30 which attracts millions of pilgrims its closure especially during the upcoming fasting month of ramadan is very unfortunate the grand mosque closure causes losses of billions of dollars to the government of saudi arabia if the pandemic caused the cancellation of the annual pilgrimages of hajj in late july 2020 the saudi economy would incur the loss of several billion dollars there have also been setbacks to other religious communities of the world the pope john paul had to address an empty hall at vatican on the occasion of easter also the devotees were denied the entry to bethlehem the birth place of jesus the son of marry the pandemic also severely impacted the religious observation of passoverwhile more than half of the world population locked down to contain the spread of covid-19 accusations and counter accusations have surfaced in different parts of the world some of these accusations are aimed against certain ethnicities and religious minorities which are divisive in a time when unified approach is required many of the accusations are centered on the action plans of different countries and the origins of the virus itself it is a general belief that many governments did not take the threat of covid-19 serious enough reported by the guardian leader of the democratic party in the us where more than 50000 people have died in the first 4 months nancy pelosi on 29th march accused the president of the usa mr donald trump of denials and delays in action plane to limit the spread of covid-19 to save costing human lives on the other hand mr trump claims to have saved hundreds of thousands of american lives as reported by the international media he also called sars-cov-2 to be a chinese virus many accusations have also surfaced in australia england and other developed countries in some countries hatful behavior and even physical assaults have also been witnessed against certain communities many doctors and nurses have been attacked by the patients or public mobsthere are many economic and social sectors which are indirectly affected by the covid-19 full extent of the damage to these sectors will be known after sometime some of the business sectors which have severely been impacted by the pandemic include general transport investment banking traditional retail professional sports and entertainment cinemas general home and car insurance manufacturing some form of healthcarealthough the losses from covid-19 are staggering there are some winners as well environment is the greatest winner from the covid-19 pollution levels globally are so low that none of us expected them to go down so much especially in china india and other developing countries businesswise super markets and grocery stores have witnessed increase in sales without relying on any discounts and promotions initially the supermarkets in australia and elsewhere were unable to meet the demand of essential food and other items the online businesses in general and digital content providers in particular have also witnessed bumper sales indeed price of many items have doubled and tripled there have been complains of some stores charging excessive prices for the sought after items like face masks and hand sanitizers the pharmaceutical companies have also benefited from the pandemic demand for certain drugs antibiotics chloroquine and sedatives have created shortage face masks gloves sanitization gels and creams have also disappeared from the shelves of the pharmaceuticals other sectors which have benefited from the pandemics are logisticsdelivery entertainment streaming and gaming and video conferencingcovid-19 is causing human economic social and cultural setbacks of our lives we already witnessed colossal economic losses in the first 4 months of the emergence of coronavirus in china during the first 4 months of the battle with covid-19 200 people including many health workers have lost their lives we know that many countries lack resources for testing and treating the epidemic therefore the real loss of lives caused by it will never be known indeed the pandemic is causing severe depression across the board with no cure or vaccine in sight we cannot the end of this crises caused by this pandemic evidence based warning of the medical experts on the reoccurrence of covid-19 attacks on already treated people are heartbreaking one wonders if the worst is yet to come when we come out this crisis only then we shall be able to assess the actual damage it caused many of us would be left without our loved ones a sizable section of the society would have lost their jobs all these add to the ingredients of a depression of a magnitude unimaginable to many of us unfortunately some politicians are perusing their political agenda in disregard to the suffering of the society reeling under covid-19 although the end of this pandemic is currently unknown historically mankind has managed to recover from similar events in the past this suggests that we will eventually be able to recover from this crisisthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which started in china was declared a global pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 following its spread to several other countries across the globe 1 the outbreak in china began in december 2019 after some health institutions reported clusters of patients reporting with pneumonia of unknown cause that were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in wuhan hubei province 2 3 coronaviruses a large family of viruses have caused two pandemics in the past two decadessevere acute respiratory disease sars in 2002 4 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 5 the sars coronavirus sars-cov-1 is similar to the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and scientists believe that sars-cov-1 which is mainly found in bats could cause a future disease outbreakaside from pneumonia it has been observed that other clinical symptoms of covid-19 include fever dry cough and breathing difficulties dyspnoea disease onset of covid-19 may result in progressive respiratory failure owing to alveolar damage as observed by transverse chest computerized-tomography images and even death 6according to the who covid-19 had spread to 180 countries and territories killing more than 50000 people and infecting about 1 million people with 202000 recoveries as of april 2 2020 7 the spread of the disease has forced many countries to activate their public health surveillance systems with the intention of tracing contacts of identified cases for quarantine and isolating and treating active cases to reduce the spread of the disease as covid-19 continues to rapidly spread efforts are being made to discover vaccines and other interventions to prevent and treat the infections as well as to flatten the infection curve to the barest minimum as soon as possible in the meantime some medicines in use for other conditions are being relied upon for the treatment of active cases based on anecdotal reports this paper presents the pharmacovigilance implications of the introduction of these medicinesthe development of vaccines and their remarkable success in preventing several infectious diseases such as ebola virus disease and the swine flu h1n1 infection has given mankind hope that infectious diseases could be controlled or even eliminated vaccines typically prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases in the uninfected population thus creating the opportunity to flatten the infection curve vaccines work by eliciting an immune response in the individual in order to fight the active infection should it occur in future 8in most pandemics the media public research institutions pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders focus largely on the design of vaccines rather than therapies to treat patients with the active disease this leaves healthcare professionals in a predicament as to deciding the best therapeutic agents to use in order to achieve optimal treatment outcomes as a result of the self-limiting nature of most viral infections physicians manage the symptoms and complications of infection while the patients are advised to rest and maintain good nutrition and hydration to enhance immune function 9 10 however with covid-19 there are emerging therapies which are purported to be associated with very good treatment outcomes the food and drugs administration fda of the usa for instance has sanctioned the compassionate use of chloroquine 11 a 4-minoquinoline medicine which has been used for many years to treat rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyria cutanea tarda even though its use in the treatment of malaria in sub-saharan africa was banned in the early 2000s due to the incidence of adverse reactions and resistance 12 this compassionate approval of chloroquine as well as a statement made by president trump on the possible benefits of chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 has led many into believing that chloroquine is a magical covid-19 drugaside from the approval of the compassionate use of chloroquine by the fda the national institutes of health nih of the usa has recently published a new study that found hydroxychloroquine which is also a 4-aminoquinoline and a derivative of chloroquine as more effective and potent than chloroquine against covid-19 in vitro 13 moreover a recently conducted randomized controlled study by gautret et al in france showed that 100 of patients who received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin tested negative and were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment 14 consequently large pharmaceutical companies are considering re-positioning themselves to manufacture chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in larger volumes and seeking to establish contacts with markets where profitability could be maximized with the resulting increase in the demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine bayer and teva pharmaceutical industries for instance have donated chloroquine products to the usa while mylan plans to restart production of chloroquine tablets 11 currently many countries have drafted their covid-19 treatment protocols using these medicines and there have been varying treatment outcomes which corroborate what another french study on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has found out-there is no evidence of rapid antiviral clearance or clinical benefit 15chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with cardiotoxicity prolonged qt syndrome with prolonged use particularly in patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction these drugs could also cause immunosuppression aplastic anemia agranulocytosis retinal damage and peripheral neuropathy with hydroxychloroquine associated with a lower incidence of side effects 17 18 there has been a surge in the demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in many parts of the world in china there have been complaints about people ordering chloroquine from online drug stores and self-medicating at fatal doses moreover in nigeria west africa two cases of chloroquine poisoning have already been reported which have raised concerns among healthcare professionals 19 furthermore in the arizona state of the usa a man died after ingesting a high dose of chloroquine in an attempt to protect himself from covid-19 while the wife who also ingested the same drug was admitted at the hospital under critical care 20the rush for these medicines because of the covid-19 scare could deny those whose conditions require their prescriptions patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus rely on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as part of their treatment regimen 21 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are particularly indispensable in managing the constitutional musculoskeletal skin and mild pleuritic symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus an autoimmune disease that is very challenging to manage the shortage of these medicines could therefore cause poor treatment outcomes with the current lock-downs being enforced in many countries across the globe to reduce the movement of people toward mitigating the spread of the virus the situation could be worsened by panic buying to keep these medicines for use at home as first aid pharmaceutical products to prevent covid-19 moreover the disruption in supply chain due to the restricted movement of humans and goods could aggravate the situation as the stocks of these medicines get depleted a recent scoping review conducted by phuong et al 22 has revealed that medication shortages resulted in negative patient clinical economic and humanistic outcomes consequently efforts must be made to curb this impending crisisthe indiscriminate use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could lead to resistance of sars-cov-2 to these medicines in an event where the ongoing clinical trials establish that these medicines must be approved for the full-scale treatment of the disease resistance of the plasmodium parasite to chloroquine which used to be a potent medicine for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the twentieth century resulted from the indiscriminate over the counter use a repetition of same could pose a challenge to covid-19 treatment and even complicate cases if the efficacies of these medicines are lost through their misuse given the fact that drug development is a long laborious and expensive process already existing therapies like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine must be preservedthe way forward in assuaging the situation is to intensify public campaign against the routine or over the counter use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the prevention of covid-19 all community pharmacists must adhere strictly to this recommendation and seize the opportunity to educate patients on methods of preventing the spread of the disease such as regular hand washing with soap under tap water the use of alcohol-based sanitizers with alcohol concentration not less than 60 vv eating balanced diet resting well and reducing stress 23 rather than self-medicating with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the bid to prevent the diseasedoctors must also ensure that only patients diagnosed with covid-19 are given prescriptions for these medicines this will require that laboratory tools are made available in all health institution to facilitate diagnosis as continual empirical treatment could lead to resistance of virus to the medicineslastly regulation of these medicines must be strengthened and enforced in sub-saharan africa for instance drug regulation has been very challenging over the years unapproved border trade of pharmaceuticals and drug counterfeiting resulting from high demand must be vigorously checked through the collaborative efforts of drug regulatory and security agencies this could save patients from taking sub-standard medicines and consuming medicines they do not really needin conclusion as covid-19 continues to spread and efforts are being made to flatten the infection curve the general population must be monitored and educated on indiscriminate medication use in an attempt to prevent the virus from infecting human hosts they must be made aware that current medicines are served on prescription basis at hospitals and covid-19 isolation and treatment centers and are not for covid-19 prevention rather they must be educated on approved methods of preventing the spread of the virus recommended by the who in spite of the global panic to quickly resolve the covid-19 pandemic scientists must be vigilant and ensure rational medicine use while repurposing old remedieson july 6 2013 asiana airlines flight 214 from seoul south korea destined for san francisco with 307 people on-board crashed injuring 182 people and killing 2 the incident dominated the us news newscasters and media journalists analyzed every minute of the crash and the events leading up it for at least 2 days it appeared as if nothing else occurred in the world in reality a great deal was occurring from a bloody civil war in syria to major economic crises in europe to gang murders in chicago other news simply ceased to exist while the attention of the us media became fixated on the crash of asiana flight 214 with the media paying a great deal of attention on issues of human errorthis chapter does not enter into the engineering details of plane crashes however it does examine the publics perception of what it perceives to be a danger in the skies and how these perceptions are translated into the world of tourism surety surety is the key word here for numerous reasons the western world is as dependent on air traffic for travel and commerce as the ancient world was dependent on water transportation in other decades control of the seas and rivers meant not only control of economies but it also transformed into military prowess in todays world sea travel is still necessary for commerce and often for military success but ever since the berlin airlift of 1948 the public has understood the importance of aviation as a military and political tool by the 1960s businesses became international and began working across borders and in many different countries this internationalization meant that many businesspeople became dependent on efficient and safe air travel in order to conduct business around the world the aviation industry also promoted air travel as a luxurious experience and thus people could now fly with ease and comfort to their vacation spots or combine air and car travel in what was called a fly-drive vacation in all of these areas the public assumed that despite the fact that a person was thousands of miles above the earth air travel was safe and efficient air safety became of paramount importance especially as the world of aviation entered into the age of the jumbo jetsif we distinguish security from safety in the earlier decades security was a different issue in aviation the hijackings of multiple planes to cuba in the 1960s were often taken at first in a somewhat light-hearted manner in most cases airplanes were hijacked for a short while and the passengers and plane were soon returned in october 2012 patrick weidinger a specialist in aviation security and hijackings called the period between 1958 and 1970 the golden age of hijackings in 1969 there were 82 planes hijacked from the united states to cuba during this period it was not clear what was to be done with hijackers or how to prevent hijacking although these hijackings were relatively benign they alerted the public to the fact that not only did air travelers have to worry about the flights safety but also about the flights security to add to this confusion no one was quite sure if these were political acts criminal acts copycat actions or pranks not only did hijackings destroy peoples travel schedules but also no one knew where the rash of hijackings would lead this so-called golden age came to its conclusion in 1973 when 1 cuba and the united states agreed that hijackers would be returned to the united states for criminal prosecution and 2 the united states introduced the metal detector
table 71
indicates that the us hijackings may have begun with political motives but soon became vehicles for robbery and extortion the preferred weapon of choice was a gun but the claim that a bomb was on-board became an important new weapon what began as an inconvenience soon turned into a very different and more deadly experience by the 1980s hijacking or skyjacking as it came to be known was no longer a mere inconvenience but had become a deadly political weapon a few incidents show the extent of how deadly hijacking had becomeon june 27 1976 palestinian and german terrorists hijacked an air france plane flying from tel aviv to paris via athens with 250 passengers on-board they diverted the plane to entebbe uganda where it came under the protection of the ugandan president idi amin he supported the hijackers with both extra troops and arms the hijackers separated passengers who were either jewish or israeli and on july 1 1976 released the non-jewish passengers who were then flown to paris the crew was given the choice of leaving but chose to stay with the plane and remaining passengers all of whom were then transferred to an airport terminal building on july 4 1976 israeli commandos attacked the entebbe airport and rescued most of the passengers the death toll included 3 passengers 20 ugandan soldiers all 7 hijackers and 1 israeli soldier the israeli commandos also destroyed 11 russian mig fighters the remaining 97 passengers were flown to tel avivmembers of hezbollah and islamic jihad hijacked twa flight 847 enroute from rome to athens and took the plane to amman jordan after murdering a us naval diver the plane was taken on an odyssey to other arab capitals including algiers and beirut many of the passengers were not released until the end of june the capture of the twa flight proved that as a political and propaganda tool hijacking was a very powerful instrument it attracted a great deal of media and was a successful instrument in convincing the israeli government to release some 700 prisoners it would also lessen airline passengers sense of security not only might they be inconvenienced but also they might be held captive for weeks and in a style reminiscent of the nazi era people might be killed due to their nationality or religious affiliationfive pakistani hijackers took control of indian airlines flight ic-814 traveling to delhi from kathmandu with 180 passengers on-board the terrorists killed a number of passengers and took the plane first to pakistan and then to dubai where 27 hostages and the body of rupen katyal were released the plane then left for kandahar afghanistan the other passengers were released in india freeing three terrorists once again it became clear that hijacking was a successful terrorism toolthe hijackings that occurred on september 11 2001 may be the worlds most famous cases of plane hijacking these multiple acts at the same time changed the course of aviation security and demonstrated clearly to the world that a civilian aircraft could be used as a weapon of mass destruction prior to the attacks on september 11 most hijackings were of a limited scope and although there were actions such as the entebbe raids most people did not necessarily integrate these acts of terror into their private lives the 911 attacks not only demonstrated how vulnerable a major world power was to a well-coordinated hijacking used for military purposes against civilian targets but created a major economic shock wave that impacted a great deal of the united states and world economies the attacks demonstrated that tourism was now at the forefront of nonconventional warfare that civilian homefront populations were highly vulnerable to attack and that in a world of interconnected economies such an attack could damage national economies around the world the attacks not only resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent victims but also further demonstrated how much both us and international businesses had become dependent on the air transportation system over the last few decadesthere are certain goals that most hijackers have in mind when planning a hijacking which include
media attention most hijackers do not seek financial gain but rather seek publicity or political success for a particular cause the old adage that all publicity is good publicity is true for hijackings the hijacking of a plane receives wide media coverage this coverage means that the groups cause and name now become public from the hijackers perspective the longer the incident lasts the more publicity their cause receivesthe airline industry is a major part of not only the transportation industry but also the tourism industry in fact anything that hurts the tourism industry also hurts a state or nations overall economy when terrorists hijack a plane they not only receive media coverage but they also cause both immediate and long-term economic loss a terrorist hijacking may also result in loss of life even failed attacks produce a great amount of inconvenience for the traveling public the case of richard reid the infamous shoe bomber serves as a perfect example on december 22 2001 reid attempted to bomb american airlines flight 63 from paris to miami the public was still reeling from the 911 attacks that had occurred earlier that year and reid was apprehended by a flight attendant and other passengers although reid was arrested he succeeded in further damaging the airline industry by causing a new policy to be implemented passengers in nations such as the united states were now required to remove their shoes for inspection before boarding a flight this measure was meant to be an additional protection measure but many airline passengers questioned if shoe removal was nothing more than a bureaucratic overreaction it is not clear if shoe removal made air travel safer
some scholars have attempted to measure airline security on a costbenefit basis in an essay titled assessing the risks costs and benefits of united states aviation security measures by stewart and mueller the authors note that although the hardening of cockpit doors has proved to be cost-effective the use of air marshals has not their analysis reduces hijacking to a statistical number such a number may have great value from an actuarial perspective but tourism is not only about numbers it is a business with a long after-life and often lives as much on perceptions as it does on facts thus the traveling public especially the leisure traveling public often panics and this sense of panic may if enough media attention is given to the incident last for many years mueller  stewart 2008hijacking then takes on at least three different aspects first on a national level it may become part of the political or economic narrative within that country many nations have developed both preventative and legal policies to deal with internal hijackings second on the international level hijackings can become a more complicated issue for example the hijacker may take the plane to a country that has no diplomatic relations with the nation of origin or is at a state of war with the latter nation the united nations has enacted a number of conventions and protocols to deal with hijacking and considers it an unlawful act these acts however do not mean that any particular nation may choose to respect the protocols of an enemy nation or protect its citizens thus there is the potential for innocent civilians to be held as hostages or pawns third the hijacking may do great harm to a nations tourism industry to its reputation and to its overall economic well-beingfor all of the above reasons tourism industries airlines and national governments have joined forces to prevent airline hijackings although at first most people did not realize the seriousness of hijackings there are a few exceptions to this statement such as the israeli airline el al in fact el al has built a reputation on being a secure airline and has often been able to charge higher fares due to the fact that the airline is perceived to be safe after 911 most people understood that hijacking was an act of asymmetrical warfare once that perception entered into the public governmental and business consciousness new rules were developed and it soon became clear that simply asking for a persons drivers license and if the passenger packed his or her own bags was not enoughcurrent counter-hijacking measures are based around a series of concentric circles these includeencouraging passengers to become aware of their surroundings and fellow passengershardening the airports defenses and creating sanitized zonesgreater examination of luggagemaking the plane itself more secure
each one of these steps has a series of substeps often visitors turn to popular web sources for information concerning what to do the following is an example of one of these popular web-based sources and the information that it gives to its readers in the e-line news service wikihow six steps are given for passengers to protect themselves against a terrorist attack these include1before boarding the plane be alert to what is going on around you there should be no unattended luggage passengers want to be sure that they have full control of their own luggage and that no piece of luggage is ever left unattended in a like manner the now famous phrase see something say something is an important part of personal security if you feel something is wrong then listen to your gut2being aware of what other terrorists have done in the past such as the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber the authors point out that alert passengers are safe passengers3choose proper clothing airplanes are not meant to be fashion shows they are meant as forms of transportation wearing light comfortable and nonflammable clothing is an important part of a personal evacuation should that ever be needed women should not wear heels and people should use vision aids that are least likely to fail during an emergency4listen to and read about the planes safety steps too many people simply do not listen to the flight attendants briefings and then review visually the passengers who are in close proximity ask yourself in case of an emergency who is the strongest person in close proximity where are children located and how close am i to an emergency exit5have a plan in mind should there be an attack the old pattern of simply doing nothing and thereby appeasing the attacker may no longer be the best plan however you do not want to stand out in a crowd or raise the attackers suspicion or anxiety level decide if you want to attack first or be submissive and establish a rapport with your abductors6should you decide to fight be prepared that the person may have a knife do not try to take the attacker on alone but rather think how you can get other passengers to aid in the attack your highest chance of success will come if you can catch the hijackers off guard httpwwwwikihowcomend-a-plane-hijacking
experts in security use the word hardening to mean making a target less vulnerable or making it less susceptible to an attack it should always be remembered that there is no such thing as 100 security all life reputations and locations are always vulnerable and there is nothing made by human beings that cannot be destroyed nevertheless experts can lessen a locales vulnerability and this lessening is called hardeningin the united states airport and security professionals after the 911 attacks realized that they could not merely depend on passengers but that airport terminals would have to become harder to target to make the airports less likely targets numerous measures have been taken around the world many airports were built however in a different era and the airports architecture does not lend itself easily to airport security checkpoints and metal detectors often airports need to be redesigned so as to accommodate a world that demands greater security airports have developed numerous ways to increase security these include1vehicles are not permitted in close proximity of the terminal2vehicles are examined before being allowed to enter the terminals premises the preparking scan however is not easy to accomplish as passengers normally carry baggage with them and the opening of car trunks or the random scanning of vehicles hardens the target but does not ensure security newer airports are taking into account the principles of cpted crime prevention through environmental design and the cpted offshoot tpted terrorism protection through environmental design for example many airports have found ways to remove blind spots from their security observers so that security personnel have a clear line of sight not only from the naked eye but also via observational points and cameras3the use of body scanners and metal detectors perhaps the most common way to protect a large part of the airport and its airplanes is through the use of mechanical devices such as body scanners and metal detectors certainly these machines have proved themselves effective in having found numerous weapons and other prohibited objects nevertheless it should be noted that they are only as effective as the people watching the machine although a great many weapons have been caught there are still too many that get past these machines furthermore often airport security machine personnel demonstrate lack of motivation or overmotivation a poor understanding of the travel experience and signs of both physical and mental fatigue4airport peripheral areas security personnel have questioned some of the security measures that governments have instituted although the areas beyond the security checkpoints are relatively safe the precheckpoint areas are another matter the same can be said for many airports where people must go to pick up luggage not only are many of these areas minimally guarded but because so many security personnel have been moved into other areas of the airport there is often no one guarding luggage as it comes off the conveyor belt this lack of human supervision produces not only luggage that is taken by mistake but means that luggage is open to being stolen or having a foreign object placed within it5other areas of concern some of the other areas of concern are airport parking lots and garages many of which are connected to the terminal and intertransportation that connects to other forms of transportation such as rails and bus service with the heart of the airport
another method of making an airplane and the same also applies to cruises more secure is through the examination of cargo in the world of air travel cargo tends to fall into three categories1shipped cargo eg packages and mail2personal cargo eg checked luggage3on-board cargo eg carry-on luggage handbags medical equipment
each of these forms of cargo requires special treatment from the tourism security perspective the security professional must be able to enforce rules while acting in a civil and professional manner because tourism is such a media-covered industry any mishandling of a passenger will almost immediately become a news item on the other hand the public demands full protection and does not tolerate security mistakesin the united states as in most nations civil aviation authorities and law enforcement agencies such as the police have been given the authority to inspect all baggage and also the travelers person this means that if security believes that a passengers luggage or person may be a threat to the aircraft other passengers or the airport the security professional has a right to investigate as he or she believes is necessary or to deny boarding for that passenger most countries also have the following policies1if the passenger refuses to cooperate then that passenger is subject to the laws of the nation from which the aircraft is to depart carriers have the right to deny a passenger boarding rights should he or she not cooperate with security personnel2each nation has lists of who may perform baggage and personal examinations the aircrafts captain always has the right to conduct further investigations even after the passenger has boarded the aircraft
there is little doubt that the transportation security administration tsa still has problems with its current systems in december 2008 it was announced that full-body scanners would be used at us airports the full-body scanners were not only disliked by the public but took a great deal of time to pass through and despite the governments assurances to the contrary many people questioned their impact on personal health due to the fear of radiation furthermore there were questions as to the protection of personal privacythe scanners were disliked enough that on may 31 2013 fox news reported thatthe full-body scanners that caused an uproar for taking semi-scandalous snapshots of fliers at security checkpoints have been removed from americas airports the move comes after a congressional mandate and several complaints lodged by privacy-rights activists who likened the scanners to a virtual strip search instead airports will now use scanners that only show generic images of bodies according to a letter released thursday from tsa officials to members of the house homeland security committee as of may 16 2013 all ait units deployed by tsa are equipped with the body-masking capability additionally tsas procurement of next generation ait requires the same body-obscuring capability tsa administrator john pistole wrote in the letter according to the hilltsa gets rid of full-body scanners at us airports 2013 para 14
furthermore many other types of scanning machines often find false-positives such as peanut butter jars baseballs or sports equipment some experts believe that the rate of false-positives falls between 18 and 35 of all baggage examined other experts note that screeners became less careful as the number of false-positives increases freelance writer beth pinsker quotes isaac yeffet formerly of el al airlines considered to be the worlds safest airline as stating lets say im a screener and i open the luggage to do a search and find chocolate or peanut butterim happy because i found what the machine flagged pinsker 2003 para 10 yeffet goes on to state i can assure you from my experience and knowledgethat most of the explosives will be in a false bottom para 10 yeffet notes that el al trains its personnel not to be machine operators but rather to be security professionals who can think on their own pinsker goes on to ask the question what constitutes success the answer of course is a machine that identifies every bomb while keeping false positives to a tolerable level thats a formula sure to please passengers para 23in the united states the tsa publishes a regularly updated list of what is allowed and not allowed on planes for passengers confused as to what may or may not be allowed the tsa provides an online web service that allows passengers to ask questions some of the items that have long been on the tsas not-allowed list includesharp objectssporting goods that may cause harmguns and firearmstools that can become weaponsmartial arts and self-defense items that may become weaponsexplosive and flammable materials disabling chemicals and other dangerous itemsother items as determined by tsa agents
perhaps the best way to handle the what to bring question is to realize that flying is a privilege and not a right and that when we are on an airplane we are dealing not only with our own personal safety but also that of our fellow passengers and that of the crewthere have been various methods to ensure the hardening of the aircraft itself especially once it is in the sky although no one will provide nor should it be provided a full list of on-board security policies some have become well known among these are1the use of air marshals on selective flights2the locking of the cockpit door3additional training for all flight attendants being aware of what is happening on the plane may be a major deterrent4because most cargo is not passenger cargo it is estimated that the number is well below 50 it is important that cargo also be inspected to ensure the planes security air cargo is subject to random searches and x-raying other suggestions some of which have been implemented include the reinforcing of cargo holds and passenger plane airframes a number of transportation companies have developed blast-proof baggage containers and it is rumored that el al now has multiple devices on board to deflect an incoming missile
it is almost impossible to write about airline safety and ignore the el al model there are those people who approve and there are those who disapprove of some of el als practices but most people have come to see this model as the standard for the industry although there is a great deal we do not know about el al security there is also a great deal that has been made public included in these known facts are1airport security personnel are well-educated professionals who speak at least two languages2airport and national security agencies work together and share intelligence3israeli security agents are tested throughout the world and throughout the year if a security person fails an infield test he or she immediately loses his or her job4when it comes to the security of its planes and passengers el al ignores issues of political correctness in el al world profiling is not a bad word and is done along psychological lines5psychological profiling is also accomplished by interviewing all passengers prior to boarding the plane el al does not have technicians instead it has security specialists who are trained to read signals given off from every part of the body6el al was the first to not only lock cockpit doors but also to reinforce them7el al planes use a system called flight guard this system developed in israel protects planes from incoming missiles andor flares sent off to confuse the airplanes protection system8el al uses air marshals and well-trained flight personnel who work in concert to make sure that every el al flight is safe
because many parts of an airport are one-way streets entrances without exits fire safety and design are especially important especially in a period of time in which the majority of emphasis is on counter-terrorism it should be remembered that a terrorist has a great many tools in his or her arsenal and the use of fire as a weapon to destroy both property and lives should not be discounted for example security specialists tend to see airport check-in security and immigration customs lines as challenges these lines may produce bottlenecks where orderly lines quickly melt into chaos airports must have a fire evacuation strategy that permits the exiting of potentially large numbers of people in areas that are not designed for two-way pedestrian passages what is true of the public areas of an airport is also true of the airports off-limit zones cargo areas are prime locales for a fire and this fire may then quickly spread to any number of locales should the fire in any way mix with fuel services then a tragedy can easily turn into a catastrophe airport security specialists then need to identify all areas where a fire may break out and have a plan in place to contain the fire and evacuate large numbers of people in a minimum amount of time because airports welcome people from around the world airport signage must be such that a person can understand it even if the person does not read the local languagethere are numerous methods that have been tried around the world the author does not endorse any of the ideas found below they are merely creative ideas it is necessary however to make sure terrorists understand that we are constantly changing our security models and that we are not merely reacting to what was but working hard to ensure that it will not be here are a few suggestions1require all flight personnel and especially pilots to have a background check and use the top psychological models to make sure that pilots are not suicidal2consider allowing police officers to fly at a deep discount if they carry a weapon and handcuffs3determine what passengers really can and cannot carry the belief that a plastic baggie worth less than a penny can protect a plane from exploding toothpaste is simply silly4take protective measures at both check-in counters and bag claim5have an air marshal on every flight and have this person in a different seat each time6provide pilots and other air crew with pepper spray or other similar substances7use some form of iris screening to identify passengers8develop new techniques so that if the pilot is incapable of landing the plane others can land it with or without knowledge of special equipment9run a counter-terrorism video on the airplane prior to take-off telling people that in case of a terrorist attack not to panic and that the pilot may take certain precautions10make sure that the cockpit is totally isolated from the rest of the plane use double doors or nonbreakable doors11require all crewmembers to be trained in counter-terrorism techniques
although terrorism often grabs the headlines perhaps an even more important issue is that of health health issues in the air take on three separate dimensions1passenger health the ability not to get sick while flying2cross-continental and transnational health issues this topic includes the transporting of illnesses from one place to another and the exposing of populations to risks that normally do not exist in the host society3use of illness as a weapon of mass destruction in this case a person who is intentionally ill is sent to another airport or nation for the expressed purpose of carrying an illness from one location to another
there are a number of health risks that can impact any airline passenger especially when the passenger is on a long trip 4 hours or more and seated with minimal legroom deep vein thrombosis for example may be one of the travelers greatest risks most airline websites offer some guidance on how to avoid this problem through the use of exercises in place the encouragement of taking a walk every few hours and care in drinking a minimum of alcohol for example the united airlines website offers the following suggestionswear comfortable clothing and shoesget a good nights sleep before your trip and rest as much as possible during the flightwhile away get as many hours of sleep every day as you normally would at home taking short naps of 3040 minutes will refresh you as you adjust to the new time zonedrink plenty of water andor juice before and during the flight to stay hydratedeat light meals during your flight also avoid caffeinated beverages and alcoholdont remain in one position too long perform the simple stretches as seen below and walk when possibletips for healthy travel 2013
flying entails other risks for example an article written by various doctors found on the federal aviation administration website notes that1aircraft are pressurized to be somewhere from 6000 to 8000 feet above sea level this higher altitude especially for people from sea-level communities means that there is less oxygen and that gases in body cavities expand more rapidly the doctors also note that furthermore an increase in cabin altitude will cause gases in our body cavities abdomen middle ear behind the ear drum sinuses to expand as much as 25 this can cause problems in the abdomen bloating or stomach cramps ears a crackling sensation or ear block and respiratory tractsinuses2issues of jet lag especially when one is crossing several or more time zones3infectious diseases just as in any other confined space there is a chance that an infectious disease may pass from one person to anotherbagshaw et al 2002
because air travel is the most common form of travel there are bound to be in-flight emergencies ranging from the birth of a child to a heart attack the centers for disease control and prevention published a book on health for travelers chapter 6 of this book statesworldwide more than one billion people travel by commercial aircraft every year and this number is expected to double in the next 20 years increasingly large aircraft combined with an aging flying population makes the incidence of onboard medical emergencies likely to increase approximately 1 in 10000 to 40000 passengers has a medical incident during air transport of these approximately 1 in 150000 requires use of in-flight medical equipment or drugs the most commonly encountered in-flight medical events in order of frequency are the following1vasovagal syncope2gastrointestinal events3respiratory events4cardiac events5neurologic eventsdeaths aboard commercial aircraft have been estimated at 03 per 1 million passengers approximately two-thirds of these are caused by cardiac problemsmarienau illig kozarsky  gallagher 2013
in addition to standard first-aid kits depending on the size of the aircraft and applicable regulations enhanced emergency medical kits may include but are not limited toautomatic external defibrillatorsintubation equipment pediatric and adultcpr masks pediatric and adultintravenous access equipment and solutionsintravenous dextroseantihistamines oral and injectablefirst-line cardiac resuscitation drugs atropine epinephrine lidocainenitroglycerinbronchodilatorsanalgesics
in 2011 the movie contagion was released as a major motion picture the movie is part of an ongoing genre of movies dealing with pandemics scientists and pandemic experts noted the accuracy of contagion the movie deals with a fast-moving pandemic as in real life the medical community must not only scramble to find a cure but it is unclear who may be transmitting the disease and what the role of air transportation may be in the spreading of the pandemic the movie underlines the fact that it is not only the disease that is creating social havoc on a macro level but also the human proclivity to panic in the face of a silent killer the panic causes the unraveling of much of society and this unraveling becomes a crisis in and of itselfalthough the movie is pure fiction it serves to remind the tourism security professional that travelers especially international travelers may transmit diseases from one part of the world to another either knowingly or unknowingly this potential hazard is especially true if the host country has wiped out the disease and its population is not immune to it because airlines are not only an enclosed space but also carry people from multiple nationalities the potential to transmit disease is extremely high furthermore most airlines use a hub-and-wheel method for flights and this means that people from various parts of the world may be feed into one hub thus the passengers on a plane may have originated in various locations the potential for illness may begin in the host locale pass onto one or more terminals be carried on an airplane and finally infect people in the receiving locale in june 2012 cnn provided a list of the 10 top airports for spreading diseases in the united states table 72
to add to the problem is the case of a media scare concerning a new pandemic at least during the initial period it may not be clear where transmission is found or what the incubation period may be some of the airborne illnesses that have worried both medical personnel and travelers alike aretuberculosissevere acute respiratory syndrome sarscommon coldsinfluenzasmeningococcal diseasesmalariadenguemeaslesfood-borne illnesses
a good example of a false panic is sars the so-called sars pandemic became a media event and did a great deal of damage to both hong kong and toronto canada in the case of toronto there were many more traffic fatalities than there were deaths caused by sars and no one outside of a hospital environment was stricken with the illness another example is the 2006 outbreaks of avian bird flu h5n1 in various nations around the world these outbreaks caught the tourism industrys attention despite the great amount of publicity given to avian flu it is important to note that as of this writing there have been less than 700 people so far who have contracted the diseasethe sars panic caused far fewer deaths than did traffic accidents in the impacted places but the panic that sars caused created economic havoc although the media was a major component in scaring the public reality proved to be different than what was stated on television the tourism security officer then needs to be aware of not only the facts but also the perception of the facts as presented in the media as a tourism security specialist you need to know that
tourism is highly vulnerable to a panic situation the days after 911 ought to have retaught the tourism industry that for most people travel is a leisure purchase based on want rather than need if travelers become afraid they may simply cancel their trips in such cases there may be massive layoffs of tourism workers
you must be prepared to take care of sick employees and their families the people staffing the tourism industry are also human that means that their families and they are also susceptible to illnesses should large numbers of staff or their families become sick hotels and restaurants may have to close simply due to manpower shortages tourism industry people need to develop plans on how they will maintain their industry while suffering from manpower shortages
security personnel must be prepared to take care of visitors who fall ill and may not know how to contact local medical authorities or even speak the language of the local doctors another problem to be considered is how the tourism industry will aid people who fall sick while on vacation medical notices will need to be distributed in multiple languages people will need ways to communicate to loved ones and to describe symptoms to medical personnel in their own language
security personnel must be prepared to fight against a pandemic not only from the medical perspective but also from the marketinginformation perspective because the public may well panic it is important that the tourism industry be prepared to offer concrete and credible information this information should be given to the public almost immediately every tourism office should have an information plan ready should a pandemic occur in its area develop creative websites so that people can gain information any time of the day and without regard to where they may be located
security personnel must be prepared to counter negative publicity with an action program for example in areas that have been impacted by a disease make sure to advise travelers to stay current with their vaccinations and create medical information sheets it is essential that the public know where to go for information as well as what is true versus what is false for travelers who may not be up-to-date with current shots offer lists of doctors and clinics willing to accept travelers insurance
an up-to-date first-aid kit and proper preventative procedures at hotels and other places of lodging for example make sure that employees use antibacterial hand wipes and encourage hotels to provide these for travelers
security personnel must be prepared to work with travel insurance companies in case of a pandemic travelers may not receive value for money and may desire to either cancel a trip or cut it short the best way to maintain good will is by working with such organizations as the united states travel industry association in canada it is called travel and health industry association of canada develop travel health programs with these organizations so that visitors feel financially protected
be prepared to work with the media a pandemic is like any other tourism crisis and should be treated as such prepare for it before it strikes if it should occur set your action plan in place and make sure that you work with the media finally have a recovery plan set so that once the crisis has abated you can begin a financial recovery program
the bottom line is that air travel may not produce illnesses but the transfer of large numbers of people from one place to the next may be a source of worry not only for medical authorities but also for tourism security professionalsif an unintentional disease or pandemic can send the tourism industry into a panic then an intentionally planned attack could have catastrophic results tourism security specialists realize that their industry could be used as part of some form of biological warfaretourism is based on the premise that we live in an interconnected world for the most part this interconnectivity has brought a great deal of benefits to millions of people nevertheless there is nothing gained in this world without a price one of the prices we all pay for bringing the world together is that we are not only open to new cultural experiences but also new biological threats as newsweek noted in its april 29 2009 issue in reference to the swine influenzathe central driver is the increasingly interconnected world we live in even the most remote areas of the planet can now be reached in less than 48 hours diseases now plaguing those in refugee camps heavily populated and growing slums or the most remote tropical rainforests can without warning show up in far-flung towns and cities a devastating hemorrhagic-disease epidemic in africa or south america could rapidly become the hemorrhagic epidemic of boston or bordeaux even good clinicians rarely have the knowledge to diagnose and treat exotic tropical diseases until a month ago our attention was focused on asiathe source of the last two influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968as the likely source for the next one and yet it appeared in mexico while we werent lookingopinion swine flu is a wake up call 2009 para 3
the tourism industry is particularly vulnerable to biological warfare especially in the form of contagious illnesses such as smallpox because tourism is a peacetime and often leisure industry it can become the perfect undercover delivery system here are just a few reasons for this1traveling today especially in a world with limited visa restrictions is relatively easy2airports are hubs with thousands of people going to any number of places these are easy centers in which to expose people to contagious diseases and they will then act as carriers to any number of other places3often travelers make more than one stop these additional stops mean a greater potential for infection it can also become exceedingly difficult to develop the common thread that unites all of the infected victims4tourism receives a great deal of publicity once the epidemic pandemicdisease is identified by the media there is a high probability of some form of panic5tourism is a major economic generator in and of itself and numerous other industries are also dependent on the travel industry if the public fears travel the economy will be severely injured if not destroyed
what makes many of these potential diseases scary is that they are easy to producemake and the delivery system may be almost impossible to detect furthermore were terrorists to use a powder of anthrax or get someone ill with smallpox organisms these diseases would be almost impossible to detect until it was too late to make matters still worse the physicians attending the sick might lose valuable time until they were able to determine the cause of the illness additionally health workers might panic leaving the sick unattended and the public in a state of alarmfinally tourism security specialists and professionals will need to be concerned about not only the movement of people but also the threat to food and the movement of contaminated food from one location to another these are special threats to people who may eat contaminated food then board an airplane and not realize that they are sick until they are at the next locale or in the air for example the world health organization notes thatduring 1996 tourists who travelled to yellow fever endemic areas without having had yellow fever vaccination imported fatal yellow fever infections into the united states and switzerland during the same year approximately 10000 reported cases of malaria were imported into the european community with one fourth of them reported from the united kingdom when cholera re-entered peru in 1991 after a long absence it found an opportunity to spread through the existing sanitation and water systems causing over 3000 deaths seafood exports were embargoed from peru and tourism decreased costing an estimated loss of at least us770 million to the peruvian economy in one yearglobal infectious disease surveillance 2013 para 2
the world is an interconnected planet the good news is that tourism allows people to get to know each other and understand each other from around the world the bad news is that often we bring other baggage when we travel than merely our suitcasesalthough air travel especially in tourism is the most preferred form of public transportation other forms of transportation have long played a part in tourism in an earlier chapter we discussed the cruise industry and its impact on tourism in this chapter we turn to two other forms of land tourism travel travel by train and travel by bus and motor coachperhaps no form of travel has captured the publics imagination as much as the train called the orient express portrayed in film and in literature this train has come to be the epicenter of both intrigue and romance within nineteenth-century europe the actual train began service from paris to constantinople now istanbul in october 1883 the media dubbed the train the orient express and the name stuck the luxury train became a favorite of european royalty and was also known as the spies express a number of movies portrayed the train as a center of spies and even murder and this portrayal added to the trains acquired glamor zax 2007 the orient express was not the only train to be considered romantic in the nineteenth- and twentieth-century world of train travel us trains have also become part of what we might call the romance of the old westtrain travel began in the united states in the early part of the nineteenth century with the expansion toward the western states train travel had the advantage of comfort and speed over horse travel especially over long distances trains in the united states had three main purposes transportation of goods transportation of people and in the latter part of the century more luxurious trains provided tourism experiences to parts of the united states that were relatively unknown to a large part of the nations eastern population train travel however was not without problems not only was there the problem of derailments and other mechanical breakdowns but there were also issues of attacks by hostile natives and by robbers many of these security issues became part of the us movie industry and added to a sense of adventure in 2010 national geographic published its list of the top 10 train trips in north america the list includedpeak experience colorados durango and silverton narrow gauge railroadrevolutionary railway new york to vermont ethan allen express

in the latter part of the twentieth century train travel which had fallen into a downward spiral began to take on new life in tourism the reasons for this renaissance were economic and involved issues of security these includedtrains were considered to be more ecologically friendly they can carry more people for less use of energytrains were considered by some to be safer there was less publicity given to a train disaster than to an air disasterthe introduction of the bullet train in japan and europe made train travel a lot faster than it had been in the pastthe europass gave thousands of young north americans a train travel experience that they had not had at homesenior citizens and young people had the extra time to travel by train and see the countryside as they traveled

one of the most recent tragic incidents involving train travel occurred in spain in july 2013 the crash is important not only in that it was one of spains worst disasters since 1944 but also because it symbolizes that all forms of transportation carry risk the accident took place near santiago de compostela a major tourism center especially for religious tourism although it will take some time to know all of the facts as of this writing we know that at least 79 people died when the train derailed the trains conductor has pled guilty to having spoken on a cell phone while taking a major curve at a speed well above what the law permitted it is clear from the evidence given that human error caused the crash the victims came from numerous nations around the world and to quote one news source the crash has cast a pall over the town a catholic pilgrimage site santiago officials had been preparing for the religious feast of st james of compostela spains patron saint the day after the crash but canceled it and turned a local sporting arena into a morgue driver in spain train crash 2013 para 23tragedy has struck the spanish rail system in other ways for example on march 11 2004 bombs went off almost simultaneously in various commuter trains entering the city of madrid these explosions killed 191 people and wounded over 1800 other innocent victims the bombings may have not only murdered and injured a great many people but may have caused the prime minister at the time to lose the election spains new government then pulled out of its involvement in the iraq warfrom both the train accidents and terrorism attacks a number of facts begin to emergealthough train travel is considered less dangerous than air travel the reality is that in both forms of transportation there is always riskalthough most governments place their resources into airline protection the possibility of a terrorism attack against a train especially against a commuter train is ever presentcurrently trains are a weak link in the world of tourism securitynations would be wise to consider the consequences of attacks against not only people but also against cargo often trains carry dangerous chemicals or other substances through populated areas
train transportation then is an area about which not only tourism security officials need to concern themselves but general security officials alsoon february 25 2012 some 22 passengers were robbed and assaulted on a mexican tour bus traveling near the tourist city of puerto vallarta luckily there was no loss of life although there was loss of property the attackers intercepted the bus as it passed through the town of el nogalito the incident followed on the heels of another incident in mexico where an american mother and her daughters were among seven passengers who lost their lives in pachuca state of veracruz it should be emphasized that these were not motor coaches per se but tour buses nevertheless this incident teaches us several important security pointsthe robbers had inside information as to where the buses would bethere was no special dispensation given to visitorsin the case of the puerto vallarta incident the robbers specifically targeted people on a tour bus
a more typical situation is what occurred in july 29 2013 in italy some 39 people died when their bus plunged off a ravine in southern italy it should be noted that this was not a tour bus the tragic news however demonstrated that both locals and tourists are forced to use often-substandard roads bridges and other public arteriesthe bus world is highly complex and it is essential for tourism security personnel to be aware of the different forms of bus travel and the different challenges that each one of these subcategories faces

on march 11 2020 covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who the sars-cov-2 infection has swept the globe with 2101164 confirmed cases and 140773 deaths in 184 countries and territories as of april 16 2020 4 according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc two crucial actions can reduce the risk of viral transmission frequent hand washing and surface decontamination while such amplified hygiene measures are of utmost importance for the prevention of person-to-person viral transmission these changes in practice are projected to trigger a rise in adverse cutaneous reactions such as contact dermatitis in the community dermatologists should be familiar with the hygiene practices recommended for covid-19 prevention and prepared to counsel patients on strategies to combat potentially debilitating skin damage that can result from repeated exposure to detergents and disinfectants in this report we review the recommended hygiene procedures for prevention of emerging viral pathogen transmission and discuss the adverse skin reactions associated with these augmented hygiene practices we conclude with strategies which patients can implement during the covid-19 pandemic to minimize skin irritation white still performing hygiene practices effectivelyin response to the sars-cov-2 outbreak the cdc and environmental protection agency epa released updated guidelines for infection prevention the cdc describes proper hand hygiene as frequent hand washing with soap and warm or cool water for 20 s or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60 alcohol 2 for disinfection of environmental surfaces the epa released emerging viral pathogen recommendations for the use of antimicrobial pesticides against sars-cov-2 9 although limited data are available regarding survival of sars-cov-2 on surfaces early reports suggest that viable virus can be detected on certain materials like stainless steel or plastic for up to 48 or 72 h following viral exposure respectively 10 disinfectants meeting the epa criteria for use against sars-cov-2 contain active ingredients such as quaternary ammonium sodium hypochlorite peroxyacetic acid hydrogen peroxide and alcohols many of which are known skin irritants or allergens 11 12as hygiene recommendations evolve during the covid-19 pandemic and community members adopt changing practices dermatologists are likely to see a rise in adverse cutaneous reactions from prolonged irritant exposures and widespread use of antimicrobials adverse consequences of frequent hand hygiene include skin dryness irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis 12 skin dryness is an early sign of damage to the natural skin barrier which can result from recurrent use of lipid-emulsifying detergents that deplete lipids in the stratum corneum lipid-dissolving alcohols in hand sanitizers may also contribute to barrier dysfunction 6 following barrier compromise irritants and allergens can more easily breach the stratum corneum causing inflammation in the deeper layers of the epidermis and contact dermatitis dermatitis symptoms include dryness roughness itching burning erythema edema blistering scaling and fissuring the most common form of contact dermatitis is irritant contact dermatitis from direct exposure to environmental irritants while strong irritants like caustic chemicals may induce acute dermatitis on initial contact milder irritants like hot water detergents or alcohols may require multiple exposures to cause skin damage recently a high incidence of hand hygiene-induced skin damage was reported in first-line covid-19 healthcare workers at the epicenter in china of 434 healthcare workers in hubei province 74 321 performed hand hygiene more than ten times per day and 766 246 of these frequent washers reported hand skin damage with dermatitis symptoms 7 a less common form of contact dermatitis is allergic contact dermatitis which can occur when patients have hypersensitivity reactions to fragrances preservatives or chemical antimicrobials in detergents or disinfectants 12 among the 370 epa-registered disinfectants for sars-cov-2 as of april 16 2020 the most common active ingredient is quaternary ammonium found in 203 of the registered products 9 importantly the quaternary ammonium salt quaternium-15 was found to be the allergen most frequently associated with a positive patch test reaction 165 in a study of 959 patients with allergic contact dermatitis of the hands 11to combat adverse cutaneous reactions from shifting hygiene practices skin moisturization and allergen avoidance are paramount throughout the covid-19 pandemic regular use of oil-containing emollients after hand washing has been associated with reduced skin damage 5 in a double-blind randomized trial of healthcare workers with occupation-associated severe hand irritation scheduled use of oil-containing lotion was superior to barrier cream for improvement of hand skin scaling cracking and pain 8 subjects treated with oil-containing lotion also exhibited a 50 increase in the mean total number of hand washes per day by the fourth week of use suggesting that improved skin condition correlates with increased hand hygiene compliance in addition to preventive skin moisturization precautions should be taken to avoid contact with allergens in surface disinfectants patients should always wear gloves and clean hands upon completion of product usedermatologists can promote protective strategies throughout the covid-19 pandemic by endorsing the following cdc- and epa-based recommendations related to hand hygiene and surface disinfection first proper hand washing procedures entail wetting hands lathering with soap scrubbing for at least 20 s rinsing with clean running warm or cool water and drying hands hot water was not shown to significantly improve hand washing efficacy and patients should avoid washing hands with hot water to minimize skin damage 3 second antibacterial soaps should be avoided because they were not shown to be superior to non-antibacterial cleansers at preventing infectious illness symptoms in community non-healthcare settings 1 avoidance of antibacterial chemicals in soaps may reduce patient risk of irritant or allergic skin reactions third if soap and water are not available alcohol-based hand sanitizer at least 60 alcohol can be rubbed into hands for 20 s patients can reduce their risk of allergic skin reactions by avoiding fragrance-containing sanitizers fourth surfaces should be disinfected with epa-registered products for use against hard-to-kill emerging pathogens the active ingredients have predicted efficacy against sars-cov-2 but are also known skin allergens so patients should avoid direct skin contact with these disinfectants by wearing impermeable gloves during use and cleaning hands on completion finally emollient moisturizers should be applied regularly after hand washing to combat barrier damage induced by irritant or allergen exposure use of skin moisturizers may promote long-term hand hygiene compliance thereby decreasing the risk of pathogen transmission over time by providing anticipatory guidance to patients during the covid-19 pandemic dermatologists can help to limit the adverse cutaneous effects associated with evolving hygiene practices in the community settingadaptation is an evolving long-term process during which a population of life forms adjusts to changes in its habitat and surrounding environments adaptation by the global community as a unit is vital to cope with the effects of increasing populations global warmingclimate change the chemical biological and physical impacts on life-sustaining ecosystems and competition for life sustaining and economically important natural resources the latter include water food energy metal ores industrial minerals and wood within this framework it is necessary to adapt as well to changes in local and regional physical conditions brought on by natural and anthropogenic hazards by health threats of epidemic or pandemic reach by social conditions such as conflicts driven by religious and ethnic fanaticism and by tribalism and clan tiesalthough the rate of global population growth is declining and is expected to fall to the replacement level by mid-twenty-first century it is still increasing by about 7580 million people annually see chap 101007978-3-319-09686-51 a grand part of the growth is taking place in africa asia latin america and the middle east that together already accounts for a 2014 population of 59 billion of the 72 billion people worldwide conversely populations are contracting or stable in most of western and eastern europe and japan together with the united states that has a stable population this latter group today is home to the other 13 billion people thus although there are two population situations to adapt to both have common problems of sustainability to addressthe principal problems with growing populations do not involve space although population density is a problem unto itself for reasons discussed in previous chapters the main problems are how to nourish people with food and water the chronic malnutrition that about 1 billion people suffered from in 2013 is likely to grow in number in some regions due to global warmingclimate change because humans cannot adapt to less food if they are already at subsistence rations for example the 2012 population in sub-saharan africa is 902 million people the population is projected to increase to about 125 billion in 2030 an increase of about 38  within the same time frame the united nations estimates that acreage under maize cultivation in the region will decline by 40  because of heat and drought brought on by climate change the loss of arable land for food production can be countered in sub-saharan africa if marker assisted hybridization of maize or maize genetically modified to withstand heat and drought come onto the seed market together with modified seeds for other food staples and if african nations that do not now accept gmo seeds do so in the future if not nations favored for food production by climate change will have a moral obligation to provide food staples to people in nations with declining food production at accessible costs based on their economies it is clear that what happens in sub-saharan africa and other regions with declining cultivation acreage or that will bear other effects of climate change eg drought shifting rain patterns will affect the rest of the worldwide community politically economically and socially the earths problems that associate with global warming climate change will be further discussed in the last section of this chapterwater is the staff of life it keeps the body hydrated and is necessary to grow food crops hydrate food animals and grow feed grains chemically or biologically polluted water does not serve these ends if ingested contaminated water can result in sickness as discussed in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-52 water stokes industry and manufacturing as well thus keeping economies in many countries contributing to a populations well-being by providing employment goods and services ideally these businesses contribute their fair share to a tax base that supports social needs eg education healthcare maintenance of infrastructure factory owners adapt and plan against water shortages by having a water recycling system in place but may also slow or stop production until operational water conditions return citizens with a reliable water supply can adapt to periods of water shortage by limiting use according to mandates by government officials but still have water for basic daily needs however persons in nations with a chronic per capita water shortage may not have this option to serve their daily needs unless water is imported or new water sources are found see chap 101007978-3-319-09686-52 if imported water is not an option to meet immediate essential needs an alternative adaptation for people and animals is to try to reach a location where water would be available to them with growing populations per capita water availability is greatly diminished table 101007978-3-319-09686-52 water shortages become endemic and people are at risk of existing at subsistence levels or dying most at risk from the lack of a basic water ration are pregnant women infants young children and old people water wars are a future possibility as nations battle for their peoples survival unless political differences are set aside and projects are supported to develop and share water sources in a welcome effort jordan israel and the palestinian authority signed a memorandum of understanding in the world bank december 2013 with specific aims 1 produce millions of cubic meters of drinking water for a water-deficient region 2 pipe 200 million cubic meters of water annually 180 km 110 mi from the red sea to the dead sea 3 build a desalination plant at aqaba that would supply water to aqaba and eilat 4 the israeli water utility would supply 2030 million cubic meters of drinking water to the palestinian authority for the west bank population at a reduced cost and 5 there would be an inflow of water to slow and in the future perhaps abate and reverse the shrinking of the dead sea funding for the estimated 400 million 5-year project will come from the world bank donor nations and philanthropic groupsas the global population increases and more people in developing and less developed nations have more disposable income there will be a growing draw on natural resources other than water and food to service their industrial agricultural and manufacturing needs and wants competition can force economic wars among national and multinational corporations for the resources necessary to provide goods and services and thus drive up prices for resources industries and manufacturing units that cannot compete economically for natural resources will shut down thus contributing to unemployment and downturns in economies because of falling domestic demand to keep order in the increasingly interdependent world economy accommodation for shared natural resources or substitutes for them at affordable prices is the adaptationnecessary this can be mandated by the world trade organization backed by other practical-minded international groupsanother adverse effect of growing populations that is a national resource that can be lost at the expense of some countries to the benefit of others is brain power this brain power has been cultivated at excellent universities in developing countries often times at little or no cost to students eg in medicine science engineering economics the arts who attend and graduate in increasing numbers where there are too many well-educated professionals but lack of employment opportunities for them in their fields of expertise educated people have the option of relocating to another country that can nurture and use the expertise many adapt to the employment problem by taking up this option this may mean moving from a developing country to a developed country or from a less developed country to a developing or developed country ultimately this loss of citizens with special skills can hurt a country to counter this brain drain or reverse it a country can adapt by investing in its future to create programs and conditions that keep talented professionals home or if they have emigrated entice them to return china and india are examples of countries that have successfully taken this tactwhen there are increases in a population because of immigration problems can ensue between immigrants and a general population adaptation to diversity and the multicultural experiences it brings to a community is often not a comfortable change the antipathy of some in a host country is based on slowness of the immigrants to learn the language and inability of host country citizens to understand what immigrants are saying among themselves this makes citizens feel uneasy some view immigrants as a threat to their own or a family members employment or advancement race difference is a factor that some cannot readily adapt to as is ethnicity with its traditions and customs unfamiliar to the general public religion can be divisive if adherents to its beliefs engage in acts of hatred detrimental to the host country fueled by fundamentalists and zealots who interpret religious writings as giving them license to commit crimes or absolving them of the crimes sadly many citizens paint an entire religious community with the taint of the relatively few evildoers adaptation to diversity is essential for our earths citizenry with joint efforts by all to resolve worldwide issues eg global warmingclimate change so as to become the keys to providing a sound future for coming generations there has to be a shared attack on global threats no matter what the language race ethnicity or religious beliefs are no matter social or economic status no matter whether a threat affects less developed developing or developed countriesin areas prone to earthquakes we know that earthquakes do not kill and injure people but that collapsing buildings and infrastructure do earthquakes are not predictable so that there is no adaptation by a timely evacuation to minimize deaths and injury however building structures to make them more earthquake resistant can save lives reduce injuries and protect property thus after a high-magnitude earthquake forensic engineering teams come to assess the damage and determine where and why damage and destruction took place within the context of the magnitude of an earthquake the type of motion it originated shaking jarring rolling its duration the area it affected and the geologic properties of rocks underlying structures foundations hazard assessment teams also evaluate other factors that contributed to additional damage such as ruptured gas lines that feed fires and ruptured water lines that inhibit fire control the engineers establish how construction can be improved in the future in terms of construction techniques and materials to prevent the types of collapses and utility failures they investigated municipalities revise building codes accordingly to direct reconstruction and future building projects where possible structures that withstood an earthquake with minor or no visible damage should be retrofitted to improve their resistance to the next big one with each event we gain more data on how to better construct earthquake-resistant structures and alter building codes to more stringent specifications in theory this adaptationto an irregularly recurring global event is good but in practice it is most applicable to nations with the economic resources for reconstruction according to revised building codes and where there is no corruption to allow a bypass of the code the same can be stated for retrofitting to give more resistance to earthquakes to existing structures many developed nations and nations rich in commodity exports eg oil have a moral obligation to donate funds material and expertise to help citizens in economically disadvantaged nations recover from a destructive earthquake some commodity-rich and economically sound nations do not do so directly whereas others big and small rally to help disaster victims for example immediately after megatyphoon haiyan devastated many regions in the central philippines in 2013 israel sent 250 medical doctors and nurses and field hospitals to help philippine citizens recover from the impacts of the typhoonas discussed in an earlier chapter volcanoes are predictable in terms of becoming active by emitting wisps of smoke bulging on a slope warming of the soil or nearby pond or lake waters emitting increasing concentrations of gases and showing increased low-frequency seismicity however this activity does not always result in an eruption a marked increase in measurements and observations especially the low-frequency seismic activity suggests that an eruption is imminent adaptation to living and working on or near a volcano means investing in equipment to monitor volcanic activity and listening to alerts from scientists monitoring its activity and being ready to evacuate by gathering important papers and precious mementos and prepared to load into transportation for evacuation to safe locations governments adapt by charging geologists to map out areas considered as high- moderate- and low-hazard zones in the volcano environs geologists do this by studying rocks deposited from past eruptions and assessments of the topography municipalities then pass zoning regulations applicable to the hazard levelgovernments have adapted to repeated periodic flooding in areas by creating flood control systems described in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-54 dams hold water during times of heavy andor extended rainfall and release any overflow into channels that move water away from urban or rural population centers levees increase the volume of water that can move through a channel thereby keeping it from spreading into populated areas and cultivated farmland for smaller waterways that flow through cities municipalities may invest in deepening widening and straightening channels as well as erecting walls so that more water can flow through the area more rapidly without coming out of a channel governments define zones on flood plains according to a recurrence interval of damaging floods eg 100 years as being off limits for residential and factoryplant construction as much as we plan to adjust to living in an area prone to flooding there is always the possibility of a megaevent that can overcome in situ control systems therefore as described chap 101007978-3-319-09686-54 governments adapt to this possibility by installing flood prediction equipment in drainage basins to provide warning to those at risk from rising and sometimes raging waters the warning gives people time to gather important documents and personal treasures and evacuate to safe areas the apparent increase in the frequency and magnitude of storms and resulting flooding in recent years is thought by many weather scientists to be related to global warming and the increased amount of moisture in the atmosphere from warmer oceans that gathers in clouds and precipitates during storms this will be discussed further in this chapter
adaptation to extreme weather events such as an extended period of drought heat waves and frigid weather means preparation to wait them out some municipalities adapt to repeated sometimes seasonal times of short-term drought by storing a 36 month water supply in surface or underground reservoirs during periods of normal precipitation that can be tapped conservatively as needed others may plan to move water via pipes or water tankers from where it is plentiful to where drought conditions exist otherwise to survive people move as best they can to where they have access to water in instances of years long drought crops and livestock and other life forms may be lost heat waves can kill adaptation to heat wave conditions means that water has to be available to people to avoid dehydration where possible homes should have air-conditioning or fans to keep people comfortable and municipalities should have cooling centers to which people can go personnel should check on senior citizens and escort them to cooling centers if necessary clearly economically advantaged nations have the resources to give support to citizens during natural hazards such as these these nations international organizations and ngos have a moral obligation to help economically disadvantaged nations as is possible when hazard conditions such as these threaten populationsthe most extreme of weather conditions that can injure and kill people and destroy housing and infrastructure are tropical storms that evolve into violent hurricanes typhoons monsoons by increasing wind speeds and sucking up moisture water as they track across oceans toward land when these storms make landfall they drive storm surges that can wreak havoc onshore communities and as they move inland precipitate heavy rains that cause life-threatening and destructive flooding these violent storms are destructive to coastal populations and island nations and have regional reach inland as they move along paths until they finally spend their energy or move out to sea on november 8 2013 the typhoon named haiyan the strongest recorded typhoon ever to make landfall smashed into the central philippines killing more than 2600 people injuring about 12500 and displacing almost 600000 people there was a 4-m 13 ft storm surge driven by winds measured at over 312 kmh 195 mih with gusts reaching 380 kmh 235 mih the typhoon flattened the city of tacloban that was home to 200000 residents and there was major flooding inland the weather alerts led to a government call for evacuation away from the predicted path of the storm and about 1 million people followed the evacuation warning surely saving many lives access to aid typhoon-ravaged areas was difficult and there were shortages of water food and medical care for many evacuees for several days the philippine central government and local officials were not prepared to deal with a storm of this magnitude but help started arriving from many nations worldwide there was a post-event concern of attending to sanitation needs of survivors to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as cholera typhoid fever hepatitis and dysentery if the philippine government had adapted by adopting better policies with respect to response to high-category typhoons in addition to the call for evacuation the impact of haiyan would have been ameliorated one would hope that this deficiency would be dealt with to limit the effects of future like disastersevacuation to prevent injury and death in coastal zones that could be struck by high winds heavy sustained rains and storm surges is dependent on weather bureau forecasts and warnings from police firefighters or other government-authorized personnel homeowners adapt to hurricanes by securing roofing with additional nails or special fasteners as a retrofit precaution and by boarding up windows on structures before an incoming storm hits governments have adapted to the onslaught of violent high-energy storms by constructing seawalls of varying designs and heights to protect population centers by damping the force of storm surges in china for example a seawall 672 m 22 ft in height and that has been heightened in the past protects shanghai from the full damaging effects of high-category typhoons as a result of rising sea level the shanghai seawall and other that protect coastal cities from being flooded by surges from high-energy tropical storms will have to be heightened to afford a greater degree of protection to people and propertywildfires can be a natural hazard when ignited by a lightening strike however most wildfires are started by human carelessness such as tossing a lit cigarette on a forest floor or failing to completely extinguish a campfire or by arsonists one may adapt to living in an area with a history of wildfires in two ways neither of which is practical or promises 100  protection first would be to clear an area of vegetation in a 30-m 100 ft swath around a dwelling or site for building second would be to build with nonflammable materials so that embers propelled during a wildfire could not ignite a structure adaptation to the advance of a wildfire would be to heed warnings to evacuate carrying a prepared case with important documents and other items of personal value to delay evacuation by going back to retrieve something from then home can be fatal as it was for two people in a recent june 2013 wildfire that destroyed almost 500 homes in colorado springs colorado usawhen there is a hazard event coming that calls for evacuation responsible and often economically advantaged governments have adapted to the threat by designating evacuation routes by providing transportation for people who need it by having evacuation centers stocked with water and food cots and blankets basic medical supplies and medical personnel and by having phone service available for people that need it in the case of a primary or triggered hazard that happens with little or no warning eg an earthquake a tsunami a volcanic mud flow search and rescue teams should be ready to move in soon after dangerous conditions ease and they can move with safety there should be medical attention to treat injured survivors and stations set up as soon as possible to provide water food and other essentials available to those that survived with little or no physical hurt these first steps at adaptation are the keys to survival recovery after a shock phase can be long and drawn out depending in grand part on a nations social and economic resources and physical and economic assistance from other nations international institutions and ngosglobal warming is a fact attested to by an overwhelming majority of the scientific community and unwaveringly supported by a february 2014 joint publication of the us national academy of sciences and the royal academy in the uk on the causes and evidence for global warming 1 as noted in earlier chapters during the past century measurements show that the earth has warmed by 08 c 144 f global warming is an ongoing process that is attributed in grand part to a slow but continuous and increasing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the greenhouse gas most associated with global warming is carbon dioxide co2 a plot of the increase of co2 content in the atmosphere with time against the increase in global temperature shows an excellent correlation of one with the other additional lesser contributors include methane ch4 nitrous oxide no2 and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs with the beginning of the industrial revolution and the increased use of coal as the principal energy source the content of co2 in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million 0028  the combustion of coal and later oil petroleum and natural gas emits co2 to the atmosphere initially and for many years thereafter the added greenhouse gases were taken up by vegetation for photosynthesis and was also absorbed by the oceans and other water bodies this kept the atmosphere co2 close to the 280 ppm pre-industrial level however with increased industrialization the need for electrical power and the use of internal combustion engines the amount of co2 generated was greater than what could be absorbed by nature and the content of co2 in the atmosphere increased during june 2013 its concentration reached more than 398 ppm an increase of over 40  over the pre-industrial concentration scripps institute of oceanography mauna loa measurement the increasing co2 content other greenhouse gases aerosols and particles acted as a media that admitted sunlight heat energy to the earths surface but did not let all of the heat escape back into the atmosphere this abets global warming in the past two to three decades the rush to industrialization in developing countries eg china india and brazil and their growing power needs and vehicular use has thwarted the implementation of international agreements to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants other industrial and manufacturing operations and the transportation sectora direct consequence of global warming is sea level rise slr caused by the progressive melting of icecaps and ice sheets in greenland the arctic and antarctica and of mountain glaciers in the himalayas the alps the rocky mountains and the andes the 20-cm 8 in sea level rise during the past century may see a rise of another 50 cm 20 in1 m 39 in during this twenty-first century one-third of the rise would be from the expansion of warmer sea water one-third from icecap and ice sheet melt and one-third from mountain glacier melt 2 in 2012 other researchers used computer models on existing data and proposed that 50  of sea level rise between 1903 and 2007 was from glacial melt 3 following the same line of investigation other scientists studied satellite data and ground measurements from alaska the canadian arctic greenland the southern andes the himalayas and other high mountains of asia and estimated that glacier contributions to sea level rise from 2003 to 2009 was 29  and together with ice sheet melt explained 60  of slr 4 a publication in 2012 estimated that ocean thermal expansion 0300 m deep and 300700 m deep contributed up to 35  to sea level rise 5 these latter two estimations are in line with the ipcc prediction for melting ice and ocean thermal expansion contribution to the estimated rise of sea level by the end of the century 2 with a rise in sea level marine waters encroach on land as the rise continues possibly at an increasing rate it threatens habitation in lowlying islands coastal villages and farmland in lowlying zones and heavily populated cities worldwide settled on inshore terrain close to sea level eg bangkok ho chi minh city jakarta manila miami new york boston buenos aires london rotterdamrising sea level and warming of ocean waters have other ramifications that affect coastal communities as well as inland areas as explained in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-57 the warmer surface water releases more water vapor with heat energy into the atmosphere when the water vapor molecules condense in clouds heat energy is released this energy gives more force to tropical storms as they form track to shore and move inland or storms that move close to and along a coast these storms may transition to hurricanes typhoons monsoons with the violent winds that cause destruction and heavy rainfall that triggers flooding if they move onto land we recognize that rising sea level means that tropical storms that impact a coast with storm surges have a farther reach inland with their destructive energy that is more pronounced when the surge occurs at high tide the surges also saturate farmland they reach with salt water that harms crops they also carry salt water into fresh water marshes and ponds thus disrupting ecosystems there the increase in the number of these extreme weather events and the increase in violence and destruction they wreak on land compared with like weather events in the recent past eg during the past 30 years strongly suggest that they are fueled to a significant degree by global warmingthere are two possibilities for adapting to the effects of rising sea level on coastal urban centers one impractical the other very costly but doable the impractical adaptation possibility is to move at-risk population centers inland out of the reach of the destructive tropical storms this does not lessen the threat of flooding the move is possible in some cases where land is available but such a move is not economically feasible one practical but costly adaptation to mitigate encroachment from sea level rise and the effects of tropical storm surges is to surround cities at risk within place seawalls 23 m higher than recorded high tides or higher depending on historical records and contemporary published data the walls can have a concave configuration so that surging waves lose energy when their lower parts hit and are curled back on themselves damping some wave energy or there can be a different configuration best for the sites to be protected similarly gates buried at strategic locations where there is ship access to consider can be built to be hydraulically driven so that they can rise from a near shore seabed site to mitigate the effects of storm surges both techniques have been used at different global locationswe have read that climate change affects land-based agricultural production both for crops and animal husbandry the warming climate at higher mid-hemispheric latitudes and at higher altitudes does not favor the growth and normal yield andor quality of many crops depending upon the degree of climate change and the linked changes that may follow it farmers can adapt in several ways to maintain or increase crop yield and nutrition value for example when warming starts diminishing the productivity of a traditional crop farmers can sow crops that are known to grow well in warmer temperature and give a satisfactory economic benefit however new groups of weeds pests and diseases will migrate to the warmer growth environment and will have to be dealt with in order to protect the new cropswhere the effect of global warming reduces water supply for rain-fed agriculture for crops irrigated with surface waters and for groundwater-irrigated crops when aquifer recharge does not balances discharge agriculturalists can adapt in two ways first is the use of a more efficient irrigation method that delivers water directly to a growing plant eg drip or focused irrigation this minimizes runoff and loss to evaporation second and similar to what was mentioned earlier is to sow a crop that needs less water to thrive and that delivers a good yield good-quality productanother result of global warming for some farmlands is a longer growing season in this situation growers can adapt by planting earlier and have the possibility of double cropping they can also grow a cultivar that is later maturing and that gives a product that brings a good market price however switching to new crops in a warmer growth environment means that there will be an invasion of a new set of weeds pests and diseases to ward offin any efficient operation and as emphasized in earlier chapters farmers adjust to a changing growth environment for a given cultivar by applying the optimum amounts of fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals as might be needed that nurture and protect it most effectively this reduces agricultural costs and lessens runoff of these chemicals to ecosystems where they can be harmfulglobal warming can bring on abnormal weather extremes that affect agricultural productivity in these cases farmers have to plan ahead based on recent history of these conditions in their regions drought heat waves and long-term rain or heavy rain in a short time present problems for both cultivars and food animals periods of less than average precipitation may last months or years depending on the amount of the deficit precipitation adaptation can include storing water in reservoirs and cisterns during times of rainfall to be tapped during a drought to sustain food animals and crops during a short-term not too severe drought there is also the option of trucking in water to sustain livestock long-term droughts when precipitation deficits are high take their toll on plants and animals to the detriment of agriculture in a region especially when accompanied by heat waves they have caused recent disasters for crops and food animals on all continents less antarctica farmers either wait out the bad times change the type of cropping they do the livestock they tend to or change careersthe adaptation from crops that have been grown successfully before the effects of global warming reduced yields and quality of a harvest to those same crops that can grow successfully under the advancing warming changes just described generally means that hybridized species have to be developed and used as warming increases at a location and slowly tracks to higher latitudes and higher altitudes thus growers turn to plants that are created by hybridization as described in chap 101007978-3-319-09686-53 traditional methods and marker-assisted selection methods within the same species and genetically engineered -modified -manipulated methods using different species hybridization is a slow process sped up markedly by genetic engineering a method that yields foodstuff not accepted by the european union and many nations outside the union especially in africa bred species are developed to carry one or more characteristics that favor crop resilience against the effects of climate change these include resistance to disease weeds and pests and tolerant of drought water stress heat short-term inundation and short-term saline exposure see chap 101007978-3-319-09686-53 hybrids have also been developed to give higher yields and more nutritious crops thus far research has been focused mainly on improving seed for world staples such as rice maize corn wheat sorghum and soybeanthere have been great successes where hybrid crops were agriculturalists adaptation so that the possibility exists that we can feed the earths growing populations and reduce chronic malnutrition when this is coupled with the opening of additional arable acreage and the use of improved farming methods for seeding watering and harvesting global food security can be strengthened for the existing world population and the future generations on earth however this will require economic and technical input by developed nations and international groups without basic sustenance people will have less resistance to diseases and there may be local or regional population crashes if diseases evolve into epidemics or pandemics that invade susceptible populationswarming of the open ocean water enclosed aquaculture operations in ocean waters and on land water bodies has affected marine fisheries and marine and estuarine aquaculture that grow food fish and shellfish and lakes that sustain fisheries in marine fisheries worldwide eg in the north atlantic off the coast of peru off the coast of the philippines some food fish or fish captured for other purposes eg to use in pet food to use to make fertilizer have migrated to cooler water in ecosystems with conditions conducive to their spawning and growth in some cases predators follow fish they prey upon that have migrated to cooler waters but in other cases they find new prey to sustain them in other situations they may become prey for larger fish in an ecosystem fishing fleets adapt by following the fish they hunt into cooler waters where ideally they capture the hunted species in quantities allotted them by national and international fishery governing body regulations if the quota system is followed this will allow recovery of fish populations and sustainable harvestingaquaculture operations that provide important supplies of food fish worldwide can adapt to warming waters by raising food fish or shellfish that will grow and multiply under the changed range of daynight temperature conditions if the fish they are farming cannot survive in the warmer waters aquaculturalists also have the option to move their facilities to cooler-temperature waters but the economic feasibility of doing this has to be evaluated by a benefit to cost analysis this analysis has to be for the time frame during which the cooler-ecosystem waters are estimated to remain stable within the framework of a time range against global warmingclimate change another adaptation is that food fish currently being raised can be genetically engineered to be resistant to a warmer growth environment without changing their nutrition yield growth rate and ability to reproduce
vaccines provide a main line of defense against many diseases smallpox has been eradicated on earth by vaccination polio has all but been eradicated globally except for a few pockets of the disease in pakistan afghanistan and nigeria where in some cases religious fundamentalists have beaten and killed health workers tasked with giving the vaccine to children and in other cases where parents have been warned by the zealots against allowing their children to be vaccinated recently 81 polio cases were diagnosed mainly in somalia but also in kenya this is attributed to the fact that by 2013 500000 children in somalia have not received the vaccine and are at risk from this highly contagious disease it is also attributed to cross-border migration of infected persons into kenya both governments are stepping up their vaccination programs there were 59 cases of polio diagnosed in the rest of the world in 2012
measles is a global disease that can be prevented by a vaccine that is safe and cost-effective measles may soon reach the near-eradication stage in 1980 and subsequent years 26 million people mainly children under 5 years of age died from measles since 2000 1 billion children were vaccinated 225 million in 2011 by 2011 84  of the worlds children received the measles vaccine up from 72  in 2000 from 2000 to 2011 deaths from measles dropped to 71  from 548000 to 158000 when the vaccination rate reaches 95  mainly in low-income countries the world will have brought another disease close to elimination 6
seasonal influenza is a global viral illness that afflicts 35 million people the sickness kills 250000500000 people with severe symptoms annually transmission of the virus takes place when an infected individual coughs or sneezes without covering hisher mouth and releases droplets that can be inhaled by someone up to a meter away transmission can also be from hands carrying the virus seasonal influenza affects all age groups but children less than 2 years old people over 65 and those with complicating medical problems are most at risk influenza is a disease to be controlled the principal control is by safe and effective vaccines that can prevent 7090  of influenza cases in healthy adults secondary controls are obvious for infected persons cover the mouth when sneezing or coughing and wash the hands frequently the influenza vaccine is taken once annually because strains of the influenza virus change from year to year adaptation is needed the adaptation is via a vaccine that is prepared with 3 or 4 strains that scientists determine will be most common during a coming season 7other types of influenza and respiratory illnesses have the potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic they include avian flu and its strains and swine flu if the strains develop the ability for person-to-person transmission after infection and sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome  mers because there is human-to-human transmission of the sicknesses to the present the outbreaks of the animal influenza diseases have been contained by quarantining infected people during treatment and by culling flocks and herds or if available vaccination of healthy animals the latter two respiratory illnesses are caused by the coronavirus and infected people have been in isolation wards for sars an illness that broke out in 2003 and spread to 24 countries isolation of victims and treatment with antiviral drugs and steroids stopped the disease during 2004 mers is a recent 20122013 illness that has been confined to jordan saudi arabia qatar and the united arab emirates the mers virus has been found in camels infected persons are quarantined in hospitals but an effective drug treatment is still being sought to complement the normal hospital care-afforded patientshiv aids is a global epidemic that killed 25 million people in three decades since 1981 worldwide in 2011 there were 34 million people with hiv mainly 33 million or 97  in sub-saharan africa and southsoutheast asia the illness is caused by the exchange of body fluids semen vaginal excretions blood breast milk from an infected individual with an uninfected person more than 50  of the cases of hiv are from heterosexual activity there is no vaccine against hiv aids no cure for it but there is a cocktail of medicines antiretroviral treatment that control viral replication and allow an infected persons immune system to strengthen this keeps the illness at bay and afflicted people in general good health and productive in their communities in 2012 only 97 million less than 30  of those with hiv in low and middle economies received the antiretroviral treatment this is changing as more hiv carriers have access to antiretroviral therapy and there are more donations from economically advantaged countries to support hiv stabilization and reduction programs the number of new cases of hiv is not exploding because more than 50  of those infected are following protocols that reduce the transmission of the diseasethe prevention of transmission methods include access to male and female condoms blood screening before transfusions and needle and syringe exchange programs for sterile injections by drug users hiv testing and education programs and hiv treatment help prevent transmission because individuals in continuous treatment have a very low probability of passing on the disease male circumcision reduces the infection in men by about 60  there is still much progress to be made because there were 25 million new cases of hiv in 2011 with 18 million of that total in sub-saharan africa the hivaids is a global sickness that is slowly coming under control because of generous donations from governments and foundations in developed countries added to what low- and middle-income countries themselves provide to lower the prevalence and incidence of hiv in their populations 8
tuberculosis tb infected 87 million people globally in 2011 killing 14 million persons it is a bacterial disease that spreads among people when infected individuals cough sneeze or spit releasing bacteria into the air where they can be inhaled by others a meter away although tb occurs worldwide developing countries carry the largest burden of cases and deaths 95  the bulk of new cases are regional in asia 60  with sub-saharan africa reporting a large share as well with 2600 new cases per million inhabitants there is no vaccination for tb but the disease can be treated and cured the treatment is a half-year course of four antimicrobial drugs that must be taken without fail and thus requires continual supervision by healthcare personnel more than 51 million people have been treated and cured of tb since 1995 and perhaps 20 million lives saved by following the who stop tb strategy protocols including securing adequate sustained financing ensuring early reliable detection and diagnosis and providing approved treatment with a secure effective drug supply the number of people infected with tb is declining and from 1990 to 2011 the tb death rate dropped more than 40  the success in dealing with tb is muted somewhat because a strain of the bacterium that causes tb has evolved to be multidrug resistant  mdr-tb in 2011 310000 cases of this variant were reported of the 87 million cases worldwide mainly from india china and the russian federation these are treated with but do not always respond to the most effective anti-tb drugs research into new drugs to deal with this problem is ongoing 9 there is the question of whether people visiting or immigrating from these countries should be screened before a host country issues them entry visasregional illnesses threaten the health of 100s of millions of people mainly in tropical and subtropical areas and often affecting children one of these the guinea worm disease is trending toward elimination if not eradication this is a parasitic disease caused when people swallow water contaminated with infected water fleas microscopic copepods carrying worm larva the worms release penetrate the intestines and move through the body migrating under the skin until they emerge causing swelling and blistering people infected with guinea worm disease cannot contribute to their communities for months during the mid-1980s there were 25 million cases mainly in 16 african nations but attention to where the sources were so that they could be avoided and treated and assistance in generating clean water were adaptations that brought the number of cases down to less than 10000 in 2007 the number of cases continued to decline and was reduced to 542 in 2012 in four african countries south sudan chad ethiopia and mali there is no vaccine against guinea worm disease health officials adapt to counter this sickness in several ways as noted above access to clean drinking water is the best way to prevent infection the prevention or transmission of the worms from infected individuals to healthy persons by proper treatment and hygiene and the use of the larvacide temephos to eliminate the parasite-infected water flea vector and other prevention protocols are important in the control and effort to eliminateeradicate the disease 10 the jimmy carter institute atlanta georgia usa has been a principle force since 1986 in the fight to rid the world of guinea worm diseasein tropical and subtropical regions there are three mosquito-vectored diseases that put millions of people at risk yellow fever malaria and dengue fever yellow fever is an endemic viral disease in tropical regions of africa and latin america with 200000 cases reported annually that cause 30000 deaths there is no set treatment for afflicted people but there is an adaptive preventive measure a vaccine against yellow fever is available that is safe affordable and that gives lifelong immunity to the disease with one dose after 710 days for 95  of the people vaccinated when there is the onset of a yellow fever outbreak where the population lacks vaccination protection mosquito control is an essential first step in adaptation to prevent or slowdown transmission of the yellow fever virus spraying insecticides to eliminate breeding sites and kill adult mosquitos is the control used during epidemics to make time for vaccination campaigns in a population and for immunity to take hold there are limitations to the application of the yellow fever vaccine first is that babies less than 9 months of age should not be vaccinated or during an epidemic babies less than 69 months of age should not receive the vaccine second pregnant women should not be vaccinated except when there is an outbreak of the disease third people with a strong allergy to egg protein or those with a marked immunodeficiency or with a thymus problem should not receive the vaccine 11
malaria is a parasitic disease caused by the bite of an infected mosquito there is no vaccine against malaria but one is undergoing a clinical trial in seven african nations with results expected in 2014 a use or no use decision as a control method for malaria will be made in 2015 promising results from an early-stage clinical trial of an unconventional vaccine prepared with live weakened sporozoites of the malaria parasite were published in 2013 plasmodium falciparum was given to healthy 1845 year-old volunteers intravenously the volunteers were grouped to receive 26 doses and subsequently exposed to bite by five mosquitoes carrying the parasite none of the six that received five doses were infected with malaria three of the 12 that received four doses became infected whereas 16 of the 17 that received lower doses became infected of 12 that received no vaccine 11 became infected those that became infected were treated with malarial drugs and cured clearly higher dosages give protection against infection by malaria 12 more research and extensive clinical trials are necessary to determine how children respond to the vaccine with adjusted dosages and whether the results from early-stage trial are reproducible in larger volunteer populations if the results of additional clinical trials go well the hurdle of producing enough vaccine and adapting it to injection has to be facedforty percent of the deaths from malaria are of african children in the democratic republic of congo and nigeria in addition to sub-saharan africa populations in asia especially india and the greater mekong region and latin america suffer from the disease the effort to deal with the disease that is preventable and curable now centers on control and treatment to reduce the number of cases in 2010 the who reported that there were 219 million cases and 660000 deaths with an uncertainty range of 490000836000 in a 2012 report researchers suggested that the number of deaths was understated and that their computer model gave a figure for 2010 almost double 1238000 deaths 95  uncertainty interval of 9290001685000 13 the who stood by its figure stating that much of the data in the cited study were based on verbal testimony of how people had died not on laboratory diagnosis of samples either figure represents too many deaths from the disease and have to be reduced mosquito control is the adaptation that can reduce the transmission of the disease greatly this includes personal protection by use of proper clothing andor the application of mosquito repellent the use of long-lasting insecticidal pyrethroids treated nets to kill mosquitos and prevent nighttime bites and indoor residual spraying remains effective for months those people infected can be treated with oral artemisinin monotherapy followed by a second drug failure to complete the treatment as prescribed leaves parasites in a persons blood no other antimalarial treatment is available so that parasite resistance could become a serious problem for visitors to a malaria region antimalarial drugs taken before during and after a trip can protect them from the disease many countries in tropical and subtropical areas have used the above-cited strategies and others to work toward the elimination of malaria malaria eradication is the goal of the who 14
dengue fever is a female mosquito-borne virus that infects people with an influenza-like disease in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide the disease can kill if it evolves to severe dengue it is endemic in latin america and asia where most cases now occur since the 1970s the sickness has spread to more than 100 countries putting about 35  of the worlds 2013 population 25 billion people at risk dengue fever is especially endemic to urbansemi-urban environments humans are the main carrier of the virus after a mosquito bites an infected person each subsequent bite by the infected mosquito creates another carrier a mosquito can bite many people each time it feeds in the americas alone there were 16 billion cases of dengue fever reported in 2010 with 49000 being severe dengue there is no vaccination against dengue fever but research continues to develop one the main treatment for afflicted persons is to keep them hydrated adaptation to deal with slowing or stopping the spread of dengue fever involves three main tracks in addition to spraying insecticide to kill mosquitos the best control method to prevent the transmission of the virus is to deprive mosquitos of sites with shallow standing water where they can lay eggs and multiply control can be improved if communities cover and clean water storage containers regularly and use proven insecticides on them as necessary finally individual protection such as the use of mosquito repellants and insecticide-impregnated bed nets can help reduce the incidence of dengue fever as it has with malaria 15 although controls are known they are not always applied because of economics and other factors that prevent access to protection methods the result is that the number of cases of dengue fever reported continues to grow globally as populations increase in urban locations the incidence of dengue fever can be expected to increase as well unless strict controls are enforced until a safe and cost-effective vaccine is developed a positive aspect of the dengue fever problem is that recovery from one serotype of the virus gives immunity for life however there are four serotypes of the infectious virus so that recovery from one leaves a person susceptible to the others 15chagas is another regional disease it infects 78 million people annually mostly in 21 latin american countries it is a parasitic illness that evolves after the bite of a blood-feeding triatomine bug often on the face where it defecates close by leaving parasite-bearing feces parasites access the body when the feces are inadvertently smeared into the bite the eyes the mouth or any skin lesion the parasites circulate in the blood expressing their presence as a purplish swelling of one eyelid or as a skin lesion there are several other symptoms as well in this acute stage of the illness but these may be absent or mild if diagnosed early during this stage chagas disease is treatable the parasite is killed with the medicines benznodazole and nifurtimox taken for 2 months there are limitations as to who can take these medicines eg not by pregnant women or people with kidney or liver problems the untreated sickness can cause cardiac alterations and digestive problems that show up 2040 years after an untreated infection chagas disease can be spread by blood transfusion and by organ transplant making blood screening for the parasite essential before a procedure it can also pass to a fetus from an infected woman there is no vaccination against the illness so that control of the vector triatomine sp is necessary the controls adapted by many municipalities include insecticide spraying inside a home the use of treated bed nets and hygiene practices that protect food its preparation and its storage before eating it 16 the sickness may recur if control practices become lax chagas disease is spreading as populations emigrate from latin america to northern countries blood screening of visitors or immigrants from the countries where chagas is endemic may be necessary and treatment followed by an infected individual before a host country issues an entrance visa this would prevent the ingress and possible spread of chagasoutbreaks of diseases in town and cities is most often caused by bacterium-contaminated water or food and poor sanitation sicknesses such as cholera typhoid and various other diarrhea types are examples of such diseases they are all highly infectious if good hygiene practices are not followed these diseases are endemic in many countries where populations do not have access to safe water and adequate sanitation there are vaccinations for some of these sicknesses that may require more than one dose but they may not be completely effective or long lasting and require revaccination at times specified by medical personnel eg after 25 years otherwise infected persons can be treated with medicines such as oral rehydration pills or antibiotics adaptation for prevention is easier called for than realistically available washing hands with soap and clean water after visiting the toilet and as noted above access to safe water and good sanitation given the millions of people infected by these bacterial diseases and the hundreds of thousand that die from them annually generally in economically disadvantages countries there should be an expanding global priority to eliminate the disease-causing conditions and preparedness to combat an outbreak when it is reportedthere are important factors to consider when adopting plans to halt or meliorate the effects of health threats to people in the near and extended future one is the climate change-driven spread of tropical and subtropical diseases discussed earlier to newly warmer and moister higher-latitude and higher-altitude zones another is the growth of populations mainly in tropical and subtropical regions in africa asia and latin america together with this latter factor are the increasing populations and population densities in urban centers especially in the regions just cited an additional factor to consider is whether there is accessibility to populations by healthcare workers or by people to healthcare clinics or hospitals well-staffed and well-stocked with necessary pharmaceuticalscertainly future planning has to include funding to support research to develop vaccines for diseases that do not have vaccination as an option against an illness eg malaria dengue fever  in addition improvement of vaccines that are available but that are not completely effective in terms of protection or the length of time they are effective should be a priority in pharmaceutical and biotechnology laboratories scientists presented a fine review of the status of vaccine research from the design and development of vaccines to discussion of vaccines and infectious diseases eg hiv malaria tuberculosis pneumococcal disease and influenza 17 they also discuss vaccines against enteric infections and viral diseases of livestock as well as vaccines against non-infectious diseases eg cancer and against chronic non-infectious diseases continued and repeated education classes on how to prevent the transmission of diseases and free supplies of materials that work to this end eg insecticide-treated bed netting male and female condoms are essential to reducing the prevalence and incidence of diseases as are safe water and uncontaminated food as new medicines or combinations of medicines are developed tested and found to be effective in controlling diseases they become part of the protocol for either curing disease or controlling disease to reduce transmission while allowing persons to carry on with their lives in these times of easy and rapid migration one wonders whether screening of visitors or immigrants for diseases known to be endemic or active in the countries or regions from which they come should be required so as to prevent a carrier from infecting others and spreading a disease eg chagas disease cholera tuberculosis this was done at airports during the sars scare for people leaving or entering a country eg china and likely limited the transmission of the sars virus and spread of the diseasepreparedness for a disease outbreak response to an outbreak and management of resources during and post-outbreak are the keys to adapting to health threats that could affect future generations this means developing the capability to extend the reach of health services to regions where climate change brings warmer moister conditions to higher-latitude and higher-altitude ecosystems that are now reached by disease vectors that have expanded into these formerly cooler and drier environments as a result of global warming adapting to this reality and planning ahead makes it possible to deal with and stem an incipient outbreak of disease before it is transmitted and spread to the general population this becomes essential when there is a future disease outbreak in large dense populations in tropical and subtropical urban centers as well as those in regions warmed and humidified by climate change to subtropical and tropical settings remember that urban populations worldwide especially in africa asia and latin america are where much of the global population growth will take place during the next few generations under these conditions diseases can spread rapidly in many ways these include from bites of vectors by respired droplets after an infected person coughs or sneezes and by touching surfaces bearing viruses bacteria or parasites diseases are also spread by ingestion of contaminated water andor tainted food and by other methods of infection transmission disease transmission can be checked by rapid response teams with appropriate and sufficient supplies to treat and perhaps places to quarantine those in the infected populationlastly it must be noted that there are many other diseases in addition to those cited previously for which prevention treatment and cures are research priorities in laboratories worldwide in addition there are addiction diseases that can trigger health problems in important segments of society these include smoking eg emphysema lung cancer alcoholism eg cirrhosis of the liver drugs eg various psychological and physical ills and overeating obesity diabetes high blood pressure adaptation to these health threats involves public education forums through various media outlets counseling and sponsored groups with their individual group meeting and programs are assisting many in breaking from an addiction to the benefit of a healthier life adaptation to meet the health challenges in the past and in contemporary times has been a slow progressive adventure with many successes but with much yet to be done this is the planned path for the future meet the challenges of societal health threats resolve many and keep researching to resolve othersa special ipcc report in 2012 examines in a general way adaptation to a changing climate as a risk management approach 18 it uses pre-planning to reduce exposure and vulnerability to extreme hazard events by preparing for them beforehand responding to their impacts on people structures and infrastructure and having in place recovery systems that can act when a danger condition eases in this way there will be an ability of populations to cope with future risks brought on by a changing force with which a hazard impacts a community changes in the frequency of an occurrence and extension of the spatial reach of its destructive power much of this has been discussed in the chapters of the book you are readingan understanding of what is being done now to adapt to the various problems society faces during the second decade of the twenty-first stimulates proposals of how to adapt to them as global conditions change in the future to this end the world bank commissioned a study on the effects global warming as it increased from 08 c that exists on our planet now to what can be expected if the warming reached 2 c a change that many scientists believe we can adapt to and then reached 4 c as warming continues 19 the study centered on regions with high population growth and great susceptibility to be negatively impacted by climate changes 1 sub-saharan africa where food production is at risk 2 southeast asia where coastal zones and productivity are at risk and 3 south asia where there could be extremes of water scarcity and excess the effects of higher temperatures from global warming and climate change included what has been discussed in previous chapters of this book heat drought sea level rise coastal zones typhoons flooding river runoff water availability ecosystem shifts crop yields fishing aquaculture livestock health and poverty and tourism projections such as those published in the world bank study give impetus to governments international institutions multinational companies private foundations and ngos to think now to invest now and to research now for adaptations that can be realized in good time and that will provide global citizenry with a good quality of life where neededin this book we have examined existing human populations and the problems they are experiencing in the second decade of the twenty-first century and have also considered growing populations globally and additional problems future generations will experience we have discussed strategies on how to cope with many-faceted threats to citizens these include how to nourish those who need food and water how to shelter people safely from natural and anthropogenic hazards how to provide them with healthcare education and employment and how to prepare them for the evolving global warming and the physical and biological dangers that ensue from climate change given the present global conditions with about 14  of our earths population suffering from malnutrition and more than 21  not having access to safe water our capability of nourishing a billion and a half more people by 2035 is in question also problematical is our capability to provide for an additional billion people 15 years later or a total of at least 103 billion people by the turn of the century that is if we reach those population figures or have population crashes such as from pandemics that can kill scores of millions if a disease is not immediately treatable or an unlikely but possible nuclear conflagration that could do the same less likely yet is an explosion of a small asteroid or comet in the atmosphere such as happened in a poorly inhabited area of siberia in 1908 here an exploding mass more than 60 m in size knocked down millions of trees in an area greater than 2000 km2 close to 800 mi2 with energy thought to be 1000 times greater than the hiroshima atomic bomb clearly such an event could kill the population of a megacity if it were to occuranother question is whether national governments are economically strong enough and have the will to set priorities that adopt strategies to protect citizens from natural eg earthquakes and anthropogenic eg pollution hazards as well as from extreme weather conditions that are supported by global warming  pollution of the atmosphere but are naturally occurring countries can also improve social and economic conditions by investing in health care and education for their citizens in order to form a sound and knowledgeable cadre that would be attractive to investors interested in locating a development project that would provide employment again this is in question given limited national economic capabilities and the increasing numbers of people to be accommodated especially in several developing and less developed countries in africa asia latin america and the middle eastat this point we must ask what is the carrying capacity of the earth have we reached it at 7 billion given the billions who are today under served in developing and less developed countries some scientists will answer yes whereas others believe that advances in agriculture and technology can allow population expansion although to what point is not defined can countries that are poisoning their environments do a turn around to save their citizens from grief can they exert controls on operations that create unhealthy conditions that sicken people lessen agricultural production and otherwise disrupt local regional and global ecosystems at the expense of maintaining their gdp and increasing it this is not the case for many nations today that do not want to acknowledge that changes tomorrow may be too late and that the future begins now without action now to activate programs to sustain and nurture our ecosystem earth the future is bleak for many and bright for a few with action now we can strive toward an equalization in benefits for all citizens the intergovernmental panel on climate change completed the fifth assessment report april 2014 after this book was written climate change 2014 impacts adaptations and vulnerability it is a comprehensive and important contribution to the challenges presented to society by climate change now and in the future and how to manage them for the good of society the full text is online at wwwipccchreportar5
great focus was placed on consumer purchasing behavior in the early stages of the covid-19 global pandemic in america panic buying was heavily covered on the news and social media with countless outlets reporting shortages in health and cleaning products such as hand sanitizer and cleaning wipes telford and bhattarai 2020 knoll 2020 this type of buying and the related product shortages have the potential to impact individual health and well-being and the safety of others through product supply chains and overall burden on medical services the behavior was largely deemed a result of overreaction or greed on the part of consumers or as a result of intent to resell on the part of some online sellers although such motives may have stimulated some consumer purchasing not all rapid purchasing was likely of this variety instead some individuals adopted a rapid response to the approaching pandemic to improve their health outcomes this proactive coping can be viewed as a valuable health-protective behavior in the face of covid-19 currently the factors predicting the purchasing of health care products at the early stages of a global pandemic are unknown further it is unclear what psychological factors are key in motivating such purchasing the aim of the current study was to obtain information on who engaged in this preparatory purchasing behavior as well as on a key psychological variable that may motivate this behaviorage has been prominently discussed as a predictor of poor outcomes for covid-19 age is associated with a higher risk of both hospitalization garg et al 2020 and death ruan et al 2020 due to covid-19 this information about age risks has spread widely also previous studies have identified older age to be correlated with more preventative health behaviors deeks et al 2009 this popular understanding of age in relation to covid-19 risk paired with existing evidence that older individuals engage in more preventative behaviors suggests that age is a likely predictor or preparatory purchasing behaviorwhile income level may not directly influence susceptibility to covid-19 those who earn less may struggle to adhere to recommended preventative behaviors such as social distancing those in low-income areas are less likely to stay home following directives to do so chiou and tucker 2020 perhaps due to a lack of resources or requirements to physically attend work thus it is possible that due to increased exposure to others individuals in low-income areas are motivated to engage in more preparatory purchasing alternatively it could be that low-income individuals purchase fewer products due to financial constraints as such divergent predictions could be made regarding the relationship between income and preparatory purchasing behaviorblack communities have been disproportionately impacted by covid-19 in the united states infection rates are up to three times higher in predominately black communities and death rates are up to six times higher yancy 2020 garg et al 2020 other differences in race and ethnicity require further study however this initial evidence is reason to consider that race may influence preparatory behaviors including purchasing health and safety productsgender represents another variable that may play a role in preparatory purchasing there is emerging evidence that men are disproportionately impacted by covid-19 garg et al 2020 and daily postings of cases and demographic information mean that this information is widely accessible to the public further gender differences exist in a variety of health behaviors including both risky behaviors eg alcohol consumption and preventative behaviors eg health screening dawson et al 2007 lemasters et al 2014 azevedo et al 2007 although these results vary based on behavior women generally take part in more preventative behaviors than men further gender differences are also seen in the utilization of health services bertakis et al 2000 and in shopping and consumer behavior seock and bailey 2007 barber et al 2009 suggesting that gender may play an important role in health-protective purchasing behavior related to covid-19covid-19 can infect anyone however the severity of the resulting illness is linked to certain medical conditions it has been established that chronic illnesses including cardiac illnesses chronic respiratory illnesses diabetes and hiv place individuals at high risk for complications resulting from covid-19 although some risk factors are clear others remain unclear for example it is not yet known how chronic illnesses such as hypertension schiffrin et al 2020 affect those with the novel coronavirus given the variations and uncertainty of objective risk perceptions of covid-19 risk factors are likely to influence health behaviors like preparatory purchasing the influence of risk perceptions is a well-established predictor of many protective health behaviors ferrer and klein 2015 thus it can be anticipated that perceptions of possessing a risk for covid-19 will predict safety-focused acts such as preparatory product purchasingif predictors of preparatory purchasing are identified the question turns to why these variables have such effects in the present study we assess the possibility that affect particularly the emotion of worry serves as a critical psychological mechanism linking predictors to purchasing behavior prior research indicates that affect often relates to both objective risk and perceptions of risk eg lipkus et al 2005 and affect has been identified as a salient and proximal cue that stimulates health-protective action williams et al 2018 for example a meta-analysis by mccaul et al 1996 found both risk for breast cancer and worry about cancer were related to higher levels of preventative breast cancer screening the current climate around covid-19 has provoked feelings of worry in many individuals worry over covid-19 likely varies between individuals and it may be surmised that worry is elevated by the aforementioned predictor variables linked to covid-19 in the present study it is hypothesized that the state of worry mediates the relationship between risk for covid-19 and preparatory purchasing this possibility is consistent with other research in which affect served as a mediator between perceived risk and health behaviors chapman and coups 2006 zhao and nan 2016 kiviniemi and eliis 2014to assess preparatory purchasing a larger range of health-related products were assessed some products such as hand soap are considered health-protective and were assessed amidst the rapid pace and confusion of the covid-19 pandemic information about what products provide a health benefit has been contradictory and inconsistent some unproven products have been recommended in social media and from official sources including leaders of the american government assessing a wide array of preparatory purchases presents an opportunity to capture individuals attempts to engage in self-protective behaviors broadlyparticipants were contacted using the online participant recruitment system prolific and were provided with monetary compensation for their participation in the study of the 344 participants 541 identified as women 439 identified as men and 15 identified as another gender or preferred not to disclose their gender participants ranged in age from 18 to 74 m  3269 sd  1160 participants represented 44 of the united states and were 68 white 16 asianasian-american 5 black 5 latinx and 6 two or more racesa demographic questionnaire assessed participant age raceethnicity coded as white non-latinx vs non-white or latinx gender and income coded as above or below 75000 for purposes of data analyses the gender variable was recoded to only include those who identified as men or women as there were not enough other responses in order to be included in the analysis n  4in order to simply capture risk related to covid-19 during a time when new information was regularly being introduced about risk factors and affected groups a single-item measure was used reading do you have any condition that makes you more vulnerable to the coronavirus response options included yes no and unsure preliminary analyses indicated that individuals selecting yes and unsure responded the same on product purchasing and worry as such two groups were created individuals indicating they did not have a risk factor n  241 an those who did or were uncertain n  101as a global pandemic on the scale of covid-19 is unprecedented in modern times measures to assess worry that capture the full extent of the situation around the coronavirus had not been created in order to simply assess worry surrounding the situation a single-item 7-point likert-style measure was created modeled after the worry domains questionnaire tallis et al 1992 this single item reads how worried are you about the coronavirus with response options ranging from 1 not worried at all to 7 extremely worrieda comprehensive list of 24 types of health and cleaning products was provided to participants under two prompts in order to include the broadest cut of the population both conventional and alternative health and cleaning products were included items were chosen for inclusion based on current recommendations from the united states centers for disease control and prevention and on relatedness to covid-19 symptoms participants were first provided with the prompt which products did you purchase or attempt to purchase in the past 23 weeks specifically in preparation for covid-19 the novel coronavirus before being shown items specifically for health and cleaning products these items asked in preparation for the coronavirus which of the following health productscleaning products did you purchase or attempt to purchase please select all that apply the ten health products included items such as bleach cloroxlysol name-brand commercial cleaning wipes hand sanitizer at least 60 alcohol natural hand sanitizer non-alcohol primary ingredient hand soap vinegar and a write-in option the 14 health products included items such as cold or flu medicine an extra supply of prescription medication acetaminophen or ibuprofen essential oils herbal supplements and write-in options for other medication supplements or vitamins the total number of preparatory purchases were summed to form the dependent measure m  430 sd  317this study was part of a larger project on covid-19 that was approved by the university of toledo institutional review board all procedures were conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the american psychological association inclusion criteria included being 18 years old or older and currently residing in the united states for other purposes participants first were shown one of five brief handwashing messages importantly the variables of interest to the current study risk factor perceptions worry and product purchases did not differ by the message shown thus this handwashing message variable is not discussed further participants then completed the previously described measures of preparatory purchases worry and risk for covid-19first an analysis was conducted to determine which variables predicted preparatory purchasing a between-subjects anova including 1 perceived covid-19 risk factor and the demographic variables of 2 gender 3 age as a covariate and 4 income as predictor variables revealed that only having or being uncertain about having a covid-19 risk factor predicted preparatory purchasing f16 320  477 p  03 specifically those reporting having or being uncertain about having a risk factor purchased more preparatory products m  524 as compared to those without a risk factor m  420next the relationships between the predictor variables and worry about covid-19 were assessed a between-subjects anova with the predictors violated the assumption of homogeneity of variance as such separate welchs anovas which does not require the assumption of homogeneity of variance were used results indicated that only two variables predicted worry first individuals reporting having or being uncertain about having a covid-19 risk factor experienced greater worry f1 27153  4070 p  001 second women also reported greater worry than men f1 30597  1094 p  001 finally a correlational analysis also indicated that worry about covid-19 was significantly related to increased preparatory purchases r  018 p  001because of the relationships between risk factor worry purchasing behavior and gender a moderated-mediation analysis was conducted using process for spss hayes 2017 specifically the model tested if 1 the relationship between perception of a covid-19 risk factor and preparatory purchasing behavior was statistically mediated by worry and 2 if the link from worry to preparatory purchasing was moderated by gender worry completely mediated the relationship between having a risk factor and preparatory purchasing critically this mediation effect was moderated by gender such that it occurred for men 95 ci 042 139 but not women 95 ci 049 051 this model resulted in a significant index of moderated-mediation 95 ci 112 006 see fig 1
those individuals who perceived themselves to be more at risk or were uncertain about their risk for covid-19 were more likely to engage in self-protective preparatory purchasing than those who did not view themselves as being at risk this relationship was statistically mediated through covid-19-related worry these findings lend support to previous studies which have shown a mediational relationship between risk factors and affect in health decision making eg kiviniemi and eliis 2014 this study also extends these findings by demonstrating that this relationship occurs in the context of an unprecedented global pandemic when emotions and salience of health decisions are high and individual risk is ambiguousin a time of rapidly evolving information it is difficult to always fully capture and portray the factors that put individuals most at risk clearly communicating these factors are essential in order to prevent under- or overestimation of risk in terms of preparatory purchasing behavior accurate risk communication may help prevent those who underestimate their risk from being unable to purchase needed supplies at a later date encouraging accurate perceptions of risk may help to ensure access to needed supplies for all people which may in turn help to reduce the spread of disease and reduce the burden on the healthcare systemgender was found to significantly moderate the relationship between worry and preparatory purchasing specifically possessing a risk factor for covid-19 was related to increased worry which in turn was linked to more preparatory purchasing but this only occurred in men women were less influenced by having a covid-19 risk factor which may be due to their overall higher level of worry about covid-19 these results have implications for future health behavior research as they suggest that worry may be an effective motivator for individuals with low levels of worry such as men with many health-protective behaviorsthese findings should be understood in light of the limitations of the present study self-report measures were used to assess preparatory purchasing behavior while the items asked participants to report on items they purchased or intended to purchase it is possible that the unique situation of resource shortages may add to the difficulty in respondents accurately reporting their purchases or attempted purchases further while care was taken to ensure the chosen products were related to covid-19 or its symptoms the lists of potential health and cleaning products were not exhaustive perceived risk and worry were also assessed after products had already been purchasedin light of the current public health crisis it is more important than ever before that governments and health organizations are prepared for pandemics encouraging the public to engage in appropriate but not excessive preparatory purchasing of protective goods is critical to ensuring the public health and safety the present findings have important implications for understanding how individuals engage in self-protective behavior when confronted with a public health emergency the results suggest that possessing a risk factor leads to greater preparation and this occurs because of greater levels of worry this relationship however relates to more preparatory purchasing primarily for individuals who are at greater risk but are not yet worried in this case men with a risk factor other variables such as income and race did not relate to preparatory purchasing finally consistent with recent research comparing affective and cognitive pathways for health behavior the mediation results suggest that the link between risk factor status and preparatory purchasing was due to feelings of worrybacteria consist of only a single cell bacteria fall into a category of life called the prokaryotes prokaryotes genetic material or dna is not enclosed in a cellular compartment called a nucleus as it is in eukaryotes not all bacteria are harmful however the subject of this book implies the killing of harmful bacteria most people know harmful bacteria best because of the diseases they cause some of these diseases are produced when bacteria attack directly the tissues of a plant or animal for example fruits and vegetables that become discolored as they are growing may be under attack by bacteria though discoloration may also be the result of oxidationbacteria also attack cells by releasing chemicals that are poisonous to plants and animals such poisons are known as toxins as an example clostridium botulinum releases a toxin that causes the most severe form of food poisoning botulismsome forms of dangerous bacteria live on the human skin but cause no harm unless they are able to enter the body among these bacteria is staphylococcus responsible for the potentially fatal toxic shock syndrome and gastroenteritis the bacteria may enter the bloodstream through a break in the skin or the digestive tract through contaminated food and although escherichia coli is helpful within the digestive system if it is ingested it may cause cramping and diarrhea if it enters the bloodstream it causes fever hypotension altered mental status and possibly deatha diagram of a typical bacterium is shown in fig 11
and a micrograph of cholera bacteria is shown in fig 12
 bacteria can be of many other shapes however some of which are shown in fig 13
bacteria are often classified as gram positive and gram negative the main difference between the two forms of bacteria is the composition and structure of the cell walls of the two as shown in fig 14
 referring to the figurepeptidoglycan also known as murein is a polymer consisting of sugars and amino acids that forms a mesh-like layer outside the plasma membrane of bacteria forming the cell wallthe periplasm is a space bordered by the two selective permeable biological membranes which are the inner plasma membrane and the outer membrane in gram-negative bacteriathere is no periplasmic space in gram-positive bacteria because there is only one biological membrane but a region called inner wall zone has been observed between the cytoplasmic membrane and the bacterial cell wall
the two types of bacteria may respond differently to sterilization processes sterilization processes that kill bacteria usually do so bycausing damage to the physical structure particularly rupture of the cell wallsaltering the membrane permeabilitydamaging the proteins within the cellsdamaging the nucleic acids in the dna or rna
a virus is a small infectious agent that can replicate only inside the living cells of organisms they are too small to be seen with a light microscope viruses are not plants animals or bacteria but they are more like parasites they are parasites because without a host cell they cannot carry out their life-sustaining functions or reproduce although they may seem like living organisms because of their reproductive abilities viruses are not livingthe average virus is about one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium all viruses contain nucleic acid either dna or rna but not both and a protein coat which encases the nucleic acid viruses come in a wide diversity of shapes and sizes called morphologies2 viruses are inactive when outside of a living cell but their nucleic acid once entering the cell can take over the cells activities which is primarily to reproduce and break out of the cell to infect other cells figure 15
shows electron micrographs of two different viruses the micrograph of the virus on the right side clearly shows the dna and cell wall structurean endospore is a dormant tough and temporarily nonreproductive structure produced by certain bacteria it is a stripped-down dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself when conditions are not right for the bacterium to thrive it is very resistant to harsh environments and can remain viable for very long periods of time only to spring back to life when conditions are rightthe structure and a micrograph of an endospore are shown in fig 16
 the endospore consists of the bacteriums dna and part of its cytoplasm surrounded by a very tough outer coating the coating consists of multiple layers the outermost layer is the exosporium which is a thin protein covering the next layer is the spore coat which is comprised of spore-specific proteins an outer membrane surrounds the cortex the cortex is composed of peptidoglycan containing some dipicolinc acid and calcium ions that cross-link this creates a highly impenetrable layer that provides the heat resistance properties of the endospore the core contains the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane nuclear material some ribosomes rna molecules and enzymes the core contains much less water than the bacterial cellendospores are highly resistant to hostile physical and chemical conditions they allow a bacterium to survive suboptimal environmental conditions because these spores are resistant to heat radiation disinfectants and desiccation they are difficult to eliminate but not impossible from medical and pharmaceutical materials and are a frequent cause of contaminationa prion is an infectious agent rather than a life form composed of protein in a misfolded form the group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases are called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as mad cow disease in cattle and creutzfeldtjakob disease cjd in humans they occur in animals dogs cows and primates as well as humans and are rapidly fatal once symptoms develop prions propagate by transmitting a misfolded protein state when a prion enters a healthy organism it induces existing properly folded proteins to convert into the disease-associated prion form it acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more protein into prion form this altered structure is extremely stable and accumulates in infected tissue causing tissue damage and cell death cjd poses a unique infection prevention problem because prions which are protein-containing infectious agents can survive many common sterilization processesa parasitical organism is a life form that lives off the host helminthes or parasitic worms are a division of eukaryotic parasites they are worm-like organisms that live and feed off living hosts receiving nourishment and protection while disrupting their hosts nutrient absorption causing weakness and disease those that live inside the digestive tract are called intestinal parasites figure 17
shows one of these parasitic worms they can live inside humans as well as other animals the helminthes not only reside in the digestive tract they may reside in other tissues trichinosis is a well-known example trichinosis is infection with the microscopic roundworm trichinella spiralis a micrograph of the trichinosis parasites in muscle tissue is shown in fig 18

a fungus is a eukaryotic organism fungal cells have cell walls that contain chitin unlike the cell walls of plants which contain cellulose chitin is a polymer of n-acetylglucosamine molds are fungi that grow in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae such as shown in fig 19
 which shows other labeled features microscopic fungi that grow as single cells are called yeasts figure 110
shows a micrograph of a yeastsome molds cause disease or food spoilage many fungi produce biologically active compounds several of which are toxic to animals or plants and are therefore called mycotoxins of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage inhaled fungal spores are a well-known cause of allergy and asthmasome human diseases caused by fungi includeaspergillosiscandidiasiscoccidioidomycosishistoplasmosismucormycosisopportunistic pneumoniathrush
as such there is a need to control or kill fungi in the food-processing and in the medical environmentprotozoa are unicellular eukaryotes meaning that they have characteristic organelles they are relatively large and some are visible with the naked eye not all protozoa are of concern to public healththose that are pathogens include
toxoplasma

however there have been rare infections by amoeba naegleria fowleri in the news recently the news media have called these brain-eating amoeba for the infections in the news the amoeba entered the brain after contaminated warm water entered the nose though there were also cases caused by head trauma
a biofilm is an aggregate of microorganisms in which cells adhere to each other on a surface dental plaque the slimy coating that fouls pipes and tanks and algal mats on bodies of water are examples of biofilms biofilms can form on solid or liquid surfaces as well as on soft tissue in living organisms they are typically resistant to conventional methods of disinfection these adherent cells in a biofilm are frequently embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance eps biofilm eps which is also referred to as slime although not everything described as slime is a biofilm is a polymeric conglomeration generally composed of extracellular dna proteins and polysaccharides biofilms may form on living or nonliving surfaces and can be prevalent in natural industrial and hospital settingsbiofilms have been found to be involved in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body biofilms have been implicated in common problems such as urinary tract infections catheter infections middle-ear infections formation of dental plaque gingivitis and coating contact lenses though less common but more lethal biofilms have also been implicated in health problems such as endocarditis infections in cystic fibrosis and infections of permanent implanted devices such as joint prostheses and heart valvesmany primitive and tedious methods of food preservation have been used some of these were developed thousands of years ago and are still used today these include
drying  drying was and still is used to preserve fruit vegetables meats and fish foods can be dried in the sun as the ancients did in an oven or in a food dehydrator by using the right combination of warm temperatures low humidity and air current drying removes the moisture from the food so bacteria yeast and mold that need water cannot grow and spoil the food
chemical pickling  food for pickling is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms there are many pickling agents including brine high in salt vinegar alcohol and vegetable oil particularly olive oil many chemical pickling processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved becomes saturated with the pickling agent in fermentation pickling the food itself produces the preservation agent typically by a process that produces lactic acid this is commonly used to preserve vegetables
salting  salting has been used extensively for pork beef and fish the origins of salt-preserving food can be traced back to at least ancient egypt where they used salt as part of the embalming process as well as in food preservation

sugaring  sugaring is used to preserve fruits for the winter producing jams and jellies sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it and then packing it with pure sugar the sugar can be crystalline table or raw sugar or it can be a high-sugar-density liquid such as honey syrup or molassescold storage  root cellars ground burial and iceboxes were cold storage methods used before the development of refrigeration
smoking  smoking is the exposure of cured meat and fish products to smoke for the purposes of preserving them and increasing their palatability by adding flavor and imparting color the drying action of the smoke tends to preserve the meat though many of the chemical species present in wood smoke eg formaldehyde and certain alcohols are natural preservatives as well smoking is one of the oldest of food preservation methods
canning  canning is a method of preserving food in which the food contents are processed and sealed in an airtight container canning was developed around 1810 by nicolas appert in paris it revolutionized food preservation
blanching  also known as parboiling blanching is the method by which foods are partially cooked as a way to preserve their color texture and flavor
antoine-henri becquerel 18521908 is known for his discovery of radioactivity in 1895 for which he received the 1903 nobel prize for physics jointly with marie curie and pierre curie x-rays were also discovered in 1895 by wk roentgen ionizing radiation was found to be lethal to living organisms soon after these discoveries the idea of using ionizing radiation in food preservation almost immediately followed the suggestion to use ionizing energy to destroy pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in food was published in a german medical journal the same year however the cost and quantity of this radiation inhibited commercial development until much much later the basic history of food irradiation follows51905  scientists receive patents for a food preservative process that uses ionizing radiation to kill bacteria in food1921  us patent is granted for a process to kill trichinella spiral in meat by using x-ray technology19531980  the us government forms the national food irradiation program under this program the us army and the atomic energy commission sponsor many research projects on food irradiation the us armys interest is feeding soldiers during wartime1958  the food drug and cosmetic act is amended and defines sources of radiation intended for use in processing food as a new food additive the act is administered by food and drug administration fda1963  fda approves irradiation to control insects in wheat and flour1964  fda approves irradiation to inhibit sprouting in white potatoes19641968  the us army and the atomic energy commission petition fda to approve the irradiation of several packaging materials1966  the us army and us department of agriculture usda petition fda to approve the irradiation of ham1971  fda approves the irradiation of several packaging materials based in the 196468 petitions by the us army and the atomic energy commission1976  the us army contracts with commercial companies to study the wholesomeness of irradiated ham pork and chicken1980  usda inherits the us armys food irradiation program1985  fda approves irradiation at specific doses to control trichinella spiral is in pork fda approves irradiation at specific doses to delay maturation inhibit growth and disinfect foods including vegetables and spices the federal meat inspection act is amended to permit gamma radiation to control trichinella spiral is in fresh or previously frozen pork law is administered by usda1990  fda approves irradiation for poultry to control salmonella and other food-borne bacteria1992  usda approves irradiation for poultry to control salmonella and other food-borne bacteria1997  fdas regulations are amended to permit ionizing radiation to treat refrigerated or frozen uncooked meat meat by-products and certain food products to control food-borne pathogens and to extend shelf life2000  usdas regulations are amended to allow the irradiation of refrigerated and frozen uncooked meat meat by-products and certain other meat food products to reduce the levels of food-borne pathogens and to extend shelf life fdas regulations are amended to permit the irradiation of fresh shell eggs to control salmonella
the radiation dose for food irradiation and sterilization generally is measured using the conventional unit rad or the si unit gray gy the rad which stands for radiation absorbed dose was the conventional unit of measurement but it has recently been replaced by the gy 1 gy is equal to 100 rad the prefix kilo k for 1000 is commonly used with the gray unit kgy mega m for 1000000 is often used with the rad unit mrad this is summarized in table 14
there are other radiation measures curie ci becquerel bq roentgen r coulombkg ckg the rem rem and sievert sv however these are used for other purposeselectron beam irradiation is sometimes referred to as beta irradiation beta particles are high-energy high-speed electrons or positrons emitted by certain types of radioactive nuclei such as potassium-40 beta particles are subatomic particles ejected from the nucleus of some radioactive atoms they are equivalent to electrons the difference is that beta particles originate in the nucleus and electrons originate outside the nucleuselectron beam radiation breaks the dna or damages other critical molecules in bacteria either killing them or preventing them from reproducingthe procedure for electron beam irradiation is relatively simple in practice a continuous process is used to improve the economics of the process the source of electron beams is an accelerator the accelerator converts electricity through a tungsten filament sourceaccelerators generate and accelerate electrons and direct them toward the food product needing irradiation an accelerator see fig 111
 consists of four major systems1voltage generator2acceleration tube and electron gun3scan chamber and scan horn4a control system
each segment plays a key role and is briefly described low voltage power typically three-phase 440 v ac is converted to high-frequency 100 khz radio frequency rf power by an oscillator a number of rectifiers in series along with an rf resonant transformer convert the rf power into ultra high voltage 25 mm v direct current dc power the dc voltage is sent to the acceleration tube this tube is a hollow vacuum cylinder made from glass and metal glass rings are positioned as insulation rings in between metal rings called dynodes an electron gun is positioned at the entry point of the tube a tungsten filament is the source of electrons that are emitted by heating the filament the continuous electron stream is accelerated through a vacuum tube supplying a high-energy beam with a diameter of 23 cm the accelerated beam is transmitted through an oscillating magnetic field with a frequency of 200 hz that converts the tight beam cone into a wide curtain of electrons with a width of 125 m a thin titanium window acts as a window or a filter before the beam reaches the food to be irradiated a control system monitors all the functions of the various systems of accelerator to insure proper and consistent operationan accelerator operates based on a number of factors including voltage electron energy beam current and beam power because electrons have mass they can only penetrate about 15 inches 38 cm into a typical food product or about 35 inches 89 cm if the food product is irradiated on both sides electrons also have an electric charge this charge allows the stream of accelerated electrons to be scanned by magnets to track across the product a commercial food electron beam irradiator accelerates the electrons to an energy of up to 10000000 electron volts 10 million electron volts mev electron beam irradiators typically use massive concrete steel or lead shielding electron beam accelerators can be turned on and off safety interlocks ensure that a person cannot enter the radiation chamber where the food is being irradiated when the accelerator is on product is usually passed through the scanned beam on roller-type conveyors as shown in fig 112
 a picture of the electron beam scan horn and conveyor system in the irradiation area is shown in fig 113
gamma radiation signified by the greek letter  is one of the three types of natural radioactivity gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation like x-rays except even more energetic they have enough energy to ionize matter and can damage or destroy living cells which is of course why they are useful for sterilization the source of gamma rays in a gamma irradiator is cobalt-60 cobalt-60 radioactively beta decays to nickel-60 and emits two gamma rays with energies of 117 and 133 mev6
cobalt-60 is not found in nature it is a synthetic radioactive isotope made by neutron activation of cobalt-59 cobalt-60 is produced off site in nuclear reactors and transported in special shipping containers casks to the sterilization facility cobalt-60 is a solid radioactive metal molded into a cylindrical slug as shown in fig 114
 the slugs are loaded into sealed source pencils made of stainless steel the stainless steel sealed source contains the radioactive cobalt-60 but allows the gamma photons radiation to pass through the steel the pencils are arranged into flat panel arrays cobalt-60 continuously emits radiation and cannot be turned off the arrays are stored in a deep water pool which prevents gamma radiation from escaping the shielding water does not become radioactivelarge-scale gamma irradiators come in two configurations in one configuration the cobalt arrays are hoisted out of the water into a radiation chamber that typically has shields made out of massive concrete or steel this is shown in fig 115
 the concrete walls are typically 2-feet thick or more when the irradiators are out of the protective storage pool all workers are outside the thick walls hanging carriers totes or roller conveyors are typically employed to move the product through the chamber for irradiation a typical product container can be 60 cm  50 cm  150 cm and some irradiators are designed to irradiate entire pallets of product measuring 120 cm  100 cm  150 cm because cobalt-60 photons have no mass they can penetrate more than 24 inches 60 cm of food product if irradiated on both sidesin the second configuration unlike a radiation chamber irradiator an underwater irradiator stores the cobalt-60 permanently at the bottom of a pool of water instead of raising the cobalt-60 into a shielded chamber the product placed in water-free containers is lowered to the bottom of the pool adjacent to the cobalt-60 to receive a dose of radiation no above-ground shielding or radiation chamber is present typically the product is loaded into water-free containers and the containers are loweredraised using a hoist mechanismx-rays are photons and have similar properties to gamma rays emitted by cobalt-60 however x-rays are generated by using an electron beam accelerator and converting the electron beam up to 75 mev to photons by accelerating the electrons into a high-density material such as tungsten steel or tantalum the sudden deceleration of the electrons generates x-rays and waste heat the shielding and product conveyance are similar to that of a chamber-type gamma irradiator fig 115 the advantages of x-rays over electron beams are that they have good product penetration over 24 inches or 60 cm of food product if irradiated on both sides the advantage of x-rays over gamma irradiators is that they do not require a shielding storage pool however there is a substantial loss of energy during the conversion process thus it suffers a severe cost disadvantage when compared to other types of irradiators for the same product volume throughput for food irradiation x-ray machines can have a maximum energy of 5 mevultraviolet uv is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum between visible light and x-rays the uv spectrum can be broken down into four parts as shown in table 15
 the specific portion of the uv spectrum between 185 and 400 nm also known as uv-c has a strong germicidal effect with peak effectiveness at 265 nm at these wavelengths uv kills microorganisms by penetrating their cell membranes and damaging the dna or rna making them unable to reproduce and effectively killing them
ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi is a sterilization method that uses uv light it is used in a variety of applications such as food air and water purification it is effective in destroying the nucleic acids in these organisms so that their dna is disrupted by the uv radiation this removes their reproductive capabilities and kills themthe application of uvgi to sterilization has been an accepted practice since the mid-twentieth century it has been used primarily in medical sanitation and sterile work facilities figure 116
shows the use of uv irradiation in a laboratory uvgi technology is particularly suited to the beverage bottled water and food processing sectors the design of these systems is simple as shown in fig 117
 uvgi disinfection has many advantages over alternative methods unlike chemical biocides uvgi does not introduce toxins or residues into the process which themselves have to be subsequently removed and does not alter the chemical composition taste odor or ph of the productuvgi is employed to sterilize drinking and wastewater as the holding facilities are enclosed and can be circulated to ensure a higher exposure to the uv uv sterilizers are commonly used in aquarium circulation systems and hot tub circulation systems in recent years uvgi has found renewed application in air sanitization
mode of action uv photons of different energies have various effects on dna the most important damage to dna is the formation of pyrimidine dimers which form between two adjacent pyrimidine basescytosine c andor thymine t as shown in fig 118
 this abnormal link distorts the shape of the dna double helix and blocks its copying by the dna replication or rna transcription machinery a block in either of these important processes would be very dangerous for a cell as little as one dimer per cell in fact can be lethal dimers are formed in dna most efficiently by uv-c less efficiently by uv-b and very little by uv-a action the chemical structural changes are shown in fig 119
 uv-a light creates mostly free radicals that lead to indirect dna damage7
microwave sterilization8 is primarily a thermal process the heat is generated as microwaves interact with polar water molecules and charged ions the water molecules align rapidly in alternating the electromagnetic field induced by the microwaves the friction resulting from the oscillating molecules generates the heat within food the temperature achieved is limited to about that of boiling water unless the food is being held under pressure because the heat is produced directly in the food the thermal processing time is sharply reduced compared to processes applying external heat the food is not necessarily cooked because the times are short for commercial food applications this is a developing technology the microwave sterilization technology developed at washington state university uses the combination of 915 mhz microwave and conventional heating to improve heating uniformity commercial systems performing microwave pasteurization andor sterilization of foods are currently available in europe9 eg tops foods however the use of microwaves in the united states to produce prepackaged shelf-stable foods is pending upon fda acceptanceconsumers have been able to use their microwaves to sterilize baby bottles in time as short as 90 s one such unit is shown in fig 120
 steam from boiling water does the sterilizing
mode of action the mechanism of germicidal action is essentially heating other possible nonthermal mechanisms have been proposed one of these is electroporation cell membrane damage and rupture and direct electromagnetic energy coupling leading to cell lysis the destruction of cells by disruption of the bounding membrane allowing the cell contents to escape however scientific support for these mechanisms is not entirely convincingir heating can be used to inactivate bacteria spores yeast and mold in both liquid and solid foods efficacy of microbial inactivation by ir heating depends on several parameters includingir power leveltemperature of food samplepeak wavelength of ir radiationbandwidth of ir heating source
sample depthtypes of microorganismsmoisture contenttypes of food materials
inactivation mechanism by ir heating may include dna damage in addition to thermal effect thermal inactivation can damage dna rna ribosome cell envelope and proteins in microbial cellsradiation breaks the dna or damages other critical molecules in bacteria either killing them or preventing them from reproducing irradiation is a process that employs ionizing energy radiation energy ionizes a very small number of the molecules within the food product and any bacteria within the food product when a molecule is ionized it effectively breaks if a dna molecule of a bacterium is ionized it is damaged or destroyed preventing the bacteria from being able to reproduceif a water molecule within a bacterium cell is ionized it can form peroxide and act as a disinfectant within the bacterium itself this is covered later in this chapter these molecular level changes destroy the bacteria by preventing their reproduction only a very small fraction of the molecules within a living organism such as a bacterium need to be damaged to have this effect because only a small fraction of food product molecules are ionized minimal adverse effects such as changes in taste occurradiation dose is the quantity of radiation energy absorbed by the food as it passes through the radiation field during processing international health and safety authorities have endorsed the safety of irradiation for all foods up to a dose level of 10000 gy 10 kgy the bactericidal efficacy of a given dose of irradiation depends on the following10the kind and species of the organism a few are listed in table 16
the numbers of organisms or spores originally present the more organisms there are the less effective a given dose will bethe composition of the food some constituents may be protective compounds that combine with the sh groups would be sensitizingthe presence or absence of oxygen the effect of free oxygen varies with the organism ranging from no effect to sensitization of the organism undesirable side reactions are likely to be intensified in the presence of oxygen and to be less frequent in a vacuum
the physical state of the food during irradiation both moisture content and temperature affect different organisms in different waysthe condition of the organisms age temperature of growth and sporulation and state vegetative or spore may affect the sensitivity of the organisms
the success of radiation processing of food depends to a large extent on the ability of the irradiation processorto measure the absorbed dose delivered to the food product through reliable dosimetryto determine the dose distribution patterns in the product package through process qualification proceduresto control the routine radiation process through process control procedures
this subject is well documented in the literature and will not be discussed further here11
medical sterilization is a much broader field than food irradiation three terms are often used when talking about this subject and they are sterilization disinfection and asepsis sterility and asepsis refer to different conditions sterility indicates the elimination death of all viable life forms and their germinative elements such as eggs spores and endospores sterility is absolute there is no such thing as an object being partially sterile asepsis generally means that only certain types of life forms have been removed excluded or neutralized rendered nonviable while the presence of other organisms may be tolerated or even promoted for example pasteurization of food does not kill all microorganisms in the food it does dramatically reduce the number of microorganisms with the intent that the pasteurized material is stored in conditions that will maintain that low number such as refrigeration disinfection refers to a process whereby many or all pathogenic microorganisms are neutralized or removed unlike sterilization disinfection can be achieved at varying levels as defined by the cdchigh-level disinfectants are chemical sterilants that may be used for a shorter exposure period than would be required for sterilization to kill all microorganisms with the exception of high numbers of bacterial sporesintermediate-level disinfectants will kill mycobacteria causes of tuberculosis and leprosy vegetative bacteria most viruses such as poliovirus and most fungi but do not kill all bacterial sporeslow-level disinfectants kill most vegetative bacteria some fungi and some viruses such as staphylococcus species pseudomonas species salmonella species hiv virus herpes simplex virus hepatitis b hepatitis c and many common cold viruses
there are hundreds of items that are routinely sterilized or disinfected in terms of health caremedical items they are often classified by spauldings classification critical semi-critical and noncritical as shown in table 17
disinfection and sterilization are both decontamination processes while disinfection is the process of eliminating or reducing harmful microorganisms from inanimate objects and surfaces sterilization is the process of killing all microorganisms sterilization also destroys the spores of various organisms present on surfaces in liquids in medication or in compounds such as biological culture media such extreme forms of decontamination are needed during critical times like surgery or in environments like industrial laboratory or hospital it is more practical to use disinfection in everyday lifedisinfection is usually carried out using chemicals often solutions but also vapors and gases when chemicals are used to destroy all forms of microbiologic life they can be called chemical sterilants these same germicides used for shorter exposure periods also can be part of the disinfection process ie high-level disinfectionsterilization falls into the following three basic categories of which there are several options in each category1high temperaturepressure sterilization autoclave2chemical sterilization3radiation sterilization
each of these and several less common methods are discussed in later sectionsthe steam autoclave is the oldest safest most widely used and most cost-effective method of sterilization in the medical equipment industry steam is generated in a pressure chamber so that it reaches a temperature 121148 c 250300 f at 15 psi the time items are kept exposed is dependent on the temperature and size of load and usually ranges from 10 to 60 min there are two main types of steam autoclaves gravity displacement and pre-vacuum cyclegravity displacement autoclaves remove air from the chamber by gravity displacement as steam-entering chamber near the top exerts pressure on air forcing it out of the bottom as shown in fig 121
 a photo of an industrial-size steam autoclave is shown in fig 122
the high-speed pre-vacuum sterilizers are similar to the gravity displacement sterilizers except they are fitted with a vacuum pump or ejector to ensure air removal from the sterilizing chamber and load before the steam is admitted the advantage of using a vacuum pump is that there is nearly instantaneous steam penetration even into porous loads
table 18
summarizes the processing parameters for each cycle of the two types of steam autoclaveslike all sterilization processes steam sterilization may have some damaging effects on some materials at constant temperatures sterilization times vary depending on the type of item eg metal versus rubber plastic items with lumens whether the item is wrapped or unwrapped and the sterilizer type
mode of action moist heat destroys microorganisms by the irreversible coagulation and denaturation of enzymes and structural proteins in support of this fact it has been found that the presence of moisture significantly affects the coagulation temperature of proteins and the temperature at which microorganisms are destroyed

uses steam sterilization is used whenever possible on all critical and semi-critical items that are heat and moisture resistant eg steam sterilizable respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment even when not essential to prevent pathogen transmission steam sterilizers also are used in health care facilities to decontaminate microbiological waste and sharps containers but additional exposure time is required in the gravity displacement sterilizer for these items steam sterilizers are common in dental facilitiesadvantagesnontoxic to patient staff environmentcycle easy to control and monitorrapidly microbicidalleast affected by organicinorganic soils among sterilization processes listedrapid cycle timepenetrates medical packing device lumens
disadvantagesdeleterious for heat-sensitive instrumentsmicrosurgical instruments damaged by repeated exposure can corrode surgical alloys and cutting edgesdevelopment of pitting and dulling of the cutting edges after multiple steam sterilization cyclesmay leave instruments wet causing them to rustpotential for burns
flash sterilization is often called immediate-use steam sterilization12 immediate use is broadly defined as the shortest possible time between a sterilized items removal from the sterilizer and its aseptic transfer to the sterile field it is used for sterilizing cleaned patient-care items that cannot be packaged sterilized and stored before use it also is used when there is insufficient time to sterilize an item by the preferred package method flash steam sterilization was originally defined by underwood and perkins as sterilization of an unwrapped object at 132c for 3 min at 2728 lbs of pressure in a gravity displacement sterilizeroften flash sterilization equipment is located very close to operating rooms to handle urgent needs however care must be taken to avoid burns to both the medical staff and the patient burns may be prevented by either air cooling the instruments or immersion in a sterile liquid such as saline
uses flash sterilization should not be used for reasons of convenience it is not recommended for implantable devices except where unavoidabledry heat is effective at inactivating microorganisms but in general the temperatures required are higher than is required for steam sterilization to achieve an equivalent level of germicidal action this method should be used only for materials that might be damaged by moist heat or that are impenetrable to moist heat eg powders petroleum products sharp instrumentsthere are two types of dry heat sterilizers the static-air type and the forced-air type the differences are like two types of ovens common in everyday home kitchens the static type is like a conventional oven and the forced-air type is like a convection oven the static-air type has heating coils in the bottom of the unit cause the hot air to rise inside the chamber via convection this type of dry heat sterilizer is much slower in heating requires longer time to reach sterilizing temperature and is less uniform in temperature control throughout the chamber than is the forced-air type the forced-air or mechanical convection sterilizer is equipped with a motor-driven blower that circulates heated air throughout the chamber at a high velocity permitting a more rapid transfer of energy from the air to the instrumentscommon timetemperature relationships for sterilization with hot air sterilizers are170 c 340 f for 60 min160 c 320 f for 120 min150 c 300 f for 150 min
the advantages for dry heat includeit is nontoxicdoes not harm the environmenteasy to installrelatively low operating costsit penetrates materialsit is noncorrosive for metal
the main disadvantage is time dry heat penetration and microbial killing is time consuming by this method in addition the high temperatures are not suitable for most materials
mode of action the primary lethal process is considered to be oxidation of cell constituentsglass bead sterilization uses small glass beads 1215 mm diameter and high temperature 217232 c for brief exposure times eg 45 s to inactivate microorganisms they are typically used on metal surgical instruments as shown in fig 123
 these devices have been used for several years in the dental profession fda believes there is a risk of infection with this device because of potential failure to sterilize dental instruments and their use should be discontinued until the device has received fda clearancemicrowaves are used in medicine for disinfection of soft contact lenses dental instruments dentures milk and urinary catheters for intermittent self-catheterization however microwaves must only be used with products that are compatible eg do not melt microwaves are radio frequency waves which are usually used at a frequency of 2450 mhz the microwaves produce friction of water molecules in an alternating electrical field the intermolecular friction derived from the vibrations generates heat and some authors believe that the effect of microwaves depends on the heat produced while others postulate a nonthermal lethal effect the initial reports showed microwaves to be an effective microbicide the microwaves produced by a home-type microwave oven 245 ghz completely inactivate bacterial cultures mycobacteria viruses and geobacillus stearothermophilus spores within 60 s to 5 min depending on the organism another study confirmed these results but also found that higher power microwaves in the presence of water may be needed for sterilization microwaves used for sterilization of medical devices have not been fda clearedan ir radiation prototype sterilizer was investigated and found to destroy bacillus atrophaeus spores ir heating can be effectively used for enzyme inactivation ir heating can be used to inactivate bacteria spores yeast and mold in both liquid and solid foods efficacy of microbial inactivation by ir heating depends on the following parameters ir power level temperature of food sample peak wavelength bandwidth of ir heating source sample depth types of microorganisms moisture content and types of food materials13 some of the possible advantages of ir technology include short cycle time low energy consumption no cycle residuals and no toxicological or environmental effects this may provide an alternative technology for sterilization of selected heat-resistant instruments but there are no fda-cleared systems for use in health care facilities
in the health care setting alcohol refers to two water-soluble chemical compoundsethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol fda has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or high-level disinfectant with alcohol as the main active ingredient these alcohols are rapidly bactericidal against vegetative forms of bacteria fungicidal an agent that destroys fungi and virucidal capable of neutralizing or destroying a virus alcohols do not destroy bacterial spores their cidal activity drops sharply when diluted below 50 concentration and the optimum bactericidal concentration is 6090 solution in water volumevolume
mode of action the most feasible explanation for the antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins protein shape is critical to performance of the protein that shape is maintained by intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding see section 281 an example is shown in fig 125
which shows the hydrogen bonding between two amino acids
microbiocidal activity methyl alcohol methanol has the weakest bactericidal action of the alcohols and thus seldom is used in health care the bactericidal activity of various concentrations of ethyl alcohol ethanol and isopropanol ranges from 10 s to hours depending on the microorganism
uses a 70 alcohol solution is used as a disinfectant on the skin this concentration of alcohol is able to penetrate the bacterial cell wall and denature the proteins and enzymes inside of the cell a 95 alcohol solution merely coagulates the protein on the outside of the cell wall and prevents any alcohol from entering the cell alcohols are not recommended for sterilizing medical and surgical materials principally because they lack sporicidal action and they cannot penetrate protein-rich materials alcohols have been used effectively to disinfect oral and rectal thermometers hospital pagers scissors and stethoscopes alcohol towelettes have been used to disinfect small surfaces such as rubber stoppers of multiple-dose medication vials or vaccine bottles furthermore alcohol occasionally is used to disinfect external surfaces of equipment eg stethoscopes ventilators and manual ventilation bags cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr manikins ultrasound instruments or medication preparation areas alcohols may damage coatings plastics and elastomershypochlorites the most widely used of the chlorine disinfectants are available as liquid household bleach sodium hypochlorite or solid common pool chlorine calcium hypochlorite the hypochlorite ion also known as chlorate i anion is clo household bleach is an aqueous solution of 525615 sodium hypochloritehypochlorites have a broad-spectrum of antimicrobial activity they do not leave toxic residues are unaffected by water hardness are inexpensive and fast acting they remove dried or fixed organisms and biofilms from surfaces and have a low incidence of serious toxicityone danger is the release of toxic chlorine gas when mixed with ammonia or acid eg household cleaning agents the microbicidal activity of chlorine is attributed largely to undissociated hypochlorous acid hocl the dissociation of hocl to the less microbicidal form hypochlorite ion ocl depends on ph the disinfecting efficacy of chlorine decreases with an increase in ph that parallels the conversion of undissociated hocl to oclchlorine dioxide cd clo2 is greenish yellow and is an oxidizing agent with a chlorine-like odor clo2 is effective against bacteria yeasts molds and viruses the rapid sterilizing activity of clo2 is present at ambient temperature and at relatively low gas concentration 130 mgltraditionally chlorine dioxide for disinfection applications is made where it is to be used by one of three methods using sodium chlorite or the sodium chloritehypochlorite method2naclo22hclnaocl2clo23naclh2oor the sodium chloritehydrochloric acid method5naclo24hcl5nacl4clo22h2o

mode of action chlorine dioxide acts as an oxidizing agent and reacts with several cellular constituents including the cell membrane of microbes the potency of chlorine dioxide is attributable to the simultaneous oxidative attack on many proteins thereby preventing the cells from mutating to a resistant form
uses drinking water poultry process water swimming pools and mouthwash preparations it is used to sanitize fruit and vegetables as well as equipment for food and beverage processing it is used in the life sciences industry to decontaminate animal research facilities it is also employed in the health care industries to decontaminate rooms pass-throughs isolators and also as a sterilant for product and component sterilizationsodium dichloroisocyanurate is used as a disinfectant in water its structure is shown in fig 126
 it is considered to be a halogen donor a chemical that releases active chlorine after release the halogen reaction is similar to that of chlorine or bromine from other sources chlorine donor chemicals do not release the active chlorine all at once but make it slowly availablechloramine-t the structure of which is shown in fig 127
 is available in tablet or powder form and has to be dissolved before use it is sprayed on a surface and allowed to stand for at least 15 min before being wiped off or allowed to dry
mode of action the molecular structure of chloramine-t is similar to para-aminobenzoic acid which is an intermediate in bacterial metabolism chloramine-t disrupts bacterial metabolism inhibiting growth the hypochlorite moiety can destroy the dna structure via oxidation and thereby prevents microbes from reproducingsuperoxidized water has been examined as a disinfectant the concept of electrolyzing saline to create a disinfectant or antiseptics is appealing because the basic materials of saline and electricity are inexpensive and the end product ie water does not damage the environment17 the main products of the electrolysis are hypochlorous acid eg at a concentration of about 144 mgl and chlorine as with any germicide the antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water is strongly affected by the concentration of the active ingredient available free chlorine one manufacturer puricore generates the disinfectant at the point of use by passing a saline solution over coated titanium electrodes at 9 amps the product generated has a ph of 5065 and an oxidationreduction potential redox of 950 mv although superoxidized water is intended to be generated fresh at the point of use when tested under clean conditions the disinfectant was effective within 5 min when 48 h old unfortunately the equipment required to produce the product can be expensive because parameters such as ph current and redox potential must be closely monitored the solution is nontoxic to biologic tissuesin october 2002 the fda cleared superoxidized water as a high-level disinfectant fda personal communication september 18 2002
mode of action the exact mechanism by which free chlorine destroys microorganisms has not been elucidated inactivation by chlorine can result from a number of factors oxidation of sulfhydryl enzymes and amino acids ring chlorination of amino acids loss of intracellular contents decreased uptake of nutrients inhibition of protein synthesis decreased oxygen uptake oxidation of respiratory components decreased adenosine triphosphate production breaks in dna and depressed dna synthesis the actual microbicidal mechanism of chlorine might involve a combination of these factors or the effect of chlorine on critical sites
uses hypochlorites are widely used in health care facilities in a variety of settingsformaldehyde is used as a disinfectant and sterilant in both its liquid and gaseous states the gaseous method is discussed in a later section of this chapter formaldehyde is sold and used principally as a water-based solution called formalin which is 37 formaldehyde by weight the aqueous solution is a bactericide tuberculocide fungicide virucide and sporicide
mode of action formaldehyde is an extremely reactive chemical that interacts with proteins dna and rnaformaldehyde inactivates microorganisms by alkylating the amino nh2 and sulfhydral sh groups of proteins and ring nitrogen atoms of purine bases this is shown in fig 128
 the interaction with protein results from a combination with the primary amide as well as with the amino groups formaldehyde acts as an alkylating agent by reaction with carboxyl co sulfhydryl -sh and hydroxyl -oh groups formaldehyde also reacts extensively with nucleic acid two of the four bases in nucleic acids adenine2 and guanine3 are purines in dna these bases form hydrogen bonds with their complementary pyrimidines thymine and cytosine respectively this is called complementary base pairing in rna the complement of adenine is uracil instead of thymine
uses although formaldehydealcohol is a chemical sterilant and formaldehyde is a high-level disinfectant the health care uses of formaldehyde are limited by its irritating fumes and its pungent odor even at very low levels 1 ppm it is also a suspected human carcinogen linked to leukemia nasopharyngeal and lung cancers formaldehyde is used in the health care setting to prepare viral vaccines eg poliovirus and influenza as an embalming agent and to preserve anatomic specimens and historically has been used to sterilize surgical instruments especially when mixed with ethanolglutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant its chemical structure is shown in fig 129
 aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde are acidic and generally in this state are not sporicidal only when the solution is activated made alkaline by use of alkalinating agents to ph 7585 does the solution become sporicidal once activated these solutions have a shelf life of minimally 14 days because of the polymerization of the glutaraldehyde molecules at alkaline ph levels this polymerization blocks the active sites aldehyde groups of the glutaraldehyde molecules that are responsible for its biocidal activity
mode of action like formaldehyde the biocidal activity of glutaraldehyde results from its alkylation of sulfhydryl hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups of microorganisms which alters rna dna and protein synthesis
uses glutaraldehyde is used most commonly as a high-level disinfectant for medical equipment such as endoscopes spirometry tubing dialyzers transducers anesthesia and respiratory therapy equipment hemodialysis proportioning and dialysate delivery systems and reuse of laparoscopic disposable plastic trocars glutaraldehyde is noncorrosive to metal and does not damage lenses in instruments rubber or plasticsadvantagesnumerous use studies publishedrelatively inexpensiveexcellent materials compatibility

good germicidal activity has been ascribed to hydrogen peroxide it has bactericidal virucidal sporicidal and fungicidal properties the fda website lists cleared liquid chemical sterilants and high-level disinfectants containing hydrogen peroxide and their cleared contact conditions
mode of action hydrogen peroxide works by producing destructive hydroxyl-free radicals that can attack membrane lipids dna and other essential cell components catalase produced by aerobic organisms and facultative anaerobes that possess cytochrome systems can protect cells from metabolically produced hydrogen peroxide by degrading hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen this defense is overwhelmed by the concentrations used for disinfection it acts on the microorganisms through its release of nascent oxygen hydrogen peroxide produces hydroxyl-free radical that damages proteins and dnaadvantagesno activation requiredmay enhance removal of organic matter and organismsno disposal issuesno odor or irritation issuesdoes not coagulate blood or fix tissues to surfacesinactivates cryptosporidium

iodine solutions or tinctures long have been used by health professionals primarily as antiseptics on skin or tissue iodophors on the other hand have been used both as antiseptics and disinfectants an iodophor is a preparation containing iodine complexed with a solubilizing agent such as a surfactant or povidone the structure of povidoneiodine pvp-i is shown in fig 130
 a well-known pvp-i product is betadine the result is a water-soluble material that releases free iodine when in solution iodine is the active ingredient
mode of action iodine can penetrate the cell wall of microorganisms quickly and the lethal effects are believed to result from disruption of protein and nucleic acid structure and synthesisfree iodine the active ingredient in pvp-i is rapidly lethal to bacteria fungi viruses and protozoa these microbial effects are the result of cell wall penetration oxidation and substitution of microbial contents with free iodine it has strong oxidizing effects on the functional groups of amino acids and fatty acids particularly the -nh2 and -sh groups of amino acids and the double bonds of fatty acids iodine reaction with these groups leads to rapid damage to bacterial and fungal cells
uses besides their use as an antiseptic iodophors have been used for disinfecting blood culture bottles and medical equipment such as hydrotherapy tanks thermometers and endoscopes iodophors formulated as antiseptics contain less free iodine than do those formulated as disinfectantsortho-phthalaldehyde opa is a high-level disinfectant that received fda clearance in 1999 it contains 055 12-benzenedicarboxaldehyde opa the structure of which is shown in fig 131
 opa solution is a clear pale blue liquid with a ph of 75 one popular commercial formulation is cidex opa19

mode of action preliminary studies on the mode of action of opa suggest that it interacts with amino acids proteins and microorganisms however opa is a less potent cross-linking agent that glutaraldehyde however the lipophilic aromatic nature of opa allows its uptake through the outer layers of mycobacteria and gram-negative bacteria opa appears to kill spores by blocking the spore germination process

peracetic or peroxyacetic acid paa see fig 132
 is characterized by rapid action against all microorganisms the sterilant 35 peracetic acid and an anticorrosive agent are supplied in a single-dose container special advantages of peracetic acid are that it lacks harmful decomposition products ie acetic acid water oxygen hydrogen peroxide enhances removal of organic material and leaves no residue it remains effective in the presence of organic matter and is sporicidal even at low-temperatures it is considered unstable particularly when diluted for example a 1 solution loses half its strength through hydrolysis in 6 days whereas 40 peracetic acid loses 12 of its active ingredients per month one of the common formulations is envirotechs perasan
mode of action little is known about the mechanism of action of peracetic acid but it is believed to function similarly to other oxidizing agentsthat is it denatures proteins disrupts the cell wall permeability and oxidizes sulfhydryl and sulfur bonds in proteins enzymes and other metabolitesadvantagesrapid sterilization cycle time 3045 minlow-temperature 5055 c liquid immersion sterilizationenvironmental friendly by-products acetic acid o2 h2ofully automatedsingle-use system eliminates need for concentration testingstandardized cyclemay enhance removal of organic material and endotoxinno adverse health effects to operators under normal operating conditionscompatible with many materials and instrumentsdoes not coagulate blood or fix tissues to surfacessterilant flows through scope facilitating salt protein and microbe removalrapidly sporicidalprovides procedure standardization constant dilution perfusion of channel temperatures exposurepaa breaks down in food to safe and environmentally friendly residues acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide and therefore can be used in nonrinse applications

disadvantagesmaterials compatibility concerns lead brass copper zinc both cosmetic and functionallimited clinical experiencepotential for eye and skin damage
phenol is probably the oldest known disinfectant as it was first used by lister when it was called carbolic acid however there are many phenol-based materials used as disinfectants phenol derivatives originate when a functional group eg alkyl phenyl benzyl halogen replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring
o-phenylphenol is often used instead of phenol since it is somewhat less corrosive the primary use of 2-phenylphenol is as an agricultural fungicide it is generally applied postharvest it is a fungicide used for waxing citrus fruitschloroxylenol 4-chloro-35-dimethylphenol is the principal ingredient in dettol a household disinfectant and antiseptichexachlorophene also known as nabac is a phenolic that was once used as a germicidal additive to some household products but was banned due to suspected harmful effectsthymol derived from the herb thyme is the active ingredient in some broad-spectrum disinfectants that bear ecological claims this antibacterial activity is caused by inhibiting growth and lactate production and by decreasing cellular glucose uptakeamylmetacresol is found in strepsils a throat disinfectant
the chemical structures of these materials are shown in fig 133
the antimicrobial properties of these compounds and many other phenol derivatives are much improved over those of the parent chemical phenolics are absorbed by porous materials and the residual disinfectant can irritate tissue
mode of action in high concentrations phenol acts as a gross protoplasmic poison penetrating and disrupting the cell wall and precipitating the cell proteins low concentrations of phenol and higher molecular weight phenol derivatives cause bacterial death by inactivation of essential enzyme systems and leakage of essential metabolites from the cell wall phenolics generally have poor effectiveness against endospores
uses many phenolic germicides are epa registered as disinfectants for use on environmental surfaces eg bedside tables bedrails and laboratory surfaces and noncritical medical devices phenolics are not fda cleared as high-level disinfectants for use with semi-critical items but could be used to preclean or decontaminate critical and semi-critical devices before terminal sterilization or high-level disinfectionquaternary ammonium compounds quats such as benzalkonium chloride see fig 134
for the chemical structure are a large group of related compounds some concentrated formulations have been shown to be effective low-level disinfectants typically quats do not exhibit efficacy against difficult-to-kill nonenveloped viruses such as norovirus rotavirus or poliovirus newer synergous low-alcohol formulations are highly effective broad-spectrum disinfectants with quick contact times 35 min against bacteria enveloped viruses pathogenic fungi and myco-bacteriathe quaternary ammonium compounds are widely used as disinfectants some of the chemical names of quaternary ammonium compounds used in health care are alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride alkyl didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride the newer quaternary ammonium compounds ie fourth generation referred to as twin-chain or dialkyl quaternaries eg didecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide and dioctyl dimethyl ammonium bromide purportedly remain active in hard water and are tolerant of anionic residues
mode of action the bactericidal action of the quaternaries has been attributed to the inactivation of energy-producing enzymes denaturation of essential cell proteins and disruption of the cell membrane evidence exists that supports these and other possibilities the mechanism of bactericidalmicrobicidal action is thought to be due to disruption of intermolecular interactions quaternary ammonium compounds are not effective against endospores
uses the quaternaries commonly are used in ordinary environmental sanitation of noncritical surfaces such as floors furniture and walls epa-registered quaternary ammonium compounds are appropriate to use for disinfecting medical equipment that contacts intact skin eg blood pressure cuffssurfacine development company has introduced surfacine a persistent antimicrobial agent that may be used on animate or inanimate surfaces it incorporates a water-insoluble antimicrobial-drug compound silver iodide incorporated in a surface-immobilized coating a modified polyhexamethylene biguanide microbial contact with the surface results in transfer of the silver directly from the coating to the organism microorganisms contacting the coating accumulate silver until the toxicity threshold is exceeded dead microorganisms eventually lyse and detach from the surfaceadvantages it is persistent and has demonstrated vancomycin-resistant enterococcus species methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile20
biofilm was mentioned in 11 12 of this chapter studies have shown that routine biocides such as chlorine quats peracetic acid chlorine dioxide and other oxidizers are ineffective against bacteria that live in biofilm while these agents may be able to kill free-swimming pathogens these dangerous bacteria will inevitably form biofilms and become resistant to conventional treatment methodsfirst products need to go through a preconditioning phase to make microorganisms grow the batch load goes through a dwell time under a controlled environment of temperature and humidity this is often done in an environmentally controlled room this part of the process insures the sterilization process will be reproduciblethen the load goes through a long and complex sterilization cycle requirements of such a system areaccurate temperature controlaccurate pressure and vacuum control
the sterilization phases are1initial vacuum phase air must be removed or purged from the sterilization chamber because mixtures of eto and air can be explosive for those items that can withstand very low pressure a vacuum is drawn on the chamber at a controlled rate being that many of the items being sterilized are inside a package a slow evacuation rate is used when that packaging is not very permeable to the components in air for those devices components and packaging that are not designed to withstand deep vacuums andor high pressures a different approach to air remove is done a shallow vacuum with nitrogen gas purge is used an initial shallow vacuum is drawn followed by a nitrogen injection the combination of the vacuum and nitrogen injection is called a nitrogen wash the nitrogen wash is repeated several times to assure an adequate removal of air from the vessel2humidification  when the initial evacuation phase of the process is performed the product can lose a significant amount of moisture moisture is required for the eto to sterilize properly the lost moisture must be replaced prior to introducing the ethylene oxide this is accomplished by adding humidity in the form of steam injections the amount of steam required is calculated to yield a predetermined relative humidity after the addition of steam the product is allowed to dwell or soak for the amount of time required to replace the moisture lost from the evacuation phase3liquid ethylene oxide is first heated into a gaseous phase and then injected into the chamber it is often diluted with a carrier gas such as freon hydrochlorofluorocarbon hcfc common dilutions are 86 eto914 hcfc 10 eto90 hcfc and 85 eto915 co2 the amount of gas or gas concentration is dependent on two primary factors that are addressed during cycle design but it is usually 4501200 mgl the most important factor is to assure that the minimum gas concentration required to achieve sterility within the product is attained this minimum concentration must be balanced against the second factor which is the maximum amount of gas that can be injected before difficulties arise due to high levels of poststerilization eto residuals eto remaining in the items being sterilized additionally the chamber is kept at a temperature of 3763 c and the relative humidity is 4080 exposure time to eto gas is typically 16 h

4after the eto exposure phase of the process all gas must be removed from the chamber until the levels of eto fall below the flammable limit for the gas 3 or 30000 ppm this is accomplished by performing a series of post-vacuums each followed with a nitrogen backfill wash5after the process removal of residual eto is required this is often done by aeration at elevated temperature depending on the substrate materials can take 812 h or more sometimes this is done in a special room but that may require 7 days if the temperature is around 20 c

mode of action the microbicidal activity of eto is considered to be the result of alkylation of protein dna and rna alkylation or the replacement of a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group within cells prevents normal cellular metabolism and replication ethylene oxide acts more strongly against bacteria especially gram-positive bacteria than against yeast and fungi the disinfectant effect of ethylene oxide is similar to that of sterilization by heat but because of limited penetration it affects only the surface

hydrogen peroxide solutions have been used as chemical sterilants for many years however the vaporized hydrogen peroxide hpv or vhp approach was not developed for the sterilization of medical equipment and spaces until the mid-1980s one method for delivering hpv uses a deep vacuum to pull liquid hydrogen peroxide 3035 concentration from a disposable cartridge through a heated vaporizer and then following vaporization into a sterilization chamber or space a second approach to hpv delivery is the flow-through approach in which the vhp is carried into the sterilization chamber or space by a carrier gas such as air using either a slight negative pressure vacuum or slight positive pressureapplications of this technology include vacuum systems for industrial sterilization of medical devices and atmospheric systems for decontaminating for large and small areas such as laboratory workstations isolation and pass-through rooms and even aircraft interiors vhp offers several appealing features that include rapid cycle time eg 3045 min low-temperature environmentally safe by-products water oxygen good material compatibility and ease of operation installation and monitoring vhp has limitations including that cellulose cannot be processed nylon becomes brittle and vhp penetration capabilities are less than those of eto vhp has not been cleared by fda for sterilization of medical devices in health care facilities
mode of action see section for a discussion on the mode of action of hydrogen peroxidenew sterilization technology based on plasma was patented in 1987 and marketed in the united states in 199321 gas plasmas have been referred to as the fourth state of matter ie liquids solids gases and gas plasmas gas plasmas are generated in an enclosed chamber under deep vacuum using rf or microwave energy to excite the gas molecules and produce charged particles many of which are in the form of free radicals the five stages of the process consist of1vacuum2hydrogen peroxide h2o2 injection3diffusion4plasma5vent
the sterilization chamber is evacuated to 03 mmhg pressure hydrogen peroxide solution is injected from a cassette and is vaporized in the sterilization chamber to a concentration of 6 mgl the hydrogen peroxide vapor diffuses through the chamber for about 50 min and exposes all surfaces and initiates the inactivation of microorganisms at the completion of the diffusion phase the chamber pressure is reduced to 05 torr an electrical field created by an rf is applied to the chamber to create a gas plasma which lasts for 15 min microbicidal free radicals are generated in the plasma the excess gas is removed and in the final stage of the process the sterilization chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure by introduction of high-efficiency filtered air the vapor purged from the chamber is vented to the atmosphere through a catalytic filter to decompose all remaining traces of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen vapor the by-products of the cycle eg water vapor oxygen are nontoxic and eliminate the need for aeration the process operates in the temperature range of 3744 c and has a cycle time of 75 min multiple plasma cycles are sometimes used advanced sterilization products sterrad systems utilize this technology
mode of action gas plasmas generate charged particles and radicals hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl free radicals a free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and is a highly reactive species the proposed mechanism of action of low-temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma is the production of free radicals within a plasma field that are capable of interacting with essential cell components such as enzymes and nucleic acids this disrupts the metabolism of microorganisms
uses materials and devices that cannot tolerate high temperatures and humidity such as some plastics electrical devices and corrosion-susceptible metal alloys can be sterilized by hydrogen peroxide gas plasma this method has been compatible with most 95 medical devices and materials testedadvantagessafe for the environmentleaves no toxic residualscycle time is 2875 min varies with model type and no aeration necessaryused for heat- and moisture-sensitive items since process temperature 50 csimple to operatecompatible with most medical devicesonly requires electrical outlet

paraformaldehyde a solid polymer of formaldehyde can be vaporized by heat for the gaseous decontamination of laminar flow biologic safety cabinets when maintenance work or filter changes require access to the sealed portion of the cabinet this is shown in fig 135

mode of action see 11 12 13low-temperature steam with formaldehyde is used as a low-temperature sterilization method in many countries particularly in scandinavia germany and the united kingdom the process involves the use of formalin aqueous solution of formaldehyde ie 37 by weight which is vaporized into a formaldehyde gas that is admitted into the sterilization chamber a formaldehyde concentration of 816 mgl is generated at an operating temperature of 7075 c the sterilization cycle consists of a series of stages1initial vacuum to remove air from the chamber and load2steam admission to the chamber with the vacuum pump running to purge the chamber of air and to heat the load3followed by a series of pulses of formaldehyde gas4followed by steam5formaldehyde is removed from the sterilizer and load by repeated alternate evacuations and flushing with steam and air

disadvantageseto is more penetrating and operates at lower temperatures than do steamformaldehyde sterilizersformaldehyde is a mutagen and a potential human carcinogen and osha regulates formaldehydethe formaldehyde steam sterilization system has not been fda cleared for use in health care facilities
ozone has been used for years as a drinking water disinfectant ozone is produced when oxygen is energized and split into two monatomic molecules the monatomic oxygen molecules then collide with o2 molecules to form ozone which is o3 the additional oxygen atom makes ozone a powerful oxidant that destroys microorganisms but is highly unstable ie half-life of 22 min at room temperaturea new sterilization process which uses ozone as the sterilant was cleared by fda in august 2003 for processing reusable medical devices the sterilizer introduced by tso3 inc quebec city qc canada creates its own sterilant internally from usp-grade oxygen steam-quality water and electricity the sterilant is converted back to oxygen and water vapor at the end of the cycle by a passing through a catalyst before being exhausted into the roomthe ozone sterilization process uses two identical half-cycles after the chamber is loaded with instruments the door is closed and the cycle begins1a vacuum is created within the chamber2humidification3ozone is then injected into the chamber4the previous steps are repeated5a final ventilation phase is used to remove ozone from the chamber and the packaging within it the residual ozone is catalytically converted to oxygen

disadvantagesseveral metals may not be used
combined hydrogen peroxide and ozone systems have been introduceda gaseous chlorine dioxide system for sterilization of health care products was developed in the late 1980s chlorine dioxide is not mutagenic or carcinogenic in humans the process is1precondition raising of relative humidity levels to between 60 and 75 increased humidity levels are necessary for all spore reduction2condition hold time once relative humidity set point has been reached this is to allow spores to swell and crack due to humidity prior to gas introduction3charge generation and delivery of chlorine dioxide gas4exposure hold time once chlorine dioxide gas concentration set point has been reached5aeration removal of chlorine dioxide gas from chamber

this chapter reviewed briefly dozens of sterilization methods the effect of sterilization processes on plastic materials is important because most food and many medical supplies are already packaged before being processed for microbe elimination packaging is usually made from polymeric plastics if the sterilization processes weaken the plastic films they could affect shelf life and damage lossesthe effect of all these methods on plastics is not covered in the data chapters this is because the effect of many is minimal on the plastic properties the most commonly used processes get the focus in the data chapters appendix a guidelines for component sterilization based on material and process does contain guidelines on the general suitability of many of the processes on various plasticsthe current covid-19 pandemic when the destructive effects of natural or man-made forces overwhelm the ability of a given area or community to meet the demand for health care 1 demands the best disastermass casualty incident mci response during mcis preserving financial and human resources is crucial a good organization and a preventive approach are mandatory in the phase of mci response called mitigation in order to minimize resource exhaustion the use of surgical appliances and staff must be well pondered and balanced 2 surgeons and sub-specialized workers in general are a valuable resource during mci infection or death of sub-specialized staff must be minimized to preserve the ability to face surgical emergencies and associated activities that will continue to occur or perhaps increase during mci in fact any lack of specialized teams occurring during a pandemic cannot be easily addressed by reintegrating retirees or replenishing the ranks with new staff which would also be inevitably associated with a lowered standard of care hence the requirement to skeletonize surgical activities during a pandemic when possible all surgical procedures on all suspected covid-19 patient should be postponed until confirmed infection clearance minimal staff should be involved when deferral is not possible if a large number of senior surgeons is exposed to infected patients the possibility for them to become infected and require self-isolation is real and could potentially result in a dangerous shortage of senior expertise within surgical teams resource usage should be carefully considered when planning scheduled procedures particularly with regard to materials staff devices intensive care beds blood components etc caring for resource-intensive patients might be controversial during mcisthis manuscript is the result of a collaboration between the major italian surgical and anesthesiologic societies acoi sic sicut sico sicg sifipac sice and siaarti we aim to describe recommended clinical pathways for covid-19-positive patients requiring acute non-deferrable surgical caredesignated covid operating areas coa must be allocated to covid patients urgentemergent operating the or closest to the entrance of the theater block entrance should be the first one designated to covid patients when multiple procedures must be simultaneously performed operating rooms must be utilized in order of proximity to the theater block entrance in order to minimize environmental contamination in the theater blockpatient transit to and from the coa must be as quick as possible a pre-defined direct path must be kept as short as possible and away from other patients and people in general within the hospital in order to minimize the chances of infection if inter-hospital patient transfer or transfer from other buildings within the hospital is required a dedicated vehicle should be used transfer personnel should be specifically trained and equipped with ppes the patients compartment in the transport vehicle is ideally kept separate from the driver a biocontainment unit may be utilized if a patient is taken to the coa from any adjacent premise a stretcher might be used for transport all precautionary measures apply to the use of the stretcher and to the personnel responsible for the transfer table 1 fig 1 both during and after transport is completed with immediate sanitization required tables 2 and 3 utilized lifts must be sanitized if any unexpected contamination occurs during transport ie patient vomiting or else adequate dedicated sanitization should take place a dedicated specifically trained 247 cleaning team from the local contracted cleaning service might prove a valuable resource
any non-intubated patient must wear a surgical mask disposable waterproof gloves disposable cap and shoe covers during transport when possible the patients hands should be sanitized before transport transport operators must sanitize hands and wear ppes before transfer and should minimize contact with patients coded routes should be followed and hospital public areas avoided anyone crossing the path of an infected patient should be preemptively alerted in order to minimize contact well-organized logistics will contribute to minimizing disposables wastage dedicated well-identifiable containers for infectious-risk health waste irhw should be used for potentially infected disposables lastly covid patients should be transported in the most professional and confidential way possible in order to minimize unjustified alarmism dedicated areas allocated to infected patients awaiting transfer to the coa must be preemptively identified in the emergency department the patients transfer from the emergency department to the coa should be streamlined in order to avoid all unnecessary contacts each hospital should provide a step by step well-defined path pre-allocating some corridors and elevators to covid patientsspecial attention should be given to what in non-covid times is routine practice staff taking responsibility for positive or suspected infected patients must be limited to those who need to be primarily involved in each operation a record must be kept of all operators involved in procedures on potentially infected patients personnel equipped with full ppes must receive the patient in the coa transfer the patient to the operating room minimizing environmental contamination and after time-out proceed to move the patient on the operating table in the allocated

protectionsome procedures likely to generate aerosolized particles have been associated with increased coronavirus transmission tracheal intubation non-invasive ventilation tracheostomy cardiopulmonary resuscitation and manual ventilation before intubation and bronchoscopy 5 6 an ffp3 mask should be therefore worn by operators working closer to the patient during these proceduresgiven the conjunctivas susceptibility to viral transmission it is important to wear visors or goggles to protect the eyes from potential exposure of viral particles 7careful anesthesiologic planning is recommended to minimize any infection potentially associated with unexpected complex endotracheal intubation procedures a more liberal use of intubation might be justified in patients with acute respiratory failure bypassing non-invasive ventilation techniques eg cpap or bipap in order to minimize the transmission risks 5 disposable airway equipment should be preferred medical and nursing staff must be equipped with ffp3 filters during laryngoscopy and intubation 5 intubations techniques with the highest chance of first-time success should be preferred to avoid repeated airway instrumentation 4 5 awake intubation techniques should be avoided at the end of these procedures all staff directly performing the procedure must immediately replace the first pair of gloves and other ppes in case heavy contamination risk exists ie in the event that vomiting coughing or else has occurred fiberscope intubation unless specifically indicated should be avoided as it may generate aerosolization 5 rapid sequence intubation rsi should be considered to avoid manual ventilation and potential aerosolization if manual ventilation is required small current volumes should be used if available a closed suction system should be preferred during airway aspiration disposable covers should be used whenever possible to reduce equipment contamination if a patient is transferred directly from the intensive care unit a dedicated transport ventilator should be utilized in order to reduce aerosolization risks the gas flow should be turned off and the endotracheal tube clamped with forceps when switching from the portable device to the or ventilator 4 when possible a dedicated ventilator should be used in the or for general anesthesia in positive or suspected positive covid-19 patients invasive procedures like for example the placement of intercostal catheters central venous catheters or similar should be performed at the patients bedside rather than in the or when a general anesthetic is required a hepa high-efficiency particulate air filter should be connected to the patient end of the breathing circuit and another one between the expiratory limb and the anesthetic machine 2 6 alternatively for pediatric patients or other patients in whom additional dead space or the weight of the filter may be problematic the hepa filter must be placed at the expiratory end of the circuit before the exhalation re-enters the ventilator the gas sampling tube must also be protected by a hepa filter both hepa filters and soda lime must be changed after each

discourage unnecessarily entering the room supplying materials to the or during surgery should also be discouraged the scout nurse in collaboration with the operating surgeon should anticipate what is needed during the operation before the same starts surgeons should preferably perform the operation with what is available in the or once the operation started any essential retrieval of necessary equipment should be done by staff outside the or personnel present in the or during surgery must not leave the room electromedical devices ie ultrasound and surfaces must be used with adequate protective cover and adequately sanitized at the end of the operation the surgical team will drape the patient according to the surgical procedure replacing the surgical mask with ffp2 filter and wearing long shoe covers before doing so all personnel in direct contact with the patient must wear a double pair of gloves at all times even while operating after the patient left the or logistics should allow as much time as possible before the next procedure takes place to reduce possible air contamination this time depends on the number of air exchangeshour of the specific room air exchange cycles should be increased whenever possible to  25 exchangesh 2 after the case all areas at risk of contamination must be cleaned and disinfected table 2 efforts should be made to minimize the contamination risk associated with specimens sent to the pathology department no data currently exist on covid-19 viral load in bodily fluids or tissue samplesstaff not directly involved in the

doffing procedure is complete all used ppes must be disposed of through irhw containers scrubs must be replaced after each procedure following showering whenever possible personnel responsible for transferring the patient away from the operating room must follow separate access routes and wear ppes different from the ones worn in the orthe healthcare professional must take all care not to become infected while removing ppe this must be done through an adequate procedure preventing re-contamination of the operators clothing and hands the first pair of gloves is likely to be heavily contaminated and must be removed first all other ppes must be considered infected as well and removed with care during the doffing procedure especially if the patient had a cough protective suite shoe cover and head cap must be subsequently removed face mask and glasses must be then removed taking care to handle the face mask by the ear laces and without touching its external side the second pair of gloves must be removed as the very last ppe and hands disinfection with hydro-alcoholic solution must be accurately performed immediately afterthe or and surrounding exchange areas must be sanitized as soon as possible after each procedure with particular attention to all objects used when caring for infected patients similarly all areas where covid patients have transited must be carefully sanitized too all personnel must contribute to maintain a clean environment including floors and surfaces in general all potentially infected single-use materials should be disposed of through irhw containers reusable materials should be decontaminated washed dried and or disinfectedsterilized based on the likelihood of infection electromedical equipment ie ventilator radiological equipment must be cleaned with chloro-derivate solution rinsed and dried and then disinfected with chloro-derivate solution in a concentration  01 or 1000 ppm parts per million with contact time superior to 1 min 8 9 table 2 full ppe must be worn during the sanitizing procedure disposable materials only ie double gloves paper towel should be used for cleaning anything disposable kept inside the or during the operation must be disposed of through irhw containers even if not usedit is advisable to set up a dedicated container for hazardous medical waste immediately outside the or to immediately dispose of all contaminated disposable material and ppes containers should be closed and sealed before being transferred to the collection point all sharps should be disposed of in a dedicated rigid plastic container ppe should be worn when closing and transporting containers and removed immediately after any visibly damaged or contaminated container must be promptly replacedlinen can be contaminated and must therefore be handled and transported with care aiming to prevent infection spread disposable laundry should be preferred when possible all linen sheets pillowcases crossbars etc should be handled wearing ppe during collection not placed on surfaces or floors but directly inside dedicated containers these must be sealed and immediately sent for cleaning and sterilization limiting them being left outside the orinstituting precise well-established plans to perform undeferrable surgical procedures and emergencies on covid-19-positive patient is mandatory hospitals must prepare specific internal protocols and arrange adequate training of the involved personnelsocial isolation may sound modern but this is not the case isolation during illness is ancient it eventually became known as the quarantine a term derived from the17th-century italian word quarantina meaning forty days but as kelly drews reports in her brilliant 2013 article a brief history of quarantine in the virginia tech undergraduate historical review quarantines have been employed for thousands of years as safeguards against the spread of disease early in the history of civilizations isolation and confinement of ill persons were the predecessors of quarantine4 drews astute observations inform much of what followsmicrobes were not known by humankind thousands of years ago what were our ancestors trying to protect againstmicroscopic pathogens were discovered during the period 1665-83 by two fellows of londons royal society robert hooke and antoni van leeuwenhoek in micrographia 1665 hooke presented the first published description of a microganism the microfungus mucor leeuwenhoek a few years later actually observed and described microscopic protozoa and bacteria while employing his improvements on the recently invented microscope5
a key figure in the evolution of our understanding of the spread of infections was louis pasteur whose findings were published in 1861 fifteen years later the german physician robert koch traced the life history of the microbe responsible for anthrax in cattle and sheep six years after that in 1882 koch worked out the cause of tuberculosis it was the first microbial disease in humans for which this had been accomplished4 although a monumental achievement it was not until the 20th century that germ theory became a standard part of scientific and medical knowledge most of kochs contemporaries persisted in believing that the major culprits were bad air miasmas and undisciplined lifestyles and had nothing to do with tiny living organisms6
the incubation period is the interval from the time the pathogen enters the body until the time it first causes symptoms because of the incubation period an individual may carry a disease-causing pathogen without being symptomatic when symptoms occur they may be minimal such as a low-grade fever which reflects the bodys attempt to kill or control the spread of the harmful microbethroughout much of early epidemiological history isolation not quarantine was the primary method of halting the spread of pandemics because people did not understand the concept of an incubation period drews states4 therefore before microbes were discovered in the nineteenth century people understood that social isolation worked but they did not know why they only understood that sick people should be separated from well individualsthis type of uncertainty persists in many areas of medical science we have often known that something works before we understand how it works a classic example is general anesthetics whose effectiveness was unquestioned before we had a clue about the physiological mechanisms that were involveddrews finds an early form of semi-isolation the biblical book of leviticus the third book of the jewish torah thought to have been written between the fifth and eighth centuries bce instructions occur in the thirteenth chapter for the isolation of those suffering from a skin disease most likely leprosynearly a thousand years later in 541 ce the first recorded outbreak of what came to be known as bubonic plague or the black death was reported by the byzantine historian procopius7 this outbreak was also called the plague of justinian or the justinian plague after the roman emperor it afflicted the entire mediterranean basin europe and the near east constantinople the seat of the roman empire at the time was severely affected8
the justinian plague raged from 541 to 549 ce and destroyed up to an estimated 40 percent of the population in the affected regions justinian contracted the plague but did not die from it he instituted burial customs and control measures they included efforts to control the movements of people believed responsible for the disease including jews pagans heretics and homosexualsdrews is unsparing in her criticism of justinians response to the plague she states justinians discriminatory laws created a sort of quarantine though he had no knowledge of what caused the disease to spread people who were considered different from the christians of constantinople were accused of causing the terrible outbreak as a result justinian attempted to halt their movement these minorities were no guiltier in their role as plague carriers than the christians who had the disease but racism and aggression against dissident groups of justinians reign played a major role in their branding as the source of the epidemic the quarantine enacted by justinian proved virtually useless and did nothing to stop the spread of the plague however it still qualifies as a quarantine technology a failed technology but a technology nonetheless4
in drews piquant description originally appearing in the far east the disease that would come to be synonymous with plague first emerged in europe as nothing more than a rumor in 1346 over the next five to ten years the plague exploded onto the western world killing millions and altering the fabric of every society it touched4 the use of quarantine expanded during the fourteenth century as the epidemics of black death continuedwhat did the plague look like drews cites the description of the illness recorded by italian author boccaccio 1313-1357 in his decameron its earliest symptom in men and women alike was the appearance of certain swellings in the groin or armpit some of which were egg-shaped whilst others were roughly the size of the common apple against these maladies it seemed that all the advice of physicians and all the power of medicine were profitless and unavailingfew of those who caught it ever recovered and in most cases death occurred within three days from the appearance of the symptoms we have described some people dying more rapidly than others the majority without any fever or other complications9
as i write there are almost 400000 confirmed deaths worldwide from coronavirus infection httpsourworldindataorgcoronavirus-data these are tragic numbers but they are small compared to what our ancestors endured by the time the black death subsided after 1351 20 million people had died in europe alone reducing the population to 80 million people the epidemic completely halted the rise in human population begun in 5000 bce it killed so many people that it would take europe more than 150 years to return to its former population4
today people complain about isolation facemasks business closures and restricted movement compare these inconveniences with those imposed during fourteenth-century europe during the plague years drews by the late fourteenth century the effects of the plague were so bad that italian city-states resorted to desperate measures in an attempt to preserve public health without definite knowledge of what caused the disease italian health commissioners fell back on a common theory that the air itself was infected in their view the only way to stop the epidemic was to somehow clean the air in their pursuit of corruption-free air commissioners inspected wine fish meat and water supplies they worried about sewage they regulated burials and decreed the destruction of the clothing of the deceased these measures may have saved lives by cutting down on secondary sources of infection but besides burning the clothing of the deceased they did little to curb the rampant spread of the plague  more extreme measures were taken by viscount bernabo of reggio who ordered every person with plague be taken out of the city in to the fields there to die or recover4

by the mid-1370s modern quarantine procedures began to take shape in italy drews reports in 1374 both genoa and venice began determining the ports of origin of incoming ships and turned away any coming from infected areas ultimately the italian city-states extended their quarantine time requirement to forty days originally termed trentino the adjustment to forty days of quarantine caused the name to be modified to quarantino a term derived from the italian word quaranta which means forty some suggest this was based on the hippocratic belief that the 40th day distinguished acute diseases from chronic other authors contend that it was changed due to christian practices such as the observation of lent the length of the great flood of noah or the length of jesus stay in the wilderness regardless of the reason the increased quarantine time offered an improvement it better insured that the ships in question did not pose a health risk to the city4
if any deaths occurred or if anyone fell sick during the voyage or during the time the quarantine was being observed the quarantine would be extended for 50 or 60 days according to the danger and circumstances and the goods on board would be sent to the pesthouse to be purified4
in addition to establishing a maritime quarantine for incoming ships italian health officials began to restrict infected persons and their families and contacts to their homes as a means of preventing further spread of disease often the authorities would assign individuals to guard the homes of the quarantined in order to insure they did not escape isolation sometimes amounted to captivity and imprisonment in milan where cases of the plague were first discovered all the occupants of the three houses concerned dead or alive sick or well were walled up inside and left to perish this extreme action appeared to have worked as out of all the large italian city-states milan was the least afflicted with the black death11
some forms of isolation and quarantine amounted to banishment drews reports that in 2007 archaeologists discovered a mass grave of more than 1500 victims of the bubonic plague while working on the small island of lazzaretto vecchio in italys venetian lagoon during the plague years those in venice who caught the plague were sent to this island they were treated until they either survived or perished by physicians brave or foolish enough to tend to the infected drews states lazzaretto vecchio may have been the worlds first lazaret or quarantine colony4

englands major cities also suffered severely during the plague years poor sanitation and massive overcrowding guaranteed a hideous death toll the last in a long series of pandemics the great plague of london in 1665 killed between 75000 and 100000 of the capital citys citizens during the summer months the death rates rose peaking in september when 7165 londoners died in one week13
in the united states an epidemic of yellow fever struck philadelphia then the nations capital in august 1793 the disease killed around 5000 citizens and caused 20000 to flee the city in response the lazaretto station was established on the delaware river in tinicum township in 1799 it was a 10-acre compound consisting of a hospital offices and residences that processed ships cargo and passengers sailing for the port of philadelphia it operated for nearly a century14
in 1832 a cholera epidemic swept over new york city it was part of a pandemic that began in asia in 1824 eventually spreading to england and canada over the next eight years in 1832 learning that the disease had spread to quebec and the city of montreal new york city mayor walter browne instituted a quarantine in an effort to protect his city immigrants continued to enter new york city from england via canada however and the quarantine collapsed around 3500 new yorkers died while 70000 fled the city they carried cholera into americas interior spreading the disease as far south as new orleans and mexico15
quarantines and isolation have been used to stem disease for 3000 years as drews summarizes as human understanding of disease transmission grew quarantine sophistication and efficacy improved until it became standard practice in combating epidemics though not always successful quarantines delayed or contained outbreaks by removing all potential pathogen carriers from the populace at first lightly used against leprosy and plagues of antiquity quarantine as a technology expanded rapidly in the western world during the black death epidemic its initial success against the plague established quarantine as a standard procedure to stopping the spread of epidemics and pandemics4
for three millennia our predecessors have struggled to find ways of stemming illness and death from diseases that have been largely defanged by sanitation vaccines medications and the knowledge of the behavior of microbes some of the early forms of isolation were draconian as weve seen such as walling up the sick confining them to islands or sending them into fields to get well or dieagainst this painful historical backdrop perhaps we might be more tolerant of the preventative precautions issued by contemporary health authorities such as the cdc most of our ancestors who faced plague cholera and yellow fever would likely trade places with us without hesitation they would probably look with disbelief on our complaints of being inconvenienced by social isolation social distancing and wearing masks and gloves in public they would probably laugh at the current complaint that individual liberties and freedoms are being sacrificed by the preventative measures aged in our fight against covid-19 when far more lethal diseases killed them by millions and depopulated their citiesevery death from our coronavirus pandemic is tragic but remembering what our ancestors endured and their courage as well as mistakes can perhaps soften the blow larry dossey mdexecutive editorfour of the six coronaviruses covs that have made the transition from mammalianavian hosts to humans are endemic in the human population and typically associated with mild self-limiting respiratory illness 1 however the remaining two human covs cause severe respiratory syndromes and are associated with considerable mortality 1 in 2003 the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov caused a disease outbreak that claimed nearly 800 lives 2 and for the second consecutive decade this century a new human cov has emerged the middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov was first isolated from a 60-year-old man in saudi arabia in june 2012 3 three years later it has been responsible for the infection of more than 1300 individuals in 26 countries and more than 480 related deaths 4of all the cases of mers-cov reported to date three quarters have occurred within the source country of saudi arabia table 1 4 aside from a moderate outbreak in the united arab emirates uae travel-associated spread to other countries in the middle east as well as examples in europe north america africa and asia has typically resulted in very minimal local outbreaks the clear exception to this is situation in the republic of korea where over 180 cases have been reported all during 2015 4 infection in the index case followed recent travel to saudi arabia qatar uae and bahrain 5 an international health regulations emergency committee has highlighted five main factors contributing to the spread of mers-cov in the republic of korea 6 briefly these were 1 a lack of awareness among healthcare workers and the general public 2 suboptimal infection prevention and control measures in hospitals 3 crowded emergency rooms and multi-bed hospital rooms 4 the practice of patients seeking care at multiple hospitals 5 multiple visitors staying with infected patients in hospital roomsoverall clinical experience with mers-cov indicates that its spread within the human population requires close contact the majority of cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings 7 there is good potential for outbreaks to be contained given suitable levels of awareness and hygiene the latest outbreak in korea however is testament to the cost of neglecting these basic requirements a recent study by our group demonstrated impressive rapid virucidal activity of povidone iodine pvp-i against the ebola virus ebov 8 pvp-i was also effective against the european reference virus modified vaccinia virus ankara mva which was determined to be a suitable surrogate test agent facilitating the safe testing of the virucidal activity of antiseptic products against hazardous pathogens including enveloped viruses such as ebov 8 pvp-i is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial used globally in the medical fieldincluding the middle eastas a disinfectant for skin hands and mucosal surfaces as well as for wound treatment and eye applications 9it may be hypothesized that pvp-i would also demonstrate effective disinfectant properties against mers-cov the study reported here evaluated skin cleanser surgical scrub and garglemouthwash formulations of pvp-i for virucidal activity against both the reference virus mva and mers-cov itselfthree pvp-i antiseptic products were tested in this

15 30 or 60 s virucidal activity was immediately suppressed by dilution with nine volumes of ice-cold medium minimal essential medium  20 fetal calf serum and serially diluted tenfold infectivity was determined by means of end point dilution titration in microtiter plates aliquots of 100 l from each dilution were added to six 200 l samples of bhk-21 cells cultures were examined microscopically for cytopathic effects cpe after 8 days of inoculationthe virus titers were determined using the spearmankrber method 11 12 and expressed as tissue culture infectious dose 50 tcid50ml the virucidal activity was determined by the difference of the logarithmic titer of the virus control minus the logarithmic titer of the test virus  log10 tcid50ml this difference is presented as a reduction factor rf including its 95 confidence interval ci a reduction in virus titer of 4 log10 corresponding to an inactivation of 9999 was regarded as evidence of sufficient virucidal activity the calculation was performed according to en14476 10in accordance with en144762013fpra12015 the inactivation tests were conducted once at 20  1 c 10 one part mers-cov suspension 100 l was mixed with 100 l of either 03

cultivated for 5 days and then inspected microscopically after 3 and 5 days for virus-induced cpe in cell morphology calculations of viral titer in cases of no virus or low viral count were as detailed in 8the test concentrations and contact periods were chosen to observe the point at which each test preparation produced efficient virus inactivation to demonstrate virucidal efficacy disinfectant and antiseptic products are required to produce a log10 reduction in virus titer of at least 4 10 the log10 reduction factors produced by the test products under clean and dirty conditions at each time point are shown in table 2 with each pvp-i formulation log10 reduction in viral titer 4 was demonstrated under clean and dirty conditions after only 15 s with the undiluted and 110 dilutions except for garglemouthwash which in dirty conditions required 30 s of exposure at the 110 dilutionunder both clean and dirty conditions the virucidal activity of the pvp-i products varied with the concentration of available iodine as follows scrub 075 gl  75 gl  0075 gl cleanser 04 gl  40 gl  004 gl garglemouthwash 10 gl  01 gl  001 glthe titers of mers-cov present in the control samples ranged from 600 to 650 log10 tcid50ml under clean and dirty conditions mers-cov viral titers were reduced between 430 and 497 log10 tcid50ml after 15 s table 2 which corresponds to a reduction in mers-cov viral titer of 9999 for all products testedas is the case for ebola mers-cov is an enveloped virus with a high biosafety level for which there is no vaccination nor any specific antiviral treatment 13 14 while infection can remain subclinicalindicating that not all cases may be reportedmers-cov more typically causes severe respiratory disease during the first year following the first reported case two-thirds of patients suffered severe disease 15 and over a third of reported cases to date have been fatal 4containment of spread has proven achievable in most cases thus far no sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred anywhere in the world 4 however a lack of awareness among health care workers and the general public coupled with inadequate prevention and control procedures can result in outbreaks based on nosocomial infection as recently observed in the republic of korea based on the current situation the world health organization who has issued a number of recommendations 4 many of these reflect the lack of understanding of how humans become infected from animal or environmental sources with particular emphasis on precautions relating to exposure to camels the other focus is on ensuring that health care facilities adopt appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients health care workers and visitorsa practical measure applicable to both of these issues is the implementation of effective hand hygiene practice standard hand hygiene includes either washing hands with soap and water or the use of an alcohol-based hand rub 16 randomized controlled trial data are available to support the effectiveness of pvp-i and alcohol hand rubs over plain soap hand wash for hand decontamination based on post-hygiene colony-forming unit count 17 in the context of virucidal activity pvp-i has demonstrated superiority over ethanol-based sanitizers in inactivating murine norovirus on a modified finger pad test 18 in an evaluation of the effectiveness of nine different hand sanitizers against feline calicivirus a surrogate for norovirus antiseptics containing 10 pvp-i achieved a greater viral reduction rate than any of the alcohol-based sanitizers non-alcoholic sanitizers or antimicrobial soaps 19 pvp-i has demonstrated virucidal activity against a range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses perhaps most relevant in the context of the mers-cov is the evidence for effective inactivation of the sars-cov to below detectable levels within 2 min of exposure 20effective hand hygiene is crucial in minimizing viral transmission from the contaminated hands of an infected individual either through direct person-to-person contact or indirectly via contamination of surfaces however respiratory viruses are also subject to airborne particles 5 m in size or droplet 5 m transmission in which infected material is released by the infected individual breathing coughing or sneezing 21 gargling represents an effective personal hygiene measure against airbornedroplet transmission as it can reduce the microbe count at the pharynx 22 together with hand washing and mask use it has been proposed that gargling is one of the three major personal hygiene protection measures against common airborne and droplet-transmitted infections 22 specialists advise that the criteria for selecting mouthwashes should include effectiveness of the antiseptic agent in killing pathogens 22 given the strong in vitro virucidal activity of pvp-i demonstrated in this and other studies garglingflushing with pvp-i may be an effective measure to disrupt the transmission of respiratory viruses especially via airbornedroplet transmission or after uptake via the mouth such as when touching the mouth or food with contaminated handsthe data reported here indicate rapid virucidal activity of three formulations of pvp-i against both mva and mers-cov the 15-s exposure time was assessed to study the virucidal kinetics of pvp-i against mva over time the minimum contact time for hygienic hand rub and hand wash defined in en144762013 is 30 s 10 and yet proved sufficient for all three formulations to be effective against both mva and mers-covmers-cov is a harmful enveloped virus and requires high biosafety levels for any investigation it is not recommended that disinfectants are tested using highly contagious and harmful viruses thus model viruses are used the centc 216wg1 committee which establishes standardized european testing methods and requirements for the antimicrobial efficacy of chemical disinfectants and antiseptics recently implemented the enveloped mva as the model virus for the claim virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash mva was chosen on the basis of its low biosafety level its known environmental stability and its practicability for laboratory use 2325 on the basis of these practical safety concerns our study was conducted primarily using mva with confirmation only in mers-covusually only low titers of mers-cov can be harvested in cell culture resulting in a range of 500650 log10 tcid50ml to demonstrate at least a 4 log10 reduction in virus titer it is necessary for test mixtures containing low virus titers to undergo detoxification by molecular sieving or to use a more sensitive assay such as lvp 26 in lvp a high volume of the lowest apparently non-cytotoxic dilution of the inactivation assay test mixture is added to the detector cell line and the cultures are monitored for virus-specific effects using this method larger reductions in virus titer can be shown even at lower viral loads and contact times as short as 15 s can be tested minimizing the impact of any after effects lvp offers sufficient sensitivity for reductions in virus titer to be detected even using test products that are highly cytotoxic in cell culture 27it should be considered that while the results of this in vitro analysis are a suitable basis for predictions about the virucidal efficacy of pvp-i they do not provide direct information about the effectiveness of the products in practice however taken together with 1 the emphasis placed by who on ensuring suitable levels of hand hygiene 2 recommendations for gargling with antiseptic mouthwash for the control of common airborne and droplet-transmitted infections 22 3 the fact that pvp-i is a product already in use and available within the most affected regions of the world these data provide strong rationale for the use of pvp-i products for the prevention of infection by mers-cov improved awareness is needed in the health care setting to ensure effective containment of the spread of this often fatal virusthe outbreak of mers-cov in the republic of korea is testament to the ongoing risk of healthcare-associated transmission and reinforces the need for timely diagnosis and implementation of prevention and control measures the three pvp-i products tested in this study demonstrated virucidal activity against mva and mers-cov at room temperature within only 15 s of exposure this was observed under both clean and dirty conditions these data are consistent with those from other studies demonstrating the excellent virucidal activity of pvp-i against enveloped virusesthe data reported here indicate that pvp-i-based hand wash products for potentially contaminated skin together with pvp-i garglemouthwash for reduction of viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx may help to support hygiene measures during outbreaks of respiratory virusesthe emergence of novel virus strains has always posed a serious challenge for the global community severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 more commonly and simply known as coronavirus and the cause of covid-19 first emerged at the close of 2019 in wuhan a city in central china1 sufferers may be asymptomatic or suffer mild to life-threatening respiratory symptoms in mid-march 2020 the diseases spread across the globe was such that the world health organization who officially labelled the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic2 to control the spread of the virus it is essential to implement strict preventative measures including repeated hand-washing with water and soapin healthcare settings and within communities alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a popular alternative to washing ones hands with water and soap in the context of the covid-19 pandemic routine use of hand sanitizer is a favoured method of cleaning ones hands and stopping the spread of infection3

4 a range of sanitizers is available but alcohol-based sanitizers are the most effective and enjoy a higher rate of compliance for use in healthcare contexts made with n-propyl alcohol isopropyl alcohol ethanol or a combination of alcohol types these sanitizers are also less irritating to the skin and can be applied quickly3

5 given the popularity of hand sanitizers and their importance in preventing the spread of covid-19 falsified alcohol-based sanitizers pose a significant public health riskthere are two key types of falsified alcohol-based hand sanitizers 1 sanitizers that contain methanol an additive that would typically not be listed as an ingredient5 and 2 sanitizers with an alcohol content below 60 first methanol should not be used in hand sanitizers because it is highly toxic and can cause severe reactions when exposed to the skin lungs or mouth7 exposure to methanol can result in systemic toxicity and in some cases death8 9 10 11 12 13 14 the substances elevated intrinsic toxicity its ready availability and its widespread use make poisoning from undeclared methanol in hand sanitisers an important public health concern15 second a hand sanitizer that contains less than 60 alcohol would be ineffective as a germicide and offer users no biocidal effect leaving the public vulnerable to contracting and spreading covid-19recently inspections to authenticate antimicrobial product safety including alcohol-based hand sanitizers available locally have been carried out by the dubai municipality in this safety survey 6 of the 102 alcohol-based hand sanitizers tested were found to contain undeclaredunlisted methanol while others were found to have an alcohol content of less than 60 despite their labels claiming an alcohol content of 706
the above discussion identifies falsified alcohol-based hand sanitizer as a serious public health risk especially in the context of the outbreak of covid-19 the popularity of alcohol-based sanitizers in healthcare and community settings coupled with the risk of methanol poisoning and ineffective hand antisepsis posed by falsified sanitizers demands a response it is recommended that regulatory and public health bodies take an active role in ensuring the safety and quality of antimicrobial products such as alcohol-based hand sanitizers at every stage of the products lifecycle including distribution manufacture and import specifically the following recommendations are made1the introduction of regulatory and monitoring mechanisms throughout the manufacturing process to verify the purity of alcohol-based hand sanitizers2the use of good manufacturing practice gmp research reporting of usage and any adverse effects education and regulatory control to increase inspection and oversight of alcohol-based hand sanitizers quality and safety

infectious diseases vary by geographic region and population and they change over time increasingly humans are moving from one region to another thereby becoming exposed to a variety of potential pathogens and also serving as part of the global dispersal process1 microbes picked up at one time and in one place may manifest in disease far away in time and place because many microbes have the capacity of persisting in the human host for months years or even decades the relevant time frame for study of exposures becomes a lifetime furthermore microbes also move and change and reach humans via multiple channelscaring for patients in todays world requires an understanding of the basic factors that underlie the geography of human diseases and events that cause shifts in the distribution and burden of specific diseases current technology contributes to massive population movements and rapid shifts in diseases and their distributions but it also provides communication channels that can aid clinicians who care for patients with unfamiliar medical problems this chapter reviews the factors that shape the global distribution of infectious diseases and the forces that are expected to shift distributions in the future several examples are used to illustrate the broad range of factors that affect the distribution and expression of infectious diseases2
many authors have traced the origins and spread of specific infectious diseases through human history a century and a half ago john snow noted that epidemics of cholera followed major routes of commerce and appeared first at seaports when entering a new region yersinia pestis the cause of plague accompanied trade caravans and moved across oceans with rats on ships exploration of the new world by europeans introduced a range of human pathogens that killed one-third or more of the local populations in some areas of the americas the plants and animals introduced as a result of this exploration have also had profound and long-lasting consequences for the ecology and economics of the new environment3 the speed reach and volume of todays travel are unprecedented in human history and offer multiple potential routes to move biologic species around the globe pathogens of animals and plants are being transported as well and this can affect global food security4 establishment of arthopod vectors such as mosquitoes that are competent to transmit human pathogens in new geographic areas can expand the regions that are vulnerable to outbreaks of some vector-borne infections this chapter focuses only on pathogens that directly affect human health and on their sources table 1011
 when thinking about geography of human infections it is useful to consider both the origin of the organism and the conveyor or immediate source for the human fig 1011
this chapter addresses three key issuesfactors influencing geographic distribution why are some infectious diseases found only in focal geographic regions or in isolated populationsfactors influencing the burden of disease why does the impact from widely distributed infections vary markedly from one region or one population to another andfactors influencing emergence of disease what allows or facilitates the introduction persistence and spread of an infection in a new region and what makes a region or population resistant to the introduction of an infection
many microbes require a specific arthropod vector for transmission or an animal reservoir host and hence inhabit circumscribed regions and may be unable to survive in other habitats malaria is a vector-borne infection that cannot become established in a region unless a competent vector is present the presence of a competent vector is a necessary but not sufficient condition for human infection the mosquito must have a source of malarial parasites gametocytemic human or rarely other species appropriate bioclimatic conditions and access to other humans the ambient temperature influences the human biting rate of the mosquito the incubation period for the parasite in the mosquito and the daily survival rate of the mosquito prevailing temperature and humidity must allow the mosquito to survive long enough for the malarial parasite to undergo maturation to reach an infective state for humans competent vectors exist in many areas without malaria transmission because the other conditions are not met these areas are at risk of the introduction of malaria as illustrated by several recent examples in the usa and elsewhere7

an estimated 77 of the world population lived in areas with malaria transmission in 1900 today about 48 live in at-risk areas but because of population growth and migration the total global population exposed to malaria today has increased by 2 billion since 19009 malaria was endemic in many parts of the usa into the 20th century fig 1012
 with estimates of more than 600 000 cases in 1914 even before extensive mosquito control programs were instituted transmission declined demographic factors population shifts from rural to urban areas improved housing with screened doors and windows and the availability of treatment were among the factors that contributed to this decreasethe distribution of onchocerciasis in africa is notable for its association with rivers10 the reason becomes clear by understanding that the vector of this filarial parasite the black fly genus simulium lays her eggs on vegetation and rocks of rapidly flowing rivers and usually inhabits a region within 510 km on either side of a river another name for onchocerciasis river blindness describes the epidemiology as well as one consequence of infectionsome pathogens have a complex cycle of development that requires one or more intermediate hosts distribution may remain relatively fixed even when infected humans travel widely if other regions do not supply the right combination and geographic proximity of hosts fig 1013
 although persons with schistosomiasis visit many regions of the world the parasite cannot be introduced into a new region unless an appropriate snail host is present excreted eggs in urine or feces are released into water where they reach the snail hosts and humans subsequently have contact with the untreated water11 local ecologic changes and climate change however can be associated with expansion of transmission in endemic areas or increased intensity of transmission as has been projected as a possible consequence of warming temperatures in china12
many hantaviruses exist worldwide with distributions that are still being defined each hantavirus seems to have its specific rodent reservoir with which it has evolved as with many zoonoses humans are incidental to the survival of the virus in rodents yet humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal disease if they enter an environment where they are exposed to the virus undoubtedly other rodent-associated viruses and other pathogens as well as pathogens associated with other animals or insects with the capacity to infect humans will be identified as humans enter unexplored environments in the future
ebola and marburg viruses are other viruses that have focal distributions but have caused dramatic human outbreaks with high mortality they also infect nonhuman primates and threaten the survival of great apes13 recent studies suggest that bats may be the reservoir hosts14
15 because these infections can be spread from person to person secondary household and nosocomial spread in several instances has amplified what began as an isolated event lack of adequate resources in hospitals in many developing regions contributes to the spread of infections within hospitals and to persons receiving outpatient care such as those receiving injectionscultural practices can lead to unusual infections in isolated areas residents of the highlands of papua new guinea developed kuru after ingestion or percutaneous inoculation of human tissue during the preparation of the tissues of dead relativesthus the presence of a pathogen in a region may reflect the biologic properties of the organism its need for a certain physicochemical environment or its dependence on specific arthropods plants or animals to provide the milieu where it can sustain its life cycle table 1012
 the presence of a pathogen in a region does not necessarily equate with human disease because mechanisms must exist for the pathogen to reach a susceptible human host for human disease to occur sometimes it is only with exploration of new regions or changes in land use that humans place themselves in an environment where they come into contact with microbes that were previously unidentified or unrecognized as human pathogens preferences for specific foods certain preparation techniques or cultural traditions may place one population at a unique risk for infectionamong the infectious diseases that impose the greatest burden of death globally most are widely distributed respiratory tract infections eg influenza streptococcus pneumoniae and others diarrheal infections tuberculosis measles aids and hepatitis b16 most of these infections are spread from person to person the world health organization estimated that about 65 of infectious diseases deaths globally in 1995 were due to infections transmitted from person to person table 1013
16

burden from these diseases is unevenly distributed across populations and among different countries poor sanitation lack of clean water crowded living conditions and lack of vaccination contribute to the disproportionate burden from many of these infections in developing regions of the world in industrialized countries pockets of high risk persist disadvantaged populations have higher rates of tuberculosis hiv and many other infectious and noninfectious diseases rates of reported cases of tuberculosis vary widely by region table 1014

shows the effect of crowded living conditions on rates of tuberculosis in england and wales in 199218 among welfare applicants and recipients addicted to drugs or alcohol in new york city the rate of tuberculosis was 744 per 100 000 person years or more than 70 times the overall rate for the usa19 the impact of an infection derives not only from the risk of exposure but also from the access to effective therapy for example treatment of a patient with active tuberculosis can cure the individual and eliminate a source of infection for others in the community
diphtheria controlled in many parts of the world through the use of immunization resurged in new independent states of the former soviet union in the 1990s a reminder of the tenuous control over many infectious diseases populations in other countries also felt the impact as cases related to exposures in the russian federation were reported in poland finland germany and the usa serologic studies in america and europe suggest that up to 60 of adults may be susceptible to diphtheriatravelers to tropical and developing regions of the world can pick up geographically focal often vector- or animal-associated infections such as malaria and dengue20 but travelers most often acquire infections with a worldwide distribution that are especially common in areas lacking good sanitation21
food- and water-borne infections are common and lead to travelers diarrhea which is caused by multiple agents including escherichia coli salmonella shigella and campylobacter spp and others typhoid fever and hepatitis a respiratory tract infections may be acquired from other travelers from all over the globe during the crowding that occurs in travel eg in buses airplanes terminals and on cruise ships as well as from persons in the local environment tables 1015

note factors that influence the types and abundance of microbes in a community and the probability of exposure to pathogenshepatitis a virus remains a common cause of infection in developing regions of the world although it is not considered a major cause of morbidity or mortality in those regions where most persons are infected at a young age and become immune for life the presence and severity of symptoms are related to the age at which a person becomes infected infection in young children is typically mild or inapparent persons living in areas of high transmission may be unaware of the presence of high levels of transmission although nonimmune older people such as travelers who enter the environment may develop severe and occasionally fatal infection some countries with an improving standard of living have noted a paradoxic increase in the incidence of disease from hepatitis a virus as the likelihood of exposure at a young age decreases shifting upward the age of infection to a time when jaundice and other symptoms are more likely to occurtravelers may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases and influence the global burden of these diseases22

neisseria meningitidis a global pathogen occurs in seasonal epidemics in parts of africa  the so-called meningitis belt fig 1015
24 irritation of the throat by the dry dusty air probably contributes to invasion by colonizing bacteria pilgrims carried an epidemic strain of group a n meningitidis from southern asia to mecca in 1987 other pilgrims who became colonized with the epidemic strain introduced it into sub-saharan africa where it caused a wave of epidemics in 1988 and 1989 using molecular markers investigators were able to trace the spread of the epidemic clone to several other countries25 in 1996 in africa major outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis occurred185 000 reported cases with a case fatality rate of 10 caused by n meningitidis serogroup a clone iii-126 a virulent group c et-15 strain of n meningitidis spread in canada and was associated with an increased case fatality rate and a higher proportion of cases in persons over the age of 5 years27 in these examples the virulence of the microbe and travel and trade acted synergistically to change the epidemiology and burden of disease in the spring of 2000 serogroup w135 n meningitidis caused an outbreak of infection in pilgrims to the hajj and subsequently spread to their contacts and others around the world studies using serotyping multilocus sequence typing multilocus dna fingerprints and other techniques found identical w135 isolates in multiple countries pilgrims are required to receive a meningococcal vaccine but before this outbreak pilgrims from many countries received a vaccine that protected against serotype a but not w135 the vaccine reduces risk of disease but does not prevent oropharyngeal carriage of n meningitidis28
organisms that survive primarily or entirely in the human host and are spread from person to person eg by sexual or other close contact or by droplet nuclei can be carried to any part of the world the spread of hiv in the past three decades to all parts of the world is a reminder of the rapid and broad reach of travel networks although the infection has also spread via blood and shared needles it has been the human host engaging in sex and reproduction who has been the origin for the majority of the infections worldwide person-to-person spread accounted for the rapid worldwide distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars a coronavirus infection in the spring of 2003 after the virus emerged from an animal reservoir most likely bats33
drugs or vaccines injected by reused inadequately sterilized needles and syringes have been and continue to be an important means of spread of blood-borne infections such as hepatitis c hepatitis b and hiv in some parts of the world34
multidrug-resistant mdr tuberculosis has continued to increase with world health organization estimates of 500 000 new cases of mdr annually now about 5 of all new tb cases each year35 extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis which is virtually untreatable had been reported in 45 countries by 2007 it is not only the pathogens carried by humans that are relevant humans also carry resistance and virulence factors that can be transferred to and exchanged with other microbes36
see healthmaporg for outbreaks of dengue feverdengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection that has now spread to most tropical and subtropical regions of the world and continues to increase in incidence and severity viremic humans regularly enter regions infested with aedes aegypti the principal vector of dengue transporting the virus for new outbreaks infection can spread rapidly and outbreaks are sometimes massive involving 30 of the population because four serotypes of dengue virus exist and infection with one serotype does not confer lasting immunity against other serotypes a person can be infected more than once the risk of developing severe dengue eg dengue shock syndrome or dengue hemorrhagic fever dss or dhf after repeat infection is 82103 times greater than after primary infection37 in an outbreak in cuba 985 of cases of dss or dhf were in persons with a prior dengue infection the rate of dss or dhf was 42 in persons with prior dengue infection who became infected with a new serotype38
geographic regions where multiple serotypes are circulating have continued to expand setting the stage for more severe consequences of infection factors that have aided the spread of dengue include increasing and rapid travel to and from tropical regions expansion of the regions infested with aedes aegypti increasing urbanization especially in tropical areas which has provided large dense populations the use of nonbiodegradable and other containers that make ideal breeding sites for the mosquito and lack of support for vector control programsmost of the world population growth globally is in urbanperiurban areas in tropical and developing regions the expectation is that more urban areas in tropical regions will reach the critical population size perhaps somewhere between 150 000 and 1 million people to permit sustained transmission of dengue and to increase the risk of the severe forms of infection dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndromein 2001 the vector that was implicated in an outbreak of dengue in hawaii39 was aedes albopictus a mosquito species that has been newly introduced into many new regions in recent decades probably primarily by shipping40 on phylogenic analysis the virus responsible for the hawaii outbreak was similar to dengue isolates from tahiti suggesting that viremic travelers introduced the virus from the south pacificit is instructive to ask not only where dengue occurs but also where it does not although large dengue epidemics occurred in the usa in the 20th century only a handful of cases have been acquired in the usa in recent years despite the presence of epidemic disease in adjacent areas of mexico and the presence of a competent vector aedes aegypti in south-eastern usa fig 1016
24 it is possible that the presence of screened dwellings and air conditioning may make an area relatively resistant to the introduction of infection even if a competent vector infests a region though serologic studies have also documented that unrecognized dengue infections are occurring in texas41
see healthmaporg for outbreaks of chikungunyachikungunya a mosquito-borne alphavirus originally isolated in tanzania in 1953 has spread from africa causing massive outbreaks in the indian ocean islands and india since 2005 although it has typically been considered an infection of tropical regions in the summer of 2007 an outbreak caused hundreds of cases 175 laboratory confirmed in north-eastern italy the index case was a visitor from india of note the vector implicated was aedes albopictus which had been first documented in italy in 1990 and was postulated to have been introduced via used tires42 mutations in the virus may have enabled it to replicate more efficiently in the mosquito vector chikungunya virus can be transmitted by aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes which are now both widely distributed so many regions of the world are vulnerable to introduction of this virus by viremic travelerssee healthmaporg for outbreaks of choleracholera illustrates the complex interactions between microbe environment and host43 epidemics are seasonal in endemic regions vibrio cholerae lives in close association with marine life binding to chitin in crustacean shells and colonizing surfaces of algae phytoplankton zooplankton and water plants v cholerae can persist within the aquatic environment for months or years often in a viable but dormant state nonculturable by usual techniques environmental factors including temperature salinity ph and sea-water nutrients affect the persistence abundance and viability of the organisms and hence have a striking influence on human epidemicsunder conditions of population crowding poor sanitation and lack of clean water cholera can have a devastating impact as was shown by the massive outbreak of el tor cholera in rwandan refugees in goma zaire which caused 12 000 deaths in july 199444
the organism can be carried by humans who sometimes have few or no symptoms and introduced into new regions trade probably also plays a critical role ballast water picked up by boats in multiple locations and discharged at another time and place carries a wide range of species including many that have no direct impact on human health45

see healthmaporg for outbreaks of food-borne diseasethe globalization of the food market means pathogens from one region can appear in another some are common pathogens with a worldwide distribution but others are not an outbreak of cholera in maryland usa was traced to imported contaminated commercial frozen coconut milk48 alfalfa sprouts grown from contaminated seed sent to a dutch shipper caused outbreaks of infections with salmonella spp on two continents in at least arizona and michigan in the usa and in finland49 commercial movement of fruits and vegetables redistributes resistance factors along with the microbes tracing the source after an infection has been diagnosed can be convoluted and often is not carried out unless disease is severe lethal or epidemic or involves a highly visible person or populationtravel and trade are key features in the epidemiology of the infection cyclospora a cause of gastroenteritis recognized for many years in multiple regions of the world cases were often associated with living in or travel to areas where sanitary facilities were poor in the summer of 1996 a large us outbreak occurred in persons who had not traveled over a period of a few months 1465 cases of cyclosporiasis were reported from 20 states the outbreak was linked to eating raspberries imported from guatemala50 during some seasons of the year up to 70 of selected fruits and vegetables sold in the usa come from developing countriesin the past visceral leishmaniasis in brazil was primarily a rural disease recently however several cities have reported large outbreaks of visceral leishmaniasis51 reasons for the change in epidemiology include geoclimatic and economic factors drought lack of farm land famine leading to migration of large numbers of persons who settle in periurban areas where they live in densely crowded shanties lacking basic sanitation the presence of domestic animals such as dogs chickens and horses in and adjacent to human dwellings provides ample sources of blood meals for the sand fly the vector of leishmaniasis outbreaks have occurred in many cities in brazil including teresina so luis and natal children and young people have been most affected malnutrition can also contribute to the severity of the diseasediseasedisease interactions can also alter the epidemiology of infections visceral leishmaniasis has become an important infection in hiv-infected people in spain and other areas where the two infections coexist52 the presence of hiv leads to increased risk of progression of infection late appearance of disease can occur years to decades after exposure in an endemic region leading to the appearance of cases of leishmaniasis in regions distant from endemic areas a common consequence is missed or delayed diagnosismovement today involves all forms of life and the movement of nonhuman species can affect infections in humans importation of wild animals from ghana into the united states led to an outbreak of monkeypox an infection previously known to exist in africa humans became infected by handling prairie dogs sold as pets that had been housed with the imported wild animals from africa53
aedes albopictus introduced into the usa via used tires shipped from asia54 has since become established in at least 21 contiguous states of the usa and in hawaii aedes albopictus can transmit dengue and chikungunya viruses as described above and is a competent laboratory vector of la crosse yellow fever and other viruses it is also hardier than many other mosquito species and therefore may spread widely and be extremely difficult to eradicate multiple strains of eastern equine encephalitis virus have been isolated from aedes albopictus in floridaan example from the past illustrates the potential consequences of the introduction of a mosquito vector into a new region in march 1930 an entomologist in natal brazil came upon anopheles gambiae larvae in a small wet grassy field between a railway and a river55 he was surprised because the usual habitat for this mosquito was africa investigation revealed that the probable route of entry into south america was via boats that made mail runs between dakar in senegal and natal in brazil covering the 3300 km in less than 100 hours in dakar the boats were anchored a distance from the shore within easy flight range of a gambiae in brazil over the ensuing years the mosquito spread along the coastal region and inland natal as an ocean port terminus of two railway lines and the hub of truck car and river transportation was well suited for dissemination of a gambiae into the region although malaria already existed in the region the local mosquitoes were not efficient vectors anopheles gambiae in contrast lived in close proximity to humans entered houses sought human blood and was an efficient biter in 1938 and 1939 devastating outbreaks of malaria killed more than 20 000 persons in this instance the simple introduction of a new vector into a region led to severe problems fortunately an intensive and expensive eradication campaign was effectivecurrent transportation systems regularly carry all forms of life including potential vectors along with people and cargo in an experiment carried out several years ago mosquitoes house flies and beetles in special cages were placed in wheel bays of 747 aircraft and carried on flights lasting up to 7 hours temperatures were as low as 62f 52c outside and ranged from 46f to 77f 825c in the wheel bays survival rates were greater than 99 for the beetles 84 for the mosquitoes and 93 for the flies56 occasional cases of so-called airport malaria  cases of malaria near airports in temperate regions  attest to the occasional transport and survival of a commuter mosquito long enough to take at least one blood meal in the new environmentin the usa transportation of raccoons in the late 1970s from florida to the area between virginia and west virginia in order to stock hunting clubs unintentionally introduced a rabies virus variant into the animals of the region from there the rabies enzootic spread for hundreds of miles reaching raccoons in suburban and densely populated regions of the north-east usa spill-over of the rabies virus variant into cats dogs and other animal populations and direct raccoonhuman interactions have had extremely costly and unpleasant consequences57
today highly pathogenic avian influenza a h5n1 is a global concern58 it is entrenched in poultry populations in asia and africa and has caused outbreaks in europe and the middle east although the virus causes high mortality in infected humans thus far h5n1 has not been able to establish sustained transmission from person to person most humans appear to have been infected via close contact with poultry or their products although the virus can be carried by migratory birds59 most introductions appear to have been related to movement of poultry and poultry products a model designed to map risk in south east asia found risk was associated with duck abundance human population and rice cropping intensity60
geographic exposures influence how one thinks about probable diagnoses in a given patient in mexico for example more than 50 of patients with late-onset seizures have ct evidence of the parasitic infection neurocysticercosis61 in peru 29 of persons born outside lima who had onset of seizures after 20 years of age had serologic evidence of cysticercosis62 in northern thailand melioidosis is a common cause of sepsis accounting for 40 of all deaths from community-acquired sepsis63
in considering the consequences of exposures in other geographic regions relevant data in assessing the probability of various infections include the duration of visit activities and living conditions during the stay and the time lapsed since the visit among british travelers to west africa the relative risk of malaria was 803 times higher for persons staying for 612 months than among those staying 1 week64 in malawi the risk of schistosome infection increased directly with duration of stay seroprevalence was 11 for those present for 1 year or less but this increased to 48 among those present for 4 years or longer65 in a study of persons with cysticercosis the average time between acquisition of infection and onset of symptoms was about 7 years66
for malaria it is necessary to know not only whether infection can be acquired in a specific location but also the specie of parasite present and the patterns of resistance to antimalarial agents as chloroquine resistance has spread maps now typically highlight the few remaining areas of chloroquine sensitivity because the resistance to antimalarial agents is a dynamic process with levels of resistance generally increasing over time involving plasmodium vivax in some areas as well as p falciparum it is essential to base decisions about chemoprophylaxis and treatment on up-to-date information figure 1017
shows the distribution of malaria and resistance patterns globally as of 2005 recent analysis of data from a network that uses travelers as a sentinel population found marked differences in the spectrum of disease in relation to the place of exposure20
expression of disease may vary depending on age of first exposure immunologic status of the host genetic factors and the number and timing of subsequent exposures temporary residents of endemic regions have different patterns of response to a number of helminths from those of long-term residents in cases of loiasis temporary residents have immunologic hyperresponsiveness high-grade eosinophilia and severe symptoms that are not seen in long-term residents of the same area67 genetic factors can affect susceptibility to infection or expression of disease some persons for example are genetically resistant to infection with parvovirus because they lack appropriate receptors on their erythrocytes68 persons lacking duffy factor cannot be infected with the malarial parasite p vivaxknowledge about the geographic distribution of diseases is essential for informed evaluation and care of patients who increasingly have had exposures in multiple geographic regions recent travel and trade patterns have led to more frequent contact with populations human and nonhuman species from low latitude areas regions with greater species richness69 infectious diseases are dynamic and will continue to change in distribution changes in virulence and shifts in resistance patterns will also require ongoing surveillance and communication to health-care providers multiple factors favor even more rapid change perhaps in unexpected ways in the future rapidity and volume of travel increasing urbanization especially in developing regions the globalization of trade multiple technologic changes that favor mass processing and broad dispersal and the backdrop of ongoing microbial adaptation and change which may be hastened by alterations in the physicochemical environmentevery year the same ritual takes place at changing locations in the western world while the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations meet at their annual g8 summit to discuss the global state of affairs a wide variety of organizations and protesters meet in parallel to decry what they see as the negative effects of globalization notwith-standing these protests whether one sees globalization as a tool to overcome poverty hunger and disease in the world or whether one feels threatened by its consequences one thing is certain globalization is here to stay often narrowly defined as the increasing integration of the worlds economies globalization is in reality a powerful development that presents new challenges at the beginning of this millenniumone major problem is the increasing internationalization of health risks how-ever defined this term has many dimensions including economic technological political social scientific and cultural aspects the links between globalization and health are complex and globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon that can affect health in myriad ways its consequences can be either direct at the level of whole populations individuals and healthcare delivery systems or indirect through the economy and other factors such as education sanitation and water supply woodward et al 2001 given the enormous complexity and breadth of the issues our article cannot hope to cover the entire range of topics that link globalization to health instead we focus on those risks to health and health care that are related to central aspects of the globalization process namely trade travel and exchange of informationa major factor for the liberalization of international trade has been the multilateral trade negotiations during the past 50 years which culminated in the establishment of the world trade organization wto bettcher et al 2000 figure 1 illustrates the significant increases in world trade since 1980 although increasing trade is certainly good for economies it also leads to a globalization of health risks important examples of such risks include tobacco alcohol global epidemics of non-communicable diseases and trade in health servicesthe world health organization who estimates that the death toll from tobacco abuse alone will reach 10 million a year over the next two decades up to 70 of these deaths caused by lung cancer cardiovascular diseases cvds lung diseases diabetes and many other tobacco-related ailments will occur in developing countries murray  lopez 1997 these countries are at particular risk as industrialized countries increasingly ban cigarette advertisements and tobacco companies intensively target people in poorer nations as potential customers the high incidence of smoking among children and adolescents and the disturbingly low age of initiation raise additional concerns global youth tobacco survey collaborative group 2002alcohol consumption is another area in which the globalization of an industry has led to more health risks jernigan 1997 however unlike tobacco use which substantially increases the risk of mortality from an impressive array of diseases doll 1998 the impact of alcohol consumption on health is much more complex there is a strong relationship between alcohol consumption and liver cirrhosis some cancers and most causes of injuries and violence although minimal amounts of alcohol are sufficient to reduce the risk of cvd beaglehole  yach 2003the spread of universal brand names of popular beverages and fast foods has  contributed to the global epidemic of obesity by replacing traditional diets with fat- and calorie-rich foodsthe who has estimated that by the year 2020 non-communicable diseases such as cancers diabetes obesity and cvd will cause about two-thirds of the global disease burden up from 40 at present this rapid increase again illustrates the globalized risks for conditions that are mainly caused by diet even in less developed countries that have coexistent under-nutrition there were 151 million cases of diabetes worldwide in 2001 and this is estimated to increase by 46 to 221 million cases in 2010 with the steepest growth in the developing world zimmet et al 2001 the same holds true for obesity shell 2001 of course not all of this is globalizations faultthese chronic or lifestyle diseases are mainly caused by personal choice that is a sedentary lifestyle the use of tobacco and a fat- and sugar-rich diet nevertheless a key factor has been the unprecedented increase in the global food trade and its domination by large transnational companies that have developed global brand names and aggressive marketing strategies adapted to local situations chopra et al 2002 the spread of universal brand names of popular beverages and fast foods has been especially rapid in the developing world during the past two or three decades and has contributed to the global epidemic of obesity by replacing traditional diets with fat- and calorie-rich foods it is revealing that only a short period after their introduction on the chinese market 65 42 and 40 of consumers in china recognized the brands coca cola pepsi and nestl respectively lang 2001globalization of trade is also manifested in the implementation of the wtos agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips which extends patent protection on new drugs for a minimum period of 20 years as a result of high prices trips threatens to limit and undermine access to new medicines especially to poor populations living in the developing world kamal  bailey 2003 in this sense the implementation of trips can be seen as exacerbating health risks trade and movement of infected cattle and poultry across national borders may also have contributed to recent outbreaks of mad cow disease in the northern hemisphere and avian influenza in asiatrips wtos agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights threatens to limit and undermine access to new medicines especially to poor populations living in the developing worldthe globalization of trade is particularly relevant for health services that have become a commodity that can be traded in distinct ways first health services can be provided across borders examples include a range of telemedicine tools such as tele-diagnostics and tele-radiology as well as medical consultation through traditional and electronic channels second patients can travel abroad to receive health care or use certain facilitiesthe uk government recently allowed uk patients to seek treatment in the european economic area lowson et al 2002 other countries including developing ones such as cuba and india openly advertise to attract foreign patients to their clinics and hospitals third health services themselves have become an industry that attracts foreign investments several transnational companies from developed and developing countries have already created commercial health services through the purchase and establishment of hospitals chanda 2002 fourth the international movement of health personnel across borders has become a significant component of the trade in health services and has attracted considerable attention in the scientific and lay presssimilar to trade globalization has had large effects on international travel with serious consequences for global health the liberalization of the airline industry in many countries has made air travel affordable for more and more people around the world which has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of global air travel sutherst 2004 estimated that about one million people travel internationally every day and a similar number travel between developed and developing countries each week another recent report gossling 2002 put the number of global tourist arrivals per year at 700 million far-reaching air travel aided by improvements in aircraft technology that allow longer nonstop flights facilitates the spread of communicable diseases it is entirely possible that a person in the early stages of an infectious disease could be halfway around the world in 1215 hours and thus function as a vector for that disease aiding its spread perhaps into vulnerable non-immune populations the recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is the best contemporary example of the rapid spread of a hitherto unknown and virulent viral pathogen through travel of infected humans figs 2 3 and 4 sars was first recognized in february 2003 in vietnam where cases of atypical pneumonia with an unknown cause began to appear by the first week of may 2003 30 countries on six continents had reported a total of more than 7000 probable cases with more than 500 deaths who 2003aa person in the early stages of an infectious disease could be halfway around the world in 1215 hours and thus function as a vector for that diseaseanother example is the global spread of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcus that was first identified in spain in the early 1980s and rapidly jumped to south africa and the usa before spreading to all other parts of the world who 2000 each year approximately two million children die in developing countries as a result of lower respiratory infections mostly pneumonia the exact origin of this pneumococcus strain is still unknown but is likely to come from the far east mcgee et al 2001perhaps the most profound changes that have taken place during the past 10 years have come through the globalization of ideas and information facilitated through the revolution in information technology the internet satellite television broadcasting and high-speed data links across the globe have dramatically increased access to all kinds of information even in the most remote corners of the world despite early concerns about a digital divide that would further disadvantage the poor these fears have been overestimated the reality is that this divide is narrowing between rich and poor countries that have increasing access to cell phone communication and the internet the economist 2004 the success of the food and tobacco industries aggressive marketing strategies mentioned above have been closely linked to this information revolutionalthough better access to information is certainly a good thing it has also created fears that freely available scientific information might be abused by terrorists beck 2003 giving basically everyone who is interested access to the full sequences of human pathogen genomes and the ongoing trend towards open access of published research owens 2003 and even ongoing research activities for new drugs hubbard  love 2003 poses a serious dilemma with important implications for global health should the full sequence of the anthrax bacillus or smallpox virus and other virulent pathogens be published if this data could be used to develop biological weapons another example is the development of an improved virus to kill mice that has created fears that the enhanced virus could be used for bioterrorism finkel 2001 al-qaeda and the japanese terrorist group aum shinrikyo might have planned to use published research data for nefarious purposes petro  relman 2003there is another inherent danger that comes with the vast flood of information now available through the internet namely the reliability and accuracy of health information from various web sites eysenbach et al 2002 many such sites contain wrong misleading and even dangerous information crocco et al 2002 and the lay public are often more confused than informed when they search for health advicewithout doubt globalization poses risks to global health but it also provides benefits the extraordinary improvements in information technology have dramatically increased the speed and ease of data flow thereby facilitating the sharing of information medical discoveries made in one country can be made nearly instantaneously available to patients in other countries wassenaar 2003 it has also sped up the pace of discovery by linking researchers across the globe to work on the same problem such as the response to sars global cooperation of scientists linked through the internet resulted in the impressively rapid identification of the sars virus and the development of a diagnostic test gerberding 2003 similarly the new england journal of medicine used the internet and electronic communication to review revise and rapidly publish vital articles on the sars epidemic drazen  campion 2003and although many non-governmental organizations ngos decry the negative effects of increasing globalization they have also clearly benefited from it to improve healthcare delivery and health policy in many developing countries a recent key contribution of the global ngo movement lies with the adoption of the framework convention on tobacco control fctc ngos had an essential and vital role at the local national and international levels in all development phases of the fctc mackay 2003 and their contribution continues as they actively work with countries in the fctc ratification processglobalization has also brought about improvements in research methodology and some argue that clinical research has become more sophisticated as a result wassenaar 2003 other benefits of globalization include cross-border use of health services that benefit patients and provide much needed resources to national health systems jain 2003 and improved regulatory practices wassenaar 2003 finally one should not underestimate the power of knowledge as it empowers populations and individuals and in turn allows them to hold to account their political and professional leaders ellis 2003as the major international agency dealing with global public health issues the whotogether with other international organizationshas an important role in mitigating the health risks posed by globalization through the fctc the who has tried to impose more stringent control on tobacco use in its member states the policies recommend price and tax measures protection from exposure to second-hand smoke and regulation and disclosure of the contents of tobacco products packaging and labelling advertising promotion and sponsorship are also regulated as are tobacco dependence and cessation measures illicit trade sales to and by minors and liability hammond  assunta 2003 in may 2003 the final draft of the fctc was adopted by the 56th world health assembly the treaty has been open for signature since june 2003 and will enter into force once it has been ratified by 40 parties as of 1 july 2004 167 countries and the european community have signed the fctc and 24 have ratified it up from nine in marchimpressive progress in just four months the most recent public smoking bans in places such as new york city ireland and norway are clearly further important steps towards protecting public health from the perils of tobacco smokeanother example of the whos key role in global public health are the international health regulations ihr who 2004 these were used during the sars epidemic to issue emergency travel advisories for several major cities in the world affected by the disease to discourage and restrict travel and thus contain the virus these regulations were drafted to ensure maximum security against the international spread of diseases with minimum interference to world traffic one of the oldest international political instruments the ihr started as the international sanitary regulations in 1951 to provide a set of rules to protect the world from the spread of what were then referred to as quarantinable diseases in 1969 this became the ihr it is now being revised with the goal of providing a framework within which the who and other agencies can help countries to respond to future global public health threats by directly linking ihr to the global alert and response network established by the whowith regards to the epidemic of overnutrition as the main cause of many chronic non-communicable diseases some have suggested that the who should help to develop a coordinated global strategy on diet physical activity and health chopra et al 2002 such a strategy should include the use of policy education and trade mechanisms to achieve its goal to this end the who advocates a healthier lifestylea recent joint whofao food and agriculture organization report recommends that consumption of added sugars beyond those naturally present should be less than 10 of the daily caloric intake who 2003bthe development of an improved virus to kill micehas created fears that the enhanced virus could be used for bioterrorismvarious national and international groups have also been concerned with the quality and accuracy of health information found on the internet the who is leading an initiative to establish a health dot health domain to enhance the credibility of information provided for public and personal health the who proposed to restrict the use of health to content providers who would voluntarily abide by established quality andor ethical standards however in november 2000 the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann rejected the whos proposal because it was concerned by the vagueness of the whos standards for restricting registrars objections were also raised notably by a multinational pharmaceutical company as to the appropriateness of according a degree of authoritativeness over the implied accuracy of health-care-related information to a single quasi-governmental organization icann 2000there have also been calls for a global oversight system to regulate and approve research on dangerous pathogens steinbruner  harris 2003 participating governments would be required to establish review bodies that regulate relevant research in this area such an approach must clearly involve the scientific community and must strike a balance between national security needs against the benefits of open scientific communication for future health improvementas pointed out above globalization will not go away it is therefore important to anticipate future challenges for global health and to consider how to react effectively one major and increasing problem is the movement of health professionals from developing countries to high-income countries which threatens the sustainability of health systems in the poor world the director general of the who lee jong-wook clearly highlighted this potential threat while addressing the 53rd session of the who regional committee for africa health systems depend most of all on skilled and dedicated personnel and here we face big challenges particularly in this region which on top of everything else suffers heavy losses to the brain drain lee 2003 the extent of the problem has been highlighted previously pang et al 2002 and a recent survey from lithuania where 61 of medical residents and 26 of physicians surveyed said they intended to leave for the eu or other countries illustrates well the potential magnitude of health professional brain drain stankunas et al 2004 not just for african countrieshowever the migration of health personnel raises a complex ethical dilemma on the one hand it appears unethical for developed countries which often depend on foreign-trained physicians to address shortages in rural areas to attract health professionals from poorer countries on the other hand it hardly seems ethical to prevent skilled workers in search of a better life from accepting better opportunities financial or professional scott et al 2004 as borders disappear there is an urgent need to develop strategies at the national and international level that will minimize the harm and maximize the benefits of the movement of health personnel equally urgent is the need for more information about this problem there are surprisingly little data on the magnitude of the movement of health professionals between poor and rich countries and few studies have examined the impact of brain drain on national health systemsfreely available scientific information might be at risk of being abused by terroristsforeign direct investment in the health area notably for the purchase and construction of medical facilities also brings both opportunities and concerns as mentioned previously the presence of foreign commercial healthcare providers and transnational health services have the potential to benefit both patients and national coffers however one should not ignore the potential negative impact of privatized health care a recent systematic review of private for-profit and private not-for-profit dialysis facilities in the usa found that haemodialysis care in not-for-profit centres was associated with a lower risk of mortality devereaux et al 2002 more research to examine the potential impact of foreign commercial presence and cross-border use of health services on health is needed so that regulations can be designed to maximize their benefits and protect patientsas mentioned previously if patent protection leads to prohibitively priced drugs it undermines access to new medicines among the most vulnerable populations the effects of the trips agreement on pharmaceutical prices need to be documented and the design and implementation of international agreements need to consider the potential effects on developing countries health systems woodward et al 2001 similarly the essential drugs list which guides the selection of drugs on the basis of public health relevance efficacy safety and cost needs to remain an integral part of national drug policies smith  tickell 2003there is sufficient evidence that globalization has resulted in higher tobacco consumption notably in poorer countries who 2001 and higher alcohol use particularly among younger individuals kuo et al 2003 it is therefore essential that governments retain the ability within international agreements to regulate so that they can protect public health especially the ability to restrict and ban if necessary advertising and lobbying activities finally the ongoing review of the ihr process must transform these regulations into an effective tool that will allow countries to strengthen global disease surveillance and to respond efficiently to international public health emergenciesthe current models of international relations mobility and movement of goods and people are responsible for the globalization of health risks these developments clearly lead to an increase in health risks either directly or indirectly particularly in the developing world where the benefits of globalization are often offset by its adverse effects more insidiously the threat of misuse of globalized information for bioterrorism purposes is becoming a serious concern for many governments international organizations can have an important role in minimizing such risks through regulations policy recommendations advocacy and promoting dialogue among interested parties in addition to reap the benefits of globalization we need novel approaches to international cooperation that place national self-interest in the context of global mutual interest and in this way promote international cooperation and goodwill frenk  gomez-dantes 2002sars-cov-2 poses a serious and escalating threat to public health after having triggered a pandemic that stems from its first recorded infection in wuhan china during early december 2019 hong et al 2020 in many cases infection will induce flu-like symptoms in the host who will additionally become highly contagious having an averaged r0 of roughly 328 even throughout the initial incubation period which has been suggested to last up to 314 days backer et al 2020 liu et al 2020 complications in the immune response or infection occurring in those who already have underlying health conditions may result in more serious symptoms such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which can often be fatal this incidence of fatality paired with the ease of viral transfer which often occurs through droplet and aerosol transmission is what makes this particular strain of coronavirus so deadly rothan and byrareddy 2020there is current debate into the significance of the political action of many countries which could have prevented the spread from having such a global impact and whether more could have been done to better prepare healthcare services to deal with the virus having been better equipped hospitals may have likely been able to decrease the overall rates of death from the virus regardless of where the responsibility for this pandemic lies it is clear that we currently rely on international collaboration and extensive scientific prowess to deal with the issue and recover from it in a way which will best reduce the impact it can cause in the futureone such avenue of investigation is the use of biosurfactants which have proven themselves to be significant in a variety of processes all of which being crucial in managing the pandemic by dealing with both the virus itself and the symptoms in which it can cause the structure of the coronavirus similarly to others of this type consists of a lipid membrane which encloses its vital proteins and positive sense rna vellingiri et al 2020 this is an incredibly simple structure but can cause tremendous harm when its membrane fuses with that of an animal cell allowing its rna to be synthesized by the host this will result in the replication of the virus with the use of the hosts cellular mechanisms spreading to other cells in the body causing exponential damage in the process the lipid membrane along with embedded spike proteins is crucial in the viruss ability to both maintain its integrity and also pass our cells phospholipid bilayer which allows it to initiate its mechanism of infection das 2020 the amphiphilic nature of biosurfactants allows them to interact with the hydrophobic domain of the viral membrane with a significant enough affinity to disrupt it resulting in a breakdown of its structure and therefore disabling itbiosurfactants are currently used across a large range of industrial and medical processes and their innate versatility open up their use for a large variety of coronavirus related applications randhawa and rahman 2014 in dealing with this pandemic it is crucial that we target the virus at every stage of its transmission and incubation the use of biosurfactants will therefore be considered in handwashes and cleaning agents to prevent the spread of the virus targeting and relieving the symptoms after infection acting as drug delivery systems and additionally their use in other important areas with a key example being the production reliable antiviral facemasksdue to biosurfactant unique chemical structures understanding the functional mechanisms of action as well as their toxicity to human body is crucial for their exploitation in medical field nowadays biosurfactant find applications as antimicrobial anti-adhesive in immunomodulation and as antitumor lipopeptides and glycolipids are the most effective as antimicrobial and represents an important source for the discovery of new antibiotics biosurfactant have been shown in mammalian cells to participate in several intercellular molecular recognition steps such as signal transduction cell differentiation and cell immune response acting as antitumor agents by interfering with cancer progression processes gudia et al 2013 fracchia et al 2015 sajid et al 2020the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant relays on membrane damagedisruption causing metabolite leakage by modification of membrane protein morphology by affecting energy generation and metabolites transport as well as by altering the bacterial lipopolysaccharide system lps thus reducing cell adhesion and biofilm formation van hamme et al 2006 fracchia et al 2015 different lipopeptides have reached a commercial antibiotic status like echinocandins micafungin anidulafungin and daptomycin fracchia et al 2015 moreover some biosurfactant have shown immunomodulation activities sajid et al 2020 as examples surfactin is an interesting molecule believed to reduce the activity of macrophage by down regulating the expression of several cell surface molecule ie cd54 thus being a potential candidate in the treatment of hypersensitivity related immune disorders paine et al 2002 surfactin is also known to have anti-inflammatory activities because of its inhibitory properties on phospholipase a2 on the release of interleukin and nitric oxide kim et al 1998 byeon et al 2008 backhaus et al 2017 in a similar way sophorolipid injection in animals showed inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide in the treatment of sepsis fu et al 2008 biosurfactant have been also proposed as new molecule for the treatment of autoimmune diseases as well as potent immuno-modulator and anticancer agent sajid et al 2020despite their versatility some biosurfactant are produced by opportunistic bacteria and it is essential to consider their in vivo toxicity and safety scarcity of clinical data on the use and validation of such molecules in animal models and human volunteers pose a major challenge nonetheless some biosurfactants have proven their efficacy in different sectors fulfilling drug regulatory bodies requirements as biocompatible and non-toxic moleculesalthough reasons behind microbial biosurfactant production are currently unresolved a likely explanation has been proposed through evolutionary analyses this view recognizes competitive advantages generated through biosurfactant production aiding in areas such as resource acquisition and defense therefore increasing survivability when compared to other organisms who may be disadvantaged as a result cameotra et al 2010 kiran et al 2015 biosurfactant production has often been found to occur where species have experienced depleted resources as well as during times where they may benefit from their antimicrobial nature previous studies have explored the defensive nature of surfactants by expanding the application of bioactive peptides to inactivate enveloped viruses cyclosporin a csa is a bio-peptide produced from the fungus tolypocladium inflatum already known to inhibit the propagation of the influenza virus by interfering with the viral cycle garoff et al 1998 khan 2017 csa does not affect adsorption or rna replication but instead inhibits steps after protein synthesis such as assembly or budding garoff et al 1998 this is extremely important as budding enables viruses to exit host cells and attach to derived membranes enriched in viral proteins encouraging spread and infection hamamoto et al 2013 by targeting later events of the virus life cycle the problem of resistance to available drugs will be overcome as well as limiting spread lipopeptide used as adjuvant or linked to low mass antigenic molecules have also been used to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies synthetic lipopeptide vaccines have been shown to be able to induce virus specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes against the influenza nucleoprotein epitope deres et al 1989 similar results have been observed against foot-and-mouth disease in vivo b- and th-cell response to hiv-1 wiesmller et al 1989 loleit et al 1996 this might have a very interesting application in novel vaccines discovery and production sophorolipids sl a group of microbial glycolipids produced by yeasts have shown properties as immunomodulators anti-inflammatory and improved sepsis survival in experimental animal models borsanyiova et al 2016 by acetylation of the sophorose head groups sl have been active against herpes virus and hiv virus such modification is considered to improve hydrophilicity of sl thus promoting its antiviral and cytokine-stimulating property shah et al 2005 gross and shah 2007these are potential issues that may arise with sars-cov-2 this necessitates for the screening of potential agents with novel modes of action to eliminate harmful life-threatening effectstimely antiviral administration is key throughout global pandemics and the prompt treatment of ill individuals is key to managing future cases extreme measures such as closing public areas and social distancing may reduce the infection rate of a disease however only antiviral drugs or vaccines are effective in curing and preventing infection when directly exposed to sars-cov-2 when facing a new and previously uncategorized virus vaccine production is likely to be a slow processunless the viral strain closely resembles a previously identified virus in which we have pre-established treatments therefore during such unprecedented times before a cure is available it is vital to encourage safe and efficient cleaning procedures that effectively eliminate dormant forms of the virus that may lay on surfaces in public areas clothes or homesanionic surfactant types are commonly used in cleaning products and detergents when applied to a surface the fatty acid chains of the surfactant bind to the hydrophobic components of microbes while the surfactants hydrophilic domain will simultaneously bind to water with a significant affinity resulting in the solubilization of that microbe this emulsification reaction therefore enables the surface to be cleaned whilst depositing an effective surfactant layer once attached the anionic detergent particles electric charge removes harmful substances from the surface and solubilize them into smaller droplets which results in an emulsification of dirt and detergent as the surfactant molecules are continuously attached to the dirtharmful substance the process of repulsion continues effectively preventing the same particle from being reintroduced to the surface a visual is shown in figure 1surfactants are the single most important ingredients in laundry and household cleaning products and typically account for 1540 of total detergent composition yangxin et al 2008 through increased research various combinations of surfactant types as well as alterations to surfactant volume within existing and new products have proven surfactants to be effective over traditional products such as bleach there is no doubt that bleach has proven itself to be an incredible antimicrobial agent with its active ingredient sodium hypochlorite being effective in destroying bacteria fungi and viruses however bleach can irritate skin airways and mucus membranes which suggests prolonged exposure to be harmful bleach also decomposes under heat and light and reacts easily with other chemicals decreasing its effectiveness improper use of bleach such as deviations from recommended dilutions may also affect performance and its overall use is likely to carry with it its own environmental implications which increase in significance when we consider the large-scale washing of public areas to prevent viral spread all the issues stated above highlight how using bleach alone for disinfection in public areas or areas of high risk such as hospitalssurgeries can involve injury to health-care workers and increase immunosuppression which may lead to increased susceptibility to sars-cov-2 especially in areas where exposure to the virus is more likely world health organization who 2014 therefore using products that contain biosurfactants in conjunction with or as an alternative to heavily chemical cleaners may be more effective in efficient disinfectionbiosurfactants have great advantages as eco-friendly and less-toxic alternative to synthetic surfactant and to date glycolipids sophorolipids rhamnolipids and mannosylerythritol lipids are the most commercialized in cleaning applications by different companies world-wide companies like saraya ecover and henkel apply sl in their laundry dishwashing and cleaning products whereas basf evonik teegene and unilever are commercializing rhamnolipids and lipopeptide biosurfactants based products klosowska-chomiczewska et al 2011 fracchia et al 2014 randhawa and rahman 2014 singh et al 2019since the start of the pandemic in december 2019 demand for various products -especially gloves soaps disinfectants and hand sanitizers has increased dramatically a huge emphasis has arisen on the necessity of cleanliness specifically the efficient cleaning of hands after coming into contact with potentially contaminated surfaces both indoors and outdoors due to this governments globally have had to update and define technical and regulatory standards for such products to ensure safe practice and manufacture whilst dealing with the pandemic information regarding proper hand washing techniques as well as products content has been published specifically the uk government has released technical specifications for the production of hand wash and associated legislation of personal protective equipment ppe as well as prerequisites before items are sold stricter regulations ensure consistency and guaranteed effectiveness of hand washing products which are vital during times of a pandemic cabinet office govuk 2020the effectiveness of hand sanitizers compared to washing hands with soap and water has been of constant debate as of recently the cdc center for disease control and prevention has stated that using soap when washing hands is more effective than hand sanitizer or water alone centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2019 this is because surfactants present in soaps lift and remove microbes harmful substances and dirt from skin furthermore the lather produced from soap as well as effective scrubbing work well to remove contaminantsthe use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contain at least 60 alcohol is still recommended if washing hands with soap is not available hand sanitizers do not get rid of all types of germs and may not be as effective where hands are excessively greasy or dirty centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2019 alcohol is extremely effective but efficacy differs among different types for example ethyl alcohol 70 is a powerful germicide and is considered generally superior to isopropyl alcohol it is also important to consider the prolonged and repeated use of alcohol-based products such as a disinfectant which can cause discoloration and damage to the skin world health organization who 2014 whereas teegene has reported about lipopeptide and rhamnolipid biosurfactant based cosmetics randhawa and rahman 2014 focus on surfactants 2015 and evonik has reported their sophorolipid biosurfactant for skin conditioning refatting and moisturizers properties to be used in shampoo shower gel and household cleaners focus on surfactants 2016 and it also has a potential use in handwash applicationsacute respiratory distress syndrome ards is a progressive medical syndrome characterized by a build-up of fluid in the patients alveoli which result in inefficient oxygen transfer across these alveolar membranes into the blood matthay et al 2019 ards is often a consequence of an already serious medical concern in this case covid-19 with the resulting lack of oxygen to organs contributing to the high fatality rates seen in those who begin to develop symptoms ware and matthay 2000one leading cause for this alveolar fluid build-up in response to infection by sars-cov-2 is surfactant dysfunction which has negative consequences on the emulsification and thereby clearance of liquid from this particular region current treatments for this rely on ventilators to supplement the body with the oxygen which otherwise would not be able to successfully transfer into the blood relieving the immediate symptoms which would otherwise lead to issues such as hypoxia luks et al 2020 socioeconomic factors have played a large role in the effectiveness of such a treatment with providing enough ventilators and facilities for each patient affected proving to be difficult and in some cases impossible considering the cost space and training required to use themwith this in mind biosurfactants present themselves to be a promising area of study in identifying novel treatments for ards which could overcome the socioeconomic barriers that have so far limited the effectiveness of ventilators it is for this reason that future study for their use as a direct treatment for ards through solubilizing the alveolar substrate is likely to generate positive results and is therefore crucial in combating covid-19 in the futurewhen considering possible treatment opportunities for the covid-19 pandemic it is crucial to decide upon a mode of drug delivery which doesnt compromise the molecular nature of the product while also being able to deliver it successfully to the area of interest with the sars-cov-2 predominantly impacting the respiratory system and upper gastrointestinal tract a likely mode of delivery would be via aerosol or lozenge the micellar nature of biosurfactants result in them being the ideal candidates for either system of drug delivery allowing them to form a stable liposome which will encase the drug protecting it from damage which may otherwise cause dysfunction sosnowski and gradon 2009 the physicochemical characteristics of biosurfactants allow them to maintain their integrity while used in an aerosol this would be the likely mode of drug delivery considering the main area of virulence to be within the lungsthe solubility of biosurfactants will work to their advantage throughout this process as they will evidently increase the bioavailability of the drug once it has been administered this self-solubilising nature of biosurfactants therefore advances the drugs dose proportionality resulting in more consistent impacts across patients omkar et al 2020 the ability for biosurfactants to mediate drug delivery is apparent however the benefits of their use in this way are 2-fold in addition to providing safe passage for the drug to the target the biosurfactants will also exhibit natural antiviral properties at the site of infection in addition to also relieving surfactant dysfunction in the alveoli another consequence of sars-cov-2 infection in this way they will be able to inhibit a number of viruses present around that given area while also directly relieving symptoms a significant factor reducing its virulence and transmission between hosts this characteristic has furthermore been expanded upon as researchers ponder the ability for biosurfactants to themselves behave as a treatment in this way one such example includes the addition of clinically approved biosurfactants in gummies or lozenges as they are consumed the biosurfactants will directly reach parts of the mouth and esophagus which may be impacted and therefore provide symptomatic relief vellingiri et al 2020 in addition to this the biosurfactant will likely form a vapor in the mouth which can be inhaled through the process of ingestion allowing it to reach areas of the respiratory tract to potentially provide relief in that area as wellthe covid-19 pandemic is one which has had a detrimental impact on public health seriously hindering the normal functionality of our society and therefore resulting in massive hardship across both our economy and public well-being it is for this reason that scientists have been at a bid to find novel ways in which this pandemic can be combatted across all of its planes of influence throughout our societybiosurfactants have not only proven themselves to be the ideal candidates to behave as this novel solution but have done so in a way which targets many of the avenues that are crucial in resolving a pandemic of this scale their potential in behaving as safe and effective cleaning solutions have been discussed and they have been recognized as being a valid alternative to current procedure in addition to this biosurfactants have been found to act as significant drug delivery systems housing multiple benefits to their use most importantly showing a great potential in being able to successfully deliver drugs maintaining dose proportionality in the process finally the potential for biosurfactants to exhibit medicinal qualities in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection particularly in the relief of symptoms associated with ards have shown exceptional promise the lack of knowledge shrouding this phenomenon therefore justify extensive future research a prominent barrier remains in the large production costs associated with biosurfactant bioprocessing a significant factor which must not be overlooked and should remain a focal point for future study reducing the cost of bioprocessing alongside the continued research of biosurfactant applications in this area are key to success within this fieldthe incredible versatility found across the structure and functions of biosurfactants mean that their reach in effectiveness is by no means limited to the applications which have been so far highlighted as research progresses in this area the feasibility of both their use and their socioeconomic development increase the results of this pandemic have been so far detrimental however it is crucial that we push forward and adapt such ideas in finding the very solutions that we need to combat the consequences of this virus and pathogens in the future in this way biosurfactants bring promise to a scenario that is often shrouded in despair with research and scientific prowess we will not only overcome the issues of this pandemic but we will additionally better equip ourselves for the futureall datasets presented in this study are included in the article supplementary materialms sg pc and pr have equally contributed in the preparation of this manuscriptthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestwith examples of contributions to the field such as alphonse laveran ronald ross and alan magill for malaria1 2 walter reed and william gorgas for yellow fever3 william leishman for leishmaniasis4 and lon lapeyssonnie5 for the african meningitis belt just to cite a few military medicine has and continues to contribute to major scientific advances in the fields of infectious diseases and tropical medicine and as a consequence of travel medicine as data regarding health problems in civilian travelers are globally comparable to those reported in deployed soldiers this chapter will focus on the specifics of the deployed military population and its main incapacitating medical threats the deployed military represent a special category of travelers characterized as a young disciplined trained predominantly male population that is strictly selected controlled and regularly monitored and that typically travels in a group accompanied by some level of medical care medical readiness basically equivalent to the civilian pretravel consultation is an overriding concern of all commanders it is a policy-driven force health protection approach based on physical dental and psychological examinations with mandatory lab andor radiologic investigations according to the service personnels country it includes obligatory health education sessions regarding the specific deployment-related risks and up-to-date immunizations based on the country and services health policies table 361
provides information for us personnel any contraindication for vaccination results in ineligibility for deploymentdeployments usually last from a few days to a year rest and recuperation leave r  r depends on the length of the mission and the institutions policy in the majority of cases military health care providers are deployed with the troops allowing for continuous medical support however due to lack of time or fear of the stigma of appearing weak personnel often do not seek care unless presenting with incapacitating symptomssince the beginning of armed conflicts diseases and noncombat-related injuries ncri have always caused much greater morbidity and mortality than battle injuries as an example the french conquest of madagascar in 1895 resulted in approximately 6000 malaria-related deaths for 30 killed in action6 a recent prospective study fig 361
 showed similar findings with ncri gastrointestinal dermatologic and respiratory disorders representing the leading causes of health issues during deployment the same authors reported a significant burden for infectious diseases 41 of all etiologies with ubiquitous infections in the majority of cases7 as with civilian travelers the use of alcohol and drugs has been associated with an increased incidence of accidents emotional disorders and sexually transmitted infections8 9 10 alcohol-related regulations vary according to the country of origin and country of deployment but the authors recommend restrictions against the use of alcohol on deployment to minimize these risks continuing information and education and prohibiting alcohol and drug useabuse during rotations should help to decrease the rates of ncri and other alcohol andor drug-associated medical issuesnoncombat-related injuries including road traffic injuries are a major cause of soldier attrition during international operations although generally simple to treat during deployment see fig 361 ncri have progressively supplanted combat-related injuries respiratory disease infectious disease and gastrointestinal disorders as the leading cause of hospital admissions during deployment7 11 french authors observed a significantly higher ncri rate in peacekeeping missions lebanon cte divoire versus kinetic combat operations afghanistan7
among musculoskeletal disorders french and us authors showed that low back pain andor sciatica are a significant cause both for seeking care and for medical evacuation7 this is partly because of the heavy load carried by dismounted troopers protection gear weaponry and ammunition food and water specialized equipment that can range between 50 and 100 kg per soldierdespite their relatively low prevalence7 combat-related injuries are the most feared result of military deployment and have a major psychological impact on troops their families and the media and remain the number one priority of the military chain of command lessons learned from recent conflicts have led to major breakthroughs in the field of trauma care tactical combat casualty care improved protection gear and armored vehicles deployed forward surgical teams applying damage control surgery and resuscitation advances in transfusion fresh frozen plasma and platelets lyophilized plasma whole blood transfusion and early medical evacuation have been associated with remarkably improved outcomes for the severely injured12 13 14 15 however the increased survival of patients sustaining severe pelvic spinal and extremity wounds with amputations has highlighted the essential role of rehabilitation medicine improved prosthetics psychiatrists psychologists and social workers in supporting the wounded and their families16
even though they represent a small portion of morbidity in deployed troops psychiatric diseases are among the main causes of evacuation7 moreover most posttraumatic stress disorders occur following deployment7 and symptoms increase the longer the duration after return10 several factors may contribute to susceptibility to emotional or psychological disorders during deployment education prior stressors and childhood adversity emotional isolation concerns about family during deployment working in a new foreign remote and hostile environment with limited individual space restricted and highly secured movements different rest-activity cycle being absent during births and funerals at home exposure to combat stress and witnessing unexpected atrocities wounded and killed comrades10 however a recent prospective study found no association between deployment and suicide in current and former us military personnel17 preventing deployment-related psychiatric disorders relies on a thorough psychological and social assessment as in us and french procedures for example during pre-enlistment medical screening then prior to and following the tour as well as the continuous social support of the families and prohibition of alcohol and drug useabuse during rotationswith the availability of protective countermeasures morbidity and mortality from vectorborne disease have declined during recent military operations but continue to pose significant operational threats to deployed forces18 19 experience has shown that knowledge attitudes and practices on the part of both medical providers and those deployed can have a major impact on disease burden20 21 militaries operationalize protective countermeasures through a layered approach that includes use of permethrin-impregnated uniforms and nets and deet-containing repellents vaccines and chemoprophylaxis medications from its earliest use among allied forces in the pacific campaign of world war ii adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis has been a challenge leading to the dictum that ensuring adherence to chemoprophylaxis is a command responsibility and not just a medical responsibility6 22 23 one notable exception to this experience was the very high rate of reported adherence among us military forces deployed to liberia as part of the ebola response in operation united assistance in 20142015 with no cases occurring while deployed24 faced with high threat of infectious disease during the operation the military health community provided robust expert-level consultation on force health protection measures to all deploying forces and leveraged command support to consistently reinforce prevention policies and procedures25
force health protection policy fhpp set by theater commanders establishes the countermeasures at the unit-level population separate from individualized decision-making that may occur during an individual medical visit specific medication recommendations for a deployed force balance intensity of transmission drug resistance impact of nonadherence on efficacy and medication cost for example current us military policy establishes either atovaquone-proguanil or doxycycline as first line chemoprophylaxis regimens and restricts the use of mefloquine to those both intolerant of first line agents and properly screened for contraindications26 this entails the use in us troops of atovaquone-proguanil in high-threat settings to include most of sub-saharan africa and the use of doxycycline in lower threat regions such as southwest asia another example would be the french health corps policy that uses doxycycline as the only first line chemoprophylactic drug to optimize adherence6 use of primaquine for presumptive antirelapse therapy part is typically recommended following deployments to risk areas for plasmodium vivax and p ovale fhpp is constrained by food and drug administration labeling to restrict the use of investigational products which has historically been applied to dosing considerations of primaquine hence the us military lagged civilian practice using 15 mg of primaquine base daily versus the current recommendation of 30 mg of base daily department of defense dod policies do in fact allow for a standard of care dosage to be recommended under fhpp27 force-wide testing of us recruits for g6pd deficiency is standard practiceleishmaniasis specifically old world cutaneous leishmaniasis has posed a consistent operational threat during recent us and uk military operations in southwest asia recent experience has shown that forces have the greatest risk while theaters of operations are least mature increasing the chance of sleeping on the ground use of improvised shelters and failure to utilize insecticide-treated nets with ultrafine mesh size28 29 recent military experience with leishmaniasis has informed current management recommendations with an emphasis on topical oral or even wound care alone as management for old world cutaneous leishmaniasis30 this approach is especially important from the perspective of maintaining troops in the field and avoiding need for hospitalization or evacuation for parenteral therapyregarding new world cutaneous leishmaniasis in french guiana for example leishmania viannia guyanensis and l v braziliensis are associated with concomitant or late mucosal leishmaniasis that can cause destructive lesions of the nasooropharyngeallaryngeal mucosa as a consequence systemic treatment pentamidine isethionate or meglumine antimoniate requiring close monitoring is recommended for infected french soldiers30
the prevention approach for arboviral diseases centers on the use of vaccines when available and proper wearing of the uniform and repellants the us military currently supports vaccine research programs to develop vaccines against long-term threats such as dengue and emerging threats like zika31 32
sexually transmitted infections stis have always been an important part of military history with non-negligible impact on the operating capacity of troops for example during the peninsular war of 18081814 half of all admissions in british troops were for gonorrhea and syphilis33 the pursuit of pleasure during war campaigns led to the establishment of military brothels that were shut down in the late 20th century but unfortunately replaced by local civilian bordellos the military are an at-risk sexually active population as approximately one-third are in the under 25-year-old age categorythe age range that experiences the highest rate of stis33 high incomes and purchasing power during deployments feeling of invincibility influence of pornography sexual deprivation cultural interactions and group dynamics can generate a high prevalence of sti-associated behaviors like binge drinking and drug use lack of condom use and multiple sexual partnerships9
a recent us study conducted in the navy shifted the focus of sti acquisition among male shipboard sailors from sex workers to predominantly regular sexual partners within the local military community as the consequence of the growing number of female recruits34 other authors showed that familypersonal life stress and psychological distress influenced the number of partnerships more strongly for women than for men9 another emerging issue of the growing number of women in the military is unwanted pregnancies during deployment35 preventing stis and unintended pregnancies requires information and education access to condoms and contraceptives and prohibiting alcohol and drug useabuse during rotationsdue to service personnels living and working conditions such as crowding close contact diminished cleanliness compromised skin integrity friction blisters cracks or tinea pedis in the feet cuts and abrasions military status is a recognized risk factor for streptococcal and staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections impetigo erysipelas cellulitis cutaneous abscesses panton-valentine leukocidin-positive staphylococcus aureus skin infection36 during deployments to tropical or subtropical destinations these skin conditions tend to occur more frequently because of the increased heat and humidity exacerbated by wearing heavy protective gear and reduced washing and laundry facilities in addition they are harder to treat under such circumstances29 these environmental and lifestyle factors also facilitate superficial fungal infections that may develop in 50 of soldiers presenting as tinea pedis tinea cruris tinea corporis tinea axillae tinea capitis onychomycosis andor pityriasis versicolor29 due to the maceration in combat boots feet not only pay a heavy price in terms of fungal and gram-positive cocci infections but also of other conditions such as pitted keratolysis corynebacterium sp fig 362
 these lower limb lesions in turn increase the risk of erysipelas and cellulitis with the potential for significant negative impact on force availability36 additional skin disorders include other corynebacterial infections erythrasma and trichomycosis and heat rash miliaria crystallina miliaria rubra miliaria pustulosa and miliaria profunda tropical climate-related bacterial and fungal infections can also be associated with delayed wound healing37
prevention of these infections is based on strict hygiene measures including washingdrying or changing clothes daily or multiple times a day if needed and if feasible airing skin and feet out when possible regular self-examination of the feet for early treatment of infections and blisters as well as immediate and careful wound management is recommendedother diseases such as scabies sarcoptes scabiei chickenpox varicella zoster virus and measles in case of misdiagnosis during childhood or omitted vaccination are difficult to address in these deployment settings cases should be rapidly diagnosed isolated and treated when possiblegastrointestinal and respiratory infections are among the most common ailments suffered by deployed military and are frequently cited as detrimental to military function38 39 in 20032004 a majority of us personnel reported having suffered from diarrhea 768 in iraq and 544 in afghanistan and respiratory illness 691 overall11 additionally many reported decreased individual performance effectiveness because of the illness diarrhea 46 respiratory 1411 in 2008 50 of a british paratrooper unit in afghanistan was unfit for duty due to diarrhea38
the incidence of diarrhea during deployment is about 57 per 100 person-months38 it is associated with poor hygiene and contaminated food which are encountered more frequently early in a deployment38 where hand-washing facilities are lacking and soldiers can be tempted to try fresh local food instead of eating the canned andor lyophilized nutriments included in their self-contained individual field rations enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec campylobacter and shigella have been identified as causing 3845 of diarrhea40 viral causes are less common but are frequent causes of outbreaks38 prevention is based on rapidly establishing and maintaining effective sanitation and provision of clean food and water to reduce the operational impact of diarrhea and to avoid associated deployment complications of dehydration and heat injury rapid effective treatment with a single-dose antibiotic azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone and loperamide is typically recommended38 41
the risk of respiratory infections is thought to be an increased because of crowded living conditions compounded by relative immune compromise brought on by physical and emotional stress39 this is exacerbated by exposure to dust and smoke extremes of temperature and high altitude and novel pathogens endemic to that region39 clinical presentations include the common cold the flu influenza-like illness bronchitis and pneumonia influenza virus is the classic respiratory scourge of the military but other respiratory viruses such rhinoviruses human coronaviruses respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza virus and adenoviruses are common causes of cold and flu symptoms pneumonia is most often caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza virus pneumonia epidemics due to adenovirus type 14 ad14 reemerged among us military recruits when a vaccine was not available strategies to reduce the incidence and impact of respiratory infections include an emphasis on hygiene measures hand-washing reduced crowding cohorting of ill etc vaccination for common pathogens influenza ad14 antibiotic prophylaxis penicillin in us training camps to reduce group a strep pharyngitis and early diagnosis and directed treatment of infectiondespite the tremendous improvement in hygiene sanitation infection control vaccination and chemoprophylaxis infectious diseases remain a major problem for deployed armed forces in the 21st century as these preventive measures can become neglected over time or disrupted during the early or the most intense stages of military operations dramatic improvements have been made in the last decade regarding combat casualty care not only for physical wounds but also for the invisible ones ie the psychological injuries routine screening following deployments by health care professionals is important to ensure better management of these mental disordersthe opinions or assertions expressed herein are the private views of the authors and are not to be considered as official or as reflecting the views of the american and french military health servicesmaria was distraught after reading about the potential epidemic yet to happen and the horror stories on facebook needing reassurance and certainty about what she should do she requested an urgent appointment to review her treatment plan maria was a 26-year-old woman with relapsing multiple sclerosis who had recently experienced brainstem relapse with double vision and ataxia despite treatment with pegylated interferon-beta for the last 18 months a brain mri performed one month prior had shown 16 new t2 lesions four of which were enhancing one of the enhancing lesions was at the pontomedullary junction and was certainly the cause of her relapse treatment was to be escalated to ocrelizumab with the first dose in a weeks time in view of the emerging coronavirus pandemic she was questioning whether or not she should go ahead with ocrelizumab this was despite only a handful of confirmed covid-19 cases in the country and none in her town and regionif this scenario sounds plausible what should neurologists do human coronaviruses are predominantly associated with respiratory tract infections and includes those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and now the covid-19 pandemicin an uncertain world where we do not have a clear evidence-base you often have to default to scientific principles rather than using the wisdom of the crowd not surprising with italy being one of the epicentres of the covid-19 epidemic the italian society of neurology or sin societ italiana di neurologia broke cover first producing recommendations on the management of patients with ms during the covid-19 epidemic see box 1 the sin guidelines provide relatively straightforward and one could argue arbitrary advice on how to manage patients with ms in the short-term but do not address supervision of these patients in the intermediate or long-term especially those with highly active ms if the public health measures being taken flatten the peak of the epidemic but extend its tail the problem of community-acquired sars-cov2 infection and covid-19 may be with us for many months and potentially years are the sin guidelines compatible with the best interests of our patients or a knee-jerk response to an undefined problem that may not be a problem at allit is clear that covid-19 is a pandemic and global health crisis with the potential to kill millions of people particularly the elderly and people with comorbidities such as hypertension smoking and lung disease at present we do not know if people with ms are at increased risk acquring sars-cov-2 covid-19 or developing severe covid-19 individuals with ms are not unique in their requirement to be treated with immunosuppressive therapies we discussed the covid-19 epidemic with our renal transplant team who informed us that at present they are not taking any specific action about the levels of immunosuppression for their transplant patients during the epidemic basic measures are recommended namely to improve hand and home hygiene to avoid high-risk travel and unnecessary contacts to self-isolate if necessary and to reduce contact with the hospital and other medical institutions as much as possible because they are more likely to be sources of covid-19 it is business as usual nor are they necessarily halting their transplant programme their argument is that transplanted kidneys and other transplanted organs are too precious not to protect them with relevant immunosuppressive drugs why would we not have the same attitude about the brains and spinal cords of our patients with active multiple sclerosiswe could argue that solid-organ transplant patients are significantly more immunocompromised than pwms on disease modifying treatment dmt most transplant patients are on triple immunotherapy compared to pwms who are on monotherapy and even then the level of immunosuppression is generally low hence the mortalitymorbidity risk to an individual on a dmt infected with covid-19 may be actually quite moderate to low another hypothesis being considered is that moderate immunosuppression may prevent severe complications associated with covid-19 infection the severe pulmonary complications of covid-19 infection are consistent with ards acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by an over-exuberant immune response to the virus ramanathan et al 2020 as a result several exploratory trials are currently being undertaken in china and elsewhere using immunosuppressants to try and dampen the immune response to the virus interestingly fingolimod a s1p modulator licensed for ms is being tested as a treatment for covid-19 associated ards clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04280588 interferon beta is also being trialled in covid-19 based on its antiviral properties clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04276688then there is the virology to take into account sars-cov-2 the cause of covid-19 is a new human pathogen that is likely to have recently crossed species andersen et al 2020 covid-19 will eventually become endemic and hence pose a seasonal risk to patients on immunosuppressive therapies as it is a small rna virus with low fidelity it is likely to mutate rapidly making a one-off vaccine only a partial solution vaccines take time to be developed tested and introduced at a population level delaying treatment de-escalating therapy by switching to immunomodulatory dmts such as interferon-beta glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide or interrupting dosing of dmts to wait for a vaccine will delay the adequate treatment of ms especially as it may take 1218 months to develop a vaccine we therefore need a pragmatic response on management of the potential threat of covid-19 in individuals with ms if patients have active ms they need to be treated based on the clinical evidence at hand and hence may need to be treated with higher efficacy dmts this should be implemented in conjunction with appropriate behavioural modifications to reduce or ideally prevent exposure to the virusit is essential to consider the potential risk of morbidity and possible mortality for each ms patient who may be infected with sars-cov-2 and develops covid-19 the individuals risk profile is multifactorial their dmt and consequent immune response is one of the factors other aspects to consider when assessing a respiratory viral infection include smoking practices increased cigarette smoking increases risk ambulatory status less mobility increases risk especially if the patient is in a wheelchair age increasing age increases risk weight increasing weight impacts on ambulation and respiratory function underlying respiratory illnesses such as asthma or copd also the frequency of necessary attendance at a hospital or healthcare facility for laboratory or mri testing but also for infusions may place the patient at a higher risk of exposure in the context of these factors the health care professionals should weigh the potential risks of sars-cov-1 exposure and manage their dmt accordingly visits for ms care should preferably be done by telemedicine or phonethe potential hazards posed by each dmt differ and rather than imposing a blanket rule decisions regarding treatment should be individualised see table 1
 and discussed with patients for some patients having their ms treated and controlled may be more important than the potential danger of being exposed to and acquiring a more severe covid-19 infection table 1 is our attempt to define the risks associated with the different classes of dmts in the event of a patient acquiring a covid-19 infectionassuming that antiviral responses are driven mainly by t-cells in particular cd8 cytotoxic t-lymphocytes and natural-killer cells and less so at least initially by b-cells allows one to construct a hierarchy of immunosuppression of dmts the highest risk are the immune reconstitution therapies during the depletion phase of the treatment ie haematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct alemtuzumab lemtrada mitoxantrone novantrone and cladribine mavenclad after immune reconstitution once the total lymphocyte counts have returned to normal or near normal the risk of severe viral infections are probably no higher than expected for the background population and would be associated with age and other comorbidities please note immune reconstitution takes months to years so if the patients last course of treatment was in the previous 612 months they may still be immunocompromised a total lymphocyte count less 11  109l or 1100mm3 is associated with an increased risk of infection and infection-related mortality warny et al 2018 this risk increases progressively the lower the absolute lymphocyte counts particularly when the lymphocyte count drops below 800mm3 50 risk warny et al 2018 as a rough guide pwms with a lymphocyte count above 800mm3 who grade 2 are able to deal with viral infections reasonably well provided they have no other comorbidities and are relatively youngof the immune reconstitution therapies cladribine mavenclad is classed as intermediate risk because it is a relatively poor t-cell depleting agent stuve et al 2019 t-cells are only depleted post-cladribine by an average of 50 with the cd4 population being more sensitive than the cd8 population in the phase 3 clarity study viral infections were uncommon post-cladribine and apart from herpes zoster infections were no more frequent in cladribine-treated subjects compared to placebo cook et al 2011 when viral infections occurred post-cladribine they tended to be mild or moderate in severity similarly anti-cd20 therapies such as ocrelizumab have a minor impact on t-cell counts and are not associated with severe viral infections mayer et al 2019 in the phase 3 relapsing-remitting and primary progressive trials infections were slightly more frequent on ocrelizumab compared to comparator arms interferon-beta-1a or placebo hauser et al 2017 montalban et al 2017 most of these infections were mild and moderate with the severe infections being bacterial in nature pneumonia urinary tract infections and cellulitis we therefore feel that both cladribine and anti-cd20 therapies are relatively safe to use during the covid-19 pandemic based on their profiles defined in phase 3 trialsthe sphingosine-1-phosphate s1p modulators fingolimod siponimod ozanimod ponesimod work by reducing the egress of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs into the circulation stepanovska and huwiler 2019 the actual degree of lymphopaenia is not associated with their efficacy nor the risk of infection francis et al 2014 overall infectious complications are relatively low on s1p modulators with opportunistic infections emerging over time epstein et al 2018 luna et al 2019 importantly the vast majority of patients on s1p modulators do not have a problem dealing with community acquired viral infections patients on fingolimod who are exposed to and acquire exotic viral infections such as dengue fever seem to deal with them without complications fragoso et al 2016a this is why patients on s1p modulators should be at relatively low risk of complications from covid-19 infection and why it may be safe to continue these treatments during the epidemic fingolimod does however blunt vaccine responses kappos et al 2015 indicating that both the priming and effector arms of the immune system are affected whether this will impact on covid-19 outcomes is at present unknownalthough most neurologists consider natalizumab relatively safe there is a small increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections on this medication kapoor et al 2018 polman et al 2006 rudick et al 2006 and there are theoretical reasons why it may reduce trafficking of lymphocytes in the lung and mucosa woodside and vanderslice 2008 it is clear that natalizumab blocks immune surveillance of the cns hence a person on natalizumab who develops a covid-19 encephalitis could be in danger of major complications of this infection the latter is analogous to pml which is also a viral encephalitis and similar to herpes-simplex and varicella -zoster encephalitis resulting from natalizumab exposure fine et al 2013 coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic and there has been one online case report of a 56-year old chinese man developing covid-19 encephalitis he developed a decreased level of consciousness with a normal ct scan of the brain spinal fluid analysis revealed sars-cov-2 he subsequently made a recovery and was discharged xinhua 2020 there is also clear evidence from the large chinese cohort that anosmia may be an early sign of covid-19 infection suggesting involvement of the neuraxisanother human coronavirus hcov-oc43 which is generally associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections has been shown to have neuroinvasive properties studies in mice have shown that hcov-oc43 can infect neurons and cause encephalitis and cause persistent infections in human neural-cell lines arbour et al 1999 there are case reports identifying hcov-oc43 rna in the cerebrospinal fluid or brain of children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis yeh et al 2004 and acute encephalomyelitis morfopoulou et al 2016 coronaviruses mutate very rapidly and hence may produce neurotropic strains quite quickly the latter is a potential issue in the context of natalizumab which creates an immune privileged site that may allow for the selection of these neurotropic mutants another aspect that needs to be considered is what happens in the gut sars-cov-2 infects the gastrointestinal tract with about 34 of people with covid-19 developing diarrhoea guan et al 2020 sars-cov-2 is shed in the stool holshue et al 2020 natalizumab also reduces lymphocyte trafficking to the gut and is a licensed treatment for crohns disease ghosh et al 2003 will patients on natalizumab and other dmts have increased viral replication in the gut and shedding in the stool will patients on natalizumab and other dmts infected with the virus become superspreaders despite these questions the current science indicates that patients on natalizumab should be able to deal with a novel viral infection such as dengue fragoso et al 2016b reassuringly five patients on natalizumab infected with dengue virus cleared the virus without complications similar to those on fingolimod fragoso et al 2016bclearly any decision to start a dmt during the covid-19 pandemic will need to be taken carefully and will depend on the state of the covid-19 pandemic not only in the particular country concerned but in the specific area the patient lives and receives therapy for example aggressive public health steps to contain the spread of the virus locally may make it relatively safe for a patient to start an immunosuppressive therapy our concern is that the covid-19 pandemic may trigger a large number of neurologists and patients to reconsider treatment strategy and choice of initial dmt and to opt for less effective immunomodulatory dmts this change needs to be considered carefully the covid-19 pandemic in all likelihood will be short lived and it would be unfair to patients treated during the epidemic to be disadvantaged in the long term regarding the management of their ms neurologists have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort to activate the ms community to advance the principle that time is brain to treat ms proactively to a target of no evident disease activity neda and more recently to flip the pyramid and use higher efficacy treatments first line these treatment principles are evidence-based and should not be thrown out in the context of a potential but yet undefined risk to our patients
box 1recommendations on the management of italian ms patients during the covid-19 epidemicsthese are recommendations made by neurologists and infectious diseases specialists whilst we have no evidence-based data at presenttreatment of ms patientsgiven the lack of knowledge or data on the covid-19 disease course in ms patients receiving dmts at present there is no recommendation to stop the different dmts and therefore expose ms patients to the risk of ms exacerbations we therefore recommend continuing the current dmt specifically with-first-line dmts beta-interferons glatiramer acetate teriflunomide or dimethyl fumarate these dmts can be prescribed as usual-fingolimod-natalizumab
for lymphodepleting dmts any decisions about these dmts should be based on individual circumstances-temporarily delay the start of lymphodepleting dmts such as ocrelizumab alemtuzumab rituximab or cladribine-temporarily delay between 6 and 12 months depending on the dmt re-dosing of alemtuzumab ocrelizumab and cladribine this decision should be made according to individual factors such as disease severity and activity for anti-cd2o dmts it is recommended to delay the next dose even beyond 6 months if cd19 and cd20 lymphocyte counts are severely decreased at the time the next dose is due-some special considerations for patients who have already received the first dose of the first cycle it is recommended to give the second dose ie complete the first cycle and extra precautions should be taken
patients with confirmed covid-19 infection withhold any first or second-line dmt until clinical resolution andor approval to continue treatment by an infectious disease specialist note given the potential antiviral activity of beta-interferons the decision to continue this treatment rests with the treating neurologistsymptoms of potential covid-19 infection headache anosmia fever dry cough and astheniawhat to do in the event of covid-19 symptomsinstruct your patients not to attend accident and emergency services to avoid overcrowding and further spreading of the virus instruct your patients to call the local emergency number describe their symptoms and wait for instructionsevaluate the temporary withdrawal of current dmt based on the guidelines provided aboverecommendations for ms patients and healthcare professionals at ms centres-if possible avoid crowded places such as cinemas theatres schools etc-in high risk areas restrict access to ms centres to ms patients only-for patients on immunosuppressive infusion therapies the use of protective surgical-grade masks is recommended-if travelling long distances or using public transport is absolutely necessary it is recommended to use protective masks and hand sanitizing particularly for patients on fingolimod alemtuzumab ocrelizumab cladribine or rituximab-if possible work from home-good personal hygiene is always important specifically it is recommended to wash your hands frequently ideally in an alcohol-based gel 60 alcohol

infection prevention and control departments are comprised of infection preventionists who have a variety of backgrounds traditionally the ip role has been primarily nurse-driven but recent years have seen an influx of epidemiologists as the role increasingly involves hospital epidemiology outbreak investigation and public health response the ip even at the most novice level must have a rudimentary understanding of microbiology disease transmission and public health interventions ip competencies are built up according the association for professionals in infection prevention and epidemiology apic model which is considered the gold standard the apic competency model is based upon a text that includes topics that highlight the range of ip dutiesoccupational health sterilization and disinfection bioterrorism emergency preparedness outbreak response infection prevention in a variety of settings eg behavioral health correctional facilities dental services aseptic technique infection prevention for specialty care populations eg burns pediatrics organ transplants as well as the environmental components to infection prevention work eg waste management heating and ventilation healthcare textiles the duties and capabilities of the ip are required to be extensive and diverse infection preventionists are expected to sit for the certification in infection control cic after 2 years the cic is a complex certification which aims to ensure the ip is well-versed in the variety of issues that plague healthcare systems since the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and 20132016 ebola virus disease outbreaks infection preventionists duties have increasingly involved high-consequence pathogens and emergency preparedness overall infection preventionists are responsible for all manner of infectious disease threats within a healthcare facility regardless of originperhaps one of the most crucial responsibilities of the infection prevention and control program is to perform surveillance and report communicable diseases to local health departments while ipc programs are frequently responsible for reporting hospital-associated infections within their facility it is the responsibility for reporting communicable diseases that is relevant to defense against biological attacks communicable disease reporting requirements also known as infectious disease reporting vary within each state and even county but overall there are state laws requiring medical providers to report notifiable disease to local public health departments 1 while there is variation in the lists of notifiable diseases that states require healthcare providers to report there is a general consistency of common and concerning microorganisms that includes all category a agents and a majority of those listed within the center for disease control and preventions cdc bioterrorism agents page 25 within hospitals and healthcare facilities it is generally the ipc program that is responsible for reporting communicable diseases to local public health authorities while laboratory reporting can and does happen it is mostly incomplete information and commonly limited to the positive laboratory result and the name of the patient the legal responsibility of reporting the communicable diseases ultimately tends to fall upon the infection prevention and control program which must not only report such diseases with complete patient and laboratory information but also within the required time frame state reporting laws dictate the list of notifiable diseases and their required reporting time frame for example in california the california code of regulations requires a report for west nile virus infection be submitted by electronic transmission telephone or mail within one working day of identification while a human or animal case of plague requires immediate reporting by phone 6 these lists mirror that of the cdcs national notifiable diseases surveillance system nndss in essence the reporting structure commonly begins with the ip performing surveillance based off laboratory reports and daily reports of admitting diagnoses for newly admitted patients from this surveillance reporting is performed to the local health department which will then report to the state health department which then reports it to the cdc in short national diseases surveillance and reporting frequently starts with hospital ipc programsipc programs have a critical role in communicable disease reporting which aids in public health response the strength of the infection prevention and control program will be seen in their ability to perform more specific surveillance and real-time disease reporting poorly supported or minimally staffed ipc programs will likely rely solely on microbiology reports and might be delayed in their surveillance and reporting efforts some diseases like kawasaki syndrome cannot be confirmed by laboratory tests which can be challenging but is overcome through daily chart review and a strong relationship with physicians and other clinical staff moreover once a case is identified as a communicable disease that must be reported the skilled ip will not only report the required information eg laboratory results demographics contact info but also relevant medical record information for the condition which will include a timeline of illness travel history physician notes etc such attention to detail facilitates a more rapid and efficient response from public health authorities overall the infection prevention and control program within healthcare facilities is frequently the primary source of communicable disease reporting which is a vital part of public health response during biological eventsipc programs are a connective tissue within the healthcare setting working across professions and job roles to ensure the response to infectious disease threats is appropriate it is the responsibility of the ipc program to ensure that clinical staff follow infection control guidelines but also ancillary staff which includes but is not limited to environmental services facilities sterile processing and disinfection laboratory security or food services ipc coordinates with these departments to ensure the proper education and compliance is ongoing as interaction with patients is not solely limited to healthcare providers aside from ensuring infection control practices are followed the ipc program must also coordinate with different departments within the healthcare facilitysystem to ensure the proper expertise are being utilized consider the role of construction or facilities maintenance a relatively simple task like installing cabling or renovating a new space can bring with it substantial patient safety concerns due to dust mold etc ipc must consider the full spectrum of affected people and departments during biological incidents for example during a public health emergency or treatment of a patient in enhanced precautions ipc must coordinate with environmental services to ensure proper waste disposal is being performed in the event of a pediatric patient with ebola virus disease ipc must ensure that child life services are able to provide recommendations and guidance in regards to the unique needs of pediatric patients such unique situations require ipc response and coordination of expert opinions to ensure the most appropriate actions are taken during an influx of patients with an infectious disease or in the wake of an attack ipc will be an integral component to hospital response and coordination of efforts in emergent situations the hospital incident command system hics may be initiated of which ipc plays a vital role in providing instructions and expert recommendationspersonal protective equipment ppe in the healthcare setting includes gloves gowns masks shoe covers and eye-protection these items are the most common and frequently used ppe during patient care but additional ppe may be recommended in emergent situations ppe provides a mutual benefit to both patient and healthcare worker as it reduces the spread of diseases between the two parties correct utilization of ppe decreases the microbial burden in the environment as well preventing the spread of disease through cross-contamination ppe is mutually beneficial within the care process which should be taught in training to encourage compliancedonning and doffing ppe is a critical component to efficacy improper use of ppe is common among healthcare workers as the time to properly don can be taxing or because it is thought to be easier to continue wearing ppe if only leaving a patients room momentarily eg keeping a facemask on while running to the medication room for ppe to be effective it must be donned prior to entering the patient room and doffed prior to leaving or upon exiting depending upon the layout of the care area to avoid contamination of the hospital unit ppe should always be changed between patients and should never leave the patients room regardless of how short a simple task may appear if a patient is in isolation anyone entering the room should don ppe regardless of whether the planned task does not involve patient interaction or expected contact with the environment once in the patients room one cannot predict what will be needed or if an emergency will occur meaning that ppe should be worn at all times while caring for a patient in isolationisolation precautions and the required ppe range from standard precautions to airborne isolation all of which have different and distinct requirements adherence to cdc isolation precaution guidelines and manufacturer recommendations for the ppe are imperative for the treatment of patients with infectious diseases regardless of origin vigilant adherence to proper isolation and ppe guidelines will aid in infection prevention and control efforts which can halt an outbreak in its tracks ppe can and should be worn by visitors of the patient however this is limited to ppe that does not require fit-testing ie respiratory protection for patients with airborne microorganisms like n-95 masks should not be worn by visitors or patients as they require special fit-testing to ensure proper sizing during hospitalization the room of an contagious patient should have the proper signage on the door indicating which transmission-based precautions are being used so that all staff or visitors entering may wear the necessary ppestandard precautions also referred to universal precautions are basic precautions that should be utilized on all patients as a means of reducing the transmission risk of for instance bloodborne pathogens 37 the most basic premise is to use hand hygiene and assess the risk of a potential exposure to blood or other potentially contaminated material eg urine feces breast milk and use the corresponding ppe standard precautions encourage the healthcare worker to consider the tasks being performed and apply critical thinking to the risk of potential exposure and then select ppe based upon this assessment for example drawing blood typically only calls for gloves but if the patient is thrashing or aggressive the healthcare worker should consider eye protection another component to standard precautions is respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette this lesson was developed and became essential during the sars outbreak and has now become a staple within universal precautions respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette highlights the importance of education for healthcare workers patients and visitors to ensure they cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing perform hand hygiene following exposure to respiratory secretions and practice spatial separation of febrile persons with respiratory symptoms the goal of standard precautions is to ensure that at the most basic level healthcare workers are protected against blood and other potentially contaminated material through hand hygiene and risk-based ppe utilization additional transmission-based precautions such as contact isolation precautions build upon standard precautions meaning that standard precautions will always be usedthe most basic and effective tool in the infection prevention arsenal is hand hygiene competent hand hygiene practices can prevent the transmission of diseases making it the foundation for infection prevention 32 efforts to maintain compliance can be challenging as healthcare workers are expected to perform hand hygiene before and after patient interaction 30 31 the new who model for hand hygiene goes beyond the before and after patient care practice and emphasizes moments during the patient care process the five moments of hand hygiene frequently called 5 moments model emphasizes a broader approach to hand hygiene that encompasses the intricacies of patient care the whos 5 moments model is increasingly becoming the standard practice and includes five moments in which hand hygiene should be performed before patient contact before aseptic tasks after body fluid exposure risk after patient contact and after contact with patient surroundings 7 hand hygiene should also be performed after removing gloves gloves can easily be seen as a cure-all protective barrier however hand hygiene should be performed following their removal as leakage during care and cross-contamination during removal is possible 8hand hygiene is performed with either soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer according to the cdc washing with soap and water for 1520 seconds should be performed when hands are visibly soiled after known exposures to clostridium difficile after known or suspected exposures to patients with diarrhea during a norovirus outbreak when exposure to bacillus anthracis is suspected or proven before eating and after using the restroom if none of those situations are applicable alcohol-based hand sanitizer is recommended and considered the most effective product alcohol-based hand sanitizer composed of 6095 alcohol to maintain efficacy is an easy and effective manner for hand hygiene that takes roughly 20 seconds to dry depending upon the situation alcohol-based hand sanitizer can easily provide staff with an effective and timely method for cleaning their hands which significantly improves compliancecontact isolation precautions are used for microorganisms that are transmissible through touch or contact with the patient or a contaminated item fomite contact precautions include wearing a gown and gloves during interaction with the patient or their environment the most common examples of infections in which contact isolation is used include diarrheal illnesses methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and draining abscesses contact precautions should also be taken during the care for patients infected with known or suspected multi-drug resistant microorganisms human parainfluenza virus hpiv infection in pediatric patients poliovirus vaccinia virus adverse events following vaccination like generalized vaccinia or conjunctivitis etc broadly speaking contact precautions should be used for patients with diarrhea or draining wounds and should be considered for children who have respiratory illnesses the necessary ppe for contact precautions gown and gloves should be donned appropriately before entering the room and removed at the threshold prior to exiting depending on the make of the gown it is important to follow manufacturers recommendations for removal like pulling away from the body to break any ties in the back and wear ie wearing the gown over the shoulders not hanging down around the elbows contact precautions are an effective practice for protecting the healthcare worker against infectious diseases that are spread through touch and fomitesdroplet isolation precautions are used to help stop the spread of microorganisms that are spread through tiny droplets that are disseminated through sneezing and coughing the most common causes of droplet precautions are pneumonia seasonal influenza pertussis and bacterial meningitis droplet precautions can frequently be confused with airborne precautions but these precautions focus on those microorganisms that are transmitted via droplets during close proximity interactions 9 to protect against droplet-spread microorganisms a surgical mask should be worn while in the patients room the mask should be put on prior to entering the room and removed upon exiting the room while most ppe should not be worn outside of the room a surgical mask should be discarded in the trash after leaving the room 10 hand hygiene should be performed after the mask is removed upon exiting of the room masks should always be disposed of after leaving the room and should not be re-used for multiple patients as the mask is considered contamination after being touched in emergent conditions there have been situations that call for re-using masks if supplies are limited however these should be evaluated during the event and not a common practice the association of perioperative registered nurses aorn food and drug administration fda who and cdc all recommend disposal of fda-approved medical masks after single use and that healthcare workers should don a new mask for each contact with a new patient 11 aorn highlights the hazards of reusing surgical masks by saving them or hanging them around the neck droplet precautions are an effective infection control strategy for preventing the spread of infectious diseases that are spread via droplets and close contactairborne isolation precautions are required during the care of patients who have or are suspected of having diseases like tuberculosis measles or chickenpox which are caused by small organisms 5 m in diameter that easily flow on air currents patients infected with such pathogens are capable of transmitting disease through respiratory secretions that are aerosolized during coughing sneezing suctioning procedures etc airborne precautions are perhaps the most challenging as they require healthcare workers to wear appropriate respirators that have been fit-tested adherence to airborne isolation requires healthcare workers to be fit-tested to ensure the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh-approved n-95 or higher level respirators maintain a proper seal around the face these masks should be donned prior to entering the room removed after exiting the room and then disposed ofone of the most crucial aspects of airborne precautions is that the patient must be in an appropriate negative air pressure room negative pressure rooms also called airborne isolation rooms or aiir are designated rooms with the proper engineering controls to ensure that aerosol particles containing microorganisms 5 m in diameter are kept inside the room it is vital to maintain negative air pressure as it ensures that the air flow is from outside into the room which prevents such microorganisms from being carried into the hallway and adjacent spaces more information on negative air pressure rooms can be found in the section on environmental infection control if a patient is suspected of having a disease that requires airborne isolation it is critical to have them wear a surgical mask until a negative pressure room is available one of the most common sources for exposures is delay in placing the patient into airborne isolation healthcare workers should don n-95 respirators while in the patients room and the patient should wear a regular surgical mask during transportation or in an area that is not negative pressure the use of a surgical mask for patients acts as a protection for those in the rest of the healthcare spaceairborne isolation is perhaps the most prudent during bioweapons-related or high-consequence biological events patients with high-consequence pathogens such as monkeypox sars smallpox viral hemorrhagic fevers mers and influenza require airborne isolation with some additional isolation precautions airborne isolation is the most challenging aspect of dealing with such biological threats as it requires the unique environmental controls that can pose challenging during an influx of patients with infectious diseases or in resource poor areas a recent who report highlighted the role of healthcare facilities and infection control failures in mers outbreaks which underscores the consequences of ppe and infection control failures 12 13 it is a common practice in healthcare that a patient with a coughfever has to wear a mask until infectious etiologies can be ruled out by simply having a potentially sick patient wear a surgical mask during the triage process healthcare workers and other patients can be protected regardless whether the patient has an infectious disease that is spread by droplet or airborne mechanisms although airborne isolation can be the most taxing in terms of ensuring properly fitted masks are used and negative pressure rooms are available these are vital components to infection control for high-consequence and highly transmissible diseasesin many cases combining isolation precautions is most beneficial as medical care grow is in complexity and more people are involved in patient care there is a higher risk for spreading microorganisms via aerosol-generating procedures or contaminated surfacesobjects additional ppe like bootshoe covers caps etc may be utilized in such isolation practices however proper ppe donning and doffing practices should always be followed 33 some microorganisms like human herpesvirus 3 hhv-3 varicella-zoster virus require a combination of airborne and contact isolation due to the nature of the illness they cause and transmission mechanisms it is also common in pediatric care to combine contact and droplet isolation during the care of patients with respiratory viruses eg human metapneumonvirus respiratory syncytial virus rhinovirus as children frequently spread such microorganisms through touch for example according to cdc guidelines respiratory infectious diseases except for influenza pertussis etc only require standard precautions in adults however in infants and young children standard plus contact isolation is encouraged which emphasizes the need to assess the patient population when considering isolation precautions during care combination precautions are especially beneficial if microorganisms are isolated from multiple sources such as a patient with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolated from both a draining wound and an endotracheal secretion typically contact precautions are sufficient however if the microorganism is isolated in respiratory secretions it is suggested that droplet precautions also be usedthere is an increasing practice of combining and enhancing isolation precautions for severe high-consequence or novel infections as research is ongoing regarding their transmission mechanisms enhanced isolation goes beyond just combining transmission based precautions but adding additional measures and processes 33 34 ebola virus disease sars mers and many other diseases require a combination of isolation precautions that include airborne and contact prevention measures but also enhanced isolation practices that include additional ppe and precautions novel or emerging infectious diseases may require an amalgamation of isolation precautions especially in advanced medical settings the 20132016 ebola virus disease outbreak highlighted the challenges of managing patients in american hospitals and required substantial revisions to existing ppe and isolation guidelines at the most rudimentary level isolation precautions should be designed around the transmission mechanisms of the infectious disease sars and mers coronaviruses are primarily spread through respiratory droplets which caused significant issues in the early stages of outbreaks due to delayed airborne isolation on the other hand ebola virus disease cases within the united states revealed gaps in isolation guidance and preparedness when responding to patients with emerging infectious diseases although aerosol-generating procedures were a topic of concern for sars and mers respiratory precautions were already considered for isolation precautions the limited experience and knowledge among healthcare workers surrounding ebola virus disease also posed unique challenges for training on enhanced isolation precautions and ppe during the 20132016 outbreak overall enhancing isolation precautions is a helpful strategy for handling a novel or emerging infectious disease especially if newer or more invasive medical procedures or pediatric patients are involved one of the most common lessons infection preventionists highlight for clinical staff is that it is always better to quickly initiate isolation precautions and remove them later than find out hours or days into a patients care that they were contagious patients may voice frustration with being placed in isolation but delay in isolating a patient who potentially has an infectious disease runs the risk of furthering disease transmissionvisitors play a significant role in the well-being of hospitalized patients however they also can facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases healthcare facilities will ultimately need to grapple with balancing patient satisfaction and the potential for visitors to act as amplifiers of disease especially during outbreaks adherence to isolation precautions and hand hygiene is vital among healthcare workers but the role of visitors has also become a topic of concern there is substantial evidence for the horizontal transmission of even multi-drug resistant microorganisms involving the hands and attire of healthcare workers however consideration must also be given regarding the role of visitors in infection prevention and control 14 while there is no universal recommendation for handling visitor compliance to standard or more advanced precautions it is encouraged that those visiting a contagious patient should use ppe for their own safety the society for healthcare epidemiology of america shea has provided recommendations that highlight the challenges in enforcing visitor compliance but also notes that it is crucial to consider the infectious microorganism when dealing with visitors who are unwilling to follow precautions proper education and guidance on ppe donning and doffing should be given to visitors however hand hygiene is perhaps the most important and likely practice to be followed shea notes that hospital visitors may play a significant role in the ecology of healthcare-associated infections but few visit more than one patient which makes the transmission between visitors and multiple patients less likely 14 there is a consistent challenge in enforcing compliance with visitors and little research that has focused solely on their compliance and role within healthcare-associated disease transmission several things should be considered to address visitors of patients in isolation for an infection if the visitor is a household contact and likely to already be exposed the concern then becomes if they are already infected and potentially contagious if the visitor is a breast-feeding mother who is involved in the care of the patient it is unlikely isolation precautions can be enforced many hospitals within the us also make it a practice to screen visitors during respiratory virus season to prevent symptomatic visitors from exposing patients or staff 35 this practice should be considered for visitors of such patients especially if they are house-hold or close contacts and may be a source for further transmissionpatients with high-consequence diseases like ebola virus disease or sars may pose a unique challenge for healthcare workers in terms of visitors and isolation precautions and should addressed on a case by case basis cdc recommendations for visitors of ebola virus disease patients include that healthcare workers should avoid entry of visitors into the patients room and that visits should be scheduled and controlled 15 visitors played a significant role in furthering the spread of sars and mers during outbreaks and consideration should be given to restricting the number of visitors during such events a recent who report on mers found that of the cases between december 2016 and july 2017 31 were associated with transmission in a healthcare facility including healthcare workers patients sharing roomswards with mers patients and visitors 12 13 cdc guidance for infection control during treatment of patients with sars also encourages limiting visits to those who are necessary for the patients emotional well being ensuring public health during outbreaks inherently trumps visitation 16 visitors should be educated and encouraged to wear the necessary ppe when visiting an isolated patient at the bare minimum it is prudent to educate and encourage visitors to practice hand hygiene upon entering and exiting the patients roomairborne isolations pose a challenge for visitor compliance since hospitals can not support fit-testing visitors for n-95 masks or other respirators each situation should be evaluated on an individual basis surgical masks can provide some protection but will not provide a true seal it is a common practice for many healthcare institutions to allow house-hold contacts to visit a patient in airborne isolation without a mask or wearing a surgical mask since exposure has likely already occurred in this situation consideration should be given for exposure from that visitor to healthcare workers and others after they have left the negative pressure room it may be prudent to have visitors in such situations wear a surgical mask upon exiting the patients room and wear it until they exit the hospitalvisitor adherence to isolation precautions is challenging for even the most common hospitalizations staff compliance and vigilance can be a strong role-model and reminder for visitors especially in regards to hand hygiene in the event of a bioweapons-related attack or outbreak of a highly infectious disease ie ebola virus disease visitor protocols should be established unique events and microorganisms can pose a challenge for isolation precaution compliance and recommendations may need to be modified for novel or specific situations ie caring for a pediatric patient and maintaining parentguardian visitor isolations changes to ipc guidelines for such unique situations should be done in conjunction with cdc and other expert guidance and discussed in a multidisciplinary setting to ensure support is facility-wide in these situations allowance of visitors and ppe recommendations should be made on a case by case basis visitors do play a significant role in infection prevention and control within the healthcare environment which makes their adherence to standard precautions and isolation precautions important and challengingtransmission-based precautions should be maintained until the patient is no longer considered capable of transmitting the disease the cdcs guidelines for isolation precautions is an excellent resource for duration of isolation consideration should be given for immune status of the patient as immunocompromised patients may need to be isolated for longer periods of time due to lengthier microorganism sheddingisolating patients with the appropriate transmission-based precautions is often done during admission however if patients are transferred to the healthcare facility and there is already suspicion of an infectious disease this may also determine where the patient is placed there is a myriad of components that impact patient placement and such efforts should be performed with ipc in mindalthough many healthcare facilities have private rooms there is always the possibility that patients may have to share rooms efforts should be made to place patients with infectious diseases that are transmitted via the contact droplet or airborne route in private rooms consideration for route of transmission should always be made during patient admission which would determine both isolation status and patient placement patients needing airborne isolation require rooms that maintain negative pressure which are typically only a handful of rooms per care area these patients should be place within private negative pressure rooms there is an increasingly common practice of requiring private rooms for patients infected with highly resistant microorganisms such as carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae cre or multidrug-resistant tb mdr-tb patient placement should be determined with transmission-based precautions in mind and efforts should be made to ensure patients with highly contagious or high consequence pathogens eg ebola virus sars and mers coronaviruses are in private isolation rooms per cdc guidelinesthe ebola virus disease outbreak in 20132016 highlighted the role of healthcare worker transmission not only between themselves but also among patients cdc guidelines encouraged healthcare facilities to minimize staff with direct patient care it was encouraged that those staff caring for a person under investigation pui or infected with ebola virus be dedicated to that patient as to minimize the potential for additional exposure during the 2011 outbreak of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumonia at the national institute of healths clinical center ipc staff adopted a series of control measures that included cohorting limiting activities of hospital staff exposed to infected patients and hiring monitors to ensure healthcare providers were wearing appropriate ppe and using hand hygiene 18 facilities should have policies developed and in place for those staff who may be exposed during their duties incidents involving bioweapons novel or emerging infectious diseases or high consequence pathogens will surely require unique guidelines that could test the capacity for hospitals it behooves healthcare facilities and preparedness efforts to consider staffing and cohorting needs during such challenging situationsthe initial interaction a patient within a healthcare facility or urgent care unit is the first opportunity to identify risk for infection the triage process determines the degree of urgency of the patients condition which then decides the order they are seen during this process there are many opportunities to not only identify patients with potentially contagions infections but also rapidly isolate them to prevent further exposure to staff and other patients it is encouraged for triage staff to provide patients presenting with a cough ie a potential respiratory infection a mask to wear during their time in a waiting room this simple act can be hugely preventative whether the patient has influenza mers or tbwhile the triage process primarily focuses on medical questions this is also an opportunity for questions regarding international travel and fever since the sars outbreak in 2002 it has become a relatively common practice to incorporate a question within the patient screeningtriage process regarding international travel and fever travel history is always an important component to the patients medical history but we should not forget its significance during triage and patient screening presence of fever is a standard part of the medical triage and intake during initial screening and if the patient is febrile questions regarding travel history become that much more important there are a mixture of recommendations regarding processes but it is consistently thought that if a patient with an acute illness eg fever within 2 weeks diarrhea has traveled outside the us within the last 21 days the patient should be isolated isolation should be based upon the presenting signs and symptoms but providers should also consider the area of travel and if there are ongoing epidemiologically-significant outbreaks during outbreaks like those of sars and mers screening and triage can include questions regarding not just travel but also exposure or close contact with a sick person who recently traveled to those areas or was infected the screening and triage process is especially beneficial for early detection and isolation of potentially infectious patients because it can easily be modified screening questions can be added or removed based upon healthcare needs while the standard questions remain the same questions about specific travel or exposures can be added during times of public health crises questions related to travel history should be maintained during all times though and it is encouraged that patients with an acute illness and international travel within 21 days be placed in a private room until further evaluation by a healthcare provider measles and tb are frequent suspected in patients with respiratory symptoms and a recent international travel history however the inclusion of travel history in medical triage and screening can also potentially capture cases of avian influenza mers viral hemorrhagic fever etcpatients are frequently transported throughout the hospital during their care which can make maintaining isolation precautions challenging it is encouraged for patient transportation to be limited but there are several recommendations to further reduce the spread of disease during patient movement using appropriate barriers is crucial during the transportation of an infectious patientpatients in contact isolation are encouraged to change into a new hospital gown or attire and should be transported on a wheelchair or bed covered with a clean sheet or other barrier infectious skin lesions should be covered the transporter should wear the appropriate ppe while assisting the patient into or out of the covered wheelchair or bed which should then be removed upon exiting the room gown and gloves are not required during the transport of patients in contact precautions the cdc notes that when transport or movement in any healthcare setting is necessary ensure that infected or colonized areas of the patients body are contained and covered 17 those patients in droplet or airborne isolation should wear a mask during the transportation process it is important that notification of the patients isolation status be done to the receiving department or healthcare personnel to facilitate the continuation of isolation precautionsdespite best efforts patients are not always isolated or transported appropriately if a patient with an infectious disease has potentially exposed a considerable number of staff and other patients infection prevention and control programs may be used to the contain further spread all exposures are not equal meaning that mrsa is a common microorganism within the community and an exposure response is often not warranted whereas exposure to mycobacteria or a more severe illness may require follow-up these responses should be determined by the ipc program occupational health and the medical directors associated with these programs in conjunction with hospital administration post-exposure prophylaxis may be necessary for staff and patients but medication distribution should be determined by the appropriate hospital experts hospitals and ipc programs should have a functioning process for determining patients with exposure to specific staff or in other patients ie those in the waiting lobby of an emergency department commonly exposure monitoring and notifications are used for patients visitors and staff exposed to measles pertussis etc as post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended ipc programs might monitor admitted patients who were exposed or potentially isolate them during the incubation period exposures may also be the result of infectious healthcare staff which may require patient notification overall these events should be addressed on an individual basis and adequate response measures should be applied to reduce the time between exposure and follow-upcleaning and disinfection of non-critical surfaces is a basic premise of infection control practices especially standard precautions 17 these practices become even more significant when caring for patients with infectious diseases cleaning is the process of removing pathogens whereas disinfecting kills germs on the surface and sanitizing lowers the number of pathogens on an object to a safe level rutala and weber provide an extensive outline of such methods for cleaning which includesterilization destroys all microorganisms including bacterial sporeshigh-level disinfection destroys all microorganisms except high numbers of bacterial sporesintermediate level disinfection destroys vegetative bacterial mycobacteria most viruses most fungi but not bacterial sporeslow-level disinfection destroys vegetative bacteria some fungi and viruses but not mycobacteria or spores
such practices should be closely followed especially in the event of novel or severe illnesses requiring enhanced precautions disinfection recommendations may be revised based upon recommendations from osha and the cdc as was seen during treatment of patients with ebola virus disease in us hospitals environmental contamination can be a significant mechanism for disease transmission during patient care and invasive procedures can increase this substantially poorly disinfected or sterilized equipment has been the culprit of many healthcare-associated infections and outbreaks high-touch surfaces or objects like sinks and bedrails require frequent cleaning and disinfection frequency and intensity of cleaning and disinfection may also need to be increased depending up on the degree of environmental contamination 17 environmental protection agency epa-registered disinfectant should be used to combat the environmental contamination that occurs during patient care it is important to note that certain pathogens may be resistant to routine disinfectants eg rotaviruses noroviruses clostridium difficile bacillus anthracis meaning that healthcare workers should ensure the cleaning product they are using is effective against the specific microorganism disinfection and sterilization of medical equipment should always follow manufacturer recommendations and be handled with carethere are frequently forgotten objects and surfaces that are common culprits for contamination and should be highlighted during routine cleaning computer keyboards stethoscopes and clinical work stations are all areas that routinely have a high microbial burden and are frequently neglected during cleaning there is extensive literature on practices for disinfection and sterilization but at the most basic level preparedness and response efforts should work to ensure routine cleaning and disinfection is done appropriately and correctly 36 in emergency situations a quick lesson is always to work from clean to dirty and consider all surfaces and objects environmental contamination is a continued source for disease transmission in healthcare these practices should be strengthened during routine care and also refined to meet special needs during public health emergencies and care of patients in enhanced precautionshospital ventilation systems are a critical component to patient safety these systems maintain negative pressure within airborne isolation rooms and positive pressure in operatingprocedure rooms as well as protective precaution rooms for severely immunocompromised patients negative pressure rooms will become a critical need in outbreaks of microorganisms that require airborne isolation these rooms should have high-efficiency particulate air hepa and should also follow cdc guidelines for environmental infection control regarding air exchanges per hour ach ie 12 ach for new construction as of 2001 6 ach for construction before 2001 and be monitored in accordance with engineers and manufacturers recommendations 19 the negative pressure rooms should maintain air pressure by being properly sealed and are encouraged to have self-sealing doors and ante-rooms the heating ventilation air conditioning hvac systems should also have humidity monitors to ensure the moisture levels are adequate as to discourage microbial growth the cdc has specific recommendations for air-handling systems in healthcare facilities which are vital to patient safety and reduction of disease transmission in the event of a biological attack or outbreak ensuring that these systems are operational and can maintain proper negative pressure in designated rooms will be of the utmost importance although negative pressure rooms are limited on each hospital unit there is potential to convert entire units to negative pressure through adjustments to the ventilation system and sealing of the unit 20environmental cleaning waste management and handling of textiles are all components of environmental service work in healthcare these duties are especially important upon discharge of the patient when a deep clean of the room is required commonly called terminal cleaning within a single day of admission the composition of a hospital rooms microbes begin to change and mirror that of the patient 21 combatting the bacterial communities that develop within the healthcare environment is an ongoing struggle that emphasizes the important of adequate and consistent environment services environmental services staff frequently manage these tasks and should be aware of the patients isolation status so that staff utilizes proper ppe and ensures use of proper environmental protection agency epa-registered disinfectants example clostridium difficile requires the use of bleach products to kill spores typically hospitals have contracts with linen services and waste management companies for both regular and medical waste however practices may change during the care of patients with high consequence pathogens that require enhanced isolation cdc guidelines regarding medical waste dishes and eating utensils and textiles all note that these objects have not been implicated in sars coronavirus transmission and that routine procedures should be utilized 22 in the case of ebola virus recommendations were significantly different for example despite ebola virus forming enveloped virions which are susceptible to a wide range of hospital disinfectants no epa-registered disinfectants had labels that specifically cited efficacy against the virus consequently cdc recommendations were changed to encourage use of epa-registered disinfectants that were effective against viruses that form non-enveloped virions which are more resistant to hospital germicidal disinfectant cleaning products cdc recommendations also included discarding of all textiles to avoid staff exposure during the laundering process 15 many hospitals developed ebola virus preparedness plans that placed environmental service duties more on the clinical staff caring for a pui instead of potential exposing additional staff environmental services practices should be closely followed during routine patient care but may require modification during the care of patients in enhanced precautions or during outbreaksin the pursuit of more effective and efficient cleaning and disinfecting processes newer technologies have been utilized like that of ultraviolet disinfection technology and copper-infused linen environmental monitoring to check room cleaning quality is also a frequently used measure to test true cleaning of the space overall environmental infection control by means of environmental services staff textile care and waste management are critical components to breaking the chain of infection the efficacy of these duties and the adherence to transmission-based precautions when working throughout a healthcare facility is a monumental task and becomes even more critical during outbreaksthere is a considerable amount of literature and regulatory guidance on environmental infection control as it relates to water however this section will focus on only a handful firstly facilities should consider the mechanisms for preventing the spread of waterborne microorganisms through proper hand hygiene cleaning of sinks avoidance of decorative fountains and fish tanks in patient-care areas and maintaining proper temperatures for hot and cold water 19 should water disruptions occur corrective decontamination of the hot water system may be necessary which can include flushing the water lines and outlets with chlorine andor superheated water hospitals should have contingency plans for water in the event that water disruptions are prolonged due to intrusions or contaminationconstruction renovation remediation repair and demolition within a healthcare environment can be sources for infection all work must be reviewed by infection prevention and control to coordinate prevention methods that include containment barriers and post-construction cleaning such efforts are necessary as demolition can lead to airborne infections associated with fungal spores in immunocompromised patients moreover if the proper planning is not done engineering outages can impact negative pressure rooms which decreases their efficacy conversion of spaces to negative pressure wards or specialty isolation units should be planned and tested ahead of time to ensure proper ventilation is possiblein the day-to-day world of medical care infection prevention and control practices like hand hygiene frequently have poor compliance 23 while there are a multitude of issues that ipc programs face perhaps the most damning one is internally typically ipc programs are seen as cost centers and not revenue generators which frequently translates to lackluster support and prioritization 24 medicine and healthcare are competitive markets meaning that those programs seen from this light are likely to receive cuts while there have been studies evaluating the cost of healthcare-associated infections in relation to that of an ipc program there is a considerable gap within the research regarding ipc programs and response during outbreaks or cases of high-consequence pathogens given that a single healthcare-associated infection hai like a surgical-site infection can cost upwards of 50000 and preventing just a handful of these infections can pay for the entire budget of an ipc program it is not unreasonable to think that such cost-saving could be applied to biothreat response within hospitals 25 the cases of ebola virus disease in dallas texas in 2014 exposed the lack of preparedness within us hospitals poor compliance with infection control and the cost of treating such a severe illness with enhanced precautions it was estimated that the cost of treating a hospitalized patient with ebola virus disease in the united states is 30000 per day 26 despite spending 60 billion on biodefense since 2001 to prepare for biothreats a single imported case of ebola virus disease revealed deep breaks within us preparedness efforts 27 during the 20132016 ebola virus disease outbreak it frequently fell on the ipc programs to coordinate hospital-wide preparedness and response efforts to ensure facilities were prepared to identify isolate and potentially treat a patient while such events highlight the importance of ipc programs and the diversity of their responsibilities for many in healthcare the looming threat of ebola has passed and so has the support the focus for many ipc programs has gone back to preventing hais and ebola virus disease response plans have been neglected a 2015 apic survey found that 92 of ipc program leaders believe they were more prepared than the previously year to receive a patient with a highly infectious disease 28 while this is encouraging would hospitals and ipc programs feel the same today several years after the 20132016 ebola virus disease outbreak there is a substantial need within healthcare to truly support ipc programs for not only day-to-day hai prevention but also as a means of establishing an all-hazards approach infection prevention and control as shown within this chapter involves collaboration with many internal and external partners to ensure patient safety ipc programs are sentinels within hospitals alerting internal and external partners of issues so that they may form a collective response effort it behooves bio-preparedness efforts to utilize ipc programs and consider ipc practices as a vital resource for disease control medical countermeasures and surveillancewhile advances in medicine have given us the capabilities to increasingly counter disease the invasiveness of certain medical procedures and treatments can pose substantial infection control risks the treatment of thomas duncan the first ebola virus-diagnosed patient in the united states in a seemingly regular hospital without specialized training or facilities to handle a patient under enhanced precautions points to this very dilemma in the weeks following his hospitalization there were conversations in hospital around the us as to the safety and ethical considerations for more invasive and riskier medical interventions during the treatment of a patient with such an infectious disease medical interventions like invasive surgery dialysis insertion of central lines ventilation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo or even labor and delivery all carry inherent risks for the staff performing them the outbreaks of sars and mers coronaviruses and ebola virus disease all challenged ppe and isolation recommendations requiring changes to protect healthcare workers and visitors during treatment especially those interventions that generate aerosols these outbreaks have taught vital lessons regarding the life-saving capabilities of modern medicine and technology but also reveal a lack of preparedness consideration for medical interventions in patients with such severe and uncommon diseases future efforts should establish treatment and procedure plans with these diseases in mind drawing on lessons learned and creating new protocols so that afflicted patients may receive the full range of medical care and healthcare workers can perform such work with minimal riskperhaps one of the most challenging aspects of infection prevention during the ebola virus disease response in american hospitals was the continuous evolution of guidelines for isolation ppe disinfection handling of medical waste etc the blue ribbon study panel on biodefense highlighted this very issue in its recommendations pointing to the need for a standardized process to develop and issue clinical infection control guidance for biological events 29 the recommendations from the cdc regarding isolation precautions specifically the use of negative pressure roomsairborne isolation and the necessary ppe were an evolving process in the days following thomas duncans hospitalization as an infection preventionist these days were taxing due to the constant scramble to not only train staff on the appropriate donning and doffing procedures but even acquire the correct ppe novel diseases like sars and mers also tax the public health and healthcare response systems in terms of providing adequate recommendations for isolation while these fluctuations are understandable in the event of a biological attack fear and hysteria will likely play a larger role than in naturally occurring outbreaks which makes the stability of ipc recommendations that much more important healthcare workers must feel confident in not only their training but also the efficacy of their ppe it is crucial that future efforts include stronger processes to standardize infection control recommendations and guidelines during these critical timesbiodefense and global health security efforts work to strengthen capacity to respond to infectious disease threats these efforts are imperative to preventing detecting and responding to biological events whether they are intentional accidental or natural within these plans there is often a considerable gap regarding the role of infection prevention and control and the programs within healthcare facilities there have been several reports and recommendations in recent years to strengthen biodefense efforts the health sector resilience checklist for high-consequence infectious diseases from the johns hopkins center for biosecurity points to the importance of infection control practices and their significance but there is little overall mention of the programs within hospitals this checklist focuses on the adherence to infection control practices like that of the blue ribbon study panel on biodefense report but tends to neglect the role of these programs the same can be said of more recent pandemic influenza and hospital preparedness plans unfortunately there tends to be a gap in the literature regarding ipc within biodefense efforts and although most focus on larger components disease surveillance ppe medical countermeasures the utilization of ipc programs should not go ignored hospitals already have this tool available and it behooves preparedness efforts to employ itthere is a continuous trend of pointing to infection prevention and control processes and neglecting the programs responsible for ensuring they are followed the systemic gap in preparedness efforts citing infection prevention and control practices but failing to account for the program and role of infection preventionists reveals a fundamental lack of truly understanding the role of these programs and internal hospital operations biodefense efforts inherently include infection control practices as they are the foundation for preventing the spread of disease but this gap regarding the inclusion of ipc programs does them a disservice hospitals already struggle with following ipc practices to reduce the spread of infection biodefense efforts should strengthen the existing ipc infrastructure and ensure processes are effectively followed if hospitals are already struggling with hand hygiene and ppe compliance how will they manage bioterrorism acts or pandemicsthe problem is twofold current compliance to infection control processes is often substandard and the ipc programs are frequently under-utilized andor -prioritized biodefense efforts should seek to increase infection prevention and control efforts and strengthen processes while building upon the existing ipc program infrastructure that can be an effective tool infection prevention and control is a significant resource in the biodefense arsenal and should be seen as an independent component like surveillance and medical countermeasures these programs are already in place and while they focus on the day-to-day problems of hais they can be utilized to better serve and strengthen the us healthcare infrastructure and thus preparedness strengthening ipc programs and processes benefits health security whether it is a local outbreak an act of bioterrorism or a pandemichospitals are the frontline for biological events and their capacity to adequately detect and respond to such threats can either halt or help the spread of disease infection prevention and control practices are existing guidelines and recommendations that seek to combat disease transmission during medical care ipc programs within hospitals work to ensure staff are educated on and compliant with such practices to protect patients visitors and healthcare workers these programs are also an integral source for infectious disease surveillance and a connective tissue within hospitals making them a significant contributor to public health surveillance outbreaks of sars mers ebola virus disease and multi-drug resistant microorganisms have all revealed the importance of ipc and the devastating consequences of poor compliance continued failure to prioritize ipc programs and practices as well as the role they serve within outbreaks and growing biological threats will only serve to weaken preparedness and response efforts defense against biological threats requires strong infection control practices programs and the ability to adequately employ these efforts prior to and during public health emergencies healthcare is a critical infrastructure meaning that if hospitals are amplifiers for disease transmission and sources for negative patient outcomes the impact can be devastating infection prevention and control is an essential resource against all biological threats regardless of their originthe community setting and hygiene behavior play an important role in controlling influenza whether seasonal or pandemic and emerging infectious diseases provide a good chance for promoting universal preventive measures such as hand hygiene 1 the world health organization who and other health organizations have stressed the need to highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions npi such as hand hygiene social distancing and face mask as options to prevent influenza transmission in the community 2 3 nevertheless because some npi measures are readily available and applicable for the general population they can be routinely instituted during influenza season regardless of pandemic threat evidence 47 household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of npi but low acceptability of some npi such as facemasks make it more difficult to comply with some of these recommendationshand hygiene is a key intervention for reducing transmission of acute respiratory infections ari and other infections such as diarrhea in community settings hand hygiene has been specifically recommended for prevention of diseases with pandemic potential such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and for pandemic influenza ah1n1pdm09 according to aiello et al improvements in hand hygiene resulted in reductions in respiratory illness by 21  hand-hygiene education with use of non-antibacterial soap being the most beneficial intervention 7yet studies examining hygiene practices during respiratory illness and interventions targeting aerosol transmission are needed 8 it has been postulated that the effect of interventions may be higher in the pandemic scenario because of public anxiety giving way to higher rates of adherence similar to what was observed during the sars epidemic 9during 2009 influenza pandemic there was some uncertainty as to which npi to recommend especially whether facemasks should be endorsed 10the aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in preventing cases of influenza in children in the community setting in 2009 pandemic and 20102011 post-pandemicseasonal epidemicfor each of the 7 regions where this study was performed the setting of

after touching potentially contaminated surfacesin the light of the possibility of other future influenza pandemics examining public response to the a h1n1pmd09 influenza pandemic can provide information in terms of willingness to adopt preventive behaviors in a polling study conducted by steel fisher et al in five countries 14 in all countries the most commonly adopted personal protective behavior was to wash hands or use hand sanitizer more oftenthis study highlights the effectiveness of hand washing in preventing infection due to influenza a h1n1pmd09 in the pediatric community setting it has been proven by several authors that children at school age are a key factor in the spread of influenza epidemics 1517 this fact is underscored by several studies which have proven the effects of school closures on influenza outbreaks suggesting that school closure can reduce transmission of pandemic and seasonal influenza among schoolchildren although the optimal school closure strategy is unclear 18yet although a large proportion of students may have adequate knowledge on influenza only some of them practice preventive measures 19 in our study we found a negative association for influenza infection for both washing more than 5 times per day and hand washing after touching contaminated surfaces in the school age group 517 years this fact stresses the importance of health education in which parents and teachers play an important role no protective effect was observed in the multivariate analysis for the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers the use of masks could not be assessed due to the low number of responders to this question in the pediatric outpatient setting although there is limited data to support the use of face masks andor respirators in healthcare and community settings evidence suggests that given the potential loss of effectiveness with incorrect usage general advice should be to only use masks respirators under very particular specified circumstances and in combination with other personal protective practices 20 other studies in our setting have found an adherence rate of  50  and suggested that facemasks are not useful in reducing seasonal influenza infections in the community due to their low acceptance although they could be effective in those who wore them 11yet other authors find there is evidence to support the use of masks andor respirators in healthcare or community settings 21 mask use is best undertaken as part of a package of personal protection especially including hand hygiene in both home and healthcare settings however examination of the literature has shown that most of the studies examined were too small to reliably detect what would be anticipated to be moderate effects 22frequency of public transportation use was included despite no recommendation was made by the spanish health authorities to avoid using public transportation during the pandemic because it can be considered a mass gathering site and a source of infection transmissionin our study only 09  of the children with underlying chronic medical conditions who were eligible for vaccination had received any influenza vaccine a fact that was also observed by altmann et al they showed that 93  of these children had not been vaccinated 23 low vaccination coverage among children aged 5 years who are at greatest risk for influenza associated complications and the low coverage among older children and adolescents suggest that continued implementation of existing strategies and the development of new strategies to improve seasonal vaccination coverage are needed 24 the significant burden of influenza on children should encourage upgrading vaccination coverage in these age groups and especially for those included in risk groups for whom yearly vaccination is recommended 25 26as other authors have underscored our data also showed that clinical and epidemiological characteristics of children infected with pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza a versus those infected with post-pandemicseasonal influenza ah1n1pmd09 27 28 bear no significant differences for both seasons significant differences were shown for cases having presented with pneumonia in the previous two years asthma inhaled corticosteroid treatment and presenting with more than 1 co-morbiditythere are several limitations to the study which have to be considered especially because of possible recall bias with respect to report of hand-washing behavior among cases and controls although the questionnaires were completed within few days from consultation there can also be a social desirability bias because of the fact that people might say they do wash their hands or use a hand sanitizer because that is what they are suppose to do this may carry a certain misclassification of respondents which can not be accurately assessedbasic infection prevention interventions including hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizers have been shown to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses particularly among young children 29 stebbins et al have shown that a respiratory hygiene intervention that included hand sanitizer use reduced school absences related to influenza a although no significant effect of the intervention on the primary study outcome of all laboratory-confirmed influenza cases was found there were statistically significant differences in protocol-specified ancillary outcomes children in intervention schools had significantly fewer laboratory-confirmed influenza a infections than children in control schools 30allison et al concluded that hand gel use is a feasible strategy in settings were frequent hand washing might not be possible such as in elementary schools and even though acceptance of facemask use was low most teachers stated they would use masks in their classroom in a pandemic 31 evidence from household as well as institutions demonstrate that personal hygiene continue to be a key prevention strategy against infection thus it is necessary to stress the importance of keeping proper hygiene and cleaning practices to reduce the risk of spreading infection 32the success of an npi or a set of npis depends on both its efficacy and the feasibility of implementing it with relevant populations if npis are to be used in community settings during a severe influenza season or pandemic to increase acceptability on the part of the adults is of utmost importance without such acceptance it is highly unlikely that children and their supervising adults will participate 33this study emphasizes the importance of simple infection prevention measures such as hand hygiene which have been proven effective to reduce the transmission of infection in schools and the spread to household contacts by papenburg jet al 34 frequent hand washing should be recommended to prevent influenza infection in the family and community setting and in special in the school age groupcoronaviruses members of the family coronaviridae and subfamily coronavirinae were initially considered epizoonotic in nature within avian and mammalian hosts peeri et al 2020 sahin et al 2020 the transition of coronaviruses to human hosts has resulted in acute respiratory diseases in humans the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 cause of coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 have been associated with extensive outbreaks in 20022003 sars

exposed to 280 plaque forming units of the virus watanabe et al 2010 given the gaps in our knowledge the magnitude of the risk due to virally contaminated surfaces is uncertain and should be examined furthercoronaviruses are positive-stranded rna viruses with an envelope containing glycoprotein spikes the 2632 kb genomes of coronaviruses are some of the largest among rna viruses while the targets of antiviral drugs against the coronavirus that causes covid-19 could include its unique glycosylated spike and the mpro viral protease jin et al 2020 figure 1 curtailing the spread of the virus remains the first line of defense and a crucial step to reduce the spread of the disease disinfectants and biocides effective against coronaviruses may work by inactivating the enveloped virus due to their affinity for the lipid-containing viral envelope the capsid and the genome pratelli 2007 the use of antimicrobials for hand sanitation hulkower et al 2011 fomite disinfection and as nasal sprays and oral rinses eggers et al 2015b graf et al 2018 may reduce human-to-human transmission of the virus the ongoing covid-19 outbreak has resulted in shortages of commercial alcohol-based sanitizers rubbing alcohol and personal protective equipment ppe therefore this review is intended to provide information regarding a range of alternative biocides effective in eliminating or reducing the presence of coronaviruses from fomites and other potential sources of cross contaminationfood processing plants and retail facilities often contain a high density of workers working in close proximity the rapid spread of the sars-cov-2 virus indicates that its transmission may be multifactorial otter et al 2016 figures 2 3 such as though aerosols droplets and fomites while many food processing facilities have hazard analysis critical control points haccp plans that involve cleaning sanitation and hand washing programs several facilities have reported increased spread of sars-cov-2 among workers resulting in shut downs and possible food shortages hart et al 2020transmission of sars-cov-2 is different from that of foodborne bacterial pathogens and viruses which are transmitted via the fecal-oral route the transmission of sars-cov-2 can not be controlled only through hand washing and sanitizer use and requires interventions that prevent aerosol and droplet based transmission of the virus a recent study of sars-cov-2 infected patients indicated that higher viral loads existed in the nose than the throat zou et al 2020 nasal shedding of virus particles was similar to that the influenza virus zou et al 2020 with both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals having similar viral loads during the first 10 days of infection after which individuals with severe illness have a 60 fold increase in viral load liu et al 2020 control of respiratory transmission of sars-cov-2 through aerosols and droplets as well as transmission by contact with contaminated fomites figure 3

chaudhry 2020sars-cov-2 similar to sars-cov-1 can remain viable in aerosols for a duration of 3 h recent studies on sars-cov-2 and previous studies on sars-cov-1 and mers-cov indicate that coronaviruses can survive on surfaces such as plastics and stainless steel for durations up to or exceeding 5 days sizun et al 2000 casanova et al 2010 van doremalen et al 2020 shorter survival of sars-cov-2 was observed on printed and tissue papers but the virus was recovered from the surfaces of surgical masks after 7 days chin et al 2020 further recovery of sars-cov-2 from wood and fabric for up to 2 days indicates that commonly encountered surfaces can harbor sars-cov-2 casanova et al 2010 otter et al 2016 studies using the endemic human coronavirus strain hcov 229e indicate that the coronavirus may maintain infectivity for a weeks duration on inert surfaces while the transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev another coronavirus survived for a month at 4c similarly longer durations of virus recovery 14 days were observed at 4c for sars-cov-2 chin et al 2020 factors such as viral load and humidity also influence the survival of coronaviruses while intervention efforts such as quarantining distancing of individuals hand washing and the disinfection of fomites including food contact surfaces who 2020 have been suggested the potential for mitigation strategies to reduce sars-cov-2 viral load shedding in patients and survival in the environment and on contact surfaces need to be addressed the objective of this review is to describe antimicrobial agents with virucidal activity against coronaviruses that can be effectively used for sanitation and disinfection of surfaces individually or in combination to provide effective hurdles to the spread of sars-cov-2 agents for the sanitation and disinfection of carriers vehicles and fomites in food production distribution and retail settings sizun et al 2000 otter et al 2016 are the primary focusfomites likely place a role in viral transmission because they can be contaminated with virus-containing secretions such as aerosols or droplets expelled through coughing or talking figure 2 hulkower et al 2011 menachery et al 2017 kampf et al 2020 during the 20022003 sars-cov-1 outbreak 31 cases in three separate clusters were linked to a single index patient at national taiwan university hospital the third cluster included six healthcare workers with direct sars patient contact and six additional infected healthcare workers who had no direct contact with the patient contaminated fomites were a suspected route of transmission to the workers with no direct patient contact out of 119 environmental samples collected throughout the hospital nine were confirmed sars-cov-1 rna positive chen et al 2004several other surveys on coronaviruses such as sars-cov-1 and mers-cov have indicated that fomites along with airborne routes contribute to the spread of coronaviruses otter et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 surface swabs of two hospitals treating mers-cov patients indicated that 42 out of 68 surfaces were positive for the coronavirus using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr the mers-cov was cultured from surfaces such as stethoscopes doorknobs bed guardrails and elevators kim s-h et al 2016 swabs of surfaces such as a refrigerator handle table and television remote control were positive for sars-cov-1 using rt-pcr in sars units during an outbreak in toronto dowell et al 2004 several factors including surface material organic load viral load temperature and environmental humidity may influence the survival of viral particles on surfaces kim s-h et al 2016 otter et al 2016a comparative study of the sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 examined viral stability kinetics in aerosols and on surfaces and determined that decay rates for both viruses were similar on many but not all surfaces van doremalen et al 2020 airborne titer reductions for both aerosolized viruses were 1 log10 tcid50ml after 3 h sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 were both detectable on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 h sars-cov-2 titers decreased from 1037 to 1006 tcid50ml after 48 h on stainless steel and after 72 h on plastic however sars-cov-1 appears to have a significantly shorter half-life on cardboard as the study found no detectable sars-cov-1 after 8 h while viable sars-cov-2 was undetectable after 24 h van doremalen et al 2020 this suggests that the causative agent of the current covid-19 pandemic might survive better on environmental surfaces than sars-cov-1 however the authors did caution that considerable statistical dispersion occurred within studies examining cardboard van doremalen et al 2020 coronaviruses hcov-229e and feline infectious peritonitis virus or fipv can remain infectious for long periods in water 100 days in water at 4 c and 10 days in water at 23c and pasteurized settled sewage 24 days suggesting contaminated water may be a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated gundy et al 2009 at 25c the time required for a 99 reduction in reagent-grade water was 22 days and 17 days for two sars surrogates tgev and mhv respectively in settled sewage that was pasteurized to reduce competing microorganisms and then spiked with coronaviruses times for a 99 reduction were 9 days for tgev and 7 days for mhv at 4c there was 1 log10 infectivity decrease for both these surrogates after 4 weeks casanova et al 2009 however in wastewater domestic sewage and dechlorinated tap water inoculated sars-cov-1 persisted for 14 days at 4c but only for 2 days at 20cwhile several factors affect the survival and infectivity of sars-cov-2 such as the type of surface stainless steel plastics and cardboard moisture level and contaminants protein saliva and fecal material the risk of sars-cov-2 presence on food contact surfaces and packing materials remains high during a pandemic infected individuals albeit asymptomatic could come in contact with food or packaging throughout the food supply chain hence the use of mitigation strategies should also be considered from food production facility to consumer handling of the food productthough the current sars-cov-2 literature indicates that it is a respiratory virus and not a food safety concern coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses have been known to survive on produce such as lettuce for several days ypiz-gmez et al 2013 sars-cov-2 has been isolated from feces indicating that shedding through the gastrointestinal system occurs yeo et al 2020 therefore it is hypothesized that sars-cov-2 may also have an affinity for cells in the intestine and colon gu et al 2020workers in the food retail service and health industries normally come in close contact with a large number of individuals during the work day recent shut downs of meat processing facilities that have established sanitation programs due to spread of sars-cov-2 among workers indicates the importance for new control strategies to spread the transmission of the virus hart et al 2020 hence efforts to minimize the risk of virus contamination of common contact surfaces and survival of the virus in droplets and aerosols in food manufacturing production and retail centers should be considered these efforts include the use of antimicrobial agents such as sanitizers and disinfectants on hands and fomites otter et al 2016 eggers 2019 the improper selection and inadequate use of sanitizers and disinfectants plays a significant role in the cross transfer and spread of pathogens hirose et al 2019 resulting in additional public health concerns sanitizer choice and coronavirus susceptibility to current cleaning and sanitation practices within facilities is an important consideration for instance coronaviruses such as the mouse hepatitis virus mhv and tgev are less susceptible to 1100 hypochlorite than they are to 70 ethanol hulkower et al 2011 over-dilution of sanitizers and insufficient product contact time are critical factors that should be taken into account when targeting the elimination of coronaviruses from fomites boyce 2016the presence of sars-cov-2 in human feces xiao et al 2020 highlights the importance of incorportating cleaning and disinfection regimens in toilets and restrooms as well as developing protocols to prevent aerosolization of virus particles during flushing the use of quartenary ammonium alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride and peracetic acid was effective in coliphage ms2 redution on surfaces after flushing sassi et al 2018 the use of biocides effective against sars-cov-2 in toilet bowls apart from cleaning could be considered in light of the information presented in this reviewvirucidal activity can be determined by suspension tests as well as carrier tests that mimic surfaces and evaluate the performance of biocides in the presence of organic loads through the addition of serum viral reduction is determined by infectivity assays where treated viruses are compared to untreated controls for the reduction in viral cytopathic effects cpe on tissue culture monolayers surviving fractions determined through log10 reductions are enumerated either by viral plaque assays a most probable number mpn assay or by determining the 50 titration endpoint for infectivity known as tissue culture infectious dose 50 or tcid50 assay plaque forming units pfu are proportional to tcid50 titer by a factor of 056 wulff et al 2012 rt-pcr for the estimation of viral nucleic acid using threshold cycle ct value has also been used to determine viral load reduction factors are calculated using the difference in the quotient of the infection titer before and after exposure to the antimicrobial agent rabenau et al 2005b according to the environmental protection agency epa an acceptable disinfectant claim requires a 4 log10 reduction in the human norovirus surrogate feline calicivirus fcv epa 2017 european countries recommend the use of other viral surrogates such as murine norovirus mnv or adenovirus type 5 adv-5 for testing rabenau et al 2014 criticisms for suspension tests include that they do not mimic real world conditions which should be taken into consideration while determining virucide selection for disinfection of surfaces soiled with organic matter and other substances that could reduce efficacy results regarding the virucidal activity of disinfectants using non-enveloped surrogates translate well to the more susceptible enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses several factors such as target strain testing of biocide against virus in suspension vs drying and use of protein supplementation play important roles in influencing viral particle stability and loss of infectivity during the determination of virucidal activity rabenau et al 2005aalcohol based sanitizers can be used on skin for the disinfection of fomites and on certain food contact surfaces table 1 alcohol acts on viral envelopes to denature proteins and is not significantly impaired by organic matter contamination springthorpe et al 1986 ethyl alcohol ethanol isopropyl alcohol isopropanol or rubbing alcohol and 24 dichlorobenzyl alcohol are classes of alcohol that have been shown to possess antimicrobial properties although their concentrations and ranges of activity differ lambert 2004hand sanitizers and rubs containing alcohol 7585 vv effectively reduce the infectivity of coronaviruses in in vitro tests against sars-cov-2 both the world health organization sanitizer formulation 1 85 ethanol vv 0725 glycerol vv and 0125 hydrogen peroxide vv and formulation 2 75 isopropanol ww 0725 glycerol vv and 0125 hydrogen peroxide vv resulted in complete inactivation from an initial viral titer of 8 log10 tcid50ml tests of both ethanol and isopropanol within the same study along with 0125 hydrogen peroxide against sars-cov-2 were effective in inactivating the virus within 30 s even when used at a concentration of 30 kratzel et al 2020 products based on 80 85 and 95 ethanol without dilution inactivated sars-cov-1 to below the limit of detection rf  4 within 30 s of exposure rabenau et al 2005b high concentrations of ethanol 95 and 85 based hand sanitizers have also been useful in reducing sars-cov-1 by 55 log10 tcid50ml within an exposure time of 30 s rabenau et al 2005bethanol at a concentration of 70 resulted in a 3 log10 reduction of coronaviruses tgev and mhv after an exposure duration of a minute hand sanitizers with 62 ethanol resulted in a reduction factor of 4 log10 of tgev and a 27 log10 reduction of mhv hulkower et al 2011 alcohol-based formulations containing 32 povidone-iodine and 78 alcohol reported 9999 4 log10 reduction inactivation of the modified vaccinia virus ankara mva a reference virus for virucidal hand disinfectants under clean and dirty conditions after a 15 s contact time eggers et al 2015a indicating that these sanitizers might also be effective against other enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses when evaluated on inanimate surfaces like metal glass or plastic 7895 ethanol inactivated the coronaviruses sars-cov-1 mers-cov and mhv to reduction factor 4 in 30 s kampf et al 2020 the use of amyl metacresol 06 mg and dichlorobenzyl alcohol 12 mg at ph of 23 in throat lozenges resulted in negligible antiviral activity against human

antimicrobial activity against bacteria fungi and viruses pvp-i forms i2 and hypoiodous acid hoi which oxidizes nucleic acids and membranes lachapelle et al 2013 pvp-i is used for the disinfection of skin when formulated into scrubs or hand washes and for oral cavities through oral sprays and mouth rinses nagatake et al 2002 kariwa et al 2004 durani and leaper 2008 nasal spray of pvp-i has been used for the post-operative control of staphylococcus aureus infections and could potentially be used to reduce nasal harborage and dispersal of sars-cov-2 phillips et al 2014 the exposure of sars-cov-2 78 of log10 tcid50ml to 75 of pvp-i resulted in the virus titer dropping below levels of detection after 5 min chin et al 2020 the use of pvp-i at a concentration of 75 surgical scrub 4 hand wash and 1  83 alcohol mouth rinse against mers-cov resulted in a 9999 reduction in virus populations after 15 s in both clean and soiled conditions bovine serum albumin and erythrocytes virucidal activity of pvp-i was observed against mers-cov even after a 110 dilution though a higher duration of exposure 30 s was required for the oral rinse that contained 1 pvp-i  83 alcohol eggers

plastics indicating its effectiveness as a surface sanitizer lloyd-evans et al 1986 the efficacy of pvp-i against test bacterial pathogens skin contaminant surrogates did not decrease when tested on an inert surface durani and leaper 2008 indicating that pvp-i could be used for hand washing and disinfection of skin surfaces and the oral tract and as a substitute or replacement for alcohol-based products durani and leaper 2008 while pvp-i can stain surfaces it is water soluble and stains can be washed away or removed with a damp cloth pvp-i virucidal efficacy against coronaviruses at concentrations as low as 023 rapid efficacy at 15 s and residual efficacy in combination with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol make it an excellent choice for disinfecting skin oral cavities and fomite surfaces eggers et al 2015b kampf et al 2020 the combination of pvp-i with alcohol as a disinfectant could reduce the amount of alcohol required and could serve as a useful substitute or supplement to alcohol usequaternary ammonium compounds qacs are popular sanitizers that can be used on certain food contact surfaces as well as fomites table 1 qacs are cationic detergents with membrane active properties and their antimicrobial activity is due in part to their ability to disrupt the lipid membrane of a microorganism rabenau et al 2005b pratelli 2007 kumar et al 2017 the effectiveness of qacs is very formulation specific and this affects the range of organisms to which they are effective and the time needed to be effective against a specific organism gerba 2015 the exposure of sars-cov-2 78 of log10 tcid50ml to 010 100 ppm of benazlkonium chloride resulted in viral titer reduction below levels of detection after 5 min chin et al an analysis of the efficacy of household disinfectants against murine hepatitis virus mhv a surrogate for sars-cov-1 indicated that a formulation of 010 100 ppm quarternary compound with 79 ethanol resulted in a 3 log10 tcid50ml reduction after a 30 s exposure time dellanno et al 2009 the use of 1 1000 ppm benzalkonium-chloride a qac and 1 1000 ppm chlorhexadine digluconate a polybiguanide against sars-cov resulted in a loss of culturability of the virus though detection of viral rna through pcr occurred 30 min after exposure ansaldi et al 2004 the formulations and test conditions used by kampf et al 2020 indicated a low efficacy against mers-cov the use of ethanol along with qacs usually has been associated with effective antimicrobial activity against coronaviruses sattar 2004hydrogen peroxide is commonly used to disinfect food contact surfaces as a fumigant and as a sanitizer table 1 kumar et al 2017 studies have shown that hydrogen peroxide is effective against sars-cov and its surrogates exposure of a coronavirus surrogate tgev dried on stainless steel to hydrogen peroxide vapor 20 l for 23 h resulted in approximately a 5 log10 tcid50ml reduction goyal et al 2014 a limitation to this study was that the hydrogen peroxide vapor was examined on clean surfaces therefore further studies examining the impact of organic material and soil are necessary to determine its efficacy in a range of environments and situations another study using a commercial product accel tb containing liquid hydrogen peroxide with surfactants was effective 4 log10 tcid50ml reduction at a concentration of 05 with an incubation time of 1 min against hcov-229e omidbakhsh and sattar 2006 however limited information exists regarding the virucidal activity of hydrogen peroxide on other types of surfacessodium hypochlorite naocl chlorine bleach has been used as disinfectant for the past century in water and on food contact surfaces table 1 kumar et al 2017 hypochlorous acid hocl and the hypochlorite ion contribute the majority of the disinfectant activity associated with bleach-containing products with the former compound contributing the most biocidal activity kott et al 1975 rutala and weber 1997 however while chlorine-derived compounds do exhibit significant efficacy against coronaviruses on non-porous surfaces organic matter and porous materials diminish virucidal activity because of the quenching of free chlorine geller et al 2012 common practice in the food industry is to adjust alkaline chlorine formulations to ca ph 7 using a food grade acid when it is used at higher concentrations to increase dissociation into the more potent antimicrobial compound hocl however ph adjustment is less common in healthcare and household environments and does not occur in literature examining the virucidal activity of bleach in these settings kott et al 1975the exposure of sars-cov-2 78 of log10 tcid50ml to 149 150 ppm and 199 75 ppm household bleach resulted in the virus titer being reduced below levels of detection after 5 min chin et al 2020 to elucidate the target of antiviral activity bovine coronavirus was exposed to 100000 ppm naocl ph 115 for 1 min real-time reverse transcriptase pcr rrt-pcr and western blot indicated that total rna and nucleoprotein degradation occurred in that time period when the concentration was reduced to 10000 ppm naocl a 10 min treatment was required to achieve complete nucleoprotein degradation although there was 1 log10 reduction in total rna units observed bieker 2006 hcov-229e challenged with 5000 ppm naocl for 10 min on an inanimate surface underwent a ca 3 log10 tcid50ml reduction which failed to meet epa standards for virucidal activity for a disinfectant claim tyan et al 2018 however when treatment levels were increased to 2100 ppm naocl on stainless steel coupons a 45 log10 tcid50ml reduction was achieved after 30 s against the sars-cov-1 surrogate mhv dellanno et al 2009 much lower concentrations were required in seeded hospital wastewater sars-cov-1 was inactivated by exposure to 10 ppm naocl 04 ppm free chlorine after 10 min exposure while inactivation occurred within 1 min in 20 ppm naocl 05 ppm

sulfhydryl and disulfide bonds which in bacteria leads to increased cell wall permeability impacted enzymatic transport systems and disrupted cell membranes vandekinderen et al 2009 while paa has shown effectiveness on bacterial pathogens on food and food contact surfaces it has varied impact on foodborne viruses notably human norovirus nov and hepatitis a virus hav both non-enveloped viruses

effect on viral titers of hav and murine norovirus mnv fraisse et al 2011 higher concentrations of paa 100 ppm may be necessary to reduce non-enveloped viruses on surfaces foods and fomites and research regarding the effectiveness of paa on coronaviruses is limited a 0035 35 ppm solution of paa inhibited sars-cov-1 replication in cell culture with 2 min of contact time ansaldi et al 2004 while the same concentration did not affect the viral genome after 30 min of exposure ansaldi et al 2004 another study suggested that sars-cov-1 can be inactivated with 500 to 1000 ppm of paa wang et

infectivity of the covid-19 coronavirus sars-cov-2 has caused rapid person to person transmission resulting in a pandemic that has posed multifarious challenges to the food industry though not transmitted through food infections caused by sars-cov-2 have resulted in the closing of food processing plants due to infections among essential workers furthermore food contact surfaces and food packaging materials could serve as fomites for sars-cov-2 highlighting the importance of biocide use to mitigate the spread of the viruscurrently used methods to reduce the transmission of the virus involve the use of masks social distancing as well as the use of usepa approved disinfecting and sanitizing agents these practices have not been fully successful in preventing transmission of sars-cov-2 in several food processing facilities the information presented in this review indicates that sars-cov-2 can be transmitted through the air feces soiled surfaces and could occur on surfaces that are frequently touched our review indicates that ethanol at high concentrations 70 povidone iodine hypochlorite and qacs when combined with alcohol are efficacious against sars-cov-2 for surface disinfection hydrogen peroxide vapor chlorine dioxide ozone and uv could be applied to reduce viral load present in aerosols with appropriate precautions to prevent exposure of personnel to these antimicrobialswhile hand washing and the use of sanitizers is a commonly implemented practice in food production plants the dispersal of the sars-cov-2 virus from often asymptomatic individuals

information on antimicrobials and plant-based compounds that could be explored to curtail transmission of sars-cov-2 plant derived iota carrageenan could prevent viral attachment to cells and reduce viral loads in the nasal epithelium povidone iodine has also been used in nasal sprays and might serve as an additional preventative measure to control the person-person transmission of sars-cov-2the use of a multiple hurdles to control the spread of pathogenic microorganisms is a common practice in the food industry and hence the implementation of several mitigation strategies can be adapted by the food industry biocides effective against sars-cov-2 on moistsoiled surfaces air and skin is a requirement of high priority for transmission control food processing facilities should practice the judicious and optimal use of biocides to avert the development of antimicrobial resistance in non-target bacterial pathogens during the sars-cov-2 pandemicthe review provides the food industry with information about sanitizers and disinfectants with virucidal and inhibitory activity against sars-cov-2 or surrogates on food contact surfaces liquids aerosols and skin the integration of the

threats to global health today1 although global and national amr action plans are in place infection prevention and control is primarily discussed in the context of healthcare facilities with home and everyday life settings barely addressedas seen with the recent global pandemic of coronavirus sars-cov-2 everyday hygiene measures can play an important role in containing and delaying the threat from infectious microorganisms and when employed at other times are likely to reduce disease for which antibiotics would be prescribed or even mis-prescribedat the time of writing this review and according to dr maarten van dongen founder of amr insights the global deaths from sars-cov-2 between november 2019 and march 2020 reached 16500 with many affected succumbing to secondary bacterial infections in comparison 2000 people worldwide die as a result of resistant bacteria every day8 amounting to 258000 people dying from the effects of amr within a similar time-framethe latest analysis by the world health organizations who global antimicrobial resistance surveillance glass program which included data from 49 countries found high levels of amr in escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae salmonella spp acinetobacter spp staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae in every who region2
the global impact is already profound and expected to intensify particularly among the poorest nations3

4 the main driver is overuse and misuse of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture including unregulated over-the-counter sales while global spread of resistant bacteria or resistance genes is attributed to poor infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities and sub-optimal hygiene and sanitation in communities confounded by poor infrastructure and weak governance5 in the us between 80-90 of the volume of human antibiotic use occurs in the outpatient setting with nearly 50 considered to be inappropriate or unnecessary6 without prompt action it is estimated that rates of amr to commonly-used antibiotics could exceed 4060 in some countries by 20307 and by 2050 around 10 million people could die each year as a result of resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents8 almost 9 million of these will be in africa and asia8
in 2015 an alliance of the who the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and the world organization for animal health oie developed a global action plan gap to improve awareness and understanding of amr through effective communication education and training strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation hygiene and infection prevention measures optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health and develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries and to increase investment in new medicines diagnostic tools vaccines and other interventions 9 the gap emphasizes the need for society-wide engagement with a clear focus on prevention first 9 one of the five strategic objectives is a reduction in the incidence of infection through improved sanitation hygiene and infection prevention9 at least 120 countries have finalized national action plans with the plans of more than 60 other countries under development10
what is striking is that the gap and national plans discuss infection prevention and control primarily in the context of healthcare facilities see httpswwwwhointantimicrobialresistancenational-action-planslibraryen by contrast the latest 2019 uk national action plan which sets out a 20-year vision11 and a 5-year plan12 for how the uk will contribute to controlling amr by 2040 offers guidelines on infection prevention in healthcare settings but also highlights the role of the community noting that when it comes to infections in the community the public have a huge part to play12 the plan emphasizes the importance of e-bug wwwe-bueu an educational program developed by public health england which aims to ensure that all children across europe leave school with an understanding of amr and the role of hand food and respiratory hygiene in prevention of infectionsthis paper is the output of a scientific meeting commissioned by the global hygiene council involving an invited group of experts from the fields of microbiology amr hygiene and public health the paper is not a systematic review which has already been undertaken by others including the international scientific forum on home hygiene ifh httpwwwifhhomehygieneorg but presents key evidence that the home and other everyday life settings are important for the transmission of infections and the acquisition and spread of amr and that home and everyday life hygiene should be given greater consideration in global and national action plans it is also important to acknowledge that while hygiene measures are a vital part of infection prevention addressing the rising threat of amr requires a holistic approach which includes reducing the use of antibiotics in agriculture introducing tighter regulations of over the counter sales and improving access to clean water and sanitation13
adopting a targeted hygiene approach in our homes and everyday lives including workplaces schools nurseries on public transport during leisure activities etc offers a way to maximize protection against colonization and infection at the times and places where there is the greatest risk of transmission this in turn reduces the need for antibiotics thereby minimizing the selection pressure for development of amrin recent years demographic changes and changes in health service structure mean that the number of people living in the community needing special care because they are at greater risk of infection has significantly increased the largest proportion of these are the elderly who generally have reduced immunity to infection which is often exacerbated by other illnesses like diabetes and malignant illnesses a decrease in immunity usually starts from 50 years oldother infection-susceptible groups include the very young patients recently discharged from hospital and family members with invasive devices such as catheters as well as those whose immune competence is impaired as a result of chronic and degenerative illnesses including hivaids or because they are receiving immunosuppressant drugs or other therapies immunosuppressed individuals are often also on other medications such as antibiotics to help protect them from infection but can further increase susceptibility to infections such as clostridium difficile
home and everyday life settings provide multiple opportunities for spread of infection everyday life settings include locations where normally there is no mandated hygiene policy as is typically found in clinical and educational settings for example work places public transport gyms child day-care facilities and shopping centerspoor hygiene is considered a major factor in the transmission of community-based infections including gastrointestinal gi and respiratory tract rt infections such as colds and influenza and skin infections caused by s aureus14 for the elderly communal living environments combined with problems of fecal incontinence create an environment in which enteric and foodborne pathogens are easily spread as a result the incidence of salmonellosis and campylobacter diarrhea appears to be higher among the elderly in these situationsmore vulnerable at risk members of society are now being looked after outside hospital settings for example in germany it is estimated that approximately three quarters of all people in need of care are currently being cared for at home15 in the community the immunocompromised are also at risk from opportunistic pathogens such as e coli klebsiella spp and pseudomonas aeruginosa which are considered as hospital related15
the key steps in preventing the spread of infection known as breaking the chain of infection are the same regardless of setting in the home pathogens may have been brought home from hospital settings or enter the home via colonized or infected people petsdomestic animals or through contaminated food and water15

16 pathogens and other microbes are shed constantly from these sources with rapid transmission around the home mainly via hands hand and food contact surfaces cleaning utensils and in the air figure 1
15
multiple studies conducted in home and everyday life situations demonstrate that pathogens on hands and surfaces can be transferred from an infected person spread via hands and surfaces from feces via respiratory droplets and from handling and preparing contaminated food and can survive and disseminate in numbers sufficient to cause infection15

16 these studies involve species including c difficile
17 salmonella spp campylobacter spp s aureus e coli 18 19 20 21 22
listeria monocytogenes

24 norovirus25 26 27 rhinovirus 28 influenza virus27

29 and sars-cov-230
a study18 involving preparation of salmonella and campylobacter-contaminated chickens n20 in domestic kitchens showed transfer of the pathogen to 101 and 72 respectively of contact surfaces hands cleaning cloths chopping boards utensils tap handles and cupboard door handles in a follow up study31 hands chopping board and cloth samples yielded most probable number mpn counts of 100 and 1000 salmonella per sample from 133 and 8 respectively for campylobacter counts of 100 and 1000 were isolated from 5 and 17 respectively this is a concern since it is estimated that 80 of salmonella infections originate in the home32 and a uk study detected campylobacter spp in 56 of chilled retail chickens with 7 of samples containing 1000 colony forming units cfug of skin33 the infectious dose of campylobacter is estimated at 500 cfu34 chaidez et al35 demonstrated that the risk of salmonella transmission from cleaning cloths via hands to mouth was far higher than the guideline levels for acceptable risksince most pathogenic organisms die relatively rapidly particularly on dry surfaces the greatest risk of human exposure presents immediately after shedding from an infected or contaminated source however some species including s aureus e coli and other organisms such as fungal species rhinovirus and norovirus can survive for long periods even on dry surfaces36 audit studies suggest that some gram-negative organisms can form permanent reservoirs or secondary sources of contamination particularly where moisture is present such as in sinks and drains kitchen cleaning cloths and sponges37 38 39 40 41 to what extent these reservoirs of contamination might include potentially harmful species is not known however a study conducted in culiacan mexico detected salmonella in 173180 96 kitchen cleaning cloths taken from domestic homes with an average mpn salmonella count of 66135 although further investigation is required this suggests that salmonella may be multiplying in the cloths to form a permanent reservoirinfection risk depends on the level of exposure to pathogenic organisms the infectious dose of bacteria and viruses ie the number of bacterial cells or virus particles required to cause a significant risk of infection varies for different organisms and in different situations42

43 the infectious dose for commonly-encountered bacteria such as campylobacter shigella enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec and c difficile and viruses such as norovirus and rhinovirus may be small 1-500 particles or cells44 45 46 47 48 49 for others eg salmonella it can be far greater 106 organisms44 the dose also depends on host susceptibility and mode of entry and may be lower for at-risk groups in the community such as children the elderly and people with compromised immunity44
although care of increasing numbers of patients in the community including at home can help alleviate over-burdened health systems it can be undermined by inadequate infection control in the home and urgent focus is now needed on infection transmission in homes and community settings in addition to healthcare settingsalthough multidrug-resistant mdr bacteria ie bacteria that have acquired resistance to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial classes are typically hospital-acquired50 studies conducted primarily in high-income countries show that some have become quite prevalent in the community51 infected or colonized patients discharged from healthcare settings can remain persistent skin carriers of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa or fecal carriers of enterobacteria strains which carry mdr factors eg new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 ndm-1 or extended spectrum beta-lactamase esbl enzymes many community-onset infections are associated with recent discharge from a healthcare setting52 53 54 55 56 mdr strains can be passed to other family members who become infected or colonized56 although carrier status is often not apparent as colonization does not necessary results in clinical diseasefactors affecting the spread of mdr bacteria into home and everyday life settings are complex methicillin-resistant s aureus mrsa is probably the most important mdr bacterium to transition from healthcare settings to the community the ease of transfer of mrsa from hospitals to the home via healthcare workers and others in contact with hospitals has been demonstrated in multiple studies52 53 54 55 56 this is illustrated by a study57 where significant levels of community and hospital strains of mrsa were recovered from high-frequency touch surfaces door handles toilet seats reception areas public washrooms corridors and lifts in public areas in the community and in london hospitals suggesting cross-contamination between the two settings once in the home mrsa can colonize andor cause infection among family members58 59 60
other studies show the spread of mrsa from a colonized index case eg a nurse at work to the home environment and other family members56 antibiotic treatment of family members failed to eradicate colonization because they became recolonized from contaminated environmental surfaces eradication was only successful when antibiotic treatment was combined with rigorous cleaning of the home environment56 further studies on spread of mrsa in the home environment are reviewed by bloomfield et al 201243
since 2000 we have seen the emergence of new community acquired strains of mrsa ca-mrsa while healthcare-associated strains are mainly a risk to vulnerable people for ca-mrsa any family member is at risk and it is more prevalent among children and young adults where they cause infections of cuts wounds and abrasions us experience suggests the risk is greatest among those engaging skin-to-skin contact activities and contact with contaminated objects such as towels sheets and sports equipment transmission is common in settings such as prisons schools and sports teams43 a study assessing the transmission of ca-mrsa in a university in the us found multidrug resistant usa300 responsible for diseases including necrotizing pneumonia severe sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis on common touch surfaces at the university student homes and local community settings this suggests transfer between different locations within the community61

enterobacterales are a common cause of community-associated infections including urinary tract infections and bacteremia as well as gastrointestinal infections52 resistance in community-associated enterobacterales mediated by extended spectrum -lactamases is now common in asia the middle east south america and some parts of europe a 2012 study in birmingham uk indicated that the proportion of e coli carrying ctx-m esbl genotypes in a community population was 11362 while a 2006-2011 study63 reported a 10-fold increase from 06 and 6 in esbl-producing e coli fecal carriage in healthy subjects in a parisian community lower-prevalence regions include north america parts of northern europe australia and new zealand52
according to the who foodborne pathogens including most commonly salmonella campylobacter and ecoli affect millions of people globally every year causing diarrhea or debilitating infections64 data from 18 european countries suggests that about 31 of foodborne outbreaks occur in private homes16 foodborne infections associated with these pathogens can be effectively treated by a course of antibiotics but for infections caused by consumption of foods contaminated with antibiotic resistant strains this is not possiblerecent reports indicate the importance of food as a potential source of esbl-producing organisms explaining in part the spread of such organisms to community settings65 poor hygiene with contaminated chopping boards and sponges have been found to be the potential cause of the spread of esbls in community settings for example in a study conducted in switzerland france and germany where 144 cutting boards used in domestic homes were examined after preparation of chicken meat or game esbl-producing e coli was recovered from 5 samples 3566 an italian study of 100 in-use kitchen sponges found high levels of enterobacteriaceae 589 log cfug identification of enterobacteria revealed several opportunistic and pathogenic agents including enterobacter cloacae 28 citrobacter freundii 23 and cronobacter sakazakii 151 in total 69309 22 of enterobacteria strains tested were esbl-positive67 kitchen sponges not only act as reservoirs of microorganisms but also as disseminators over domestic surfaces which can lead to cross-contamination of hands and food which is considered a main cause of foodborne disease outbreakscarbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae cre are also on the rise globally but to date most cre infections in the us and europe have been healthcare-associated68

70 although data from asia is sparse carbapenemases have been found in bacteria recovered from drinking water in india and in food-producing animals in china69

71

72 in european studies during the 1990s vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre were detected in the stools of healthy volunteers73 74 75 76 77 however rates of vre carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter infections and mdr p aeruginosa are thought to be low in individuals living in the community52
overall the evidence suggests that mdr strains of bacteria like any other strains of bacteria can enter the home or other settings via people who are infected or colonized or via contaminated food and can be spread to other members of the family via hands and contaminated surfacestargeted hygiene is a risk management system developed for home and everyday life settings during the 1980s80 it is based on scientifically-validated systems developed by the food and other manufacturing sectors as the most effective means to protect products from contamination studies on consumer understanding of hygiene show that the public are very confused about hygiene and what hygiene really means tending to equate it with eradication of dirt assumed to be the major source of harmful microbes81

82 targeted hygiene means focusing hygiene practices in places and at times referred to as risk moments when harmful microbes are most likely to be spread in order to break the chain of infection transmission the key risk moments within home and everyday settings include food handling using the toilet and changing a babys diapernappy touching surfaces frequently touched by others coughing sneezing and nose blowing handling and laundering clothing and household linen caring for domestic animals disposing of refuse and caring for an infected family member who is shedding infectious microbes into the environment15

83

84
microbiological data15

16 suggest that the surfaces that are most often responsible for spread of harmful microbes at key moments include the hands themselves hand contact surfaces food contact surfaces and cleaning cloths and other cleaning items figure 2
 these surfaces are referred to as critical surfaces or critical control points clothing household linen toilets sinks and bath surfaces may also contribute to establishing a chain of infection however the risks associated with these surfaces are typically lower as they rely on the hands and other chain links to disseminate infectious microbes to cause human exposurean important aspect of targeted hygiene is hygienic cleaning  as opposed to visible cleaning  to break the chain of infection this is achieved using hygiene procedures products plus process to reduce pathogenic microorganisms on critical surfaces to a level where they are no longer harmful to health  thereby preventing ongoing spread16

84 several methods exist to achieve such reduction in potential pathogens mechanicalphysical removal using dry wiping soap or detergent-based cleaning together with adequate rinsing inactivation or eradication using a disinfectant on hard surfaces or an alcohol-based sanitizer on the hands or a physical process such as heating to 60c140f or ultraviolet treatment most frequently a combination of these approaches is likely to be used16

84
when developing hygiene procedures aimed at breaking the chain of infection the goal should be to ensure that each procedure is appropriate to its intended use in recent years risk modelling has been developed in order to achieve this80 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was originally developed for ensuring water quality and is increasingly being used to develop infection prevention control strategies in other settings including healthcare85

86
qmra is a scientifically-validated approach that uses published data to model the chain of infection and estimate safe residual level of contamination at critical points in the chain84

87 this information is then used to estimate the log reduction required to reduce contamination to a safe level based on these estimates tests modelling use conditions can be used to develop effective hygiene procedures to achieve the required reduction the approach is set out in more detail by bloomfield et al84
in the past recommendations on selection of hygiene procedures for home and everyday life were based on the health status of family members and it is still argued by some that disinfectants should only be used in situations where people are infected or at increased risk of infection87 88 89 however if home and everyday life hygiene is to be effective one has to take into account the established evidence from models simulating use conditions showing that in some risk situations hygiene procedures that involve just wiping or detergent-based cleaning are insufficient19

chaidez et al demonstrated using qmra that twice-daily soaking of kitchen cleaning cloths in sodium hypochlorite disinfectant solution 21 reduced the average 6-week probability of acquiring a salmonella infection from handling cloths by almost 100-fold compared with usual cleaning practices36
although there is data to show that hygiene is important in preventing transmission of mrsa colonization and infection in the domestic environment further investigation is required to demonstrate the full extent to which poor home hygiene may contribute to the burden of foodborne infection associated with antibiotic resistant strainsquantifying the impact of hygiene on the burden of infection in home and everyday life is challenging because of the large population sizes required to generate significant results and difficulties in conducting studies involving multiple interventions most data have been generated from single intervention studies  primarily hand hygiene  where meta-analyses show a positive impact on gi and rt infections91 92 93
children who attend day-care centers have significantly more infections than those who do not the most common are rt and gi infections and the risk of otitis media is almost twice that of children remaining at home94 studies in day-care centers and schools in which hand hygiene was combined with cleaning andor disinfection of environmental surfaces indicate a positive impact on illness rates and reduction in the use of antibiotics94 95 96 97
in an intervention study96 in a preschool setting involving enhanced environmental cleaning and disinfection with an emphasis on toys the number of courses of antibiotics administered to children aged 6 weeks to 5 years was reduced from a median of 033 2575 interquartile range iqr 025067 per child per month to 028 2575 iqr 017042 p005 another 15 month study in 10 day-care centers involving intensified hand-washing use of alcohol-based disinfectant and disposable towels cleaning of the day-care center and regular washing of toys resulted in 24 95 ci 22 27 fewer prescriptions of antimicrobials amongst the children and staff p0001 94 a 2018 hand hygiene study at child care centers reported a 30 reduction of antibiotic prescriptions for rt infections in a group who used hand sanitizers compared with a control group98 another 2018 intervention study99 found that children were prescribed antibiotics for significantly fewer weeks in day care centers using specific disinfecting products and cleaning protocols than centers that continued to use their standard procedures and products rr068 95 ci 054 086 p0001  a relative risk reduction of almost one-thirdto the best of our knowledge only one study on the impact of targeted hygiene in the home has been conducted100 this study conducted among low-income communities in cape town south africa evaluated the impact of hygiene education alone and education in combination with hand washing with soap at critical times bathing at least three times a week cleaningdisinfecting household surfaces at critical times and proper waste disposal100 the study reported that children under 5 years of age from the education only households were 25-times more likely to experience gi illness hazard ratio hr 25 95 ci 117 491 and 46-times more likely to experience rt illness hr 46 95 ci 197 1054 than those where households implemented the additional hygiene measures this study suggests the important role a multi-component intervention including hygiene education and the use of hygiene product plays in reducing the risk of infections in a home setting however according to a recent literature review of 29 studies assessing behavior change interventions designed to increase hand-hygiene and environmental disinfecting in settings likely to include children in order to widely implement such approaches and see better infection outcomes significant hygiene behavior change is still needed for communities101
qmra is also now being used to estimate the impact of hygiene interventions on infection in community settings102 haas et al103 used qmra to compare the impact of hand hygiene on transmission from hand to mouth of e coli o157h7 following hand contact with groundminced beef it was determined that if no handwashing was performed this would result in 07 infections per year by contrast if all individuals washed their hands with soap following contact with the groundminced beef producing a 03 log reduction on hands this would result in an estimated 0014 infections per year 98 median risk reduction compared with no handwashing if all individuals used an alcohol-based hand sanitizer following contact with the beef producing a 43 log reduction on the hands this would result in an estimated 000005 infectionsyear  a 999996 median risk reduction for the hand sanitizer compared with handwashingduff et al104 developed a computer-based model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a disinfection program that targeted high-risk food preparation activities in household kitchens the model estimated that approximately 80000 salmonella campylobacter and e coli o157 infections could be prevented annually in us homes resulting in 138 million in direct medical cost savings and a gain of 15845 quality-adjusted life-years qalys set against a program cost of 788 million the program was associated with a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio of 41021qaly gained results were similar for households in canada and the ukconcern has been expressed as to whether expanding use of microbicidal products in the home and everyday life may contribute to the rise in amr105 sub-lethal levels of microbicides can induce stress on bacterial cells causing expression of mechanisms that reduce the biocide concentration at the bacterial target site further and allow the bacterial cell to repair106

107 these include overexpression of an efflux system membrane regulatory changes and changes in membrane permeability and composition107 these same mechanisms can produce changes in the susceptibility profile to unrelated antimicrobials107 in other words the use of microbicides may cross-select for antibiotic resistance and be associated with reduced antibiotic susceptibility to clinically significant levels recently reviewed by maillard107factors inherent to the microbicide ie concentration formulation mechanism of action the microorganisms ie typestrain metabolism resistance mechanisms and product usage eg concentration exposure time all impact on product efficacy 107 decreases in efficacy for example following shorter contact time or product dilution will lead to bacterial survival  antimicrobial damage caused by a sub-lethal concentration of a microbicide is likely to be repairable107
a number of expert reports commissioned in the last 10 years have highlighted laboratory studies linking microbicide use with reduced antibiotic susceptibility however these reports conclude that there is little evidence for this effect occurring in real-life clinical practice and have called for further research into whether microbicide use influences antibiotic resistance in the community108 109 110 111
rutala et al 2000 found that the frequency of occurrence of antibiotic resistance in environmental isolates from homes was much lower than for clinical isolates from a hospital intensive care unit and an outpatient setting where there was routine extensive use of antibiotics112
two studies were carried out to investigate whether antibiotic resistant strains were more likely to be found in homes where antibacterial products were used compared with homes where they were not113

114 samples were collected from houses in the usa and uk of 30 users and nonusers of antibacterials susceptibility tests against antibiotics and antibacterial agents triclosan pine oil bac and para-chloro-meta-xylenol were carried out on the bacteria isolated the authors concluded that there was no evidence that antibiotic resistant strains occurred more frequently in user homes compared with non-user homes a 1-year study by aiello et al 2005 also showed that household use of antibacterial cleaning products was not a significant risk factor for occurrence of antibiotic resistant isolates from hands115
despite more than 20 years of research there is still no conclusive resolution to the question of whether and to what extent microbicides might contribute to amr in clinical practice in light of laboratory data which indicates that microbicide-induced amr is biologically plausible for some types of microbicides it is concluded that use of microbicides needs to be prudent and appropriate and that the products containing them must be used at recommended concentrations and with the appropriate contact timetargeted hygiene works to ensure that use of disinfectants and hand sanitizers ie microbicides used at the correct concentration and contact time are confined to situations where there is identifiable risk of spread of harmful microorganisms ensuring that they play an essential role in tackling amr the need for antibiotic prescribing may in fact increase if disinfectants and hand sanitizers are not used as indicated due to the increased risk of infection and survival of bacteria bearing amr determinants these could potentially spread to other areas in the home and on into the community it is important to note also that preventing viral infections as well as bacterial infections such as those that cause respiratory and gi infections can also have a role in reducing amr as this will eliminate the potential for mis-prescribing or misuse of antibioticsin lmics and all countries regardless of their health development index measurement of a countrys overall social and economic development the principles of targeted hygiene are the same as those for high-income countries hics pathogens from infected or contaminated sources are introduced into the home and other settings and spread via critical surfaces such as hands frequently touched and food contact surfaces the major differences are that there are more risk factors for infection including drug-resistant infections in the community in lmics as a result of sub-optimal environmental sanitation lack of environmental regulations high-density housing and inadequate access to clean water due to contamination during collection transportation storage and use116 these issues can lead to situations such as those found in india where unregulated over-the-counter sales of antibiotics poor sanitation and environmental antibiotic pollution alongside other behavioral cultural and social factors have created ideal conditions for a rapid rise in mdr infections117

in 2015 an estimated 663 million people around the world were drinking from unimproved water sources and 24 billion had no access to improved sanitation  the vast majority of these were in sub-saharan africa and south asia119 it is estimated that 23 billion people lack the use of sanitation facilities which are not shared with other households120 and 892 million people still defecate in the open leading to contamination of drinking water sources and spread of disease121 higher amr rates in lmics in which per-capita antibiotic consumption is far lower than in high-income countries suggests that environmental and other factors are contributing to the increased prevalence of amr5
a number of audit studies have been conducted evaluating the occurrence of microbes in homes in lmics mostly reporting on the presence of coliforms or total counts see review by bloomfield et al43 as with studies conducted in hics the highest levels of contamination in lmics are typically found in moist locations such as kitchen sponges and dishcloths122 123 124 the key question however is whether and to what extent the incidence and levels of potentially harmful pathogens and thus infection risks are higher in homes without access to adequate water and sanitationsinclair and gerba124 monitored fecal coliforms total coliforms e coli and heterotrophic plate count bacteria on household surfaces in 8 homes that had improved latrines ie a pour-flush latrine in a rural village of cambodia and compared the results with similar data from homes in the us39 and japan40 fecal coliform levels in cambodia were found to be highest in moist locations such as the plastic ladle used for sink water the toilet seat surface and the cutting board surface124 for e coli the mean log cfu per 4 cm2 ranged from 05 to 40 with highest counts found on the top of the squat toilet the wash basin and the floor around the toilet fecal coliform levels were 100-fold higher on these surfaces in cambodia than on equivalent surfaces in the us and japanese studiesin lmics due to a lack of basic sanitation good hand hygiene is of vital importance116
globally it has been estimated that only 19 of the population washes its hands with soap after contact with excreta93 observations show that hand washing with soap is undertaken in an ad hoc manner116 with many households having no access to handwashing facilities125 unsurprisingly studies in lmics have reported high levels of fecal indicator bacteria on the hands of household members126 127 128 with one study correlating presence of fecal contamination on the hands with the prevalence of gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms within the household126 a cochrane review showed that improving hand washing practices probably reduces diarrhea episodes in child day-care centers in both high income countries and among communities living in low to middle income countries by as much as 3092
the evidence set out in this paper suggests that if combined with measures ensuring clean water and adequate sanitation targeted hygiene practices in home and everyday life settings could make a significant contribution to tackling amr through infection prevention and a consequential reduction in antibiotic prescribing this is true in all areas of the world including low-income countriesadditionally the evidence suggests that hygiene promotion would contribute to preventing the transmission of resistant bacteria from the home and everyday life settings into healthcare settings and back into the community further research is still needed to evaluate the extent to which this might occur especially in communities in low income countriesto be effective hygiene interventions need to consider all aspects that are likely to affect the outcome this includes a reduction of antibiotics from the food chain and the environment improved hygiene education and availability of appropriate products as well as the provision of clean water and improved sanitationbased on these findings the authors of this paper issue a call to action to national and international health policy makers health agencies and healthcare professionals to give greater recognition to the importance of hygiene in the home and everyday life and development and promotion or more effective codes of practice for hygiene in the home and everyday life as part of national action plans to tackle amr although the precise impact of hygiene on transmission of infection between community and healthcare settings needs further investigation it is important to recognise that reducing the need for antibiotic prescribing and the circulation of amr strains in healthcare settings cannot be achieved without also reducing circulation of infections and amr strains in the community we cannot allow hygiene in home and everyday life settings to become the weak link in the chainthe development of this position paper was supported by an educational grant from reckitt benckiser who fund the activity of the global hygiene council medical writing support was provided by the medical communications agency spink which runs the secretariat for the ghchaving a collaborative planning prevents potential mismatches in expectations and priorities between nursing educators and nursing students the planning team includes nursing educators and nursing students to design of content and activity plans for meeting the various needs of nursing students when a nursing educator starts a virtual classroom program a specific scope of teaching tasks will be suggested for example a task of hand hygiene when how and why the planning team can review the following questions to evaluate teaching tasks1what is the content specific scope of a hand hygiene task2what is the learning mode video or e-notes for hand hygiene3do all parties educators and students support the task of hand hygiene
these questions can reflect teaching content learning modes and the task of educators and students in preparing the necessary hand hygiene resourcesnursing educators need to upload teaching materials including reading materials handouts and videos there are many resources in the electronic platform such as world health organization who 2009 in addition local health organizations also provide useful information such as centre for health protection hong kong website of centre for health protection hong kong httpswwwchpgovhkenhealthtopicscontent46019728html displays hand hygiene videos pamphlets booklets and posters in various fields for example at home schools clinics and hospitals to help healthcare workers promoting hand hygiene for example washing hands with soap and water and rubbing hands with alcohol-based hand lotion these essential resources can help nursing educators build electronic libraries by selecting relevant materials to match current hand hygiene courses for enriching previous campus teachingin the step of selecting the necessary resources nursing educators can reassess three reviewing questions in step 1 the first question can reflect what the specific scope of hand hygiene is such as the different aspects between hand sanitization and washing hands with soap and water the second question can help nursing educators choose a learning mode for example instructional videos can provide visual guidance to show when nursing students need to wash hands with soap and water instead of sanitizing hands with alcohol hand-rub the third question is to determine possible arrangements in different situations including the availability of equipment water supply in ambulances these questions can help decide the necessary resources by considering the content mode and arrangements of the taskonline platforms such as zoom zoomnownet and blockboard blackboardcom provide online platforms on mobile phones laptops and computers for online seminars conferences and presentations the online platform expands traditional classrooms into virtual classrooms through technology nursing educators deliver online teaching for nursing students through online platforms enabling nursing students to receive school announcements in a virtual classroom discuss and display collaborative works synchronously for example a nursing educator can discuss the time needed to wash hands with soap students can display their answers and the educator can provide immediate feedback to studentsif all students are self-disciplined then virtual classroom education can improve student learning outcomes considering self-discipline ng and yip 2019 recommend that all participants should follow mutually agreed rules to respect nursing educators and students as a result nursing educators can provide nursing students with study guides including the structure of virtual classrooms and how students expect to interact with the educators and other students nursing students should follow study guides to participate in learning activities nursing educators also regularly check nursing students on-line participation feedback on the progress of nursing students ensures that students make progress towards achieving individual or group learning goals to assess learning outcomes of hand hygiene korthonen et al 2019 developed a multi-component hand hygiene intervention mchhi mchhi has 17 questions such as hand disinfection is not needed before donning gloves and hand should be disinfected after touching the patients immediate surroundings ibid nursing students can use mchhi to evaluate learning outcomes through self-assessment and peer assessmentthis virtual classroom approach is a design for an online environment that provide real-time interaction between nursing educators and nursing students nursing educators can plan prepare and perform hand hygiene reinforcement during suspensions of on campus learning whether novice and experienced nursing educators this 3-step approach can be used to enhance the hand hygiene of clinical nursing students hand hygiene is very important to health care professionals this virtual classroom approach can be applied to nursing education and other health care education such as medical education physiotherapy education and occupational therapy education as the rapid growth of tandem transportation has reached an unprecedented level of global connectivity with the disaster regions some preventive measures against covid-19 have be announced in the affected countries including campus course suspensions applying this virtual classroom approach to countries where campus classes are suspended will be an alternative method to enhance hand hygieneall the authors contributed to the planning drafting and revision this editorialthis editorial did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public commercial and nonprofit sectorsin italy the spread of the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the unsolved problems inherent to the prison system since the abolition of death penalty a sentence to prison is the harshest punishment imposed on criminals in italy prison has substantially a threefold purpose first the separation from society and confinement of dangerous individuals for the safety of the public second by depriving someone of their liberty for a period of time it is achieved a punishment for crime that also act as a deterrent for the rest of the society third correction and rehabilitation to the community with the possibility of preparing the prisoner for a law-abiding life recent riots in italian prisons have made it clear that something in the delicate balance between confinement punishment and rehabilitation has failed abovementioned riots - according to what the minister of justice reported in parliament - involved about 6000 prisoners 10 of the prison population and led to the death 13 prisoners furthermore 40 prison officers got injured in addition to the devastation of several institutions and the escape of dozens of prisoners some of whom are still wanted in front of these episodes it could be difficult not to return an image of the prisoner as a dangerous person and therefore to be controlled and regulated the great challenge of this moment is not to give in to a custodial involution of the prison and to keep in mind that the conditions of life in the detention institutions particularly inadequate to face the ongoing pandemic emergency can act as a stressful factor to aggravate the discomfort inherent in the loss of freedom these riots were triggered both by the fear of contracting coronavirus in closed overcrowded and precariously hygienic environments and the limitations imposed on prisoners by italian law to prevent the spread of the virus these measures provided that in-person visits were no longer allowed up to the end of the month and there was the possible suspension of premium permits and the semi-freedom regime however the riots of these days have reminded us the most serious problem of italian prison system which is undoubtedly overcrowding in italian prisons more than ten thousand detainees are held in excess of the regular capacity in march 2019 out of 46904 places available in the italian prison institutions there were 60512 prisoners that is 13608 more than the regular capacity with an overcrowding of 129 furthermore there is a wide spectrum of health problems whose prevalence is greater among prisoners than in the general population in italian prisons there is an overrepresentation of drug addicts some of these fragile detainees during the riots died from drug overdose after assaulting the infirmaries to steal methadone a synthetic opioid used in the treatment of opioid addiction overcrowding and overrepresentation of drug addicts are chronic issues of the italian prison system the coronavirus pandemic only forced us for a moment to look at these unsolved problems before returning to look at what society considers most notable nevertheless it will be difficult to forget the worrying fragility of the penitentiary system which has appeared not able to guarantee conditions of security and public order neither inside the jail nor outside where escaped prisoners have not been captured yet the public disorder we have witnessed can have profoundly destabilizing effects by instilling fear in the population who feel own safety already threated by the pandemic and by jeopardizing efforts made to make prisons more humanit is precisely when it is more difficult to recognize aspects of humanity in the prisoners behaviour that we must ask ourselves what we have done wrong as a society if it is true as dostoevsky said that the degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons the journey to be undertaken is still long and difficult in these days we have to face the challenging problem of how to protect the health of prisoners during a pandemic preventing contagion in prison in fact compared with the general population prisoners and detainees worldwide experience a higher burden of infectious diseases the prevalence of hiv hcv hbv and tuberculosis is higher in prison populations than in the general population mainly because of the criminalisation of drug use and the detention of people who use drugs 1 it is also known that there are some contextual factors within prisons which contribute to a higher risk of infectious disease transmission among prisoners such factors include overcrowding risk behaviour delay or lack of diagnosis and treatment limited access to clean water inadequate sanitation and lack of harm reduction measures 2 in order to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreaks in prison whoeurope has published interim guidance on how to deal with the coronavirus disease in these settings entitled preparedness prevention and control of covid-19 in prisons and other places of detention 3 taking into account that infection can be spread to people who are nearby within 1 m by breathing in droplets coughed out or exhaled by a person with the covid-19 virus or people may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces or objects fomites and then touching their eyes nose or mouth eg a person may touch a doorknob or shake hands and then touch their own face this interim guidance recommend to take general precautions for infectious respiratory diseases as observing physical distancing washing hands with soap and water and drying them with single-use towels utilizing alcohol hand sanitizer containing at least 60 alcohol covering mouth and nose with disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing and avoiding touching of eyes nose or mouth if hands are not clean it is clear that preventing the importation of the virus into prisons and other places of detention is essential to avoid or minimize the occurrence of infection and of serious outbreaks in these settings and beyondthere is a need for a continuous balance between the protection of the security of the prison administration with the need to limit the use of external hospitalization to only the necessary cases and the protection of the health of detainees nevertheless it must be kept in mind that even washing your hands can be difficult in prison because there are lots of people using a small number of bathrooms and it is not always possible to access to soap when you wash your hands the detainees are deeply aware of this and this awareness mixed with fear has led them to the riots of these days we cannot forget that prison health is public health by definition 4 the intrinsic difficulties in balancing the deteinees right to health and the protection of public security which could be affected by the effects of both an excessively high number of releases and the release of particular categories of subjects are resonating in these days following the adoption under age and health reasons of house arrest for some members of organized crime during this tragic period its our duty as a society to protect disadvantaged people and put in place concrete measures to ensure that prisoners who already do not have full constitutional rights as the fundamental right to freedom will not also deprived of the right to healththis research received no external fundingnot applicablenot applicablepamela tozzo investigation conceptualization writing - review  editing gabriella dangiolella writing - original draft investigation luciana caenazzo conceptualization supervision writing - review  editingthe authors declare no conflict of interesthardly a day passes without new headlines concerning infectious disease threats the time is far from near to close the book on infectious disease not all infectious disease threats evolve into outbreaks or major incidents and all threats concerning suspected infectious diseases do not turn out to have infectious causesinitially the cause of major incidents often is not clearly identified this holds true especially for incidents in which symptoms of the affected persons are diffuse the conditions are undiagnosed or the hazardous materials involved are not clearly identified many incidents caused by material other than biological contaminants are often initially classified as suspected infectious incidents but when the full picture becomes clear they are found to have other causes for example intoxication by chemical or radiological agents one reason for this is that most societies have surveillance systems that most of the time direct their major interest toward the more common entity infectious diseasesinfectious diseases can constitute major incidents alone or as a part of or consequence of an incident having a non-infectious cause the infections that follow as a part of or a direct consequence of a disaster may have several different causes and they can differ depending on what type of primary incident they are secondary to the primary incident can lead to disruption of the infrastructure in the affected society which secondary can result in increasing biological incidents through for example increased crowding collapse of water deteriorating sanitation and hygienic conditions drought or famine secondary effects can even be seen within medical institutions for example as a consequnce of a lessened capacity to isolate infected individualsbecause of some of these circumstances infections can change in both clinical presentation as well as increase in virulence of the microorganism  the ability of the microorganism to cause disease certain communicable diseases are more prone to cause outbreaks than others and can cause disasters independentlyexamples of infectious diseases causing disasters independently are pandemics caused by microorganisms such as influenza or cholera before the outbreak in 2003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars it was an unknown type of infection and is another example of infection constituting a major incident independently sars also gives us a serious example of how emerging infections can be included in the term biological major incidents the term emerging infections sometimes covers both new and previously unknown contagions as well as reappearing older contagions or re-emerging infectionshumanitarian emergencies caused by conflict or natural disasters are frequently characterized by the displacement of large numbers of people the populations affected are often resettled in temporary locations with high population densities inadequate food and shelter unsafe water and poor sanitation these conditions can increase the risk of transmission of communicable diseases and other conditions and lead to increased mortality particularly from diseases prone to outbreakto address this increased risk specialized systems for disease surveillance and response are often set up in the affected areas during the acute phase of emergencies by national ministries often with support from the world health organization who and other agencies these early-warning disease surveillance and response systems are designed to detect and respond rapidly to outbreaks and disease clusters in populations affected by humanitarian emergenciesmajor incidents caused by a microorganism or its toxins also should be considered as possible bioterrorism incidents and they are more often suspected as such than what they turn out to be in realityseveral myths are circulating about natural disasters and their possible direct cause of outbreaks one is that natural disasters themselves cause epidemics outbreaks are however usually secondary to the displacement of people and disruption of infrastructures as mentioned above the appearance of infections after a disaster is therefore usually of the same type of infections that are present in the area before the incident but with a possible increase in numbers a resent example of this is the situation in haiti after the extraordinarily devastating earthquake that occurred in january 2010another common myth is that dead bodies spread epidemics carcases smell and are generally unpleasant to see and to handle they are however more of a sanitary problem but in most circumstances if handled properly they are not dangerous it is only in large-scale cholera epidemics or outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever vhf such as the ebola virus when bodies might be a direct threat to public health those who have survived a natural disaster are usually more likely to spread diseases than are dead bodiesmicrobiological incidents consequent to technical development can be caused by for example failing systems for the supply of water sanitation and ventilation these incidents can happen in a community a building or a transport facility many recent food- or waterborne outbreaks are consequences of mistreatment in the modern chains of distribution of food or watercrowding of people as well as animals constitute examples of technical development that can lead to infectious incidents such as highly pathogenic avian influenza which appears mainly in densely populated poultry farms another example is the increased risk of epidemic meningitis that occurs when extreme crowding of people takes place as it does during the pilgrimage to mecca hajja well-known incident with spread of contagious spores over a large surface area happened in sverdlovsk former sovietunion in 1979 several cases of anthrax occurred among humans as well as livestock downwind from a microbiology plant fig 122 the cause was revealed several years after the incident as an accident after the misuse of filters which led to the dissemination of anthrax spores into open air
incidents consisting mainly of primary physical trauma can have secondary results of infectious disease incidents such as a sharp increase in the number of wound infections or a shortage of isolation facilities hospital-acquired infectious diseases are another increasing form that is directly related to technical development in hospital settings and the development of medical techniquesmicrobiological incidents intentionally caused by man are often termed bioterrorism they can be used intentionally during war as well as in other situations an international agreement against the use of biological weapons was achieved under the united nations in 1975 at the biological and toxin weapons convention btwcthe production and spread of biological agents requires both knowledge and resources to produce sufficient amounts of the agent along with methods to weaponize the material the latter problem is often underestimated and is why attempts of biological warfare often have failed however in spite of the 1975 btwc agreement several attempts have been made to use biological weapons eg during the iraqiran war in the 1980san attempt to spread anthrax spores to the public in japan by the terror group aum shinrikyo in 1995 failed mainly because of the use of the wrong source of microbiological material a nonpathogenic vaccine-derived strain was used causing no harm at allthe first time a successful intentional spread of anthrax was confirmed was in 2001 after the world trade center attack on september 11 the attack was followed by an intentional spread of anthrax through the mail system in the united states with several fatalities caused by the most serious and well-weaponized form of anthraxa man-made disaster that was presumably not caused directly or intentionally by man but could still rather easily have been foreseen or predicted as a direct consequence was the extensive outbreak of cholera in zimbabwe and adjacent countries in 20082009 in spite of intense efforts from the international society the outbreak did not cease until approximately 100000 people where affected an unusually high case fatality rate clearly indicated a society under misadministration with failing infrastructure and a health system in ruinsat present the largest threats to the infectious disease arena is probably microbiological incidents consequent to changes in climate and natureinfectious diseases re-emerge in areas where they previously have been eradicated or spread to new regions because of changes in climate for example climate change has the potential to increase substantially the presence of malaria in areas where it previously has been eradicated the spread of dengue fever and the appearance of the viral infection chikungunya in southern europe are examples of incidents that most likely have one cause in ongoing climate changeclimate change also can lead to increased drought and possibly famine displacement of populations shortage of water floods storms and tsunamis all of which can secondarily lead to and increase in infectious disease incidentsthere is an obvious difference in potential microbiological hazards when for example a flood is caused by sea water or fresh water the sharp increase in numbers of cases with severe leptospirosis in the philippines in 2009 after the heaviest rains and fresh-water floods in modern history presented problems with different pathogens than what occurred after the salt-water floods in the southern united states in 2005 after hurricane katrinathe increasing problem with antimicrobial resistance is another change by nature that is considered to be one of the strongest disease threats at present the bugs are fighting back and the situtation as it was before antibiotics were available seems to be returning quicker than anyone could expectinfectious disease incidents have certain characteristics that differentiate them from most other types of major incidentsthe dissemination of or exposure to an infectious agent usually is not noticed until after some latency because the substance is not noted in any obvious way when the incident itself occurs  it is not seen or heard has no smell and is first noticed only when the exposed persons develop symptoms the number of affected can rise sharply even logarithmically if the agent involved is communicable with a high reproductive rate the potential for the contagion to spread from person to person the large number of people who possibly can be affected during a large-scale communicable disease incident is exemplified with recent epidemics in table 121
there is almost always a delay between when the incident occurs until it is discovered or revealed as such and may take even longer to be identified as a specific infectious disease incident the detection of infectious disease incidents relies mostly on different surveillance systems different methods of surveillance constitute the basis for the detection of infectious disease incidentsan outbreak or an epidemic is by definition when more cases of a certain infection are noted or diagnosed than what is expected terminology common for biological incidents are stated in table 122an outbreak can be obvious or insidious depending on the symptoms present and how well surveillance is conducted most countries have national surveillance systems for a number of different infectious diseases the national authorities are linked and report to each other through different networks or organizations eg globally through who within the european union through the european centre for disease prevention and control and through disease-specific networks such as enter-net international surveillance network for enteric infections and the european working group for legionella infections

international surveillance reporting and responding is coordinated through who and its member states global roles have been implemented through who and its international health regulations ihr to enhance public health security at all levels global national as well as regional the ihr is an international legal instrument binding 194 countries including all the member states of who the aim of the ihr is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwidein the globalized world diseases can spread far and wide via international travel and trade a health crisis in one country can impact livelihoods and economies in many parts of the world such crises can result from emerging infections like sars or a new human pandemic influenza the ihr can also apply to other public health emergencies such as chemical spills leaks and dumping or nuclear meltdowns the ihr aim to limit interference with international traffic and trade while ensuring public health through the prevention of the spread of diseasethe ihr which entered into action on june 15 2007 requires countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events through focal points to who building on the unique experience of who in global disease surveillance alert and response the ihr define the rights and obligations of countries to report public health events and establish a number of procedures that who must follow in its work to uphold global public health securitythe ihr also require countries to strengthen their existing capacities for public health surveillance and response who is working closely with countries and partners to provide technical guidance and support to mobilize the resources needed to implement the new rules the overall aim is that timely and open reporting of public health events will make the world more secure in this aspectwho also coordinates a global network of experts  the global outbreak alert and response network goarn  that can step into action on request goarn is a technical collaboration of existing institutions and networks that pool human and technical resources for the rapid identification of confirmation of and response to outbreaks of international importancedetection of an infectious disease incident depends largely on how sensitive and rapid a surveillance system is parallel to traditional surveillance systems are implemented to get early warnings for infectious disease incidents through for example syndromes health-related information activities within the population figures of absentees or crude mortality data all surveillance data are meant to give alerts and if needed result in different levels and types of response ie they provide the data needed for actionsyndromic and similar methods for surveillance can be more open to unknown changes in the panorama of diseases as well as the appearance of previously unknown contagions many new emerging infections as well as the re-emergence of previously known pathogens have occurred during the last decades well-known examples are hiv aids helicobacter pylori as a causative agent for duodenal peptic ulcers borrelia burgdorferi as the cause of different manifestations of borreliosis and coronavirus causing sarssurveillance for emerging infections also needs to cover areas outside human medicine zoonotic infections are infections that can spread from vertebrate animals to humans and vice versa surveillance for zoonotic infections thus needs to cover both public and animal health communities to increase the surveillance for emerging diseases that have a potential for widespread and serious transmission the flu pandemic of h1n1 in 20092010 is one example of this where the new viral strain actually had been circulating in pigs for almost a decade and probably jumped to humans only months before it was detected in mexico in the spring of 2009the time period from dissemination of or exposure to an infectious agent and onset of the first clinical symptoms varies depending on what type of microorganism is involved and the susceptibility of those exposed to the agent of concerned the time period from exposure and infection to onset of symptoms is the incubation period the incubation period usually varies within a certain time range and is dependent on several factors such as infectious dose mode of transmission and susceptibility of the exposedlack of susceptibility to a specific agent can have immunity as one explanation among many immunity can be genetically determined congenital or acquired after exposure or immunizationseveral infectious diseases can be treated with antimicrobial agents either prophylactic ie before or curative ie after symptoms have occurredthe first case diagnoseddetected with the infection in question is named the index case whereas the first case in an outbreak or an incident ie the case that brought the contagion into a population or group of people is the primary casean infectious disease can spread among a group or a population at different speeds depending on factors such as mode of transmission frequency and type of contact grade of exposure immunity among the population and the potential for the contagion to spread from person to person which is termed the reproductive or transmission raterelevant characteristics of infectious disease incidents are summarized in table 123
knowledge about how to limit the spread of infections is as important as knowledge about transmission routes for different pathogens because most pathogens and conditions are unknown in the individual contact situation some basic rules are important to know and to practice from a general point of view steps to be taken to achieve adequate personal protection depend on the outcome of the risk assessment conducted for each specific situation the appearance of an infectious agent or disease at a certain place or at a certain time can be part of the natural occurrence of the microorganism concerned but it also can be a consequence of environmental contamination either accidental or intentionaleach individual has physiological barriers such as skin and mucous membranes that function fairly well at least as long as the barriers are intact the barrier effect can be much improved and risks of exposure limited by introducing hygienic routines that are practiced at each level of contact between staff and potentially affected persons ie every patient in a treatment or nursing situation basic hygienic routines include disinfection of hands with alcohol-based items before and after each physical contact the use of disposable gloves when in contact with secretions or for investigations and the use of disposable aprons and eye and mouth protection when there is a risk of fluid splash point disinfection is added for environmental use eg on surfaces once splash has occurred figure 123 shows medical staff equipped according to these principles

personal protective equipment ppe varies from situation to situation as a consequence of several factors such as the contagiousness of the suspected pathogen its routes of transmission and the severity of the condition concerned an increasing level of personal protection can be achieved through adding face masks or respiratory protective gear to the basic hygienic routines stated above and into the full ppe recommended for use when there is for example a suspicion of the presence of vhf pathogens as illustrated in figs 124 and 125 the infectious agents causing vhf can serve well as a model situation when it comes to the use of ppe the vhf agents can be transmitted by all known modes of transmission and the conditions hold a high fatality rate once transmission has occurred


decontamination is seldom used environmentally for biological agents apart from in the medical setting for individual patients and for material and surfacesthe communicable disease most often subject to more extensive decontamination of the environment and contaminated individuals is anthrax decontamination of the environment can be difficult time consuming extensive and extremely costly because of the ability of the anthrax bacteria to form extremely viable spores each decontamination plan has to be tailored to the unique situation concerned for anthrax this has been shown both historically and recently in spite of the presence of modern techniques equipment and resourcesin 1942 during the second world war the small island of gruinard off the northwest scottish coast was the site of a biological warfare test performed by british military scientists fig 126 decontamination attempts on the island after the biological warfare testing were unsuccessful because of the durability of anthrax spores as a result gruinard island was quarantined for many years afterwards visits to the island were strictly prohibited except by personnel checking the level of contamination in 1986 a decontamination effort was started using several hundred tons of formaldehyde solution diluted in seawater and sprayed all over the island together with removal of the worst contaminated topsoil around the dispersal site a flock of sheep was then placed on the island and remained healthy not until 1990 after 48 years of quarantine the island was announced safe for habitation
the spread of anthrax by mail in the united states after the world trade center attack on september 11 2001 killed five people closed down a senate office building nearly paralyzed the us postal system and caused national and international panic the environmental decontamination methods used on this occasion were chlorine gas and other decontaminants the senate building could reopen 3 months after the contamination occurredthe investigation of this incident the amerithrax investigation was conducted by the federal bureau of investigation fbi and lasted for 6 years it was thereby the largest and most extensive inquest in the history of the fbi the incident was finally assessed as an intentional criminal activity without connection to any political activities however complete resolution was never achieved because the main suspect committed suicide before the investigation could be finalized
personal protection is more than physiological and biological barriers immunity needs to be considered as part of personal protection immunity can be congenital or acquired acquired immunity can follow natural exposure with or without obvious disease followed by recovery or can be induced through immunizationpassive or preferably active immunization vaccination is possible for many infectious diseases the duration of the protection achieved depends on the type of immunizing agent used and if the response is upheld naturally or if it is boosted through concomitant dosesthe possibility of using immunization during an infectious disease outbreak however is often limited because of factors such as delay in identification of the microorganism concerned delay in the development of an immune response in the immunized individual difficulties in defining a target population for directed immunization and in some instances the cost of the vaccine as well as availability of the vaccine concerned
immunization is one active way of providing protection on an individual as well as on a population basis the level of immunity in a defined population that prevents the occurrence of epidemics is known as herd immunity the herd immunity varies with the transmission rate of the disease concerned a high transmission rate takes a higher degree of herd immunity to prevent occurrence of an outbreak for most communicable diseases the herd immunity lies between 75 and 85in most circumstances achievement of immunity through immunization has the drawback that it requires some time to develop the length of time needed to develop immunity depends on what type of vaccine is used and the number of doses and dose-intervals needed to achieve full protection the duration of immunity achieved through vaccination also varies correspondingly depending on the type of vaccine and the number of doses givenpersonal protection can in certain instances also be achieved through prophylactic medication such prophylaxis can be administered before or after exposure preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis and needs to vary in length depending on the organism concerned its incubation period and possible ongoing exposure prophylactic medication with antimicrobials is seldom justified exceptions include exposure to anthrax material when several cases of meningococcal disease have occurred in a closed population malaria and specific situations with hiv exposurethe final measure to stop transmission of a contagion and its course once the disease has developed in an infected individual is treatmentan intentionally caused incident can be suspected when either the number of cases or crude mortality show a rapid increase the cases have an unusual presentation only in numbers or in clinical symptoms or a different attack rate can be observed ie indoors or at another distinct location an unusual presentation of a known disease or contagion that show an unusual pattern of sensitivity and solitary cases of a condition with high potential for use as bioterror agent are other situations that should increase the suspicion of having an intentional causethe importance of a broad surveillance system covering both known and unknown conditions is crucial to enable an early alert and the possibility of responding to what is unexpected but suspectedduring the last four decades the emergence of new diseases has given us approximately 40 new infectious diseases such rapid development provides both good and strong reasons to keep and continuously develop an open-minded surveillance system for infectious diseases the expression expect the unexpected applies more to infectious disease preparedness than any other area within disaster medicineinfectious diseases are unique in many ways when causing major incidents microorganisms are part of our daily life and they can cause severe disease as well as large outbreaks and epidemics below are listed examples summarizing how infectious disease and microbiological threats are unique
the onset of an infectious disease incident is usually gradual but can rapidly increase and even reach logarithmic proportionsthe base of the detection of infectious disease incidents are well-developed and functioning surveillance and response systems such systems also need to include mechanisms to detect emerging infectionsthere is often a delay between the incident itself and its detection once an incident is detected most traces of it source are usually gone and the base of its detection is mainly through indirect epidemiological evidencethere are several ways to protect target populations and to stop an ongoing outbreakthe strongest medical threats at present are not bioterror activities instead they are an increase in resistance to antimicrobials  infections are becoming more and more untreatable
contact lenses represent a highly effective form of vision correction for an estimated 140 million people worldwide with a very low incidence of either microbial keratitis or symptomatic inflammatory keratitis in strict daily wear of contact lenses 1112 it is well established that contact lens wear and particularly overnight contact lens wear increases the risk of bacterial keratitis 12 13 14 15 16 it is also well established that viral conjunctivitis is the overall most common type of conjunctivitis 17 yet the eye ocular surface and tear film employ a variety of host-defense mechanisms such as physical barriers and immunological strategies that help reduce the chance of infection in the cornea and conjunctivaa pubmed search on 24th march 2020 found no evidence that contact lens wearers are more likely to contract covid-19 than spectacle wearers the likely belief for this being a concern relates to the fact that sars-cov-2 has been isolated in tears albeit to date infrequently 18 and also that the virus is known to be transferred by hand contact and thus could be transferred to contact lenses during their application and removal in one report positive tear and conjunctival secretions occurred in a single patient who developed conjunctivitis from a cohort of thirty patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia 18 in another report 19 64 samples of the tear film from 17 patients with covid-19 showed no evidence of sars-cov-2 by viral culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr further the frequency of conjunctivitis in patients with covid-19 reported to date is low at 3 1820 although it has been suggested that covs could possibly be transmitted by aerosol contact with the conjunctiva in patients with active disease 1820 21 22 23 24 however the question of whether covid-19 can occur through conjunctival exposure remains unknown 7 recent papers concluded that the eye is rarely involved by human cov infection nor is it a preferred gateway of entry for human covs to infect the respiratory tract 25 and that the results from this study suggests that the risk of sars-cov-2 transmission through tears is low 19 thus to date there are no findings that support concerns that healthy patients are more at risk of contracting covid-19 if they are contact lens wearersit could be argued that covid-19 is so new that such data would not yet exist however the lack of evidence from previous outbreaks of coronavirus disease including sars suggests that the risk of developing covid-19 from contact lens wear is low it is informative to consider viral diseases that are transmitted by direct contact and which could be used as a surrogate for evaluating the risks of covid-19 in contact lens wearers viruses that are associated with human infections have been found on ocular surface tissues or in the tear film these include but are not limited to both dna and rna viruses such as adenovirus other coronaviruses herpes virus human immunodeficiency virus influenza virus and zika virus 182226 27 28 29 that said these viruses are typically found at low levels and it is generally believed that they are not transmitted from the ocular surface with the exception of adenoviral infectionsone ocular viral infection to consider is epidemic keratoconjunctivitis ekc caused by the non-enveloped dna virus adenovirus this disease is highly contagious spreads rapidly through direct contact accounts for 65-90 of viral conjunctivitis cases 3031 and has been implicated in actively transmitted disease in eyecare clinics and other common healthcare settings where there is close contact between healthcare providers and patients 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 a review of the literature appears to show no increased risk for ekc in those wearing contact lenses versus non-lens wearers with a reported frequency of 3-15 in contact lens wearers 3236 indeed it has been proposed that bandage silicone hydrogel contact lenses can be used to help treat adenoviral infection in patients 39 there are conflicting data on herpes simplex keratitis hsk another dna virus but one that is enveloped and contact lens wear one prospective cohort study and one retrospective case control study showed no association between contact lens wear and hsk occurrence or reoccurrence whereas one retrospective study and a case report did suggest an association 40 41 42 43another virus for which there has been concern as it relates to the ocular surface is the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids with an estimated prevalence of 11 million in the us 44 hiv is an rna virus but a different form of rna virus called a retrovirus and has an envelope hiv has been detected in most ocular tissues including the cornea conjunctiva and tear film of patients with aids 45 it has also been recovered from the surface of a contact lens 46 it is presently believed however that hiv has not been transmitted via ocular surface tissues or the tear film the cdc specifically states hiv is not spread by saliva tears or sweat that is not mixed with the blood of an hiv-positive person 47 research has also indicated that with appropriate rubbing of contact lenses most contact lens care systems would likely prevent the chance of the lens transferring the virus to the eye and resulting in hiv 48 however because of the immunodeficiency and compromise it is recognized that aids is associated with opportunistic infections that can put an individual at risk for ocular infection 49 hiv has been identified as a risk factor for hospitalization for corneal ulceration while daily contact lens wear not overnight wear can be safe in a patient with aids it is important that the eyecare practitioner play an active role in managing the patient and their ocular health as it relates to safe contact lens wear a cd4 count indicating immunocompetence may be key in guiding these decisions on march 20 2020 the cdc released information related to patients with aids and precautions as it relates to covid-19 50 of course there are many differences in these viruses in terms of their structural biology vectors and other factors however with limited current data comparing contact lens wearers versus non-lens wearers in patients with covid-19 this remains the best evidence available of disease spread via viral contaminants that are highly infectious and potentially spread by direct contact and an exhaustive literature search would not support the apprehension that contact lens wear is a concerncoronaviruses are capable of producing a wide spectrum of ocular disease including anterior segment diseases such as conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis and posterior segment conditions like retinitis and optic neuritis 51 current understanding about how sars-cov-2 spreads is based largely on what is known about other similar coronaviruses currently two types of sars-cov-2 have been detected l and s 52 the l form is suspected to be the derived variant of the ancestral s type which is suggested to be more aggressive and is significantly more prevalent in wuhan china where covid-19 was first reported than other places although its frequency of isolation has decreased since january 2020 52 the virus spreads primarily via person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes 5354 however it also could be spread if people touch an object or surface with virus present from an infected person and then touch mucosal surfaces such as their mouth nose or eyes 54 55 56 given that contact lens wearers must touch their eyes when applying and removing their contact lenses it is understandable this has been raised as a potential concern for increasing their risk of exposure to the virus the consistent unambiguous advice to protect individuals from the virus is to employ frequent handwashing with soap and water the lipid envelope of the virus can be emulsified by surfactants such as those found in simple soap which kills the virus 5457 best practice advice for contact lens wearers includes the same instructions that should be imparted under all situations regardless of the covid-19 pandemic when using contact lenses careful and thorough hand washing with soap and water followed by hand drying with unused paper towels generally known as kitchen roll in the united kingdom is paramount for contact lens wearers this should occur before every contact lens application and removal and such practice reduces the risks of infection and inflammatory responses and is highly effective 58 it follows that as long as contact lens wearers are using correct hand hygiene techniques they should be limiting any virus transmission to their ocular surface and indeed as already stated there is currently no evidence that they are at any higher risk of developing covid-19 infection than non-wearersa systematic review of the literature shows that there is no scientific evidence that wearing spectacles provides protection against sars-cov-2 or other viral transmissions although this concept has been recently proposed in the media 59 60 61 this belief around the safety of spectacles likely exists because of the guidance to use approved personal protective eyewear medical masks goggles or face shields in certain settings involved in the care of infected patients 62 however these goggles and shields provide very different protection to that afforded by standard spectacles a difference recognised by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc who state that personal eyeglasses are not considered adequate eye protection 63
despite the cdcs clear delineation between standard spectacles and approved personal protective eyewear it is understandable that a misplaced belief still exists for spectacles being preferable to contact lenses there are a number of confounding factors however which do not support this theory consider firstly part-time wearers of spectacles who only use their spectacles for occasional distance use or for reading their assumed protection is intermittent and additionally their increased frequency of putting on and removing their spectacles adds to the potential of touching their face each time possibly in the absence of hand washing another point to consider is that some viruses such as sars-cov-2 can remain on hard plastic surfaces similar to those found in spectacle frames and lenses for hours to days 64 65 66 67 upon touching their spectacles any virus particles could potentially be transferred to the wearers fingers and face and thus adequate hand hygiene practices should also extend to the regular handling of spectacle and sunglass frames to prevent transmission of viral particles to the fingers and subsequently to the face spectacles should be regularly cleaned with soap and water and dried with paper towel to remove any adhered viral particleshands are a common vector for the transmission of respiratory infection 6869 an observational study of medical students examined the frequency with which they touched their face 70 on average each of the students touched their face 23 times per hour of all face touches 44 involved contact with a mucous membrane eyes nose or mouth versus 56 that involved contact with non-mucosal areas ears cheeks chin forehead or ear of the mucous membrane touches 36 involved the mouth 31 the nose 27 the eyes and 6 were a combination of these regions given this very high number of face touches hand washing becomes extremely important as a method to prevent transmission of any pathogenic organism from the fingers to the mucous membranes of the face it is also important to remember that the generally younger demographic of contact lens wearers are often seen to practice more risky behaviors such as the non-observance of social distancing seen recently during spring break in the us 71 which poses an inherent increased risk for sars-cov-2 infection hence it remains important to remind this age group of the role of hand hygiene in preventing both ocular and systemic infection regardless of their mode of vision correctionin addition to commons soaps used in hand washing the sars-cov-2 virus is very likely susceptible to the same alcohol- and bleach-based disinfectants that eye-care practitioners commonly use to disinfect ophthalmic instruments and office furniture 66 to prevent sars-cov-2 transmission the same disinfection practices already used to prevent office-based spread of other viral pathogens are recommended before and after every patient encounter many of these steps have been summarised in a recent editorial 72 which covers a number of important considerations for conducting safe clinical practice during the pandemicthe cdc and who recommend that people clean their hands often to reduce their risk of contracting the virus specifically they advise all people towash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after they have been in a public place or after blowing their nose coughing or sneezingif soap and water are not readily available they should use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 alcohol they should cover all surfaces of their hands and rub them together until they feel drythey should avoid touching their eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands
the use of daily disposable contact lenses substantially reduces the risks of many inflammatory complications 73 contact lens wearers should always either dispose of their daily disposable lenses each evening or regularly disinfect their monthly or two-week lenses according to manufacturer and eye care professional instructionsa point to consider is whether there are differences in the risk of sars-cov-2 infection between the various contact lens materials available suggestions have been made that siloxane-based materials silicone hydrogels are more likely to bind sars-cov-2 than hydrogels 61 and that these contact lens materials are particularly risky to wear a recent study showed that the aerosol and surface stability of both sars-cov-2 and its predecessor sars-cov-1 the viral strain associated with the prior sars epidemic of 2002 and 2003 was similar 74 specifically both viruses could be detected in aerosols for up to three hours on cardboard for 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel for 2-3 days to date there have been no laboratory studies reported on the ability of coronaviruses to adhere to contact lenses and none on the ability of disinfectants to kill coronaviruses adhered to contact lensesthere is no evidence of the presence of sars-cov-2 in the tears or conjunctival tissue of asymptomatic patients and even in those with confirmed disease the presence of sars-cov-2 on the ocular surface is low 18 19 20 thus binding of sars-cov-2 to contact lenses from the ocular surface in asymptomatic wearers would be unlikely it is advisable that patients with covid-19 should not wear contact lenses and if a patient were to develop covid-19 any contact lenses that were being worn at that time should be immediately disposed of as should any remaining disinfecting solutions and contact lens cases that the patient possess the patient must revert to spectacle lens wear and when fully recovered should recommence wear with a new pair of lensesthe issues that influence bacterial viral fungal and amoebic binding to contact lens materials are highly complex and variable with confounding data on the factors that impact microbial binding 75 76 77 78 79 80 to date no studies have addressed this issue specifically for the virus that causes covid-19 a recent paper 66 has been cited as suggesting that silicone hydrogels are more likely to bind sars-cov-2 than hydrogels 61 however this paper did not examine contact lens materials the inanimate surfaces described in the paper 66 which most closely resemble contact lens materials were plastic and silicon rubber 648182 neither of these materials appropriately represents the complex bulk and surface chemistry of contemporary contact lens materials 83 84 85 and cannot be used to reflect the likely binding of any pathogenic organism to modern day contact lenses soft lens material surfaces are far more hydrophilic than the plastic and silicon rubber surfaces examined in this manuscript and the binding of virus particles to substrates is complex depending upon the charges and topographic characteristics of the virus and the characteristics of the surface in question 86 the factors governing the binding of sars-cov-2 to inanimate surfaces are so far unknown but for a variety of waterborne viruses the major driving factors were electrostatic interactions charge driven followed by hydrophobic interactions with only minor impact from van der waals interactions 86other factors of note in the paper by kampf et al are that the high concentration of inoculum used to examine the potential viral binding rates 103  105 are likely very much higher than those encountered on the ocular surface in asymptomatic wearers and potentially much higher than that encountered following contamination transferred via fingertip application or removal of contact lenses the viability time quoted is that found at room temperature but the time for which viruses remain viable at ocular surface temperatures is significantly lower 8182 and to date the time for which sars-cov-2 remains viable on hydrophilic substrates such as contact lens materials remains unknown finally these studies took place in a dry static environment which in no way reflect the moist condition of the ocular surface and did not take into consideration the impact of blinking on removal of potential viral contaminants from a lens surface furthermore no evidence exists that would support the contention that silicone hydrogel lenses are more likely to be contaminated with sars-cov-2 or indeed any virus than hydrogel lensesto date no evidence exists of the ability of currently marketed contact lens solutions to disinfect sars-cov-2 and evidence concerning the ability of contemporary care solutions to disinfect viruses remains equivocal 8788 and future work in this area is required over 30 years ago it was recognized that contact lens care systems of that time based on chemical and thermal disinfection approaches were effective at inactivating both herpes simplex and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 8990 another study showed that common commercial contact lens care systems were capable of safely decontaminating hiv-1 from contact lenses particularly when a rub step was included 48 a recent paper showed that benzalkonium chloride a common ophthalmic preservative could slow or halt adenovirus 91 another paper reported that a rub-and-rinse technique was more effective at removing viruses from contact lenses than one in which no rubbing occurred 88 most modern lens care systems include a surfactant 92 and given that sars-cov-2 has a lipid envelope it is plausible that a rub-and-rinse of the lens with such a care system may well be effective at killing the virus but further work in this area is required to confirm this finally one study demonstrated that thorough cleansing of virus-infected contact imaging lenses such as retinal and fundus lenses with both bleach and waterdetergent was possible 93 although this is not suggested as a suitable option for contact lens disinfectiona potentially important finding from the review paper by kampf et al 66 was their investigation of the inactivation of coronaviruses by various biocidal agents these studies included examining the effect of disinfectants such as benzalkonium chloride chlorhexidine digluconate hydrogen peroxide and povidone iodine which are or have been used in contact lens solutions chlorhexidine digluconate was a relatively weak biocide when tested against mouse hepatitis virus or canine coronavirus benzalkonium chloride had improved activity 05 hydrogen peroxide a concentration substantially less than that used in contact lens solutions caused a 4 log10 reduction in human coronavirus within 1 minute and povidone iodine at concentrations as low as 023 much less than found in contact lens disinfection systems caused 4log10 reduction in the coronaviruses that cause sars or mers middle east respiratory syndrome within 15 secondsclearly this is a fast moving situation with information and advice being produced based on the best available evidence at the time each manuscript news report and social media post is written there are many areas where further study could extend current knowledge of the interaction of sars-cov-2 with both the ocular surface and contact lenses already mentioned above further study is required to investigate the interaction of sars-cov-2 with contact lens materials and the ability of contact lens disinfecting systems to kill the virus the tear film is another area of interest the tear film has antiviral properties 9495 and it is plausible that the tear film could inactivate viruses that were to come in contact with the tears for instance the tear film contains the protein lactoferrin which is thought to prohibit adenoviral entry into corneal epithelial cells 96 however this is unknown for sars-cov-2 but given the low frequency thus far of patients infected with covid-19 that demonstrate the virus in the tears 19 this is an area also worthy of study what is missing at this time is the minimum infectious dose of sars-cov-2 that can cause covid-19 and such information would be valuable this dose would likely differ depending upon where that viral dose was delivered for example on the conjunctiva versus into the respiratory tract or indeed whether there is true evidence to date that covid-19 could indeed occur through conjunctival transmission 7the evidence presented in this paper suggests the safety of contact lens wear has not altered due to the pandemic and that appropriate hygiene considerations for contact lens wear and care should be the same as that always recommended however with local access to eyecare being different at this time of social distancing and potentially severely compromised during the height of the pandemic what should eye care professionals bear in mind when discussing contact lens wear with their patientsa key consideration is for practitioners to be cognizant of local clinical care facilities during the course of the pandemic and to act to minimise the impact of contact lens-related adverse events on the wider healthcare system which may be very stretched as staff are moved from providing ophthalmic care to other areas more directly related to covid-19 patients the implications here will necessarily vary according to local and regional considerations for example as of march 24 2020 routine eyecare has been suspended in many countries with optometric practices moving to provide scaled-back provision telephone-only consultations andor emergency services for example in the united kingdom practitioners should work to manage cases within an optometric framework rather than refer into the national health service where possible this could include telephone contact with patients reporting contact lens problems andor a video consultation using a suitable mobile phone app to enable rapid triage and management reducing the need for burdening other clinical colleagues some cases may be best managed by referral to optometric colleagues licensed to practice as independent prescribers therapeutically qualified optometrists and who can treat more significant contact lens adverse events in other cases local minor eye conditions services mecs may be an alterative care pathway under this service patients are sent to local optometrists who have undergone accredited training in advanced optometric care that can triage whether referral to ophthalmology is required and where possible and within their scope of practice treat minor eye conditions it is imperative that eyecare professionals avail themselves of the relevant options as early as possible in order to act quickly in the interests of both their patients and the wider healthcare system and not begin to investigate the possibilities only after a contact lens wearer reports having some form of adverse eventin north america australia and other regionscountries therapeutically-endorsed optometrists are more likely to be the first port of call for contact lens patients with clinical adverse events although again most health authorities have required deferral of non-emergent routine care here also appropriate pathways need to be considered and enacted where a reduced level of routine eyecare is available in countries where contact lens fitters and practitioners are less likely to offer clinical care to patients with clinically significant adverse events management pathways and advice should again be considered to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare systemit is particularly imperative during the ongoing pandemic that practitioners redouble their efforts to provide clinical advice to their patients to minimise contact lens complications not least because many parts of the world are in forms of lockdown and even leaving home to seek attention may not be straightforward the simplest approach as recommended by the american academy of ophthalmology would be to cease contact lens wear and return to spectacles during this time 97 however given the personal motivation individuals may have for wearing contact lenses or indeed those wearing lenses for a clinical reason keratoconus for example this suggestion is likely not practical for many contact lens wearers in the uk the general optical council have taken a pragmatic approach to contact lens wear and supply during the pandemic releasing a joint statement with a number of other health care regulators they recognise the highly challenging circumstances and the need to depart from established procedures 98 they have offered guidance which enables practitioners to exercise their professional judgement on whether patients need to be seen or whether following remote consultation that the best course of action is to continue to supply lenses even in the case of an expired specification 98 this action will act to ensure a continual supply of new lenses to wearers and significantly reduce any temptation from patients to use lenses beyond the recommended replacement interval practitioners should also act to ensure patients receive a supply of their prescribed lens type and communicate this appropriately to dissuade patients from sourcing alternative non-prescribed lens brands via online lens retailersit is important to remember that by any absolute measure contact lens wear is a safe form of vision correction for millions of people around the world a review of 1276 soft contact lens wearers records across 4120 visits found eighty-two percent did not present with any complications during the observation period of more than two years 99 the frequency of more significant complications such as corneal infiltrative events cies and microbial keratitis are well understood the annual incidence of symptomatic cies in daily reusable soft lens wear is around 3 and nearly zero in daily disposable wear 100 the incidence of symptomatic cies in extended wear is higher with a 2-7x increased risk compared to daily wear 101 102 103 annual incidence of microbial keratitis mk varies by modality and is around 2 per 10000 wearers with daily wear of soft lenses 1315104 increasing to around 20 per 10000 wearers in extended soft lens wear irrespective of material type 1314105106however a valid concern arises that any contact lens complication that warrants a visit to a healthcare facility at this time of limited resources is potentially an issue to put these risks into context it is helpful to consider the incidence of contact lens issues in relation to accidental home-based injuries that also require medical care in the us in 2012 a total of 194 million home injuries occurred that required medical attention representing a rate of 2417 per 100000 of population 107 a study across two years in belgium estimated the annual incidence of home incidents requiring management by general practitioners to be 2194 per 100000 people 108 within the context of these figures contact lens wear with a rate for microbial keratitis of 02-2 per 100000 ie 2-20 per 10000 wearers does not represent a significant additional burden on the healthcare system compared to the inherent dangers of living within the home which based on their incidence as quoted above would result in a far greater number of injuries that may require medical attention during the pandemichow could the risks of contact lens wear be further minimised to reduce any potential burden on hospital visits at this time the risk factors that result in cies and infectious keratitis are well understood the relative risks of developing cies are summarised in the comprehensive review by steele and szczotka-flynn 11 and include non-modifiable factors such as younger age 175-261x higher prescription 5d 121-16x and history of a previous event 25-61x along with modifiable risks such as overnight wear 25-7x bacterial bioburden on the lens and lid margins 5-8x and lens replacement schedule - reusable compared to daily disposable 125x mk is associated with many similar factors including overnight wear 13105106 and for daily wear poor lens and storage case hygiene infrequent lens case replacement exposure to water and smoking 109110 risk factors for mk in daily disposable wearers are more frequent use any overnight wear less frequent handwashing and smoking 111 while it is not possible to change a non-modifiable risk factor such as the age of a patient there are significant opportunities to address modifiable behaviours given the reduced incidence of cies in wearers of daily disposable lenses 99100 this form of lens wear seems ideal in a time of reduced clinical provision some patients hold supplies of both reusable and daily disposable contact lenses with the latter normally used for sports or holidays with appropriate practitioner discussion a move to using daily disposable lenses could be recommended at the current timeceasing planned or accidental overnight wear significantly lowers the risk of contact lens complications some patients may principally use their lenses on an extended wear basis for occupational reasons and the same benefits may no longer be present if they are currently working from home in such situations reverting to a daily wear schedule could be merited  although only if the patient has an appropriate care regimen and is suitably compliant in its correct use in the same way patients who habitually alter from daily wear to extended wear over time for work or other reasons may be best advised to adopt a routine daily wear modality until normal clinical provision is available such changes to contact lens wearing schedules should be undertaken only after consultation between the patient and their contact lens practitionerscrupulous hand hygiene along with correct use of multipurpose solutions with rub and rinse cleaning of reusable lenses daily case cleaning and regular replacement of the lens case are all positive changes about which eye care professionals should remind their patients at the current time likewise an important point is to counsel on the avoidance of contact with water to reduce the risk of microbial keratitis especially acanthamoeba keratitis which has been increasing in recent years 112113 finally a patient who has access to both reusable and daily disposable contact lenses at home could be advised to switch to daily disposables the modality with the lowest risk of complications in soft lens wear 73100adherence to compliant lens wear and care practices is an important aim for the profession all of the time however it can be argued during the current outbreak of sars-cov-2 this should be an area of heightened focus the attention on thorough hand washing is welcome and an important start but for eye care practitioners it is reasonable to use this time to go much further revisiting patient education on safe wear and care practices with the aim of reducing the chance of developing contact lens-related complications requiring clinical carein conclusion to date no evidence suggests that contact lens wearers who are asymptomatic should cease contact lens wear due to an increased risk of developing covid-19 that wearing prescription spectacles provides protection against sars-cov-2 or that any one form of contact lens material is more likely to enhance or reduce the risk of future covid-19 infection however information concerning this novel coronavirus is evolving at a rapid rate and eye care practitioners must remain attentive to new findings as they emergepractitioners must remain vigilant about reminding contact lens wearers of the need to maintain good hand hygiene practices when handling lenses a focus on fully compliant contact lens wear and especially on the modifiable risk factors associated with contact lens complications are especially important during the height of the pandemic where access to primary and secondary optometric care may be substantially different to normal and practitioners should act to minimise the burden on the wider healthcare system by considering their local clinical pathway options patients must be reminded of the need to dispose of daily disposable lenses upon removal the need for appropriate disinfection with reusable lenses including the use of a rub-and-rinse step where indicated and appropriate case cleaning and replacement finally consistent with guidance for other types of illness particularly those of the respiratory tract 114 115 116 no contact lens wearer with active covid-19 should remain wearing their contact lenses this

was first recognized in december 2019 and within months evolved into a global pandemic declared by the world health organization who in march 2020 to avert its rapid spread country-specific restrictions have been introduced spanning strict socialphysical distancing measures stay-at-home orders and even lockdowns workplace closings and furloughslayoffs postponing of elective procedures in medical centers to preserve medical resources suspending many in-person medical consultation and clinic visits or substituting these face to face consultations with remote interventions eg telecommunications measures to limit person-to-person contact affected institutions and researchers applying non-invasive brain stimulation nibs operations with the suddenness of covid-19 emergence operations at clinics and research centers administering nibs were disrupted to varied degrees - from suspension of all activities to limiting new enrollment or abbreviation protocols to incremental accommodations - depending on regional restrictions and the nature of underling protocols eg in-person treatment vs remote treatment the means of maintaining and even expanding access to nibs during the covid-19 pandemic are strategically evolving considering that nibs is a unique non-pharmacological tool forms of which have been successfully established for treatment of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 often on moderately or even severely impaired patients unresponsive to conventional therapies 8 9 the reestablishment of nibs operations in the current era of covid-19 pandemic as well as through future epidemics is of paramount importancemoreover a further wave of mental health issues following this first outbreak of this virus is anticipated 10 11 forms of nibs are broadly applied and trials for mental health indications thus hold the potential to mitigate the psychological after-effects or comorbidities of the pandemic this amplifies the urgent need for a roadmap of how to resume nibs-based clinical and research activities in the face of the covid-19 and also future pandemicsthis expert consensus paper aims to outline processes that could facilitate rapid prudent and coordinated re-establishment of operations at institutions providing nibs treatments or using nibs in research we specifically focus on low intensity transcranial electrical stimulation tes encompassing transcranial direct current stimulation tdcs transcranial alternating current stimulation tacs transcranial random noise stimulation trns and transcranial magnetic stimulation tms however our recommendations may be adapted to support the reestablishment of a broad range of device-based interventions a session of the nyc neuromodulation 2020 online conference 20-22 april 2020 was dedicated to sharing experiences of nibs researchers all over the world which inspired the plan to synthesize these opinions in the present document along with general guidelines and checklists we provide an overview on the different strategies that have been introduced to mitigate the spread of the virus in nibs procedures and nibs laboratories additionally we highlight new opportunities for nibs regarding the current situation and discuss possible directions of research that could be taken considering the expected development of covid-19-related diseases and disorders the considerations presented here not only reflect the covid-19 crisis but also prepares the nibs community for potential future epidemics or pandemicsin general steps taken to support nibs operations under any epidemicpandemic conditions may span a reduction of unnecessary contact by judiciously removing protocol steps or transition to telemedicine approaches which may include the intervention itself b optimization of all at-center protocols based on sanitization section 61 physical distancing section 62 and streamlining procedures c addition of protocols to manage risk such as covid-19 or related symptom screening section 63 or steps to support personnel affected by covid-19 medically or professionally section 5 these overarching principles apply with varied weights to the 3 phases of covid-19 response section 4 and are systematized through detailed guidance section 4 section 5 section 6 section 9 our checklist section 34 case examples section 2 section 8 and consideration for specific clinical populations section 7while strategies for the use of nibs as a unique therapeutic tool through the covid-19 crisis are currently developing in the immediate aftermath of covid-19 emergency many clinical trials and experiments involving neuromodulation around the world were severely disrupted or suspended - with the exception of those that employing remote at home tdcs treatments in many cases research activities were diverted to writing reviewing and analyzing data remotely onsite clinical services were disrupted in some cases with services limited to teleconsultations following initial disruption several on-site services began to implement remediation measures section 8 section 9 clinical services and trials based around remote at-home tdcs through telemedicine were generally able to proceed with minimal accommodations section 8 section 9 this section focuses on immediate response as reflected in the survey of nibs centersthe survey addressing the impact of the covid-19 pandemic was sent to institutions applying nibs research laboratories and nibs clinics across the world replies were received from 29 institutions representing 17 countries these responses thus reflect the situation on the ground at the time of assessment with ongoing remediation methods addressed later in this paper mainly depending on the national and local restrictions in response to the covid-19 outbreak and the nature of protocols eg type of technology trial stage clinical population there were substantial discrepancies in the extent to which neuromodulation operations were disruptedin february preclinical and clinical research activities were interrupted in china and iran in europe the restrictions imposed by governments were implemented in an uncoordinated fashion in italy portugal denmark and the united kingdom and the united states restrictions were applied to clinic services and research labs beginning in the first half of march while in germany austria and belgium restrictions were applied in the second half of march switzerland and brazil closed their labs in mid-march later between the end of march and the beginning of april clinics and research activities were suspended and labs were closed also in canada russia india australia and japanglobally restrictions regarding hospitals often involved the interruption of all non-emergency services and the re-organization of routine activity focusing on handling covid-19-related conditions for many clinics where tms and tes are used as treatment tools or involved in clinical research protocols restrictions led to the suspension of non-urgent inpatient and outpatient services as well as all in-person activities in some clinics staff members have worked in rotation to minimize infection and provide only essential services in italy and the united kingdom even home-based neuromodulation protocols were not immediately approved or feasible table 1
examples of protocols without substantial disruption include the united states new york university nyu clinic and the australia black dog institute in sydney using remote at-home tdcs treatments which were largely able to continue operations with moderate accommodations and have even met an increased demand several centers providing in-patient nibs treatment maintained at least some services in the us including wake forest north carolina and medical university of south carolina musc to help dampen the potential surge in psychiatric symptoms and illness resulting from the pandemic similarly in belgium at ghent university covid-19 sub-wards were established in the psychiatric clinic for the admissions of potential infected psychiatric patients tms has continued to be provided in both outpatient and inpatient programs in australia although not in research protocols at ghent university in belgium electroconvulsive therapy ect has been allowed only in selected cases depending on severity the international society for ect and neurostimulation published guidance on ect during covid-19 12with limited exceptions the restrictions limiting the routine and non-urgent clinical services and ceasing in-person activities have severely affected clinical research despite the guidance offered by agencies like the food and drug administration fda and the european medicines agency ema on how to manage clinical trials clinical studies as well as single-centermulti-center trials are being impacted by the covid-19 pandemic in the immediate aftermath of covid-19 research labs all over the world have been instructed to limit or stop most neuromodulation research that had direct person-to-person contact and was deemed non-essential the timing of the closures varied as well as the extent to which research was halted survey respondents report additional challenges arising from socialphysical distancing measures site closures travel limitations for staff members and patients interruption of suppliers delivery and considerations if personnel or subjects might be infected with the new coronavirus moreover difficulties in meeting the required protocol-procedures including the follow-up visits and laboratorydiagnostic testing resulted in a loss of data from ongoing trials or in a delayed data acquisition will continue until centers fully reopen and likely beyond table 2
based on our survey all other institutions stopped the enrollment of new subjects in some cases patient treatment studies were allowed to remain open to finish currently enrolled individuals in other cases institutions required investigators to determine if their research studies were addressing essential need and disruption of the intervention would lead to irreparable harm it is possible that for some studies new participants will need to be enrolled to compensate for these losses which was not budgeted for across grantseven in early phases of covid-19 responses some centers report adapting nibs clinical trials protocols to minimize in-person contact trials with remote home-based neuromodulation tdcs and tacs have largely continued in some cases received updated approvals allowing for remote consenting e-consent and enrollment of new patients for trials with in-center treatments protocols are being implemented to allow for remote consenting the remote collection of clinical data and the conduct of online cognitive tests allowing some aspects of brain stimulation trials to continue even without home-based treatmentsrespondent to the survey reported teleworking is a central component of the overall response to the covid-19 pandemic while a challenge to the normal culture way of working tele-collaboration could represent an unexpected opportunity for researchers to re-analyze collected data acquire new analysis and methods skills design new experiments pre-register scientific reports and brainstorm new ideas and projects general tele-work practices and routines have also been introduced across nibs centers to enable the remote working teams to maintain productivity while monitoring and supporting the well-being education and professional development of staff see section 5 for example early career scientists and students concerned with the degree progress should as appropriate be offered additional support by adapting progress requirements eg 3 months extensions concerning thesis submission deadlines and providing them opportunities for online networking several respondents to our survey highlighted the opportunity to learn new skills online through webinars online lab meetings with guest speakers and online conferences responders are thus positive that the nibs community could benefit from tele-work intellectual activities developed in the pandemic period eg online conferences papers experimental designs teaching materials etc and the establishment of tele-communication tools should serve the nibs community even beyond the pandemic period eg project tracking and updates new collaborationsat present the nibs community is in the process of preparing for a return to either partial or full operational status in the coming months while institutional regulations for restarting in person activities will vary institutions surveyed consistently reported implementation of personal protective equipment ppe standards social distancing approaches plans to convert the consent process and assessments to tele-videoonline administration where possible as well as sanitization procedures a number of labs also indicated plans for covid-19 testing and facilities modification to improve ventilation and social distancing procedures at present a majority of sites surveyed do not have a definitive restart date while the future is uncertain labs and clinics are preparing for eventual return to service with an eye toward implementation of plans to not only mitigate disruptions from the covid-19 emergency but also methods that will allow nibs clinical and research services to weather future outbreaks of covid-19 or similar eventsin almost all cases the rate and scale of impact from the initial covid-19 outbreak created exigent circumstances that mandated rapid decisions this commonly included cessation of all non-essential in-person research activities however institutional consideration was given in some cases for in-progress neuromodulation studies that involve the application of interventions addressing diagnoses such as depression with some studies deemed essential and allowed to continue ongoing interventions with strict adherence to ppe for both researchers and participants this determination was made by individual institutions with significant variability across sites in response to stay-at-home mandates entire study teams were faced with moving all activities to remotetele continuation for those involved in studies deemed essential structured plans to allow study team members in labsclinics and access to appropriate ppe were required in addition studies either already designed for remote administration of assessments andor interventions were allowed to continue with either minor or no modification to existing protocolsin some cases studies were able to modify their existing protocols to continue research efforts on a fully remote basis using tele-onlinevideo assessments or at-home brain stimulation procedures however many studies are incompatible with remote continuation and were required to stop for those faced with remotetelework documentation reports of activity approvals updates online audits online analysis dissemination of results through manuscript development online conferences and study team virtual meetings represented transitions requiring minimal effort to implement however for those requiring access to specialized hardware specially protected data or software as a few examples housed within the workplace this transition either proved difficult or resulted in work stoppage regardless an important element of the initial and ongoing response to covid-19 across ongoing studies involved communication with all participants currently enrolled in ongoing studies to provide information regarding how their participation in the study would be impacted by stay-at-home mandates as well as providing additional information for available local resources to address potential concerns for their welfare and well-being during the outbreak eg tele-mental health services community assistance programs etcduring the covid-19-related stay-at-home mandate critical consideration must be given to re-integration strategies and approaches for restarting studies and trials the timing and details of re-integration procedures will vary significantly across institutions as did study stoppage and stay-at-home procedures nonetheless brain stimulation teams can begin planning for potential iterations of re-integration procedures at present commonly discussed strategies across institutions include a tiered return to institutions for study teams potential split shifts for study team members to cover study activities ppe for all participants and study staff covid-19 infection or antibody testing procedures body temperature assessment of all staff and participants redesign of lab proceduresspace to minimize person-to-person contact new facility and equipment sanitization procedures among others see also below section 6 while institutional procedures will vary advanced planning for how these procedures will impact study continuation is important in addition study teams will be faced with a backlog of participants that either missed planned follow-up visits or have upcoming follow-up visits as well as a need to replace participants whose intervention schedules were interrupted by stay-at-home mandates study teams will likely be strained to perform all needed activities for study continuation upon return advanced planning for prioritization of study activities will be important for efficient transition back to in-person activitywe are also faced with the uncertain possibility of one or more recurrent waves of covid-19 and similar epidemicpandemic outbreaks in the coming months and years thus careful consideration of protective equipment to protect research participants and staff members to disinfect tools and labs and long-term planning for implementation of remote assessment andor intervention procedures may prove critical for long-term continuation of studies should this become a reality further still once rapid covid-19 testing and antibody assays are proven to be reliable and widely available we will have tools that may allow us to alter how we respond to future waves of covid-19 if procedures for maximizing the safety of in-person study activities modification of space for face to face visits restructuring of waiting areas to separate participantspatients stringent ppe procedures etc can be implemented immediately following the current outbreak these methods paired with new covid-19 testing procedures may redefine how we respond to future covid-19 pandemic events for example most tms clinics around the world were shut down for depression treatment following the initial covid-19 outbreak preventing access to care needed by patients if careful in our current and future response different approaches for safely continuing such activities may be possible we can consider developing institution specific standard operating procedures for the labs and orientation of all staff members to deal with future outbreaks as such we provide a summary of important considerations for response to covid-19 as well as a checklist for adapting research and treatment practices to covid-19 in table 3
here we provide a list of recommendations for adapting research and treatment practices to covid-19 pandemic1conduct a systematic updated risk-benefit analysis of each protocol to decide for each effort if it should continue and inform remaining steps this may include contingency plans to changes in a given circumstance eg if x happens the trial will need to wind down under these conditions engaging all stakeholders in discussion eg staff program office dsmb etc and statistical consultation with respect to the power to make conclusions regarding protocol changes eg change in dose trials terminated prematurely and associated changes in outcome reporting eg feasibility instead of efficacy2transition as many study procedures as possible to electronic or video format eg consent process screening visit assessment tools switch to an established home-based techniques3remove non-essential steps in protocols that require in-person interactions4establish stringent safety and sanitization procedures for all required in-person interactions and train staff in execution of these procedures with documentation of training completion ultimately staff will have to follow regulatory and protection procedures adopted by specific research or clinical settings eg nursing home setting will have to follow covid-19measures for that setting or in-person visit at a patients home will require compliance with covid-19protection mandated for home care therefore developing and updating protocol specific safety procedures requires research staff communication and coordination with institutional clinical leadership for the specific setting in which nibs studies will be carried out5implement all institution required safety procedures eg screening ppe covid-19testing etc develop study-specific considerations for staff who recovered covid-196consider changes in intervention that do not impact trial integrity eg number of visits inclusionexclusion or consider changes that strategically change trial scope ie still allow for meaningful publishable outcomes eg changing to a pilot trial7for in-person protocols streamline the entire process from participant preparing to leave their home to transportation to arriving at cliniclab to leaving the cliniclab to maximize socialphysical distancing including between patients and between staff with special attention to neuromodulation steps where possible the clinical trial may provide support for car service for participants to avoid public transportation8add additional telemedicine steps follow-ups to adjust for changes in protocol add steps responsive to covid-19 related concerns this can include additional data collection that may impact immediate decisions vii or later analysis such as testing all subject temperature or surveying for covid-19 related symptoms determine protocol for identified covid-19 positive patients including if they are not critically ill or without symptoms9review explicit protocolsconsideration for adverse events related or not to the intervention so that the decision tree what to do who makes the call what needs to be reported is mapped out beforehand patient or caregiver has x symptoms leading to y actions10obtain irb approval for any applicable changes eg all the above in protocol including patient consent in regard to any new anticipated risks11take steps to share your plans lessons learned and ongoing experiences with the broader community survey all stakeholders eg building facilities research personnel to gauge comfort with planned activities
all clinical trials registered with a database such as clinicaltrialsgov should be appropriately updated to reflect the mitigation plan to limit risk of infection a revised timeline for enrollment and any socialphysical-distancing related adaptations to the protocol participants may be more willing to enroll knowing that precautions have been madesome ethics boards may mandate withholding research recruitment for some period at peak of outbreaks while pausing a study does not necessarily require notification to the irbethics board any protocol changes to the process of interaction intervention or assessment of participants must be reviewed and approved by the resident ethics board this includes but is not limited to modifications of the method of administration from in person to online shifts to at-home neuromodulation procedures change in participant payment method etc study sponsors may have differing timelines for study restart than local institutions and ethics boardsmany research groups are now converting their consent and screening visits to a tele-healthvideo-visit the term most frequently used is e-consent or e-consenting the requirements for this vary by institutional review board but all contain the core features of providing the prospective participant with a copy of the consent eg via mail or email going over the consent remotely and obtaining a signed copy of the consent eg mail or email which the investigator countersigns on the date of receipt once the participant signs the consent typically with either video observation or through a secure online signature process this enables the investigator to proceed with the screening visit which can be facilitated using electronic forms eg redcap qualtrics clincapture such videoonline consents and videoonline-based screening visits lessen the risk of contracting the illness for everyone and may provide a more effective means of performing a consent visit involving all necessary safety precautions masks disinfection etcstudy suspension and any revisions to procedures within funded studies should be discussed with the funding agency in addition for clinical trials with a standing data safety monitoring board dsmb study suspension and restart as well as changes in study procedures should be forwarded to the dsmb for approvalin most places across the world neuromodulation studies have been suspended yet the costs associated with those experiments eg salaries animal housing and food costs have continued this placed a financial burden on these studies and will also delay the final results of the studies thankfully several funding agencies including the us national institute of health wellcome trust and the medical research council uk and swiss national science foundation have announced the ability to apply for an administrative or grant supplement to cover unforeseen covid-19-related costs they have also streamlined the process for getting approval for a no cost extension these steps offer significant relief to researchers and increase the likelihood that the dedicated resources already invested in these projects will be fruitfulsupporting our colleagues particularly early career researchers is vital in this time of crisis there are a number of issues that this period brings here we will discuss some of the most pressing this cannot be an exhaustive list however and it is vital that as a field we are sensitive to the additional needs of our colleagues it is perhaps important to note that we are in no way encouraging a decrease in the standards required for publication rather an increase in understanding around the circumstances in which that work is done is called forfirstly it is vital to recognize the additional anxiety the current situation will place on early career researchers and phd students for students with only months of funding left with which to complete their degrees this is a very stressful time as it is for those more senior researchers with grant deadlines it is to be hoped that this paper will provide helpful suggestions and contribute to the discussion for ways to ease the difficulties faced at this time however the inevitable anxieties associated with the current situation are real and should be explicitly acknowledged we must work to address these and to support our colleagues through this difficult timeresearch groups around the world will be physically separate indeed often spread across time zones if students choose to spend this unprecedented period at home this will inevitably lead to psychological stress something that has already been seen in china 13 maintaining group cohesion is vital and implementing explicit support structures is necessary particularly for those isolating on their own with families elsewhere 14 while online tools cannot replace face-to-face interactions they are vital substitutes in current times the vast majority of labs will have moved work meetings online already but in addition to these it is important to recognize that for many work is also a social experience and now more than ever an essential source of support scheduled coffee breaks games nights film nights cocktail hours with alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink of choice and many other social events are all being implemented successfully across the world to create at least some of the social interactions so important to both our mental wellbeing and our lab cohesion explicitly matching group members in a buddy-scheme where each lab member has a partner that they have to contact even briefly each day is a way of providing a light touch method to flag potential mental health issues early while we cannot prevent the inevitable increased rates of mental health problems in our community making sure that we explicitly discuss the difficulties we all face in this pandemic and the inevitable mental health repercussions will hopefully allow those facing particular problems to speak out and receive the support they need 15it is necessary to act now to ensure that the current pandemic does not have long-lasting negative consequences on the field nibs has historically had a lack of female representation 16 something that leaders in the field have made a concerted effort to address in recent years 17 with increasing success however the current crisis is likely to exacerbate the gap between women and men and between carers and non-carers in terms of available time and opportunities the burden of care and responsibilities have fallen unequally in this crisis - for some this is a virtually unheard of period of quiet in which they have the time to produce as much if not more work than normal however for the field as a whole it is vital to recognize that for others this is a time where demands and anxieties have increased and available time has shrunk considerably the room of ones own in which to write 18 is for some a daily reality and for others merely a distant dream the real effects of this inequality across academia is already being spoken about anecdotally by editors who report decreases in the number of submissions from women 19 and possibly increases in the number of submissions from men how those trends continue will need to be carefully monitoredwhile it is extremely difficult to judge what effect other responsibilities may have on our colleagues productivity it is timely to recognize that although individual circumstances vary substantially on average women still carry the majority of the burden of both caring responsibilities and household tasks even when both partners work 20 - something that can at the moment only exacerbate gender imbalances in the field it must therefore be the responsibility of all of us particularly those in more senior positions to acknowledge this and to challenge the potential prejudices of others and ourselves when making career-determining decisions not just at the moment but in the months and years to come suggestions have already been made as to ways to tackle this including explicitly treating this period as carers leave in future applications 21in the shorter term the socialphysical distancing measures in place around the world are not only limiting what we can do in terms of science but limiting the opportunities for all of us particularly the early career researchers to network and to meet potential advisors for the next stage of their careers initiatives such as on-line conferences are likely going to be the mechanism for sharing our science for at least the next few months and provide an essential opportunity for our ecrs to discuss their work however what is difficult to reproduce on-line is the informal chat over coffee with others in the field which can often provide the start to a conversation that ends with a postdoctoral position or support for tenure-track applicationsovercoming these restrictions will be difficult by definition it is challenging to formally engineer informal discussions we all have a responsibility to recognize this and to be responsive to unsolicited emails from researchers elsewhere this is also a time to embrace the ability to invite speakers from around the world to give informal talks at lab meetings and small gatherings without the costs involved in travel not only does this broaden our horizons at a time when it is all too easy to reduce our interactions it also has secondary benefits small lab talks provide excellent opportunity to interact with external researchers in a small group inviting senior researchers to speak can provide a route into discussions for ecrs inviting ecrs to speak provides valuable experience for themin practical terms many universities have relaxed the timescales required for phd students something that we must support and petition for many grant bodies around the world have already announced blanket extensions to current funding - as a field it is our responsibility to make these allowances as equitable as possible a number of routes through the current crisis have been suggested in the rest of this article which will allow us to continue our research with disruption kept to a minimum however in the inevitable rush back to the lab for the long-term sake of the field we must not forget to bring everyone with usa critical factor in controlling and reducing the spread of sars-cov-2 and the associated covid-19 has been so-called socialphysical distancing which means preventing physical contact especially of persons who otherwise would not have social contact what is essential to understand here is that the terminology socialphysical distancing may be somewhat misleading as what matters in essence is the physical distancing the latter in turn has mainly been recommended because one dominant way by which sars-cov-2 is transmitted is by airborne droplet infection more specifically aerosols emanating from the upper respiratory pathway housing the virus in high concentrations are thought to passively travel through the air and remain airborne for some time while the exact travel distance and the amount of time that infectious materials maintain in the air are currently a matter of debate most recommendations suggest keeping at least 2 m 6 ft distance to any other person and assuming that any unknown person could potentially be infectious 22 minimizing duration of contact is another strategy that may be considered based on study protocols current federal and institutional guidances and current scientific consensus on impact of briefer contact times protocols in reducing risk to operators and patientssocialphysical distancing parameters as defined by governments and regulatory authorities vary among countries states and counties and change over time as a regional covid-19 situation develops the following procedures are therefore region and institute specific and subject to ongoing risk-burden evaluation as applicable social distancing should be maintained in all offices the allowed density of staff in given rooms should be considered along with the need for and mechanism of minimizing face-to-face interaction eg by using chat emails or telephones as applicable to the specific time and protocol it may be prudent to wear masks and maintain a recommended interpersonal distance if and when patients should wear masks for necessary clinical treatments should be determined for studies and therapies where wearing masks hinders the efficacy transparent face masks could be consideredduring nibs procedures it is often not possible to maintain the recommended physical distance at least for some amount of time for instance applying electrodes for tes or adjusting the position of tms coils requires direct contact between the person applying nibs and the person receiving nibs robotic tms provides some opportunity for tms administration with operators further removed from participants easily by 2 meters6 feet except for brief localization to navigation though the participant can be trained to do this however such devices will not be available to all labs and clinics in these instances protective measures are important to reduce the inhalation and expiration of aerosols and the amount of time during which the recommended physical distance cannot be complied with should be restricted to a minimum possibleppe can take many forms such as wearing face masks that should cover both mouth and nose there are different safety standards for these masks and we recommend that medical and research personnel in constant contact with potentially infected persons including participants and patients but also co-workers wear those with the highest safety standards eg n95 masks importantly the masks should be regularly changed with maximal wear time differing as per the specific type and make of the mask as otherwise they might even be counterproductive due to the accumulation of viral material at the inner side of the mask if appropriate patients and participants may be provided with single use or disinfected multiple use masks by the neuromodulation labsas appropriate in addition to masks medical and research personnel may consider wearing transparent visors or protective eye wear covering the upper parts of the face and especially the eyes through which viral material can also easily enter the organism visors that cover the whole front of the face extending way down below the chin may supplement face masks for researchers and participants in theory the appeal of visors without masks is allowing better verbal communication compared to face masks which limit articulation and comprehensibility of speech sounds ie the muffling effect-b but such considerations are secondary to safety the appropriateness of visors and other ppe eg goggles protective coats in various social and clinical environments will ultimately depend on current regional and institutional guidances in some regions and institutions current recommendations are to use both a surgical mask and visor for direct interactions with patientsmoreover medical and research personnel should wear single use gloves when touching participants and patients and the latter may also want to be provided with such gloves when touching apparel that will be touched by others such as input devices computer keyboards desks etcas with all covid-19 safety procedures regional and institutional guidances applied judiciously to specific protocols considering changing conditions will determine which procedures should be implemented and which can be abbreviated our recommendations here thus index possible applicable proceduresbesides body-worn protective measures room dividers and transparent shields can be considered for installation in facilities that are not already designed for one-on-one visits these devices constitute a physical barrier protecting spread of aerosols throughout the room from participants and patients to personnel and will be especially important at patient receptions provisions of hand washing opportunities or hand sanitizers for patients and participants at the entrance to research and treatment premises are also generally recommended and they should be provided in a way that they can be regularly and easily used by medical and research personnel after each new contact with a new person additional measures to minimize airborne particles being transmitted are regular ventilation of research and treatment laboratories regular disinfection of surfaces such as doorknobs apparel furniture research equipment and visors as well as shields ideally after each use by a new person is highly recommended within elevators covering all buttons with plastic membranes that are changed daily is advised tissue paper or small wooden pieces can be provided to push the button without skin contactspecial consideration should be given for employing single-use equipment when possible for example within tes a variety of single-use and multi-use electrodes is available maximizing the use of single-use devices that contact the participantpatient serves to minimize potential translocation of virally active material from one participant to the other where devices must be used across participants antibacterial disinfection may not be sufficient in all cases all research equipment should be sanitizeddisinfected before and after use in this special consideration as to which type of disinfectant is used needs to be applied as the functionality of some electrodes may be negatively affected when disinfected with alcohol-based disinfectants one potential alternative to alcohol-based disinfectants is the use of hydrogen peroxide we recommend referring to manufacturer information to evaluate possible disinfection routines all disposable supplies should be discarded in appropriate bio-waste repositories note that most of the considerations regarding sanitization protocols should not only be applied to laboratories and treatment facilities but also for the off-site home use mentioned above in this paperthe following disinfection and sanitization protocols are aiming to give research facilities some flexibility to re-start nibs clinical services and research operations during the current covid-19 pandemic and possibly similar outbreaks in the future for patients with non-covid-19 needs or complex chronic disease management requirementsafter the nibs session is over the environmental surfaces in the stimulation room should be sanitized using a 1 hypochlorite solution with a disposable antiseptic cloth 23 also all the stimulation equipment including magnetic coil for tms stimulator electrodestimulator cables eeg cap tape measure electrodes and sponge pockets should be sanitized follow manufacturer specific guidance on how to clean the stimulator furthermore it is prudent to check for any leaked fluids from the participant on the stimulation chairthe stimulator trolley and treatment chair should be wiped with a permitted cleaning product normally bacillocid is allowed but it is better to check with the manufacturerif an mrimegcompatible stimulator is available for concurrent application of nibs during the recording of neuroimaging or electrophysiological data then the gantry and the rf coil should be sanitized with a permitted cleaning product the mri table also should be sanitized with any of the approved products the coils need to be disinfected once again after the scanner room is thoroughly sanitized then the next patient or participant may be taken 24 it is necessary to ensure that the metal nose piece of surgical masks if applicable is not ferromagnetic 25
an additional aspect that requires consideration is the inclusion of individuals that belong to higher risks groups both on the side of the personnel and the research participants or patients currently older age a history of cardiovascular diseases and diseases affecting the respiratory system eg asthma smoking but also diabetes obesity and cancer or other diseases affecting the immune system directly or through immuno-depressant treatment eg multiple sclerosis ms are widely considered as major risk factors see eg 26 for a meta-analysis however what constitutes a major risk to develop covid-19 is still not definitely established scarce and we thus recommend to closely monitor the accumulating scientific evidence in this respect eg via 27 for now we recommend that individuals belonging to the groups mentioned as well as individuals being in close regular contact with individuals belonging to such groups should only enter studies or be treated under special circumstances and with utmost carea logbook of each lab and treatment room should be maintained listing personal interactions that took place so that in case of an infection all persons in contact with the infected person can be traced back and informed about a possible infection in such cases we strongly recommend swift reactions including quarantining of the potential new carriers exclusion from work premises and rapid testing for sars-cov-2on a critical note many of these measures are not based on concrete evidence on their effectiveness there is still insufficient knowledge about which of them are necessary and sufficient to prevent further spread of the virus however to the best of our current knowledge they can be expressed as strongly recommended another critical aspect is whether the measures can be implemented consistently in many countries for instance masks but even disinfectants are still not available in the required quantities and using the limited number of protective measures for protection of healthcare workers treating covid-19 patients should be given higher priority than using it for neuromodulation researchadditional precautions are regular self-screening by personnel patients and participants for potential infections or contact with infected persons this can be achieved by a symptoms checklist which every person entering the research or treatment premises has to provide as well as by temperature measurements at the entrance to the research facilities all of the latter however may be of limited validity as many persons infected by sars-cov-2 have been reported to be asymptomatic and do not develop the associated disease and thus will neither show symptoms including fever many institutions have plans to implement either rapid covid-19 testing andor covid-19antibody testing of faculty and staff prior to reentry into the workplace in addition some institutions are considering requiring all study participants to undergo rapid covid-19 testing prior to in person study activity availability and implementation of these tests will vary across institutionsthe scientific basis for sars-cov-2-related immunity and reliability of antibody testing remains under development subject to ongoing scientific insight and respecting regional and institutional guidance screening for antibodies in the blood of staff or participants could be one element supporting the basis for an immunity passport or risk-free certificate that would enable individuals to return to work or research assuming that they are protected against re-infection in this respect it should be noted though that a previous infection and the development of immunity may not protect against another episode of infection and development of the disease see eg 28 however whether the immunity passport policy will apply systematically or not there is value in specific protocols and based on broader covid-19 situation factors in applying such tests during recruitment procedures to improve patient-clinician safety or trial integritystroke survivors can experience a wide range of impairments and disabilities including motor deficits and the loss of ability to produce andor to understand language aphasia among other treatments use of neuromodulation techniques has been proposed to enhancefacilitate stroke-recovery past studies have integrated centrally acting tdcs with peripherally acting intensive motor or language rehabilitation protocols 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 before covid-19 there were several tdcs aphasia treatment protocols published with positive outcomes 38 but during the first half of march the pandemic forced most of the labs involved in nibs and stroke recovery to suspend clinical and research activities covid-19 has significantly increased the risk of social isolation and associated depression in people with aphasia indeed language and cognitive problems limit the use of digital media ie cellular andor social network to maintain social contact patients with motor symptoms have also been penalized as a result of covid-19 since it might be more difficult for them to move or get around with limited caregiver and physical or occupational therapy support stroke patients being in an older age category increase the risk of contracting the virus and potentially having a worse outcome thus in order to contain the exposure they will probably be forced to stay-at-home for a longer period than young people augmenting the possibility of psychological distress and depression to address these mental health issues researchers from the aphasia research lab at the irccs santa lucia foundation in rome have launched an online interview in the aphasic population to evaluate whether anxiety and fear towards covid-19 contagion would discourage the restart of rehabilitation one concern is that patients worried about covid-19 may be deprioritizing their neurorehabilitation needs and may develop an attitude of resistance towards clinical research deemed non-essentialassuming that regulatory agencies and medical centers will hopefully lift the research and clinical treatment suspensions in the coming months when appropriate mitigations plans are in place it is important to consider that tdcs protocols for motor andor aphasia rehabilitation will be hampered by the difficulty in maintaining an adequate safety distance during electrodes application and even more importantly by the mandatory use of masks indeed for language and cognitive interventions it is extremely important that both the therapist and the patient understand each other being able to see their mouths movements ie lip-reading is known to facilitate communication transparent face shields without masks might be a good alternative option here however these will not resolve the question of electrode application while keeping a safety distance another possibility is to develop remote but supervised and controlled interventions at the patients home using home-based tdcs devices as appealing as this sounds considering that most patients have cognitive and physical limitations in applying the kit and that nibs approaches require a peripheral intervention eg traditional speech therapy or physical-occupational therapies it will be challenging to provide these combined approaches in a patient home for stroke patients there might be also an option to develop remote intervention in an outpatient clinical setting ensuring that there is enough separation and physical distance between the patient and the investigators there is no doubt that requests will be made to regulatory agencies to allow for clinical research in stroke recovery to be conducted in a remote way or at the patients home by integrating tdcs with other telerehabilitation techniques and digital interventions eg computer delivered rehabilitation in this way we may resolve the issue related to language distortion due to wearing a cover that masking not only verbal communication but also facial expressions would anyway hinder communication exchanges moreover since some tdcs language protocols have already been validated we might think of offering caps to the patients family with the position of the electrodes already fixed to facilitate and standardized application however we must be mindful that by doing so we may be limiting the breath of patients we can study and the generalisability of our findings eg only those who have prior experience using digital technologies with limited cognitive difficulties who have family members that can monitor and assist putting on the home-kits would benefit from those treatments we also have to consider the safety of the remote tdcs protocols patients might be at a risk of seizures after stroke and fatigue is an important factor which might interfere so timing and careful monitoring of the remote interventions are additional variables to take into account considering past remote neuromodulation studies and current covid-19-related problems tdcs protocols either at home or in a remote location at a medical center separating the patient from the clinician may be an opportunity as well as a challenge in the futurefor over the last decade neuromodulation has been safely integrated in pediatrics with myriad diagnoses and disorders and promising outcomes 39 40 protocols have integrated tms rtms tdcs and theta-burst in varying age ranges from infancy through young adulthood although commenced in adult populations pediatric tele-neuromodulation protocols have not yet been established in response to covid-19 the pediatric neuromodulation laboratory in the medical school at the university of minnesota in conjunction with physicians from gillette childrens specialty healthcare and mayo-rochester have developed an online survey investigating the impact of covid-19 and the stay-at-home mandate on familychild access to rehabilitation care for children with cerebral palsy pediatric investigators in our department of psychiatry are also integrating our protocol to run a parallel survey for families of children with related psychiatric diagnoses we are now commencing a novel pediatric telehealth nibs study investigating tdcs in the home setting via remotetelehealth specifically for children with perinatal stroke and resultant cerebral palsy this study is informed by our previous adult stroke neuromodulation telehealth studies and previous established guidelines the first phase of this study will investigate the feasibility and reliability of parentscaregivers in operating the device and positioning the electrodes phases thereafter will establish child tolerance and safety along with administration and assessment of stimulation in conjunction with rehabilitation interventionsneuromodulation is an appealing option for symptom management and rehabilitation for those living with chronic neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis parkinsons disease pd and other disorders with cognitive or movement dysfunctions with many positive signals from the literature and large controlled trials underway specific considerations with these patients include potential cognitive impairments which may reduce the ability to understand and complete the required study procedures as well as sufficient motor functioning to operate any study equipment from a remote home location however in our work to date we have found that the majority of those living with ms ages 18 to 80 years and with varying disability levels including wheelchair dependency and impaired upper limb motor functions can complete our remotely supervised protocol with guidance from a tdcs technician and can also include caregiver training for support it is important to include these patients with more advanced disease for full representation of the disease spectrum because they often have fewer treatment and rehabilitative options continuity of care for patients in research or clinical protocols is important and ongoing communications serve as a connection to the clinic for those patients with stable disease who otherwise would not be in contact with their treatment teams during the current time periodthe secondary effects of the covid-19 pandemic eg periods of lockdowns closures of routine clinical services and forced self-isolation deriving have uniquely challenged the health and welfare of people vulnerable to drug and alcohol addiction as well as those with behavioral addictions gambling gaming compulsive eating internet and new technologies inpatient or residential treatments have been interrupted since the substantial risk of coronavirus spread with congregation of individuals in a limited space alcohol and marijuana sales have also increased as in many areas of the world businesses that dispensesell these products have been some of the few businesses to remain open as they are often deemed essential services this suggests a burgeoning wave of drug and alcohol related problems will emerge in society and highlights the need to return to delivery of clinical treatment research in this area that said a recent summary by the national institute of drug abuse highlighted original research demonstrating that chronic smokers and opiate users are likely at higher risk for covid-19 related morbidity associated with respiratory disease 41 data from the chinese center for disease control and prevention have suggested that covid-19 has an increased fatality in patients with chronic conditions like respiratory and cardiovascular diseases 42 an international group of experts on addiction medicine infectious diseases and disaster psychiatry has recently explored the possible raised concerns and nicely provided recommendations to a comprehensive healthcare response to covid-19 in sud 2 to deal with the consequences of the covid-19 on addictions efforts will require joining partnerships and possibly unprecedented use of technology in which neuromodulation by nibs would nicely fit especially thinking in distance treatment with an online monitoring systemit has become clear that older adults have the highest rates of morbidity and mortality associated with covid-19 consequently older adults represent a vulnerable population and careful consideration should be made when bringing them into a research or clinical environment wherein they may be exposed to others that are infectious special consideration should be given in regard to labclinic activities with older adults that have comorbidities that further increase risk for poor covid-19 outcomes such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease while standard ppe sanitization and minimization of person-to-person contact should be adhered to in all participants it may be necessary to discontinue ongoing in-person research activities for those at the highest risk for infection and poor outcomes in-home neuromodulation or treatment options in the daily care units for older people may be a particularly good option for these individuals regardless of comorbidities labsclinics working with older adults should adhere to the highest standard of safety for minimizing covid-19 transmission when continuing in-person research activitiesvulnerable sub-populations of older adults also include those with multiple chronic illness and low performance status such as those receiving supportive services within the retirement communities norc or community-based patients receiving specialist-level palliative care at-home tes paired with telehealth solutions has been shown feasible in these vulnerable sub-populations with proper covid-19 precautions screening and ppe protection non-invasive neuromodulation may provide an option for symptom management in home settingsin the department of neurology at nyu langone health in midtown manhattan a protocol for remotely supervised tdcs rs-tdcs 43 44 45 has been systematically developed and validated over the past five years with the goal of increasing access to treatments for larger sample sizes and to extend the number of treatment sessions to date using this protocol 5100 remotely supervised at-home sessions have been delivered to patients with ms 46 47 and other neurological conditions such as pd 48 and cerebellar ataxia 49 and following ect 50 targeting behavioral outcomes such as cognitive and motor functions and fatigue while reducing patient time and costs was the original goal of the rs-tdcs protocol 51 the covid-19 clinical research pause demonstrated the broad utility of remotely supervised at-home treatment for clinical trials to date there are two ongoing rcts in ms participants one pairing tdcs with cognitive training for 30 daily sessions over 6 weeks national ms society and the other pairing tdcs with upper extremity motor exercises us dod for 20 daily sessionsthe research team prepared lab computers in advance of the research pause to administer the video visits off-site research participants were able to continue their daily treatment sessions without interruptions we then obtained irb approval to obtain informed consent for these trials remotely and have continued to enroll new participants we have coordinated shipping of study equipment in kits to our participants that includes a preprogrammed tdcs device headset single-use sponge electrodes a preconfigured laptop computer for the video visits and survey administration for outcomes in the motor training trial equipment for the daily exercises and assessment measures is also included study materials preparation and shipping incoming and outgoing follow a checklist protocol for enforcement in the policy for cleaning and disinfecting of study materials with all equipment marked for visual confirmation of sanitization a third ongoing study national institutes of health nih that required baseline and treatment end neuroimaging visits was able to continue the treatments for the current participants but with enrollment on hold until research neuroimaging visits are resumeddue to the high demand for access to tdcs from patients with ms eg those who have had positive benefit in a clinical trial as well as those with other chronic neurological conditions we received institutional approval for a clinical tdcs service in december of 2019 as innovative care this service was launched through the nyu langone virtual health platform to provide video visits as telemedicine using our rs-tdcs procedures adapted for clinical use patients are loaned the tdcs device and headset with a baseline clearance evaluation and then an intake visit with agreement forms and device orientation the virtual visits operate directly through epic 52 as is now system-wide throughout the nyu langone health system for implementation of telemedicine patients in the service currently include those with cognitive or motor symptoms of ms mild cognitive impairment and ataxia 49 we also have provided the clinical treatment to patients with traumatic brain injury post-stroke aphasia and depression and cognitive impairment following ect 50 there has been no alteration of this clinical service during covid-19 and we are able to see new patients through the outpatient telemedicine platformsimilar to adults tdcs has been found to be well tolerated by children and has promising clinical effects 53 the challenge of pediatric in-home telemedicine methods includes safety and parental compliance 54 considering that neuromodulation performed remotely or in the home setting in children incorporates a vulnerable population and also involves parentslegal guardians assessments of safety reliability and adherence are expanded beyond the construct of adult studies and the investigators role in education and remote oversight pivotalfor over a decade our pediatric neuromodulation laboratory has pioneered protocols incorporating neurorehabilitation and neuromodulation the potentially devastating impact on access to rehabilitation therapies due to the covid-19 stay-at-home mandate on families and children with disabilities has yet to be fully realized telerehabilitation as an alternative means to access rehabilitation intervention has been successfully and feasibly performed in diverse populations of children with disabilities and by diverse telerehabilitation strategies 54 considering the construct telerehabilitation in children has been reported to initially involve face-to-face discussion and education for both the parents and the child 55 additionally specific considerations are indicated for pediatric populations and integration of parents in a pediatric telerehabilitation study aiming to increase treatment opportunities in cognitive training for children corti et al integrated assessments of the feasibility of interventions and the study design in the home setting 55 key aspects of these assessments included accessibility training compliance technical smoothness and training motivation along with assessments of recruitment enrollment and retention the authors found integration of the assessments to establish the study well-suited and remarkably high adherence to the protocol inherently integrating tdcs with telerehabilitation would raise unique considerations at the forefront-safety and reliability-with tdcs applications to date there are no current publications surrounding pediatric tele-neuromodulation therefore to adapt our current clinical research neuromodulation study to a tele-neuromodulation neuromodulation model with supervision for children who are diagnosed with stroke at or around the time of birth we are currently integrating guidelines established by charvet et al 47 56 and further work in adult stroke by van de winckel et al 57our past studies have integrated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms and tdcs with intensive rehabilitation in the pediatric population with perinatal stroke and resultant cerebral palsy now with our latest study single -session tdcs in cerebral palsy 58 we are investigating the neurophysiology and behavioral outcomes surrounding tdcs in children with varying forms of circuitry we had safely and feasibly completed sessions in 19 children with stroke by the time covid-19 put our study on hold however from the commencement of this study this study garnered local national and international interest from families of children with stroke many traveling great distances and incurring staggering related costs of travel to participate the covid-19 challenge has now encouraged us to consider how to potentially integrate tele-neuromodulation for children at home and could allow a broader catchment area of families previously unable to travel and enroll integrating accessibility and compliance in these unique teams of parentschildren with cerebral palsy our remote training and education laboratory tdcs supervisors will incorporate training the lay assistant parent as to tdcs delivery and the tdcs user child for ease of tdcs electrode placement integration of a pre-marked skull cap with 10-20 electroencephalogram system electrode coordinates indicating the c3 c4 locations to approximate the primary motor cortex will facilitate anodecathode positioning based on the indicated montage assessments of reliability of set-up and electrode placement and prior to commencing the stimulation sessions and monitoring tolerance and impedance will be paramount along with establishing a consistent and reliable method of remote communication eg zoom during the set-up stimulation session and prepost assessment trialsintegrating a covid-19 response to continue neuromodulation in the pediatric population with perinatal stroke and resultant cerebral palsy as well as lack of access recruitment feedback garnered from our previous work with families nationally and internationally this remote investigation will inform future larger externally-funded studies to remotely integrate children with mobility financial and access challenges eg rural communitiesmost of the tdcs-tacs clinical trials were stopped in middle of march 2020 there is one trial running with neuroconn mobile devices the aim of this phase ii study is to collect information about the efficacy of 10 hz tacs in the treatment of glaucoma 59 using a domiciliary tacs the number of possible stimulation sessions is fixed 34 during 14 weeks which cannot be changed remotely and at this stage will not be changed due to safety reasons to the best of our knowledge this is the longest stimulation duration that was ever applied in this patient group furthermore none of the stimulation parameters can be changed during treatment only by shipping a new stimulation module to the patients patients are required to document adverse events and side effects in a diary and the stimulation module is saving the parameters of each session which t can be downloaded in the study center unfortunately several patients were not able to visit the center at the end of the stimulation session therefore the objective measurements eg perimetry are still missing the state of the patients are followed by regular phone calls two of them indicated to terminate the participation in the trial due to high levels of personal stressthe act trial is a multisite definitive phase iii clinical trial that investigates the benefits of pairing tdcs with cognitive training in older adults to remediate age-related cognitive decline and potentially prevent onset of mild cognitive impairment and dementia 60 act involves a 3-month cognitive training intervention paired with 20 in labclinic sessions of either active or sham tdcs participants undergo cognitive training and tdcs 5 daysweek for the first two weeks then complete cognitive training at home on a study supplied laptop 4 days per week with 1 day per week in labclinic for stimulation at present the act trial has randomized 307 of 360 older adults targeted for randomization in the trial as this trial works with a population at high risk for poor covid-19 outcomes in-person study activities were stopped on march 13 2020 at this time 22 participants were actively in the intervention phase of the trial as act is a definitive phase iii trial near its completion a late phase change to at-home tdcs procedures would significantly undermine trial integrity for evaluation of definitive benefits from tdcs paired with cognitive training as only a small subset of participants would receive the alternative intervention approach even were the current covid-19 outbreak to occur earlier in the trial a significant change in intervention procedures would likely not be feasible for a phase iii trial in addition the primary outcome measure in the act trial is currently not available through telemedicine further preventing continuation of trial activities through a fully remote process in act 22 participants whose interventions were interrupted will need to be replaced in addition approximately 40 participants will miss the timing of their final 1 year follow-up assessment and mri visits as of the current date careful consideration with the trials data safety monitoring board and funding agency program office will need to be given regarding whether these 40 participants will need to be replaced in the trial as well pre-covid-19 act was within 14 months of completion with the loss of 22 participants the study will likely not be completed for 24-26 months should the 40 participants missing their 1 year time point need to be replaced trial completion could be delayed to 36 months or more while the extent of delay is still to be determined this serves as a poignant example of how covid-19 is directly impacting the speed of progress in medical science this example also further highlights the critical importance of advancing remotely supervised methods of neuromodulation administration in act participants complete cognitive training at home for a large portion of the trial were this initially paired with remote tdcs the overall impact on act would be significantly reduced however lack of availability of primary outcome measures for remote online or tele-administration would have still led the act trial to pause activities thus it is also important to note that there is a strong need for overarching work attempting to facilitate remote assessment activities for clinical trialsconsidering past remote neuromodulation studies and current covid-19 related challenges tele-neuromodulation holds one of the greatest opportunities for innovation and growth in the nibs field right now 61 moreover it is generally the case that administration of remote neuromodulation would allow those with limited accessibility eg mobility issues geographic location financial barriers limited access to communication technologies to interventions not previously realized rapidly expanding investigations of tdcs in the home setting in adult populations have been well-tolerated and shown high compliance and low drop-out rates in diagnoses such as depression 62 stroke 57 ms 44 46 47 pd 48 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 63 as well as in seriously ill multi-symptomatic palliative-care patients considering the acute challenges in neuromodulation access for all an additional consideration is the expanding field of pediatric telemedicine with implications for safe and feasible neuromodulation applications in the home setting 54 64 65as outlined in case examples sections 81 82 for those centers already engaged in remote supervised tdcs strategic and incremental protocols changes allow continuation and even expansion of protocols for those centers exploring transition of in-center tdcs to remotely supervised tdcs there are well established principles under the remote supervised rubric that allow home-based tdcs with compromising reproducibility 46 and detailed supporting documentation 45 56 65 66for those protocols providing nibs treatments that inherently require in-center application notably tms and ect and where covid-19 related streamlining of in-center protocols is not practical for specific patients transition to home-based tdcs may be considered as a valid alternative option there is evidence that tdcs can extend the benefit of tms or ect treatments 50 67 when ect and tms services are not available the operant decision is not the comparative efficacy of various nibs techniques 68 but the riskbenefit ratio of trialing tdcs the risk of tdcs is considered non-significant and safe including across clinical populations 69 70 71 - indeed tdcs is broadly applied to healthy subjects eg college students 72 specifically for major depressive disorder controlled trials 73 74 75 meta-analysis 68 76 77 and expert consensus 78 suggest tdcs is comparably effective with significantly less adverse events than drug therapy consideration for deploying remote-tdcs treatment should be based on the latest clinical trial data 56a common theme echoed in this manuscript is to shift any non-essential in-person visit to electronicvideo format for many research studies there is a consent visit screening visit and follow-up visits one of the benefits of the covid-19 crisis has been a widespread familiarity and increasing comfort with video conferencing software eg zoom webex vsee it is important to ensure the security of the videoconferencing platform when connecting with patients or study participants however with respect to institutional requirements for hipaa compliant communications given that tms studies often require at least one in-person intervention visit transforming our protocols to embrace video techniques for all other visits would improve the risk benefit ratio for the staff and the participants additionally research groups may want to consider adding covid-19-related illness as an exclusionary criteria or as part of the risks for participating in a research study which relies on multiple in-person visits should the institution deem this necessaryfixed frequency rtms eg 10 hz is the oldest and most established stimulation protocol and has been fda-approved for use in treatment resistant major depressive disorder for many years in recent years however bursting frequency protocols eg theta burst stimulation tbs have emerged as highly potent and temporally efficient forms of brain stimulation that is 600 pulses of intermittent tbs itbs delivered over 45 seconds result in an elevation in cortical excitability comparable to 2000 pulses of 10 hz tms delivered over 15 minutes 79 the effects of a single session last approximately 30 minutes but repeated sessions have similar durability and efficacy as 10hz rtms 80 34 and were first described in the motor cortex several recent clinical trials applying tbs to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have demonstrated treatment outcomes with itbs are comparable to treatment outcomes with traditional 10 hz rtms in major depressive disorder furthermore these protocols have similar side-effects safety and tolerability profiles the advantages of elevated potency and efficiency are coupled with a rigorous biologic foundation as theta is an endogenous neural rhythm associated with learning and memory by using tbs the number of patients treated per day with current rtms devices can be increased several times without compromising clinical effectiveness or safety in this covid-19 era one way to minimize the length of the time that a participant or patient has to be present in the room with a staff member would certainly be for investigators to consider using bursting frequency rtms protocols which appear to be more efficient pulse-to-pulse the shorter duration of the stimulation session also provides more flexibility when considering changes in workflow and schedules to ensure that patients do not overlap and thorough infection control measures are applied after every sessionthat said there has been some concern that the response to theta burst stimulation is highly variable 80 81 although there have been very few sham-controlled comparisons of fixed frequency versus theta burst frequency tms the largest study to directly compare these protocols which was not sham controlled did not find a difference in the variability or the durability of response to 20 sessions of itbs compared to conventional 10 hz tms in patients with depression 80 while the relative efficacy and durability of these protocols is an empirical question that remains unanswered in the covid-19 era it seems that greater investigation into the factors that increase theta burst efficacy are warrantedthe development of novel accelerated tms dosing strategies is another opportunity for clinical researchers previous studies have demonstrated that delivering multiple tms sessions per day has similar efficacy to a single tms session per day when the total number of tms administrations is equal 82 83 84 given that the total number of tms sessions appears to be a critical factor in behavioral change these concentrated dosing protocols would be attractive to both patients and providers while these protocols are being explored in research laboratories however there is still a gap in our knowledge regarding the parameters that optimally balance efficiency with long-term efficacy in one of the most concentrated tms protocols to date williams and colleagues 2018 recently published a study of 6 individuals with highly refractory depression 5 days 10 sessionsday 1800 pulses of itbssession 50 minute inter-session interval which demonstrated that this rapid dosing schedule was feasible and was effective as a rapid antidepressant 85 86 galletly and colleagues 2010 for example elegantly demonstrated that tms delivered 3 timesweek achieved overall similar outcomes to 5 timesweek as long as the overall number of administrations was the same 18-20 administrations 87 while most accelerated tms studies are being done in major depressive disorder they are also being used in many currently recruiting drug and alcohol treatment research trials 88 89 90 91 92 93 these protocols reflect dosing schedules that are likely more tenable for patients who likely have job and family responsibilities often 3 days per week versus the standard 5 days per week they are being used by researchers around the world by decreasing the number of times a participant or patient needs to come to the laboratoryclinic accelerated tms schedules will also minimize the number of days that individual spends out of the house the number of times they use public transportation and the number of other person-encounters they have over the course of their treatment as 30 sessions of tms could be given in as little as 3 or 6 days as has been tried at various institutions in the united states on the other hand although it reduces the total time of tms treatment patients need to stay longer in the tms environment from one or two hours mounting up to the entire daya few other techniques and opportunities for innovative tms protocol adaptations include greater reliance on neuronavigation for reliable and fast tms coil positioning as described in previous sections of this manuscript and the delivery of tms in off-site community clinics wherein the participant may have less exposure to potential covid-19 carriers in the hospital environment perhaps the most provocative but still chimerical opportunity is for increased investment and innovation in a portable means for tms delivery there are several patents currently for portable tms devices eg for the treatment of migraine attacks starling et al 94 and several papers have recently been published describing personalized tms helmet designs which stabilize the coil 95 and wearable tms coil designs 96 currently however there are no devices being made for commercial use the ability to distill the power of electromagnetic induction as a brain stimulation tool into a briefcase-sized device has the potential to revolutionize non-invasive neuromodulation as a field to see this materialize from a fantasy to a reality on the tails of the covid-19 crisis could in fact be one of the biggest achievements the neuromodulation field may gain from this experience it will however take talent time and investment to make this happen one should also balance the safety balance of reducing exposure to the coronavirus with the exposure to the yet unclear risks of patient self-application of home-based tmsas discussed above section 91 tdcs can be deployed at home with no or minimal required in-person interactions on a situation based providing tdcs as an alternative to tms or optimized the benefits of tms eg tdcs for maintenance of tms therapy can be considered 97 98in conclusion many of the tms treatment trials that were temporarily halted in march 2020 around the world have begun to put strategies in place to return to enrollment and execution these decisions should be made with sensitivity to many factors including the potential risk of covid-19 exposure to the participants and staff for in-person visits and the potential benefit to participants  patients of the intervention those trials involved structural or functional imaging remains restricted based on the opening of imaging facilities similarly any tms trials involving parallel in-person protocols eg rehabilitation are considered in totality while there will be many factors that influence this decision for each tms study there are some common themes that will minimize risk electronic visits when possible accelerated treatment courses shorter pulse sequences like theta burst use of technological methods such as neuronavigation and scalp modeling to improve rigor and decrease contact that not only improve the risk benefit ratio but will likely lead to a reimagination of the future of tms delivery-perhaps even launching a new industry that merges the portability and affordability of tdcs devices with the benefits of electromagnetic induction as a mechanism of inciting brain changein response to the covid-19 outbreak initial psychological and emotional reactions such as elevated levels of anxiety fear stress or anger and behavioral responses like socialphysical-distancing stockpiling goods ppe and disinfectants have been predicted based on previous experiences 99 and then reported during the covid-19 outbreak 100 101 102 103 however precipitated psychological responses might progress into severe mental concerns which can easily outlast the pandemic sleep disturbances somatization stress-related illnesses posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd anxiety disorders depressive disorders and health risk behaviors such as social isolation substance abuse or suicide attempts might also surge 2 102 104 accordingly depressive and post-traumatic symptoms have been constantly reported and found to persist even 25 years after epidemics 105 evidence that similar symptoms are present among health care professionals and the general population during the covid-19 outbreak is already emerging from china the epicenter of the outbreak 103 106 107 108 and from europe as well 109the consequences of covid-19 might be more immense in terms of the number of affected and maybe in terms of symptom severity than previous outbreaks not to mention its economic and political impact and their effects on an individual level apart from new cases with mental health issues those already facing mental health problems or belong to a vulnerable population might experience their symptoms worsening 110 111 increased risk of covid-19 infection or potentially deteriorating mental health during the outbreak has been articulated concerning patients with cancer 112 dementia 113 pd 114 chronic pain 115 ms 116 and drug users 2in light of the potential surge of demand for mental health care effective therapeutic options are critical nibs is a promising and versatile tool to consider the administration of magnetic fields ie tms or weak electrical currents ie tes induces long-term neuronal effects through modulating neuroplasticity 117 one of the first and most successful areas of nibs application is the use of hf-tms over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to alleviate depressive symptoms that now has a level a evidence ie definite efficacy 4 interestingly promising results are emerging regarding the beneficial effects of nibs on several clinical populations suggesting transdiagnostic opportunities level b probable efficacy recommendation has been proposed for the use of tms in fibromyalgia pd ms ptsd and stroke 5 evidence is less conclusive on tes however level b evidence supports the utility of tdcs in depression chronic pain and fibromyalgia 6 moreover prosperous results suggest the potential efficacy of nibs in several other disorders eg in anxiety disorders 118 dementia 119 obsessive-compulsive disorder 120 121 and pediatric attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 122in an outbreak situation adaptation skills and flexibility are essential to adjust behavior to the new regulations thus to mitigate the spread of the virus cognitive control is impaired in several conditions 114 123 however nibs has successfully ameliorated cognitive impairment in different patient groups 123 124 125 another important skill emotion regulation has improved in patients with anxiety disorders with the effects being sustained for 3 months after tms 126 depressive symptoms anxiety and ptsd emerging or being accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic 102 might also be successfully mitigated with nibs based on previous research 4 127 128 furthermore stress is also known to exacerbate disease-related symptoms such as the motor symptoms of patients with tic disorders or pd 114 129 130 preliminary evidence indicates the beneficial effects of tms on motor performance as well 131 132recently the possibility of covid-19-associated nervous system diseases has also been clinically proven by detecting the ribonucleic acid rna of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient 133 neurological symptoms such as impaired consciousness headache dizziness and taste or smell impairment are not uncommon 134 therefore the long-term follow-up and monitoring of severe cases of covid-19 in terms of neurological symptoms is highly advised 135 through the enhancement of neural plasticity some covid-19-related neurological residual symptoms might be attenuated by nibs in a rat model tms has been found to reduce inflammation after focal brain injury 136 and to decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with pd 137 moreover patients with disorders of consciousness have shown neurobehavioral and electrophysiological gains after multiple sessions of nibs 138 139 140 therefore anti-inflammatory potential and neurological utilization of nibs might also be investigatedfinally there may be opportunities to apply nibs in the broader context of changing medical protocols this could span changing methods and access to prescribed medications eg ability to diagnose monitor for adverse events as well as any consideration of unexpected interactions between drugs eg psychotropics and antiviral medication a general feature of nibs is its non-drug non-systematic application nature non-addictive nature and ability to terminate or adjust dose in clinic or remote for home-based treatment and vice versa clearly there is potential for nibs as a unique treatment tool in the fight against the medical and psychological after-effects of the covid-19 outbreakthe covid-19 pandemic just like all crises has yielded challenges for researchers clinicians participants and patients but also lessons to learn from and new opportunities to pursue by synthesizing the experiences of experts from all over the world this consensus paper establishes practical recommendations to follow in operationalizing nibs during covid-19 pandemic mitigating the risk of infections and in preparing the nibs community for any future epidemicpandemic indeed as we emerge from the current pandemic the number of people who require innovative treatments such as nibs due to direct and indirect effects of covid-19 onto the brain and mental health will significantly increase this burden on the health care systems mandates broader investigation and adoption of therapeutic solutions such as the use of nibs for nibs laboratories and clinics to contribute to the ease the burden of the pandemic it is necessary to re-establish operation with prudent protocol modifications as soon as possiblemaintaining ongoing and restarting operations at nibs clinics and research institutions across the world requires accommodation to strict measures namely socialphysical distancing introduced due to the covid-19 outbreak the suddenness and severity of initial restrictions resulted in significant disruptions to ongoing clinical treatment and trials spanning suspension recruitment of participants interruption of ongoing treatment to complete suspension of in-person activities the degree of interruption varied for example in-person non-clinical non-essential work was largely halted while remote-tdcs clinical activity continued interruption of ongoing trials is compounded by overall operational and programmatic uncertainties eg the situation of students and early career scientists financial concerns the overarching concern is when and how specific clinical and laboratory work can be resumed and what precautions are to be adopted this document provides guidelines for maintaining and resuming nibs operationswe distinguish three phases of procedural responses immediate covid-19 impact current practices and future preparation with current reactions of the nibs community to the covid-19 pandemic largely in early phases with reactions aiming to limit disruption to ongoing protocols however streamlining and expanding nibs services is now ongoingbased on the analysis of international experts with domain relevant expertise covering nibs technology clinical services and human trials we formed recommendations to ensure the safety of participants researchers and staff members during the re-establishment of access to nibs clinical services and research operations apart from the obvious preparations eg sanitization and social distancing protocols and remote data acquisition where possible recommendations are also made regarding protocol optimization methodological good practices the support of all stakeholders including early career scientists to foster this process a checklist is also provided in the article mitigation plans to reduce the risk of infection for subjectsparticipants and researchclinical staff are preeminent but should be based on the applicable national and institutional guidance and scientific understanding to avoid being misdirected or unduly burdensome recommendation on precautions are also discussed considering pediatric research older adults patients with addiction stroke ms or other chronic neurodegenerativeinflammatory disordersas explicated through this document appropriate safety protocols are crucial to provide nibs for those who require mental health care regardless of and also aggravated by the outbreak with well-coordinated and strategic responses the nibs community can play an expanding role in managing the burden related to the covid-19 pandemic while continuing to generate clinical and scientific regarding the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of nibs as we have discussed above expanding clinical trials with telemedicine-based nibs are of high impact in the current situation and considering future outbreaks and longstanding need for vigilance since tes devices are more easily transportable and simple to use the remote application of tes is more supported in contrast to tms guidelines 46 56 and empirical experience 140 141 142 regarding the at-home applications of tdcs are available experiences gained through this process as well as new perspectives gathered during the challenging era of covid-19 might delineate new research and therapeutic goals and become invaluable when preparing for future outbreaksthe interest in telemedicine-based solutions has especially increased among the nibs community 61 and the experiences gained from such studies conducted during the outbreak will be broadly valuable generally remote nibs solutions extend the availability of neuromodulation and can reduce costs of increasing the trial sample sizes and treatment duration the adaptation process of some in-clinic tms solutions that sustained operation during the pandemic and protocols to reduce contact is addressedthe nibs community has faced varied degrees of disruption that has broadly challenged laboratories and clinics across the globe by working around evolving restrictions and uncertainties strategic and not unduly burdensome implementation of applicable safety procedures and adaptation of protocol components to limit in-person activities access to nibs must be continued and re-established rapidly in this article approaches and practical recommendations have been provided indeed if further outbreaks arise the nibs community will be

and akimasa hirata have no conflict of interest to declare and did not receive specific funding for this workinfectious diseases vary by geographic region and population and they change over time when moving from one region to another humans are exposed to a variety of potential pathogens and also serve as part of the global dispersal process1 microbes picked up at one time and in one place may manifest in disease and potentially be transmitted far away in time and place because many microbes have the capacity to persist in the human host for months years or even decades the relevant time frame for study of geographic exposures becomes a lifetime furthermore microbes also move and change and reach humans via multiple channelscaring for patients requires an understanding of the basic factors that underlie the geography of human diseases and events that cause shifts in the distribution and burden of specific diseases current travel capacity contributes to massive population movements and rapid shifts in diseases and their distributions but technology also provides communication channels that aid clinicians who care for patients with unfamiliar medical problems this chapter reviews the factors that shape the global distribution of infectious diseases and the forces that are expected to shift distributions in the future examples illustrate the range of factors that affect the distribution and expression of infectious diseases2
many authors have traced the origins and spread of infectious diseases through history a century and a half ago john snow noted that epidemics of cholera followed major routes of commerce and appeared first at seaports when entering a new region yersinia pestis the cause of plague accompanied trade caravans and moved across oceans with rats on ships exploration of the new world by europeans introduced a range of human pathogens that killed one-third or more of the local populations in some areas of the americas the plants and animals introduced as a result of this exploration have also had profound and long-lasting consequences for the ecology and economics of the new environment3 the speed reach and volume of todays travel are unprecedented in human history and offer multiple potential routes to move biologic species around the globe pathogens of animals and plants are being transported as well and this can affect global food security4 establishment of arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes that are competent to transmit human pathogens in new geographic areas expands the regions that are vulnerable to outbreaks of some vector-borne infections this chapter focuses only on pathogens that directly affect human health and on their sources table 106-1
 when thinking about geography of human infections it is useful to consider both the origin of the organism and the conveyor or immediate source for the human figure 106-1
this chapter addresses three key issuesfactors influencing geographic distribution why are some infectious diseases found only in focal geographic regions or in isolated populationsfactors influencing the burden of disease why does the impact from widely distributed infections vary markedly from one region or one population to another andfactors influencing emergence of disease what allows or facilitates the introduction persistence and spread of an infection in a new region and what makes a region or population resistant to the introduction of an infection
many microbes require a specific arthropod vector for transmission or an animal reservoir host and hence inhabit circumscribed regions malaria is a vector-borne infection that cannot become established in a region unless a competent vector is present the presence of a competent vector is a necessary but not sufficient condition for human infection the mosquito must have a source of malarial parasites gametocytemic human or rarely nonhuman primates appropriate bioclimatic conditions and access to other humans the ambient temperature influences the human biting rate of the mosquito the incubation period for the parasite in the mosquito and the daily survival rate of the mosquito prevailing temperature and humidity must allow the mosquito to survive long enough for the malarial parasite to undergo maturation to reach an infective state for humans competent vectors exist in many areas with no malaria transmission because the other conditions are not met these areas are at risk of the introduction of malaria as illustrated by several recent examples in the usa and elsewhere7 8
an estimated 77 of the worlds population lived in areas with malaria transmission in 1900 by 2002 about 48 lived in at-risk areas but because of population growth and migration the total global population exposed to malaria had increased by 2 billion since 1900 see figure 106-2
9 for example in africa the population in malaria endemic zones increased by almost 200 million people between 2000 and 201010 this contrasts with the situation in the usa where malaria was endemic in many areas into the 20th century figure 106-3
 with estimates of more than 600 000 cases in 1914 even before extensive mosquito control programs were instituted transmission declined demographic factors population shifts from rural to urban areas improved housing with screened doors and windows and the availability of treatment were among the factors that contributed to this decreasethe distribution of onchocerciasis in africa is notable for its association with rivers11 the vector of this filarial parasite the black fly genus simulium lays her eggs on vegetation and rocks of rapidly flowing rivers and usually inhabits a region within 510 km on either side of a river another name for onchocerciasis river blindness describes the epidemiology as well as one consequence of infectionother pathogens have complex cycles of development that require one or more intermediate hosts distribution may remain relatively fixed even when infected humans travel widely if other regions do not supply the right combination and geographic proximity of hosts figure 106-4
 although persons with schistosomiasis visit many regions of the world the parasite cannot be introduced into a new region unless an appropriate snail host is present excreted eggs in urine or feces are released into fresh water where they reach the snail hosts and humans subsequently have contact with the untreated water12 however local ecologic changes and climate change can be associated with expansion of transmission in endemic areas or increased intensity of transmission and this has been identified as a possible consequence of warming temperatures in china13 for a more detailed consideration of the influence of climate change on the distribution of infectious diseases see chapter 4ebola and marburg viruses are viruses that have focal distributions but have caused dramatic human outbreaks with high mortality they also infect nonhuman primates and threaten the survival of great apes14 recent studies suggest that bats may be the reservoir hosts15 16 because these infections can be spread from person to person secondary household and nosocomial spread in several instances has amplified what began as an isolated event lack of adequate resources in hospitals in many developing regions contributes to the spread of infections within hospitals and clinicscultural practices can lead to unusual infections in isolated areas residents of the highlands of papua new guinea developed kuru after ingestion or percutaneous inoculation of human tissue during the preparation of the tissues of dead relativesthe presence of a pathogen in a region may reflect the biologic properties of the organism its need for a certain physicochemical environment or its dependence on specific arthropods plants or animals to provide the milieu where it can sustain its life cycle box 106-1
 the presence of a pathogen in a region does not equate with human disease because mechanisms must exist for the pathogen to reach a susceptible human host for human disease to occur exploration of new regions or changes in land use may place humans in an environment where they come into contact with microbes that were previously unrecognized as human pathogensbox 106-1biologic attributes of organisms that influence their epidemiology

among the infectious diseases that impose the greatest burden of death globally most are widely distributed respiratory tract infections eg influenza streptococcus pneumoniae and others diarrheal infections tuberculosis measles aids and hepatitis b16 most of these infections are spread from person to person the world health organization estimated that about 65 of infectious diseases deaths globally in 1995 were due to infections transmitted from person to person17
burden from these diseases is unevenly distributed across populations and among different countries poor sanitation lack of clean water crowded living conditions and lack of vaccination contribute to the disproportionate burden from many of these infections in low- and middle-income countries lmic in industrialized countries pockets of high risk persist disadvantaged populations have higher rates of tuberculosis hiv and many other infectious and noninfectious diseases rates of reported cases of tuberculosis vary widely by region and within countries table 106-2

hepatitis a virus remains a common cause of infection in lmic where most persons are infected at a young age and become immune for life infection in young children is typically mild or inapparent persons living in areas of high transmission may be unaware of the presence of high levels of transmission although nonimmune older people such as travelers who enter the environment may develop severe and occasionally fatal infection countries with an improving standard of living may observe a paradoxical increase in the incidence of hepatitis a disease as the age of exposure increases shifting the age of infection to a time when jaundice and other symptoms are more likely to occurtravelers also contribute to the global spread of infectious diseases24 25
neisseria meningitidis a global pathogen occurs in seasonal epidemics in parts of africa figure 106-6
26 irritation of the throat by the dry dusty air probably contributes to invasion by colonizing bacteria27 pilgrims carried an epidemic strain of n meningitidis type a from southern asia to mecca in 1987 other pilgrims who became colonized with the epidemic strain introduced it into sub-saharan africa where it caused a wave of epidemics in 1988 and 1989 the epidemic clone spread to several countries28 in 1996 in africa major outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis occurred 185 000 reported cases with a case fatality rate of 10 caused by n meningitidis serogroup a clone iii-129 in canada a virulent group c et-15 strain of n meningitidis was associated with an increased case fatality rate30 in these examples the virulence of the microbe and travel and trade acted synergistically to change the epidemiology and burden of disease in 2000 serogroup w135 n meningitidis caused an outbreak of infection in pilgrims to the hajj and spread to their contacts and others around the world studies using serotyping multilocus sequence typing multilocus dna fingerprints and other techniques found identical w135 isolates in multiple countries before this outbreak pilgrims from many countries received a vaccine that protected against serotype a but not w135 the polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine reduces risk of disease in the vaccinated individual but does not prevent oropharyngeal carriage or transmission of n meningitidis31
organisms that survive primarily or entirely in the human host and are spread from person to person eg by sexual or other close contact can be carried to any part of the world the spread of hiv in recent decades to all parts of the world is a reminder of the rapid and broad reach of travel networks although the infection has also spread via blood and shared needles it has been the human host engaging in sex and reproduction who has been the origin for the majority of the infections worldwide person-to-person spread accounted for the rapid worldwide distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars a coronavirus infection in the spring of 2003 after the virus emerged from an animal reservoir most likely bats and infected farmed civets36
multidrug-resistant mdr tuberculosis has continued to increase the world health organization estimated that 450 000 cases and 170 000 deaths from mdr tuberculosis occurred in 201218 extensively drug-resistant xdr tuberculosis which is virtually untreatable has been reported by 92 countries almost 10 of mdr-tb cases are xdr-tb18 humans also carry resistance genes and virulence factors that can be transferred to and exchanged with other microbes37
dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in most tropical and subtropical regions globally an estimated 96 million people have symptomatic infection each year38 viremic humans regularly enter regions infested with aedes aegypti the principal vector of dengue transporting the virus for new outbreaks because four serotypes of dengue virus exist and infection with one serotype does not confer lasting immunity against other serotypes a person can be infected more than once one study found the risk of developing severe dengue after repeat infection was 82103 times greater than after primary infection39 in an outbreak in cuba 985 of cases of dengue shock syndrome dss or dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf were in persons with a prior dengue infection40 risk factors for severe dengue identified in epidemiological studies include young age virus strain and host genetics41
factors that have aided the spread of dengue include increasing travel to and from tropical regions expansion of the regions infested with aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus population growth and increasing urbanization in tropical areas the use of nonbiodegradable and other containers that make ideal breeding sites for the mosquito inadequate vector control programs and increasing resistance of vectors to insecticidesin 2001 the vector that was implicated in an outbreak of dengue in hawaii42 was aedes albopictus a mosquito species that has been introduced into new regions in recent decades probably primarily by shipping used tires and other items43 the virus responsible for the hawaii outbreak was similar to dengue isolates from tahiti suggesting that viremic travelers introduced the virus from the south pacificalthough large dengue epidemics occurred in the usa in the 20th century few cases have been acquired in the usa in recent years despite the presence of epidemic disease in adjacent areas of mexico and the presence of a competent vector aedes aegypti in south-eastern usa figure 106-7
26
aedes albopictus has even broader distribution in continental usa the presence of screened dwellings and air conditioning may make an area relatively resistant to spread of infection even if a competent vector infests a region since 2009 a few cases of local dengue transmission have occurred in key west florida43 and serologic studies have also documented that dengue infections are occurring in texas44
chikungunya a mosquito-borne alphavirus originally isolated in tanzania in 1953 has spread from africa causing massive outbreaks in the indian ocean islands india and other parts of asia since 2005 in the summer of 2007 an outbreak caused hundreds of cases 175 laboratory confirmed in north-eastern italy the index case was a visitor from india the vector implicated was aedes albopictus postulated to have been introduced via used tires45 mutations in the virus may have enabled it to replicate more efficiently in aedes albopictus mosquitoes the asian tiger mosquito which is now widely distributed outside of asia46 it can survive cooler temperatures than aedes aegyptibeginning in late 2013 local chikungunya transmission was documented in the caribbean islands the virus has now spread widely in central and south america47 chikungunya virus is introduced into new areas by viremic travelers and can cause high attack rates in susceptible populations persistent and disabling joint pain can follow acute illness especially in older individuals48
cholera illustrates the complex interactions between microbe environment and host49
vibrio cholerae lives in close association with marine life binding to chitin in crustacean shells and colonizing surfaces of algae phytoplankton zooplankton and water plants v cholerae can persist within the aquatic environment for months or years often in a viable but dormant state noncultivable by usual techniques environmental factors including temperature salinity ph and sea-water nutrients affect the persistence abundance and viability of the organisms and hence influence human epidemicsunder conditions of population crowding poor sanitation and lack of clean water cholera can have a devastating impact as was shown by the massive outbreak of el tor cholera in rwandan refugees in goma zaire which caused 12 000 deaths in july 199450
toxigenic vibrio cholerae o1 was introduced into haiti in 2010 in the aftermath of the earthquake51 as of march 2013 it had caused 650 000 illnesses and 8000 deaths studies suggest that it was introduced by un mission personnel who lacked sanitary disposal of their waste subsequently a tributary of the artibonite river was contaminated with a pathogenic strain of south asian type vibrio choleraethe organism can be carried by humans who can introduce it into new regions trade probably also plays a critical role ballast water picked up by boats in multiple locations and discharged at another time and place carries a wide range of species52 53 in earlier studies of the ballast and bilge of cargo ships in the usa gulf of mexico researchers were able to identify v cholerae identical to the strains causing epidemic disease in latin america54
the globalized food market moves pathogens from one region to another an outbreak of cholera in maryland usa was traced to imported contaminated commercial frozen coconut milk55 alfalfa sprouts grown from contaminated seed sent to a dutch shipper caused outbreaks of salmonella spp on two continents the usa and finland56 commercial movement of fruits and vegetables redistributes resistance factors along with the microbestravel and trade are key features in the epidemiology of the infection cyclospora a cause of gastroenteritis for many years cases were often associated with living in or travel to areas where sanitary facilities were poor in the summer of 1996 a large us outbreak occurred in persons who had not traveled over a period of a few months 1465 cases of cyclosporiasis were reported from 20 states the outbreak was linked to raspberries imported from guatemala57
in the past visceral leishmaniasis in brazil was primarily a rural disease recently however several cities have reported large outbreaks of visceral leishmaniasis58 reasons for the change in epidemiology include geoclimatic and economic factors drought lack of farm land famine leading to migration of large numbers of persons who settle in densely populated peri-urban areas that lack basic sanitation domestic animals such as dogs and chickens are sources of blood meals for the sand fly vector of leishmaniasis outbreaks affecting especially children and young adults have occurred in many cities in brazil malnutrition contributes to disease severitydiseasedisease interactions also alter the epidemiology of infections visceral leishmaniasis has become an important infection in hiv-infected people in spain and other areas where the two infections coexist59 the presence of hiv leads to increased risk of progression of infection disease can also appear years after exposuremovement of nonhuman species can affect infections in humans importation of wild animals from ghana into the usa led to an outbreak of monkeypox an infection previously known to exist in africa humans became infected by handling domestic prairie dogs sold as pets that had been housed with the imported wild animals from africa60
aedes albopictus introduced into the usa via used tires shipped from asia61 has since become established in at least 21 contiguous states of the usa and in hawaii aedes albopictus can transmit dengue and chikungunya viruses and is a competent laboratory vector of la crosse yellow fever and other viruses multiple strains of eastern equine encephalitis virus have been isolated from aedes albopictus in floridacurrent transportation systems regularly carry all forms of life including potential vectors along with people and cargo in an experiment conducted several years ago mosquitoes house flies and beetles in special cages were placed in the wheel bays of a boeing 747 aircraft and carried on flights lasting up to 7 hours temperatures were as low as 62f 52c outside and ranged from 46f to 77f 825c in the wheel bays survival rates were greater than 99 for the beetles 84 for the mosquitoes and 93 for the flies62 occasional cases of so-called airport malaria  cases of malaria near airports in temperate regions  attest to the occasional transport and survival of an infective mosquitoin the usa transportation of raccoons in the late 1970s from florida to the area between virginia and west virginia in order to stock hunting clubs unintentionally introduced a rabies virus variant into the animals of the region from there the rabies enzootic spread for hundreds of miles reaching raccoons in suburban and densely populated regions of the north-east usa spill-over of the rabies virus variant into cats dogs and other animal populations and direct raccoonhuman interactions have had costly consequences63
highly pathogenic avian influenza a h5n1 is a global concern64 it is entrenched in poultry populations in asia and africa and has caused outbreaks in europe and the middle east although the virus causes high mortality in infected humans thus far h5n1 has not been able to establish sustained transmission from person to person most humans appear to have been infected via close contact with poultry or their products although the virus can be carried by migratory birds65 most introductions appear to have been related to movement of poultry and poultry products in south east asia risk was associated with duck abundance human population and rice cropping intensity66
geographic exposures influence how one thinks about probable diagnoses in a given patient in mexico for example more than 50 of patients with late-onset seizures have computed tomography ct evidence of the parasitic infection neurocysticercosis67 in peru 29 of persons born outside lima who had onset of seizures after 20 years of age had serologic evidence of cysticercosis68 in northern thailand melioidosis is a common cause of sepsis accounting for 40 of all deaths from community-acquired sepsis69
in considering the consequences of exposures in other geographic regions relevant data in assessing the probability of various infections include the duration of visit activities and living conditions during the stay and the time lapsed since the visit among british travelers to west africa the relative risk of malaria was 803 times higher for persons staying for 612 months than among those staying 1 week70 in malawi the risk of schistosome infection increased directly with duration of stay seroprevalence was 11 for those present for 1 year or less but this increased to 48 among those present for 4 years or longer71 in a study of persons with cysticercosis the average time between acquisition of infection and onset of symptoms was about 7 years72
for malaria it is necessary to know not only whether infection can be acquired in a specific location but also the species of parasites present and the patterns of resistance to antimalarial agents figure 106-8
shows the distribution of malaria analysis of data from the geosentinel surveillance network a network that uses travelers as a sentinel population finds marked differences in the spectrum of disease in relation to the place of exposure22 73
expression of disease may vary depending on age of first exposure immunologic status of the host genetic factors and the number and timing of subsequent exposures temporary residents of endemic regions have different patterns of response to a number of helminths from those of long-term residents in cases of loiasis temporary residents have immunologic hyperresponsiveness high-grade eosinophilia and severe symptoms that are not seen in long-term residents of the same area74 genetic factors can affect susceptibility to infection or expression of disease some persons for example are genetically resistant to infection with parvovirus because they lack appropriate receptors on their erythrocytes75 persons lacking duffy factor cannot be infected with the malarial parasite p vivaxknowledge about the geographic distribution of diseases is essential for informed evaluation and care of patients who increasingly have had exposures in multiple geographic regions recent travel and trade patterns have led to more frequent contact with populations from low latitude areas regions with greater species richness76 infectious diseases are dynamic and will continue to change in distribution and access to real time epidemiologic outbreak surveillance data such as that provided by promed wwwpromedmailorg is a vital tool for clinicians changes in virulence and shifts in resistance patterns will also require ongoing surveillance and communication to healthcare providers multiple factors favor even more rapid change perhaps in unexpected ways in the future rapidity and volume of travel increasing urbanization especially in developing regions the globalization of trade multiple technologic changes that favor mass processing and broad dispersal and the backdrop of ongoing microbial adaptation and change which may be hastened by alterations in the physicochemical environment

the schwartzreport tracks emerging trends that will affect the world particularly the united states for explore it focuses on matters of health in the broadest sense of that term including medical issues changes in the biosphere technology and policy considerations all of which will shape our culture and our lives
perhaps it is because i research and publish the daily schwartzreport the many stories i have done on climate change have certainly sensitized me to what is happening maybe its just curiosity or maybe its fear whatever the reason as i travel now i find myself looking around and thinking what will be the impact of climate change on this community i notice how they are dealing with the homeless because migration is going to be a big deal so this trend is only going to get worse whats the food situation like how good are the bridges how do they handle sanitation demands at large events it is going to be a huge problem and all of it impacts most particularly health carein the united states on 30 january 2020 a thursday the centers for disease control confirmed the first human-to-human transmission of the virus in the country a 60 year old man returning from wuhan china the center of the outbreak1 a few hours later the world health organization declared the fast-spreading outbreak a global health emergency2
a few hours later president trump closed the borders quarantined hundreds of travelers who had just arrived in the us and gave an interview as quoted from cnbc president donald trump said the us government was working closely with china to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has killed at least 171 people predicting a very good ending for the united stateswe are working very closely with china and other countries and we think its going to have a very good ending for us that i can assure you trump added us officials believe we have it all under control adding that its a very small problem in this country3
four days later 17438 cases had been identified and there were 362 known deaths four days after that the virus still centered in china had infected 34546 people by that time and killed 720 people worldwide4
you will be reading this several months after i write it and so will know how this plays out but the numbers alone arent the point i am trying to make it is that this virus in spite of all medical advances arose very quickly and has had worldwide effects just as the aids pandemic has infected 75 million and killed 32 million as of 2019 5 or the much smaller worldwide ebola hemorrhagic fever african epidemic which killed 11000 certainly we have come a long way the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 the deadliest pandemic on record which infected an estimated 500 million worldwide roughly a third of the worlds population and killed 20 to 50 million including and estimated 675000 americans6
what i am trying to show with these illustrations is that a century of experience and data has taught us these afflictions appear in spite of all the advances of medicine and cannot be anticipated the question that haunts my mind is how would the united states handle such a pandemic outbreak if it occurred as the coronavirus did in china just as some kind of major climate change crisis was also stressing the american healthcare system are we prepared i dont think so do youthe reality is that not only america but the world is utterly unprepared for these outbreaks and when one adds the migrations that climate change will compel things look very bleak indeed the international organization for migration in geneva is generally considered the best source on information on this issue and their source is oxford professor norman myers he says that by 2050 which is to say just 30 years from now when global warming takes hold there could be as many as 200 million people overtaken by disruptions of monsoon systems and other rainfall regimes by droughts of unprecedented severity and duration and by sea-level rise and coastal flooding7
this rise in migration trend is already underway the united nations reports the climate crisis is already having an effect according to the internal displacement monitoring centre 172 million people had to leave their homes last year because of disasters that negatively affected their lives slow changes in the environment such as ocean acidification desertification and coastal erosion are also directly impacting peoples livelihoods and their capacity to survive in their places of origin8
but i want to focus on the americas internal migrations particularly just consider the internal migrants projected to abandon coastal cities and towns because of flooding due to sea rise
a multi-university re search team led by caleb robinson of georgia institute of technologys school computational science and engineering department did the calculations see
fig 1
 and projected that sea rise alone will make 13 million people internal migrants9 the teams commentary is chilling the impacts of slr sea level rise are potentially catastrophic about 30 of the urban land on earth was located in high-frequency flood zones in 2000 and it is projected to increase to 40 by 2030 taking urban growth and slr into account 14 in the united states alone 1233 million people or 39 of the total population lived in coastal counties in 2010 with a predicted 8 increase by the year 2020 by the year 2100 a projected 131 million people in the united states alone would be living on land that will be considered flooded with a slr of 6 feet 18 mas oceans expand and encroach into previously habitable land affected peopleclimate migrantswill move towards locations further inland looking for food and shelter in areas that are less susceptible to increased flooding or extreme weather eventswe argue that the comprehensive impacts of slr on human populations when considering migration expand far beyond the coastal areas10
climate change migration and epidemics what lessons should we draw from those trends how prepared is america to deal them ask yourself where i practice how would the emts clinics hospitals my practice itself handle the stresses to come over the next three decades whether it is people fleeing people in transit or people arriving how would sanitation housing healthcare and food support be done where you livei want to argue that we as a nation are headed to a disaster of a proportion nationwide never experienced in our history and it is occurring at the same time that the illness profit system that passes for healthcare in america is collapsing is this a political statement only in the sense that it is going to require politics to solve it lets put partisanship aside and just look at the objectively verifiable data starting with the demographic which is going to live through what is occurringwe are an aging population according to the us census bureau in less that 20 years the old will outnumber the young for the first time in us history they report already the middle-aged outnumber children but the country will reach a new milestone in 2034 previously 2035 that year the us census bureau projects that older adults will edge out children in population size people age 65 and over are expected to number 770 million previously 780 million while children under age 18 will number 765 million previously 767 million11 so we are getting older and less vital also lifespan in america has been going downward for the last three years after more than a century of increasing steadilysteven wolf of center on society and health department of family medicine and population health virginia commonwealth university school of medicine richmond and heidi schoonmaker of eastern virginia medical school norfolk teamed up to really climb inside of this life expectancy decline and their report in jama should be a clock stopper they found that us life expectancy increased for most of the past 60 years but the rate of increase slowed over time and life expectancy decreased after 2014 a major contributor has been an increase in mortality from specific causes eg drug overdoses suicides organ system diseases among young and middle-aged adults of all racial groups with an onset as early as the 1990s and with the largest relative increases occurring in the ohio valley and new england the implications for public health and the economy are substantial making it vital to understand the underlying causes12
and all of this is occurring in a nation whose healthcare system currently ranks according the to the world health organization a lowly 37th in the world far from preparing for climate change and what it means the united states is going backwards dismantling the fragile system it hastwenty percent of the people living in the united states live in what is defined as a rural area rural counties constitute approximately 97 of the land mass of america about 20 of the population live in one of these counties  thats just under 66 million men women and children although this population is skewed older 175 are older than 65 compared to urban areas where that percentage is 138 in some states more than 50 of the older population lives in these rural areas13
so we have climate change coming on in rural areas where there is an older population that already requires more healthcare that average14 so what is actually happening since the us healthcare system places profit above health hospitals are closing right and left see
fig 2
 because they arent profitable enough and the covid-19 crisis will show us what happens in such a healthcare systemin 2016 about 41 of rural hospitals nationally operated at a negative margin meaning they lost more money than they produced from operations texas and mississippi had the highest number of economically vulnerable facilities that year15 three years later in 2019 more than 20 of our nations rural hospitals or 430 hospitals across 43 states were near collapse at least 155 rural hospitals have closed since 200516
i have been documenting this in these pages since 2005 once the reality is faced that healthcare is calibrated to profit not wellbeing it is easy to see why hospital corporations are closing rural hospitals at present we have a situation where the healthcare system is disintegrating at the very time it is going to be most neededthink about those hospitals closing each time a rural hospital closes there are tragic consequences for the local community and surrounding counties while the medical consequences are the most obvious there is also loss of sales tax revenue reduction in supporting businesses such as pharmacies and clinics there are also fewer professionals including doctors nurses and pharmacists and fewer students in local schoolsdavid mosley and daniel debehnke md studied this exact issue and reported the closing of a rural hospital often signals the beginning of progressive decline and deterioration of small rural towns and counties hospitals often serve as financial and professional anchors as well as source of pride for its small rural community it also often means loss of other employers or inability to recruit new employers due to lack of nearby health care when a rural hospital closes its doors unemployment often rises and average income drops17
there are no nurses doctors pharmacists or ers for local farmers ranchers growers and assorted men women and children who love living and working in americas vast rural regions rural communities and rural citizens are often left with no options for routine primary care maternity care or emergency care even basic medical supplies are often hard to find just think about one example of what would happen if 13 million americans were on the move in desperation consider diabetesaccording to the centers for disease control in 2017 more than 100 million us adults are now living with diabetes or prediabetes the report found that in 2015 303 million americans  94 percent of the us population were diabetic another 841 million had prediabetes a condition that if not treated often leads to type 2 diabetes within five years18 and the numbers in 2020 are larger because they have been going upassume for the moment equal distribution of diabetic sufferers amongst the internal migrants although in actuality that will not be the case coastal southern states where climate change will particularly cause internal migration have the highest diabetes rate in the country but just assume equal distribution if there are 13 million internal migrants 94 would be over a million men women and children 1222000 to be exact if you have been taking insulin for more than 10 years without it you probably wouldnt live no more than 10 days19 do you think all those migrants will be well stocked with the insulin they need no neither do iif you live and practice in a city of a hundred thousand or a town of 50000 could your emergency rooms handle 10000 or 5000 additional diabetics desperate probably unable to pay for their daily insulin insulin is not optional how would your city or town even set up the system to meet the demand would your pharmacies have enough on handand it isnt just the diabetes if people werent getting their dosages regularly a whole range of serious health complications such as cardiovascular events or kidney disease will arise and require carein this essay i have just touched on three aspects of the crisis humanity faces pandemics climate change and diabetes but that is a very partial list to really get the full picture would require more than an essay one would have to add extreme weather events from hurricanes to heatwaves the decline of life-sustaining ecosystems food security and dwindling stores of fresh water each one of these alone poses a monumental challenge to humanity in the 21st century taken together as is likely to happen the situation becomes cataclysmicamerica is not prepared for any of this not even close how bad could it get at the university of massachusetts in boston at the center for governance and sustainability a team led by the centers director professor maria ivanova as that question and their conclusion looking at the combination of variables they see affecting the world they said these factors have the potential to impact and amplify one another in ways that might cascade to create global systemic collapse20
erik franklin a researcher at the university of hawaiis institute of marine biology concurs human society will be faced with the devastating combined impacts of multiple interacting climate hazards they are happening now and will continue to get worse21
if any group must lead the preparation fight to prepare us i think it must be americas healthcare professionals the people actually on the line however comfortable you are no matter how convinced you are that this chain of crises wont touch you or that you can handle it you wont and you cant not with the infrastructure and illness profit system we have todayi think a significant part of the budget now going to the military should be redirected into the rebuilding of a new system based on universality and fostering wellbeing it is going to require a different consciousness a different way of thinking a different worldview and just as they say you either become part of the problem or part of the solutionthe peoples republic of chinaor mainland chinahas emerged as the second largest economic power in the world with an average 10 percent growth of gross domestic product gdp a year world bank 2015 the country was formerly administered by a huge bureaucratic communist politburo it

economic reform and openness policy the industrialized china lifted around 500 million of its 13 billion citizens out of poverty world bank 2015 french and crabbe 2010 p xxiv however china maintains its system of authoritarianism notwithstanding regular cries for western style democracy by chinese students and citizens such as those of the tiananmen square protest in april 1989 leslie 2014 or demands for direct election of the hong kong governor by the citizens of hong kong during the so-called umbrella movement in the fall of 2014 so and ngo 2014china is one of the few countries that has globalized without being westernized the others being iran and taiwan nisbett 2003 p 224 as the socialist ideology still prevails at least in theory it is no surprise that the chinese understanding of

expression freedom of religion womens rights migrant and labor rights sexual orientation and gender identity human rights watch 2013modern china has been applauded for its great leap of economic success and hyper growth the boston consulting group 2013 that can be attested by such mega cities as beijing tianjin and shanghai and the urbanized provinces of hebei shandong jiangsu zhejiang fujian and guangdong as well as the growth of the middle class from 74 percent in 2005 to 113 percent in 2010 french and crabbe 2010 pp 1820hong kong has gone through a different path of economic success a former british colony returned to china in 1997 hong kong has been known as a modern western city with underlying chineseness wei and li 2008 p 4 it was founded by british merchants in 1841 and became an important port connecting south china and the rest of the world it comprises hong kong island new kowloon the new territories and 235 islands in the south china sea it has a land area of 1104 sq km or 4247 sq miles wei and li 2008 p 6 hong kong will officially enjoy its capitalistic system and western lifestyle under the one-country two systems concept until 2047 macpherson 2008 p 10 hong kong according to economic and trade information is the worlds eighth largest trading economy and the tenth largest exporter of commercial services it has the most services-oriented economy with service sectors accounting for more than 90 percent of its gdp it is the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment fdi in asia after mainland china and the third largest source of fdi in asia after japan and mainland china hong kong trade development council 2015in contrast to its great leap in socio-economic development china and to a certain extent hong kong is facing a number of serious issues regarding its environmental hazards and livelihood threats such as contaminants and toxicity in foods as well as non-consumable products sold as consumables pollutants in the air non-potable water supplies smoking and tobacco control noise pollution etc macpherson pp 3649 moreover it is also well documented that western diseases or chronic non-communicable diseases are prevalent due to rapid changes in lifestyle such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes obesity lung cancer etc french and crabbe 2010 pp 68 the emergence of communicable diseases has been well documented in good case studies such as those of bubonic plague in the nineteenth century pryor 1975 pp 6170 and the epidemics or pandemics in the contemporary globalization period of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars bird flu or h5n1 hivaids or even persistent tuberculosis and malaria in addition mental health-related issues such as high suicide rates depression and mental disorders are on the rise huang 2013 p 4 macpherson 2008 pp 3949all of these health hazards and ecological mishaps have had not only the microbes and some individuals to blame socio-politico-cultural determinants are in fact the culprits the low chance of the poor getting good education the absence of strong civic organizations morally corrupt interest groups and bureaucracies in food production and environmental regulation and control public health policies sanitary standards healthcare funding gender-related factors the one-child policy and the top-down health communication strategies could be mentioned as partly responsible as well french and crabbe 2010 pp xiiixiv huang 2013 p 21 wermuth 2003 p 63 not only domestic factors but also external factors such as globalization policies of the world trade organization wto the world bank and the international monetary fund imf affect chinas inequalities harris and seid 2004 p 25given this background this chapter aims to discuss how globalization has been affecting public health in china why economic progress brought about inequalities how these inequalities have been impacting public health in china and what the current status of public health is in china and hong kongcases of epidemics that broke out in the past such as bubonic plague bird flu and sars will be analyzed for both the public health and health communication policies health communication strategies regarding these infectiouscommunicable diseases have been explored the same approach has been used with current epidemics such as hivaids and ongoing historical diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis tb at the same time policies to mitigate pollutants in the air and water will be also discussedmoreover the chapter will assess communication strategies and policies on non-communicable disease ncd and public health policies this includes food safety and regulations concerning alcohol and tobacco control to prevent the onset of diabetes obesity cardiovascular disease and cancersthe concept of globalization must not be referred to as a phenomenon exclusively belonging to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries according to hopkins 2002 globalization is a new term that denotes ongoing historical processes from before the 1500s up to the present day according to lie 2003 pp 101116 globalization can be understood as a flow of cultural products from one location to another the location can be nations communities institutions or individuals unfortunately the global flows cannot be smooth because of nation states boundaries geo-cultural boundaries such as east and west and geo-economic boundaries such as the northsouth divide powell and steel 2011 globalization makes some regions become centers of economic growth while others are outliers or closer to the periphery this affects the life of the people in those regions a great deal harris and seid 2004 explain that the transition from agrarian to industrial societies in most developing countries has been slower and more problematic than that in the developed nations as there are many people who did not benefit from the developmentsncds ie cardiovascular disease especially coronary heart disease and stroke cancer chronic respiratory disease and diabetes kill about 36 million of the world population each year who 2015 social determinants that can be considered as negative consequences of globalization contributing to ncds among populations include migration of the population from traditional means of subsistence urbanization without provision of standard housing and employment and large unregulated marketing of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages harris and seid 2004 p 16 yacht and beaglehole 2004 pp 214215 the globalized worldequipped with high-speed transportationhas resulted in mobility and migration being deemed responsible for the emergence of new patterns of infectious diseases and speeding up the transmission rate of those diseases major infectious diseases have killed large populations small pox 500 million people measles 200 million spanish flu 80 million bubonic plague 75 million aids 40 million and typhus 4 million who 2015 although the incidence of infectious diseases dropped from 40 percent to 175 percent between 1990 and 2010 new diseases have emerged at the rate of one or more per year since the 1970s according to the world health organization 2015 several new infectious diseases are for instance the severe acute respiratory associated coronavirus sars-cov henipaviruses hendra and nipah avian influenza virus and the h1n1 virus swine influenza there are also historic infectious diseases that are re-emerging such as west nile fever human monkey pox dengue tb and malariauneven growth or socio-economic disparitiesdifferentialsgaps between the haves and the have-nots posed by globalization as a threat to healthy individuals or communities can be studied in nine different approaches according to wermuths research 2003 pp 943 described belowfirst the health gradient descriptive model which linearizes the socio-economic status or ses and health outcomes can be used to partially explain that high level of income education and occupation have some association with a lower death rate anderson and armstead 1995 pp 213215 to elaborate low-income people and paupers face a short life expectancy at birth as they have less access to appropriate healthcare nutrition living conditions including sanitation and later in life they are more prone to chronic stress because of unstable jobs or unemployment prospectssecond being healthy or not is a consequence of bio-psycho-social effects anderson and armstead 1995 pp 213225 the socio-demographic ie age ethnicity gender and location together with the socio-economic status ie education income occupation family wealth perceived ses economic mobility childhood socio-economic status material possessions tradingbartering practices and national income distribution the socio-environmental and medical ie residential characteristics occupational environment social support socialprofessional hierarchy and access to healthcare the psychological and behavioral ie psychological distress personality factors health promoting behaviors and health-damaging behaviors and physiological cardiovascular immune muscular endocrine height and weightthird a paradigm for research on ses and health by williams 1990 pp 8199 is based on the second approach but emphasizes the psycho-social factors that have an impact on health health practices smoking alcohol nutrition social ties or social support perceptions of control stress family occupational and residentialfourth the general theoretical model of relationships between occupational quality and poor physical health of wickrama et al 1997 pp 363375 emphasizes the underlying occupational quality social integration and marital integration to sense of control of an individual which leads to health-risk behaviors and poor physical healthfifth it was found by kennedy et al 1996 that the degree of income inequality was correlated with states mortality rates and infant mortalitysixth the social capitalcomprising the community cohesion and trust a person possesseswas suggested to be a good indicator of health by kawachi and kennedy 1997seventh the model social psychological and physical pathways to health outcomes developed by brunner and marmot 1999 p 20 reveals that social structure social environment and work affect the psychological aspects of an individual and are related to the health behaviors of that person the brain of that individual subsequently creates neuroendocrine and immune responses that cause patho-physiological changes which consequently affect organ impairment and health in generaleighth wilkinson 1997 stated that improvements of the standard of living and quality of life via globalization lower the rate of communicable or infectious diseases but increase the rate of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases among both the upper and lower social classesninth the political economy not only consists of global political and economic forces the state government social classes public administration policy making and the distribution of sources between and among populations but also concerns a world transnational trading system and the mobilization of labor and resources to maximize profits in turn it affects the living conditions of workers and their healthmainland chinas gdp per capita is us6807 while that of hong kong is us38124 the world bank group 2015 the annual growth rate of china has been 91 percent from 19892014 while the annual growth rate of hong kong has increased to 54 percent from 1974 to 2014 trading economics 2014a b mainland china and hong kong have evolved in many phases of globalization and that seems to be a mixed blessing as the positive aspects of globalization in terms of the social and political reach of the economic reform have enhanced the life expectancy at birth of an average mainlander from 69 years in 1990 to 752 years in 2012 and stagnated the mortality at birth of mainland chinese infants world health organization 2014 p 60 life expectancy at birth of a hong kongers is 807 years for males and 864 years for females also the infant mortality rates of hong kong ranked sixth lowest in the world pearson education 2013 thanks to the advances in public health and medical technology however inequalities in income global environmental changes and changes in lifestyle as well as communications that come with globalization take tolls on public health specifically in china health can be examined through five pathways as suggested by harris and seid 2004 p 11 a economic growth income distribution and poverty b democracy and governance c health services d nutrition and food security and e other risk or mitigating factorsthe latest data indicates that more than a quarter of the adult population in china or around 350 million people are overweight and obese the economist 2014 and according to who 2014 65 percent of female and 46 percent of male mainland chinese adults aged more than 20 are obese the more affluent hong kongers witness excess weight and obesity among 483 percent of males and 314 percent of females obesity among children in both mainland china and in hong kong is on the rise it is also worth noticing that 69 percent of male chinese children are obese which is twice the percentage of the male adults the economist 2014 and one out of every five children in hong kong is obese south china morning post 2015 it is also worth noting that obesity is expanding more in the rural areas than in the cities as many farmers have sold their landholdings for development and moved to more sedentary lifestyles the economist 2014 the cause of obesity in cities in china is due to the lack of public spaces for exercise and the changes in eating patterns as people consume more meat potatoes cows milk beers fast fooddeep-fried foods than in the past hence oils and fats especially transfat or hydrogenated fat used for producing margarine monosodium glutamate sugar and salt are on the increase while not enough grains are being consumed french and crabbe 2010 pp 4973 107 obesity may lead to a lack of concentration sleep apnoea constipation osteoarthritis slipped discs bad backs pulled muscles and infertility french and crabbe 2010 pp 7 910the top ten causes of death in china are malignant neoplasms 28 percent heart disease 21 percent cerebrovascular disease 11 percent diseases of the respiratory system 5 percent injury and poisoning 3 percent endocrine nutritional and metabolic diseases 3 percent diseases of the digestive systems 3 percent diseases of the nervous systems 1 percent diseases of the genitourinary system 1 percent and infectious diseases 09 percent cdc 2014 ncds accounted for 87 percent of total deaths in china in 2014 who 2014 french and crabbe 2010 p 7 reported that it was known in 2007 that bad diet obesity and a lack of physical exercise are the factors that are associated with cancers among the women in shanghai the cancer diagnosis rates in shanghai were more or less the same as those in the european union eu it is alarming that 116 percent of the population in the mainland is diabetic according to the latest survey the economist 2014 with reference to infectious diseases in mainland china zhang and wilson 2012 observed that the most frequently reported diseases were viral hepatitis 383 percent bacterial infections 333 percent and sexually transmitted infections stis and hiv 98 percent which accounted for 54 48 and 14 million diagnosed cases respectively during the period 200508 in hong kong the top three infectious diseases are chickenpox tb and food poisoning hong kong government 2014explicit public health policies in hong kong started in 1843 during the colonial period when a committee of public health was set up to tackle the fever that caused the death of 24 percent of the military and 10 percent of the civilian populations macpherson 2008 p12 the good order and cleanliness ordinance no 14 of 1845 was passed as the first law relating to public health by the colonial government macpherson 2008 p 12during the period before the second world war 18421941 the health policy and communication on the bubonic plague that broke out in tai ping shan in hong kong in 1896 was examined by pryor 1975 p 61 the plague bacillus was carried by rats to humans and through the air pryor 1975 p 62 68 plague or the black death that killed 80000 people was thought to have spread either from yunnan in the south of china or via a transportation route from india pryor 1975 pp 62 68 one of the social determinants that helped spread the disease was the overcrowded tenements in which residents were divided in cubicles some of which did not even have windows pryor 1975 p 68the first public health strategy was a bio-medical approach focused on quarantine the rapid disposal of corpses fumigation or disinfection of residences and evacuation hong kong then a colony under the british demolished every house in tai ping shan and rebuilt the area as a public park called blake garden ng 2014 p149 this is a top-down approach although the government executed the plan to battle the plague efficiently this approach earned distrust and resistance from the local residents ng 2014 p 149 describes how chinese families were known to hide the sick and even dead bodies in their homes to evade forced removal and mass burial and many of them migrated to china this incident emphasized that the policymakers have to ensure a good two-way communication and understand the local culture to gain acceptance and cooperation by the locals for the health policy to be successfulthis biomedical approach to health communication worked when the british government set up a bacteriological facility in 1906 which is now the hong kong museum of medical sciences and brought in experts from england france and japan to treat the infected and develop a vaccine the bubonic plague was controlled in 1925 after 20000 deaths which is 70 times the number lost to sars in 2003 ng 2014 p 149during the second world war public health in hong kong was expanded together with advances in vaccination health communication strategies in those days as analyzed from the narrative by macpherson 2008 p 20 entailed a top-down unilateral approach as anti-tb campaigns were used to educate the public in terms of behavioral change communication good governance and medical service were executed under a structural intervention plan macpherson 2008 p 20 reported that the hong kongers at the health department did such a good job in health services and rehabilitation of the colony during the war that almost 2 million people immigrated to hong kongmacpherson 2008 pp 2225 writes that in this period hong kong focused more on the biomedical intervention of maternal and child healthcare services to reduce infant and neonatal mortality and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases in children in 1948 health communication in hong kong could therefore be called a participatory-based advocacy servaes and malikhao 2010 communication as a non-anti-tuberculosis association was formed at the same time a structural intervention approach to public health was implemented when the housing authority resettled the slum dwellers to standard residential areas hong kong also collaborated with international organizations like who to create outreach services it also limited the number of migrants from mainland china the health communication strategycombining social marketing of vaccinations with behavioral change interventionscame up with promotional activities such as giving away gifts to the children who had been vaccinated this strategy was used to battle cholera and hepatitis infections macpherson 2008 pp 2324 the public health of hong kong after 1997 will be analyzed in conjunction with that of mainland china as hong kong was returned to china under the one country two systems arrangement after that particular yearthe ministry of public health moph was set up in 1949 prevention was the work that the moph did with mobile health teams all over the country the mode of health communication was a mixture of social marketing and propaganda as health was prized close to national security the government launched a series of patriotic hygiene campaigns to emphasize the importance of environmental sanitation as analyzed by huang 2013 pp 3133 during the great leap forward campaign of 195859 the principle of public health was based on egalitarianism and health services were free of charge and accessible as the state took care of society the health communication policy in this period was top-down authoritarian and relied on one-way communication mao dictated the public health policy in the anti-schistosomiasis campaign in 1958 and came up with his own form of pest control which included sparrows as pests this wrong policy led to a plague of locusts as there were not enough sparrows in other words a less thought-out policy led to an ecological imbalanceduring the great cultural revolution period under mao the barefoot doctor program was promoted as a national policy huang 2013 p 43 this was a structural change intervention during which china trained peasants to become medical doctors in the rural areas moreover during this period health services and medical services were managed in a three-tier system huang 2013 public health and education policies were mixed up with political ideology and resulted in a step backward for china as shown by the epidemiological data in state statistics macpherson 2008 pp 3435changes took place during the economic reforms after mao passed away in 1976 in 1985 public health policies allowed the private health care establishments to reduce the role of the state huang 2013 pp 5758 it was a structural change of the public health system huang 2013 p 80 reported that this economic reform model in the health sector jettisoned the maoist health model which emphasized quality and universalism the profit-oriented approach had a profound effect on preventive measures as the public needed to bear the cost of medical fees macpherson 2008 p 36 in 2006 it was found that historical diseases had re-emerged and new diseases such as hiv and aids h5n1 or sars spread rapidly hong kong has had a socialist health care system providing good service at minimal cost to the people macpherson 2008 p 45 in 2006 the hong kong sar government introduced private health insurance schemes for those who could afford them macpherson 2008 p 45the hivaids epidemic is a manifestation of a complex relationship between inequality particularly gender inequality with regard to education and income and poverty sutherland and hsu 2012 pp 27 43 according to macpherson 2008 p 40 the number of people living with hivaids plwha in hong kong remains low but the increase of hiv infection rates in guangdong and shenzhen which borders hong kong has triggered alarmsthe hiv epidemic in china concerns three different socio-cultural and economic factors the first is a complex consequence of the poorly controlled blood drug and sex trades the second is three socially marginalized populations impoverished rural residents in central china ethnic minorities in border regions and female migrant workers in many cities the third factor is homosexuality among chinese males jun and worth 2010 pp 1341macpherson 2008 p 40 reports an estimated 650000 plwha and an estimated 6000080000 new cases ren et al 2014 pp 267284 studied the chinese newspapers coverage of hiv transmissions over a decade 200010 and came up with the finding that hiv stigmatization in chinese newspaper was high the media labeled and stereotyped plwha and their relatives zhang 2010 pp 177194 studied the source of hiv-related stigma and discrimination in china these according to him can be traced to ideas and metaphors associated with the attitudes of government agencies news media and health professionals stigma is exacerbating the hivaids epidemic as the infected people will not disclose their status not even to their intimate partners for fear of being outcast and losing income thus health communication regarding hivaids in china is pretty negative and impedes the progress of public health shi and chen 2014 p 295 conducted a quantitative content analysis about plwha on weibo the chinese social networking application equivalent to twitter and found that more than half of the messages in the hivaids weibo group were about social support either informational or emotionalregarding the hivaids communication strategy of the government macpherson 2008 p 40 reports that china denied having an hiv problem till 2002 one month after the global aids fund was announced huang 2010 pp 47 60 conducted ethnographic studies among female sex workers in china from 19962008 and contended that health knowledge alone will not be sufficient to change hiv risk-taking behavior promoting condom use among sex workers often failed to consider the complex power relations between new sex workers from poor areas their handlers and the customers who wanted unprotected sex huang 2010 pp 5960 and the government policy which used condoms as legal evidence to arrest and fine a sex worker before 2001 the nationwide condom use in local hotels was launched in 2004 and in entertainment areas in 2006 huang 2010 p 62 this is a structural change intervention in the fight against hivaids in 2003 the chinese government launched the four frees one care program consisting of free voluntary hiv testing and counseling free anti-retroviral drugs for the poor free medication for all pregnant plwh and free schooling for the orphans of people who have died of aids huang 2010 p 94 the government also provides screening to prevent bloodborne infections and a needle exchange program huang 2010 p 94 this has been a biomedical intervention the government launched a nationwide awareness and safe sex campaign which was a social marketing communication strategy from the above mentioned stigmatization studies there is a need for more in-depth content analyses of the messages the government sent out to assess their relevance and impactsars broke out in guangdong province in the south of china in mid-november 2002 huang 2013 p 89 the mode of communication of the government of guangdong was denial and silence on grounds of secrecy huang 2013 p 90 furthermore fragmented and poorly coordinated provincial policy could not reach the higher authoritys decision-making bodies in time when the epidemic broke out the disease reached hong kong in march 2003 hung 2003 it was a success of hong kongs biomedical invention capacity that the scientists could identify the virus and a team of international experts could develop a vaccine against sars in may 2003 hung 2003 the hong kong public health specialists uncovered the flaws in the infrastructure that had helped spread the disease such as the bad sanitary drainage systems of apartment buildings that allowed mists of contaminated water to spread furtherhung 2003 p 94 reports the public health strategies as followsthe prevention and control measures undertaken in hong kong include 1 preventive education and publicity 2 tracing the source of infection 3 introducing five major control measures compulsory isolation and surveillance of contacts stopping school and university education sessions exchange of epidemiological information between hong kong and mainland china temperature checking of travelers at points of entry and exit district-wide cleansing campaigns 4 strengthening collaboration and communication with mainland china and the who and 5 developing a quick diagnostic test for sars
the sars crisis made the chinese government acknowledge that animal-borne epidemics such as foot and mouth disease swine vesicular disease and avian influenza should no longer be kept as state secrets huang 2013 p 94 communicable or infectious diseases such as plague and cholera as well as sars highly pathogenic avian influenza polio and pulmonary anthrax etc should be reported within a given period of time also capacity building among bureaucratic organizations has been established in the years since huang 2013 pp 9394as ncds are determined partly by the quality of food water and air intake the policies and measures to control and regulate food safety and water and air pollution should be analyzed macpherson 2008 pp 4243 reports there is no comprehensive environment protection law to give force to a maze of regulatory regimes and policies and no systematic attempt to promote public discussion and awareness of environmental problems
regarding food safety macpherson 2008 p 43 reports the serious lack of enforcement and unified supervision to a set standard even though china has over 200 laws and regulations on standard food safety she also reports about fake drugs in china mou 2014 p 330 studied the micro-blogging exchanges about food safety crises in china and found that the chinese government has not used micro-blogs to inform the public about food safety even though half of the online users are micro-blog users and that the authorities intervention on social media was not sufficient during the period of a food safety crisisit is important that the time spent watching television and exposure to advertising and marketing strategies are analyzed french and crabbe 2010 p134 report three explanations of a survey by ofcom the independent regulator and competition authority for uk communications industries into how hours of exposure to television programs and advertising correlate with poor diet poor health and obesity among children and adults the reasons given were a television viewing is a sedentary activity b television viewing is associated with unhealthy snacking and eating high fat high sugar and high salt hfss pre-prepared and fast meals c the exposure to advertisements of hfss food products is high moreover peers and children can influence hfss food choice by peer pressure pester power or nagging the parents for it most importantly marketing power via product promotions and special offers affects childrens hfss food choicehealth communication if planned and executed wisely can amount to more than informing people about diseases and disease prevention and cures it can alter attitudes in favor of living healthily it may to a certain extent induce positive health behavior but it will not be effective if the communicators pay less attention to the enabling polity and environment that can assist health behavior changehealth communication research in china that borrows the western quantitative analyses pays less attention to the enabling environment in which the health communication takes place the political and economic environments influence the public health policy public health during outbreaks should be transparent and timely thanks to advances in epidemiological and microbiological research which form a pivotal part of biomedical intervention disease control and prevention are possible however the examples of disease outbreaks in china show that exclusively top-down command and lack of coherent communication between and among the responsible authorities can aggravate the situation from the analyses of the public health policies of china one can see that the civic organizations were not encouraged in china to check and balance the information from the authorities and help monitor the outbreaks participation is thus lacking in the health communication process in china advocacy-communication can be seen from the social networking sites such as weibo and in microblogging mostly behavior change interventions and school-based interventions took place for introduction of vaccination and promoting a hygienic environment capacity building domestically in china and with hong kong special administrative region or with other nations in times of a health crisis have always proven to be effective law enforcement should be strengthened moral ethics should be on the agenda of media advocacy to make the citizens and government officials realize that one cannot make profits at the cost of other peoples lives and that one should not discriminate or victimize others malikhao 2016 public ethics and vigilance on any issue that affects peoples wellness and well-being should be on the top agenda of communication and public health to ensure a good

 for mhv only 70 ethanol and purell hand gel 62 ethanol produced a log10 infectious virus titer reduction factor 25 after 1-minute contact time hypochlorite 1100 use dilution was least effective producing a log10 reduction factor 1 hypochlorite vesphene iise cidex-opa and clorox anywhere spray each produced a log10 reduction factor of 25 with log10 reduction factors of 062 133 171 and 198 respectively statistical analysis using 1-way anova showed that the mean log10 reduction factors for the 6 germicides differed significantly p  0001for tgev infectivity reduction factors of 3-log10 were observed for 70 ethanol 319 purell hand gel 404 and clorox anywhere spray 357 vesphene and cidex against tgev produced intermediate log10 infectivity reduction factors of 203 and 227 respectively as seen with mhv hypochlorite exposure resulted in an infectious tgev titer log10 reduction factor 1 035 statistical analysis using 1-way anova showed that the mean log10 reduction factors were significantly different p  0001 among the 6 germicidesanalysis of the mean log10 reductions of mhv and tgev by germicides was done using the tukey multiple comparison test to determine whether reductions by individual germicides significantly differed from one another p  05 table 3
 in addition 2-way anova was used to compare 2 independent variables germicide and virus type and their influence on the log10 virus reduction factor this analysis aids in determining how much of the variability in reduction is explained by each of these 2 variables as well as potential interaction between them using 2-way anova infectivity reduction results are statistically significant p  0001 a type iii sum of squares test was used to examine variation among mean reduction results germicide had a greater influence on log10 viral reduction p  0001 than did the virus type tgev vs mhv p  0008 additionally when interaction between germicide and virus type was evaluated using the anova test it was determined that there is a statistically significant interaction between virus type and germicide type p  0001health care-associated transmission can play an important role in the spread of coronavirus infection and coronavirus nucleic acids have been found on hospital surfaces in outbreak settings7 data from surrogate coronaviruses suggest that these viruses can survive for long periods on hard surfaces potentially posing a continued risk of infection if health care surfaces are not adequately disinfected the efficacy of 6 hospital surface germicides was tested against 2 coronaviruses mhv and tgev used as surrogates for sars-cov these findings expand the available data on disinfection beyond what has been previously studied using other surrogates such as human coronavirus 229e although 229e shares some tissue tropism with sars there are important differences studies of sars patients and outbreaks demonstrated that sars-cov is also a fecally shed virus with intestinal tissue tropism 229e lacks this this may indicate important differences in resistance to environmental stressors because fecally shed viruses must be able to survive the conditions in the gastrointestinal tract including extremes of ph abundance of other microbes and bile salts this gastrointestinal tropism has played an important role in at least 1 major outbreak this suggests that surrogates such as mhv a virus with multiple tropisms and tgev an enteric virus that reflect this diversity in tissue tropism are necessarya log10 viral reduction factor of 3 has been previously suggested as a benchmark for effective virucidal activity against coronaviruses and other viruses on surfaces3 15 17 24 the results of this study show that of the commonly used hospital germicides tested only the ethanol-based germicides were able to achieve this level of reduction of infectious virus after 1 minute of contact time for mhv the 3 ethanol-based germicides 71 70 and 62 ethanol gave the greatest reduction in infectivity with log10 reduction factors ranging from 15 to 49 this was greater than the reductions observed with hypochlorite phenolic and orthophthalaldehyde based germicides these same performance trends are evident in tests of these germicides against tgev the ethanol-based germicides gave log10 infectivity reduction factors ranging from 29 to 46 greater than those observed for hypochlorite phenolic and orthophthalaldehyde germicides the phenolic and orthophthalaldehyde germicides had greater virucidal activity against tgev than against mhv however only the reductions in infectivity by orthophthalaldehyde were significantly different between mhv and tgev statistical analysis indicates that mean log10 viral reductions differed significantly based on both the type of germicide and the type of virus tested and that there are interaction effects between germicide and virus type hence both the selection of germicide and the type of virus will influence the resultant magnitude of reduction of virus infectivity titerseveral previous studies have determined that surface disinfection is an important method for preventing viral transmission from surfaces to humans17 the risk of acquiring infection decreases proportionately to the amount of viral agent present on surfaces3 this study shows that ethanol-based germicides achieve the greatest reduction in viral titer on surfaces these findings are consistent with previous studies of coronavirus disinfection but this study provides more precise estimates of inactivation on surfaces than have been previously observed with other human coronaviruses such as 229esome previous studies of chemical disinfection of 229e have been limited by cytotoxicity problems that limited the ability to measure infectious virus reduction25 sattar et al26 found that 70 ethanol reduced human coronavirus 229e dried onto a stainless steel surface by 999 this study shows that the actual reduction is slightly greater than 3-log10 39 for tgev and 319 for mhv the available data on disinfection of sars-cov itself are not extensive partly because of the challenges of working with sars much of the available data focuses on alcohols seventy percent ethanol was found in 1 study to inactivate sars by 3 log1027 rabenau et al9 reported a log10 reduction factor of 5 after 30-second contact time using 78 ethanol and 70 propoanol a reduction that was actually greater than what they observed with other germicides classified as chemical steriliants these results support the findings of this study that ethanol-based disinfectants are efficacious against coronaviruses however flammability limits the use of ethanol for spills or contamination events involving large surface areasother studies show that disinfectant efficacy can vary by virus type with nonenveloped viruses such as adenovirus differing from enveloped viruses such as the coronaviruses studies of hospital germicide efficacy against adenovirus 8 using the same carrier-based method with 1-minute contact times found greater log10 reduction factors by opa 437 than were observed in this study for tgev 227 and mhv 171 in contrast vesphene iise reduced adenovirus 8 by a log10 reduction factor of only 041 compared with 133 for mhv and 203 for tgev in this study reduction of adenovirus 8 by 70 ethanol was similar to that observed for coronavirus in this study but 012 hypochlorite reduced adenovirus 8 approximately 4-log10 greater than reductions observed for coronaviruses with 006 hypochlorite5 this suggests that disinfection efficacy may differ greatly by virus type and that nonenveloped viruses may not be appropriate surrogates for predicting the effects of disinfectants on enveloped viruses such as coronavirus and influenzahypochlorite demonstrated a log10 reduction factor 1 after 1 minute for both tgev and mhv when applied at the 1100 006 use-dilution prescribed by the manufacturer previous studies of coronavirus disinfection have found higher reductions with concentrations of hypochlorite greater than the recommended use-dilution suggesting these results are consistent with a concentration-dependent effect sattar et al26 reported 999 reduction of viral titer for human coronavirus 229e when 010 and 050 sodium hypochlorite solutions were tested with 1-minute contact times commercial marketers of sodium hypochlorite recommend contact time of 5 minutes in actual use it is likely that contact times are shorter than this and increases in concentration may be necessary to offset the use of shorter contact times the results of this study suggest that the 1100 use-dilution should not be recommended for use on surfaces with suspected contamination by coronaviruses hypochlorite is an important environmental surface disinfectant in health care without the flammability and rapid evaporation of ethanol it is suitable for large surface area spills increases in both sodium hypochlorite concentration and contact time should be evaluated to determine whether these factors would improve virucidal activity of hypochlorite on hard surfaces to achieve a 3-log10 reduction performance targetorganic matter may play an important role in the poor performance of hypochlorite on surfaces observed in this study a concentration of 600 mgl on a surface produced a log10 reduction factor 1 of mhv and tgev in this study the poor performance of hypochlorite against viruses dried into surfaces may be due to the high oxidant demand exerted by the proteinaceous cell culture medium matrix in which the viruses were suspended this results in consumption of available hypochlorite by the proteins and other organic compounds eg amino acids present in the matrix rendering it unavailable for disinfection use of viruses suspended in a proteinaceous matrix simulates the real world conditions under which viruses shed by human hosts occur in health care environments viruses are not shed by an infected host as single purified particles they occur as aggregates surrounded by membranes and embedded in feces mucus and other proteinaceous matrices together these results suggest that changing the recommended use-dilution of hypochlorite may address the problem of oxidant demand exerted by proteinaceous material such as body fluids and result in effective inactivation of coronaviruses shed from human hostshypochlorite phenolic and opa disinfectants tested reduced infectious viral titer by 3 log10 after 1-minute contact time opa is used as a high-level disinfectant for semicritical equipment such as endoscopes28 viruses can be deposited on the surfaces of semicritical equipment items during patient care these results suggest that sufficient contact time is crucial to ensure that inactivation of viruses on the surfaces of semicritical equipment items takes place according to the manufacturer the phenolic disinfectant tested demonstrated a 3- to 4-log10 reduction in viral titer after 10 minutes contact time when tested against another surrogate coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus the results from this study using 1-minute contact time suggest that virucidal efficacy is greatly compromised if germicides are not used according to label directions and contact time is shorter than manufacturer recommended contact timesenveloped viruses of great nosocomial importance and pandemic potential such as sars cov and avian influenza are extremely challenging to work with in the laboratory in the event of re-emergence of sars-cov and in the context of pandemic influenza control data are needed to guide decisions on appropriate disinfection of health care surfaces for control of viral transmission tgev and mhv are nonpathogenic to humans and easily propagated and assayed in cell culture by plaque and quantal mpn assays29 30 this study shows that these types of surrogate viruses can help expand our knowledge of practical aspects of virus control such as inactivation by disinfectants for viruses of public health importanceit also increases the available data both for disinfectants that have previously been studied with sars co-v and disinfectants that have not previous studies using sars have evaluated benzalkonium chloride and magnesium monoperphthalate-based products16 povidone iodine27 formalin and glutaraldehyde31 this current study included sodium hypochlorite and a phenolic which have not been evaluated in previous studies previous investigators have tested several types and concentrations of alcohols including isopropanol propanol and ethanol for which varying results have been observed in studies of sars the data from this study can add to existing knowledge to help clarify how effective alcohols are against coronaviruses on surfacesfour of the 6 germicides tested showed greater reductions of tgev compared with mhv this suggests that mhv is potentially a more conservative surrogate for evaluating disinfectant efficacy against sars-cov these studies should be replicated using sars-cov to determine which surrogate virus is a more suitable model for the response of sars to these germicides there is still an important role to be played by surrogate viruses especially for the evaluation of new disinfectants or the re-evaluation of use of current disinfectants such as changes in dose and contact time the available data suggest that both tgev and mhv may serve as conservative surrogates for modeling control of sars-cov by health care germicides in worst case scenariossince the advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic endoscopy of gastrointestinal gi tract and ear-nose-throat procedures which perform a wide range of aerosol-generating procedures have been the focus of significant attention with multiple guidelines and statements from different societies giving instruction and recommendation to protect both patients and medical staff from contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 infection1-4 however there has yet to be recommendations or guidance for safe practices in the gastrointestinal motility laboratory gml where aerosol-generating procedures are often performedthe gml serves as the clinical hub of functional gi diseases related investigations such as gi manometry and ph studies it also performs an array of other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures from the urea breath test to capsule endoscopy gml procedures are often performed without sedation and involve repeated nasal-oro-pharyngeal intubation during procedures causing the patient to cough or wretch which increases the risk of aerosolization and contamination of healthcare environmental surfaces hence appropriate precaution needs to be taken to minimize the risk of covid-19 to healthcare workers performing these procedures156the asian neurogastroenterology and motility association anma is the representative society for the standard of functional gi diseases care in asia anma is committed to guiding the protection and care of both patients and the medical staff during gml procedures during the covid-19 pandemic anma aims to provide recommendations for safe and good clinical practice regarding gml activities these statements are based on the best available evidence and expert opinions anma recommends that all gml strictly adhere to institutional local and state advisories and guidelines for infection controlthe current guidelines made certain assumptions that the government or local authority does not limit the running of the hospital to urgent admissions through the emergency department only we based these guidelines on the best available current evidence of covid-19 which is rapidly evolving as well as existing practices of disinfection for contagious respiratory diseases these guidelines are based on current knowledge of covid-19 which is rapidly evolving and existing practices of disinfection in hospitals while treating viral and other contagious diseases we hope to provide a reference point for gml staff from doctors to medical technologists to carry out procedures safely during the covid-19 pandemic this guideline is useful when the transmission rate of covid-19 is still high it may or may not apply to future respiratory viral infections because each virus has a unique disease patternthe anma president appointed the lead author to form a writing committee based on their expertise in the field the job of the writing committee was to review current literature and regulation regarding the activities of gml around the globe during covid-19 the writing committee was tasked to produce evidence-based statements to guide the gml staff on how to handle at-risk patients or high-risk procedures during covid-19 altogether 17 experts from around asia were invited and all of them agreed to join the writing committee the lead author and president of anma predetermined 7 chapters for development the writers were divided into 3 groups with each group focusing on 2 to 3 chapters during the writing process several online voting and discussion processes were conducted to reach an agreement for contentious issues the 3 group leaders would then resolve any discrepancies in the statements by reaching a consensus the final manuscript was reviewed by 2 infectious disease experts and then finally by 2 senior anma council committee membersmany gmls may not be adequately equipped to handle outbreaks such as covid-19 most are placed next to or near to the endoscopy suite and may not have the characteristics or requirements typical of an airborne infection isolation room aiir some laboratories have separate rooms for upper gi lower gi procedures and breath testing during the writing process and experts discussion we realized that some gmls do not perform all the core procedures for example wireless motility capsule hydrogen and methane breath test some of the core procedures are performed by other endoscopy centers or diagnostic laboratories for example urea breath test and video capsule endoscopy besides some laboratories perform research and advanced diagnostic and therapeutic procedures on top of the core tests table 1 all these characteristics need to be taken into consideration when planning workflow during the outbreak it is essential to start with triaging of patients at the registration counter with risk evaluation temperature check provision of surgical masks and hand-sanitizers patients should have a safe distance of 2 meters apart in the sitting area it may be advisable to review and revise the workflow based on new research changing epidemiology and policies fig 1 depending on the local staffing level only the absolute minimum number of staff that can ensure the running of the procedure safely needs to be present in the room splitting gml staff into 2 teams is also a good policy to avoid cross-infection and to ensure continuity of the laboratorythe sars-cov-2 is easily killed and vulnerable due to its lipid shell but it may remain infectious in aerosols for hours and viable on surfaces for days68 it is not clear if there is fecal transmission despite the finding of viral shedding in stools910 recommended disinfectants include 62-71 ethanol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite that effectively inactivates the virus within 1 minute11 procedure rooms should be regularly disinfected and thoroughly cleaned before and after routine use for high-risk patients and motility procedures full ppe should be available gml staff may also consider the use of virucidal povidone-iodine 7 gargle or mouthwash12 at the end of the day staff ensures the safe disposal of ppe and other disposable consumables and complete sanitization of the gml roominventory of a motility laboratory can be categorized into either reusable eg high-resolution manometer or disposable eg ph catheter for reusable items after use these should be disinfected and cleaned as per recommendations from the manufacturer and hospital guidelines typically for the high-resolution manometer it should be immersed and wiped with an enzymatic cleaning solution then rinsed with warm tap water and later soaked in an approved disinfectant eg cidex ortho-phthalaldehyde advanced sterilization produces irvine ca usa or peracetic acid ideally a dedicated reusable probe should be reserved for high-risk covid-19 patients however in less resourceful laboratories it is essential to document the covid-19 status for each patient performed with the probe all disposable items must be disposed of safely after the procedure and not be reusedhealthcare providers in the gml including nursing staff or medical technologists should undergo standard infection control training which includes strategies concerning infection control in gml triaging of patients disinfection policy and proper wearing and removing of ppe appropriate knowledge of infection control is fundamental to protect gml staff and patients the definition of a confirmed probable and suspected covid-19 case by the world health organization should be reviewed by healthcare providers to triage the patients standard infection control education must include hand hygiene and disinfection of equipment components of full ppe include surgical masks or n95equivalent filtering facepiece ffp 23 respirators goggles or face shields or both hair nets or hoods isolation gowns long-sleeved and water-resistant and singledouble gloves fig 213 all gml staffs should familiarize themselves with risk stratification of different patients level of risk of procedure and type of patients so that the appropriate ppe and infection control procedures are followed14all staff should undergo adequate training to wear a suitable n95equivalent respirator that has been fit-tested for the right model and size as well as optimal training on donning and doffing of ppe15 ppe training of gml staff shall include 1 demonstration of all individual components of ppe to the trainees along with an explanation of utility and proper wearing of each component 2 stepwise demonstration of the complete procedure of donning and doffing by one of the trainers or refer to online sources and 3 emphasis on critical points like performing optimal hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizer before donning of ppe and during as well as after the process of doffing fig 3-5 gml staff should also be taught regarding the safe disposal of useddoffed n95equivalent respirators and other components of ppe there should be a provision of separate designated areascubicles for donning and doffing of gml staff disinfection of the gml equipment and the procedure area should be performed before and after the procedure with recommended disinfectant11 to minimize the risk of exposure to staff and to ensure fair use of ppe only essential personnel gml physician and trained techniciannurse should be inside the gml procedure room with appropriate ppe the gml patient shall be wearing a triple-layer surgical mask all the time until it is needed to be adjusted for the performance of the upper gi gml procedure as applicablea confirmed case of covid-19 required laboratory evidence according to the world health organization irrespective of signs and symptoms16 a probable case is a suspected case with the inconclusive covid-19 test result a suspected case fulfils the following 3 criteria 1 patients presenting with acute respiratory signs and symptoms with no other known etiology and a history of travelling to or a resident in countries with local transmission of covid-19 during 14 days before the start of any symptom 2 patients presenting with acute respiratory signs and symptoms who have positive contacts with a confirmed or probable case of covid-19 in the past 14 days before the start of any symptom and 3 patients with a severe acute respiratory illness requiring hospitalization and with no other cause that fully explains the clinical presentation covid-19 can cause various respiratory and gi symptoms17 patients infected with covid-19 often present with fever cough fatigue anorexia and breathlessness a small proportion of patients also had diarrhea nauseavomiting and abdominal pain18on the day before or day of the gml procedure all patients need to undergo pre-screening and patients classified table 2 based on the following information collectedany decision to provide gml procedures for high-risk patients should be based on the urgency of procedures ideally involving a multidisciplinary team including infectious disease specialiststhere may also be issues around patient distress and medico-legal concerns in any decision to defer investigations thus decisions on complex cases should also be made by a multidisciplinary team for patients whose referral to tertiary care centers for gi motility study have been deferred or canceled systems need to be in place to keep records of this so that either alternative arrangements eg clinic follow-up radiological imaging can be made or proactively prioritize rebooking when deemed safe to resume normal activities19most gi motility disorders follow a benign and chronic course and gi motility procedures are generally considered as elective procedures and deferment is strongly recommended until further notice during covid-19 outbreak19 sars-cov-2 is presumed to spread mainly via respiratory droplets from coughing sneezing talking and being in close contact with symptomatic covid-19 patients20 transmission can also occur from asymptomatic carriers and from infected individuals with virus shedding during the pre-incubation period before symptoms develop21 furthermore gi motility disorders are often manifested by non-specific symptoms that may be confused with gi manifestations of covid-1922 the 4 american gi organizations recommended that all elective non-urgent endoscopic procedures be rescheduled to stop covid-19 spread and preserve ppe and availability of healthcare workers1 this should be adhered to similarly for gml investigations given the risks of transmission mentioned abovemost gi motility disorders also have a relatively benign prognosis data on the rationale of which gml investigations are to be performed urgently are lacking in conditions where there is a significant impact in delays of diagnosis such as pseudoachalasia23 or achalasia24 alternative methods of evaluation have to be considered first eg timed barium esophagogram for achalasia25 before deciding on the necessity of gml investigations also in the presence of alarm symptoms radiologic investigations or endoscopy should have been performed first to exclude malignancy or other time-sensitive diagnoses clinching a diagnosis in a condition such as achalasia is time-sensitive as there are implications to management as some patients can present with severe malnutrition from dysphagia and pulmonary complications from aspiration of retained esophageal content thus treatment cannot be delayed for long periods another relatively common example of a time-sensitive diagnosis are patients with overt obscure gi bleeding in such situations video capsule endoscopy is suggested to be performed as soon as possible optimally within 14 days2627 otherwise the diagnostic yield and therapeutic intervention rate decreases with longer waiting times28 also video capsule endoscopy does not involve close contact between healthcare staff and the patients so transmission of covid-19 is less likelyprevious researches have reported that the median duration of viral shedding is 20 days with the shedding duration extending at times even up to 37 days29 additionally sars-cov-2 rna was detected in fecal samples for a mean of 279 days30 therefore gml testing should not be performed for at least 4-6 weeks after clearance from covid-19 infection with clearance being defined by the center for disease control and prevention as 2 separate respiratory swabs are negative for covid-19 over 24 hours for patients whose gml investigations have been deferred or canceled systems need to be in place to keep records so that alternative arrangements eg clinic follow-up radiological imaging can be madeendoscopic procedures can lead to aerosolization and permit the subsequent airborne transmission of sars cov-1 coronavirus while there is little evidence to support the transmissibility of covid-19 during motility testing these recommendations and statements are based on indirect evidence expert opinion and consensus within the working group1 there was complete agreement amongst all members in the working group that these procedures are deemed as high-risk although esophageal manometry and ph-impedance monitoring do not involve positive insufflation like in upper gi endoscopy these tests potentially increase the risk of generating aerosols especially during the intubation process which often induces intense gagging sneezing and coughing by the patient an earlier study on the sars cov-1 coronavirus has demonstrated that aerosol generation increases the risk of infection among the healthcare workers by 466 times 95 ci 313-694 for those who are exposed to such procedures compared to non-exposed31 moreover during the procedures healthcare providers have to remain physically within a 1-meter distance from patients and this close exposure may permit transmission a study during colonoscopy found that microbial spread can be found up to 6 feet away from the patient32 breath tests including hydrogenmethane breath tests and urea breath test requires repeated long exhalation into multiple breath bags at various intervals up to a 3- to 4-hour testing period even though breath samples are collected in sealed breath bags there is concurrent exhaled air through the nose during the process of expiration studies showed that an increased expiratory flow rate was associated with smaller emitted particles which possibly less than 5 m in diameter33 various sizes of droplets can find their way into the eyes noses or mouths of people who are within proximity or possibly be inhaled into the lungs of those who are nearby therefore we propose that esophageal manometry ph-impedance monitoring hydrogenmethane and urea breath tests have a high-risk potential of transmitting covid-19though plausible there is little evidence to dictate the risk of fecal transmission of covid-19 during anorectal physiologic tests eg anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion test and treatment such as biofeedback the majority 7 out of 11 of the members in the working group believed that these procedures are nevertheless potentially high-risk for transmission of covid-19 viral shedding in feces had been reported in 38-58 of patients with covid-19 infection and can even be detected in recovered patients after hospital discharge and whose nasopharyngeal swab has become negative17 although these procedures do not involve air suctioning or insufflation aerosolization of viral particles may still occur during flatulent situations such as during straining or when rapidly increased abdominal pressure is applied these situations may result in an increased risk of covid-19 transmission through fecal-oral transmission or mucosal contact sars-cov-2 rna can be found in the tissue samples obtained from upper gi tracts the esophagus stomach and duodenum down to the rectum of covid-19 patients9 wireless motility capsule and colonic transit marker studies involve trans-nasal or trans-anal catheter insertions they are not aerosol-generating procedures and have minimal patient contact all members of the working group agree that procedures such as wireless motility capsule and colonic transit marker studies pose a low potential of covid-19 transmission table 3ppe recommendations for healthcare workers and patients as dictated by local hospital protocols should be adhered to whenever possible recommendations made in this section are based on the perceived risk of the procedure matched with the patient risk profile and expert opinions ppe and work environment recommendations for the gml personnel during the covid-19 pandemic period as stratified by the risk of patients and procedures are summarized in table 4 both low-risk and high-risk patients need to follow their respective local hospital guidelines and workflows during transfer and when in the waiting areas in the waiting lobby to minimize patient and caregiver exposure or potential transmission of covid-19 patients and accompanying persons should wear a surgical mask and keep an appropriate distance from each other the patient should wear a surgical mask until the procedure beginsif either high-risk or low-risk procedures need to be performed in high-risk patients under particular circumstances we would suggest the gml staff including the doctors technician or nurses to follow the standardized precautions and wear full ppe including masks with n95 or equivalent filtering facepiece respirator hairnethood isolation gowns double gloves goggles or face shields n95 respirator could achieve a much better facial fit and filtration of airborne particles coming from the open airways of the patients during the whole procedure in the work environment34 after washing hands thoroughly with water and an alcohol-based sanitizer we recommend all the gml staff to wear 2 layers of gloves for all the procedures and change the outer gloves whenever contaminated by the patients saliva or secretionsprocedures that are high-risk for covid-19 transmission should be performed with caution even in relatively low-risk patients gml staff should also follow standard precautions and wear adequate ppe including a mask with n95 or equivalent filtering facepiece respirator isolation gowns hairnethood double gloves and goggles or face shields to minimize covid-19 transmission risk we recommend all high-risk motility procedures or procedures involving high-risk patients to be performed in aiirs with dedicated medical equipment during the covid-19 pandemic period whenever possible or filtered with a high-efficiency particulate air hepa filter the procedure room should be equipped with a double basin sink for washing and a safe disposal area aiirs are single-patient rooms with negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas and at least 6 air changes per hour all room doors should be kept closed during the whole gi motility procedure with minimized staff entry and exit the number of personnel inside the examination room should be limited to only those necessary for essential care and procedure support once the motility procedures have finished all gml staff should not enter the vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed so that enough air changes have occurred to remove potentially infectious aerosols or droplets then the room after use should undergo thorough cleaning and surface disinfection before the next use environmental surveillance should also be conducted regularly to assess the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection35for low-risk patients who are undergoing a low-risk motility procedure which is clinically indicated after carefully evaluating the risks and benefits and where deferment is not possible it is still imperative for gml staff to take the necessary precautions to avoid potential viral transmission in the gml this has to be balanced with the local availability of medical resources and protective equipment as well as adherence to hospital protocol we recommend the gml personnel to wear a surgical mask isolation gown and gloves for personal protection while preserving the valuable and limited medical resources for low-risk procedures performed in low-risk patients a well-ventilated standard gml or endoscopy room would be adequatea recent study showed that sars-cov-2 virus particles could be found on surfaces where they may remain viable and detectable for up to 72 hours6 the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of the sars-cov-2 virus also exists1736 as the virus has been found to remain stable in feces and urine for at least 1 to 2 days13 for high-risk patients who require motility testing the procedure should be arranged at the end of the session the gml should have a detailed post-procedure disinfection planfor gastro-motility procedures performed on high-risk patients in negative pressure room a waiting time of 30 minutes is recommended for an isolation room with 10 to 12 air changes per hour ach in rooms with 6 ach 1 hour may be required before anyone including the physician staff or new patient enters the room so that sufficient air changes have taken place to remove potentially infectious particles37 however not every gml will have access to a negative-pressure rooms and hence alternative measures such as diluting the air with cleaner air from the outdoors should be considered and the room kept empty for at least 1 hour because small particles remain airborne for some time13at the end of each procedure the cleaning process of the procedure room should begin with a thorough surface cleaning to remove all soil and biofilm as reported in the american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy guideline38 then thorough disinfection of all noncritical surfaces frequently touched by hands eg bed rails and bedside tables procedure room furniture and floor should be performed with standard techniques by staff using appropriate ppe1335data on the viricidal efficacy of chemical agents against sars-cov-2 are not available therefore recommendations of the major endoscopic societies are based on studies done for other coronaviruses1338 for surface and noncritical patient-care equipment disinfection 1100 dilution of household bleach sodium hypochlorite or alcohol-based solutions are reported to be effective133940the disinfection and reprocessing of all non-disposable non-dedicated medical equipment used in a procedure involving confirmed or suspected covid-19 patient should follow the standard practice as per the manufacturers instructions and local facilities available there is currently no report that current disinfection techniques are insufficient373841the majority of equipment used during gi endoscopy or motility testing are semi-critical devices that require cleaning and disinfection with agents that have viricidal bactericidal mycobactericidal and fungicidal activity441 a previous study conducted after the sars outbreak reported that sars-cov-1 was readily inactivated by all disinfectants tested 4 hand rubs 3 surface disinfectants and a glutaraldehyde-based medical instrument disinfectant42 suggesting that current disinfectants and reprocessing protocols are adequate43 the reprocessing work should preferably be done by experienced staff with documented competency trainees and novices should not be included35however some points need special considerationreprocessing staff should be donning ppe that includes gloves gowns face shields and a surgical mask44 while there is no data to support a requirement for the use of n95 respirators or its equivalent in the reprocessing room their use should be considered especially in confirmed covid-19 cases45contaminated waste and disposables such as breath bags should be disposed of using the specific local regulations related to high-risk waste445 a separate record for collection treatment and disposal of covid-19 waste should be maintained and reported to concerned authorities there should be dedicated vehicles to collect covid-19 waste from different areas of the hospital and these vehicles should be sanitized after every trip covid-19 waste should be disposed of immediately upon receipt at facilities regular sanitization of workers involved in handling and collection of covid-19 waste should be done and they should be provided with adequate personal protective equipment including 3-layer surgical masks splash-proof apronsgowns gloves gumboots and safety goggles46 any worker showing symptoms of covid-19 illness should not be allowed to work at the facilitythe patients who were not suspectedconfirmed covid-19 cases when they visited the gml should be followed up they should be contacted preferably by phone at 7 and 14 days to ask about the development of covid-19 symptoms or any new diagnosis4134445 if any patient is suspected of having covid-19 symptoms on follow-up shehe should be guided to seek medical opinion urgently also contact tracing of possible staff who have been exposed should be done according to hospital infection prevention and control policies telehealth for follow-up may be helpful if the expertise and infrastructure is available445resumption of partial or full elective gml services are likely to be done in time-bound approach depending on the following conditions 1 the number and epidemiological trend of local transmission 2 the availability of medical equipment and infectious control gears including appropriate ppe and 3 the volume of postponed gml cases37 to date unfortunately there is no sign of abatement of covid-19 worldwide so it remains an almost impossible task to predict the most appropriate time to resume regular gml servicesthe major international gi societies have recommended performing the emergent or urgent and suspended the elective gi endoscopic procedures because of a shortage of health care resources and the risk of contracting covid-19 many gml activities similar to gi endoscopy are aerosol-generating and high-risk procedures for the contraction of sars-cov-2 infection among the health care workers can be triaged the indications of emergent or urgent gi motility tests are limited despite limited evidence the anma-gml-covid-19 position statement provided evidence-based consensus guidance on gml activities during this pandemic the shortage of ppe and testing kits may change management decisions in many areas the position statements may need to be updated due to rapid changes in the covid-19 pandemic and the availability of new evidencethe hungarian obstetrician ignaz philipp semmelweis 1818-1865 was one of mankinds great benefactors in 1847 semmelweis was head of the womens hospital in vienna austria he noted that puerperal fever was more common on a maternity ward where physicians and medical students provided care to women in labor ward a than it was on the ward where midwives assisted at deliveries ward b peripartum mortality on ward a was as high as 18 compared to only 3 on ward b5 at that time miasma bad air dirty bed linen low social status and climatic influences were considered possible reasons for the higher mortality on ward a in contrast semmelweis postulated that physicians and students were contaminating their hands while performing autopsies on nonrefrigerated bodies and subsequently introducing a fatal etiologic agent cadaverous particles into the birth canal during vaginal examination washing their hands with soap and water before examining women in labor did not prevent the epidemic of puerperal fever and the hands retained a disagreeable odor from the autopsy roomson may 15 1847 semmelweis ordered that all students and physicians scrub their hands with a 4 chlorinated lime solution after dissecting cadavers and before examining patients at that time microorganisms were unknown to be the cause of infection and semmelweis may have chosen chlorinated lime because of its deodorizing characteristic after introduction of the new hand-hygiene practice the maternal mortality rate dramatically decreased to less than 3 and remained low for years nevertheless semmelweis recommendations were strongly opposed by his coworkers rightfully although undiplomatically he denounced his unenlightened colleagues as killers and his appointment in vienna ended prematurely he returned to pest hungary where he instituted his antiseptic hand-hygiene method in 2 other hospitals reducing their mortality rates from more than 10 to less than 1 although most physicians at that time ignored his theory semmelweis opened a new era in medical science by introducing hand antisepsis in surgery and obstetricslater studies confirmed semmelweis findings about the important role of hcws hands in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens interestingly although semmelweis is frequently called a pioneer of hand washing he actually replaced hand washing with hand disinfection chlorinated lime has recently been shown to be one of the most active currently existing disinfectants reducing bacterial counts on the skin by 61 log10 colony-forming units cfu because chlorinated lime is harmful to the skin alcohol was later used as a hand antiseptic semmelweis intervention represents the first evidence that disinfection of heavily contaminated hands between patient contacts can reduce nosocomial transmission of contagious diseases more efficiently than hand washing with plain soap and water however many subsequently published guidelines continued to recommend washing with soap and water as the standard hand-hygiene practice for decades6 ignorance of scientific evidence supporting the use of an alcohol-based hand rub is difficult to explain hand washing may represent an old cultural heritage of human civilization that in the past served not only for the removal of dirt but also to deliver people symbolically from physical and moral evils5
more than 150 years after semmelweis epidemiological observations and despite advances in microbiology and infection control implementation of proper hand hygiene remains a challenge in clinical practice today recently completely revised guidelines for hand hygiene in health care settings were published in the united states by an international group from the centers for disease control and prevention7 according to these new hand-hygiene guidelines the use of an alcohol-based hand rub is the preferred method of hand hygiene in the health care setting hands should be washed with soap and water primarily when they are visibly soiled or contaminated with blood other body fluids or proteinaceous material this usually represents less than 10 of all routine patient contacts in general the hands should be either rubbed with alcohol the standard procedure for clean hands or washed with soap if visibly soiled but both procedures should not be used at the same timenormal human skin harbors bacteria usually between 102 and 106 cfucm2 during daily activity hcws progressively accumulate microorganisms on their hands from direct patient contact or contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and devices8 traditionally microorganisms residing on the hands are divided into resident and transient floraresident flora colonizes deeper skin layers and is more resistant to mechanical removal than transient flora this group consists mainly of coagulase-negative staphylococci and corynebacteria with a population density between 102 and 103 cfucm2 these bacteria multiply in hair follicles and remain relatively stable over time resident flora generally has lower pathogenic potential than transient flora and is considered important for colonization resistance preventing colonization with other potentially more pathogenic microorganismstransient flora colonizes the superficial skin layers for short periods and is usually acquired by contact with a patient or contaminated environment these microorganisms are easily removed by mechanical means such as hand washing transient flora eg staphylococcus aureus gram-negative bacilli or candida species is responsible for most health careassociated infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistancetwo fundamentally different hand-hygiene concepts exist9 hand washing refers to the application of a plain nonantimicrobial or antiseptic antimicrobial soap mechanical friction generated by rubbing the hands together for 1 minute covering all surfaces of the hands and fingers rinsing with water and drying thoroughly with a disposable towel which is then used to turn off the faucet the cleaning activity is attributed to detergent properties which result in mechanical removal of dirt soil and organic substances and loosely adherent flora most transient flora and a small portion of the resident flora from the hands plain soaps have minimal or no antimicrobial activity reducing bacterial counts from hands by 06 to 11 log10 cfu in 15 seconds 18 to 28 log10 cfu in 30 seconds and 27 to 30 log10 cfu in 1 minute5 prolonged hand washing does not considerably further reduce bacterial counts some investigators use other terms for hand hygiene such as hand antisepsis disinfection degerming decontamination or sanitizing in general hand antisepsis indicates hand hygiene with an antiseptic agent either washing the hands with an antimicrobial soap or using an alcohol-based hand rubthe alcohol hand-rub procedure involves the use of alcohol rather than water in contrast to hand washing the objective of this procedure is a more effective and rapid reduction of skin flora by killing not mechanically removing microorganisms all transient flora and most resident flora therefore the alcohol hand-rub procedure should not be confused with hand washing vigorous friction rinsing with water and drying with a towel are unnecessary instead the technique consists of rubbing alcohol onto both hands until it completely evaporates usually requiring 15 to 30 seconds because alcohol kills microorganisms only where it comes into contact with the skin the use of sufficient amounts of alcohol 3-5 ml and spreading it onto all surfaces rather than mechanical friction is crucial most dispensers deliver 15 to 20 ml of alcohol per application therefore 2 applications are usually necessary to completely cover both hands10
the antimicrobial activity of alcohols is based on protein denaturation they have excellent and rapid within seconds germicidal activity against vegetative bacteria fungi and many viruses for hand rubs ethanol isopropanol andor n-propanol are used listed in order of increasing antibacterial activity at equal concentrations alcohol concentrations of 60 to 95 volvol kill 34 to 58 log10 cfu in 30 seconds with higher concentrations having better antibacterial activity5 however concentrations of greater than 95 are less potent because water is essential for protein denaturation the presence of organic material diminishes the antibacterial activity of alcohols by 02 to 07 log10 cfu alcohol solutions are also highly effective against mycobacteria the bacteria most resistant to the disinfection process and multidrug-resistant pathogens but have poor or no activity against bacterial spores and protozoal oocysts supplementation with 1 hydrogen peroxide may render alcohol sporocidalin general alcohol rubs are approximately 100 times more effective against viruses than any form of hand washing5 ethanol has better virucidal activity than other alcohols transmission of viruses is of concern in a broad range of health care institutions including pediatric wards bone marrow transplantation units and long-term care facilities the recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars emphasized the importance of good hand hygiene once again alcohol effectively kills all coronaviruses the virucidal activity of alcohol against enveloped viruses such as influenza virus or human immunodeficiency virus is good except for rabies virus certain nonenveloped viruses such as enteroviruses rotaviruses or norovirus formerly called norwalk-like or small-structured virus may require higher alcohol concentrations 70-80alcohol solutions lack persistent activity on resident skin flora the resident flora regrows within hours after exposure to alcohol presumably from bacteria residing in hair follicles the addition of disinfectants chlorhexidine quaternary ammonium compounds triclosan or octenidine may delay the regrowth of bacteria this effect is usually desirable only in surgical hand antisepsis in which long-term antimicrobial effectiveness under gloved hands may be beneficial to date no clinical studies have addressed this issue5
proper hand hygiene can prevent health careassociated infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistance antimicrobial resistance prevalence rates are increasing in many countries around the world in the united states during the 5-year period from 1997 through 2001 the proportion of methicillin-resistant s aureus mrsa among isolates of s aureus causing nosocomial infection continuously increased nationwide from 224 to 38711 this growth has been paralleled by an increase in other multidrug-resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci vancomycinintermediately resistant s aureus and vancomycin-resistant s aureus12 the reasons for these worrisome findings are complex and not entirely clear but inconsistent isolation practices misuse of antimicrobial agents failure to conduct active surveillance cultures and poor adherence to hand-hygiene practice may have key roles13 14 for example in some northern european countries such as finland and the netherlands where a strict mrsa containment search-and-destroy strategy and the routine use of alcohol-based hand rubs are standard practice the prevalence of mrsa remains below 1 in contrast most southern european countries which have had inconsistent isolation precautions and hand-washing recommendations for several decades are struggling with high prevalence rates of mrsa 30 and health careassociated infections15
the goal of hand hygiene is a sufficient reduction of microbial counts on the skin to prevent cross-transmission of pathogens among patients it is easier to keep the hands clean than to make them clean the critical density of microorganisms on the hands needed for the spread of pathogens remains unknown it may depend on the type and duration of contact the type of microorganism and the patients resident flora ie their colonization resistance as observed by semmelweis in 1847 washing with plain soap is not always sufficient to prevent hand-borne transmission of pathogens although in most instances hand washing is probably sufficient to prevent transmission of microorganisms in some cases the use of soap and water fails to remove or paradoxically even increases the bacterial counts on the skin over baseline counts from clean hands presumably because of heavy contamination or recontamination by the soap faucet or sink16 17 in fact none of the hand-washing techniques durations of washing or types of soaps antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial have demonstrated antimicrobial activity equal to or better than that of alcohol-based hand rubs5 multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments have indicated considerably better antimicrobial killing with alcohol hand disinfectants than with hand washing and the use of alcohol-based hand rubs has been associated with a decrease in nosocomial infection rates3 5 18 19 20

table 1
summarizes patient-care situations in which hand hygiene is indicated7 according to recently revised hand-hygiene guidelines the use of an alcohol-based hand rub is the preferred method of hand hygiene in general hands should be either rubbed with alcohol the standard procedure for clean hands or washed with soap if visibly soiled both procedures should not be used at the same time the use of alcohol immediately before or after hand washing with soap and water is not recommended because it may cause dermatitis to avoid confusion alcohol hand-rub dispensers should not be placed adjacent to sinks but rather placed close to patients eg at bedside alcoholimpregnated wipes are not as effective as alcohol hand rubs and are not recommended for routine hand hygiene for hand hygiene outside health care facilities such as before and after working hours before eating or after using a restroom the use of soap and water is the recommended methodit is important to recognize that examination gloves do not provide complete protection against acquisition of microorganisms microorganisms from patients have been recovered from the hands of up to 30 of hcws who wore gloves21 22 therefore hand hygiene is always needed after glove use and removal gloves should be used only when contact with blood body fluids or other potentially infectious materials mucous membranes and nonintact skin are anticipated each pair of gloves should be used for the care of only 1 patient they should be removed immediately after caring for the patient before touching any surface and should be changed between care of contaminated and clean body sites on the same patient failure to remove gloves after patient contact may result in the spread of nosocomial pathogens among patients or in contamination of surfaces gloves should not be washed or reused powderless gloves are preferred because alcohol may interact with residual powder and produce a gritty feeling on the handsat least 1 to 2 minutes are required for hand washing compared with 15 to 30 seconds for the alcohol hand-rub technique4 in the intensive care unit where as many as 40 opportunities for hand hygiene per hour of care occur time constraint becomes the most important limiting factor multiple studies have shown that understaffing and increased workload are risk factors for health care associated epidemics23 24 in a mathematical model with 3 opportunities for hand hygiene per hcw per hour 100 adherence would result in 13 hours of hand washing per shift or 17 of total nursing time25 switching to alcohol hand disinfection would decrease the time necessary for hand hygiene to 03 hours or 4 of total nursing time in addition hcws can use the alcohol rub while walking to the next patient saving additional time and human resources importantly hcws simply cannot afford to use almost one fifth of their time for hand washingwashed hands can become recontaminated from faucets or by splashes from traps or sinks pseudomonas aeruginosa is commonly found in tap water in addition plain soaps may become contaminated during use and waterborne bacteria from the plumbing system may be present in the tap water in contrast alcohol hand rubs eliminate the risk of hand contamination or microbial dispersal into the environment because alcohol kills rather than removes microorganisms contamination of alcohol-based solutions with vegetative bacterial forms has not been reported alcohol dispensers can be reused as long as they are not visibly soiledlimited accessibility of hand-hygiene facilities has been shown to be an important risk factor for poor adherence to recommendations26 in a recent study adherence to hand-hygiene recommendations decreased with the number of beds in a patient room from 70 for rooms with 1 bed to 59 for 2 beds 55 for 3 beds 48 for 4 beds and 33 for 5 beds suggesting that the distance to the closest hand-hygiene facility is crucial27 sinks cannot be installed at locations most convenient for hcws in contrast alcohol dispensers can be placed on or between beds at the entrance to patient rooms and at nursing desks and can even be carried in the pockets of hcws28 the easier accessibility of alcohol dispensers obviates the need to repeatedly return to the sink wash hands dry them and return to the patients bedside to resume care easy immediate access to alcohol dispensers is the key element in improving adherence to hand hygiene a sufficient number of alcohol dispensers 2-3 per patient bed should be placed at bedside especially in areas with high workload such as the intensive care unitintact skin on hcws hands helps to protect both them and their patients from acquiring or transmitting nosocomial pathogens health care workers with dermatitis are more likely to harbor s aureus and other pathogenic bacteria than those with healthy skin skin drying and irritation can be avoided by adding emollients to alcohol formulations such as glycerol 1-4 silicone oils refattening agents or rehydrating agents moreover alcohol hand rubs cause substantially less skin irritation and dryness than washing with soap hand washing removes lipids from the skin whereas alcohol compounds only redistribute them however either strategy can result in dryness of the skin if skin-care products are not applied regularly therefore hcws should be advised to use hand lotions or creams frequently to minimize the occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis allergies to alcohol are extremely rare but reactions can be caused by emollients and other compounds added to the alcohol importantly to avoid skin irritation and prevent dilution of the alcohol to concentrations with insufficient antimicrobial activity alcohol should not be applied to wet skin or to hands with soap residue some commercially available alcohol formulations may change the color of fingernails other factors that influence the acceptance of alcohol products by hcws include the odor color and consistency of the productthe flash points of common commercially available hand-rub products are 21c to 34c depending on the type and concentration of alcohol5 therefore alcohols should be stored away from high temperatures and flames and containers should be designed to minimize evaporation in europe where alcohol-based hand rubs have been used extensively for decades the incidence of fires associated with such products is extremely low9 in the united states 1 flash fire purportedly caused by a spark of static electricity generated by removal of an isolation gown while the persons hands were still wet with alcohol has been reported29 to assess the frequency of fires associated with alcohol-based hand-rub dispensers a web-based survey of health care facilities in the united states was performed of 840 facilities that completed the questionnaire 798 reported using alcohol-based hand rubs none of the responding facilities reported a dispenser-related fire30 on the basis of these data the risk of fire is substantially lower than the risk of mrsa acquisition and subsequent infectionthe increasing use of alcohol for hand hygiene raises concern about the risk for emergence of resistant microorganisms despite extensive use there is no evidence that such resistance has emerged in vitro or in vivo suggesting that the mechanism of action protein denaturation or the rapid killing effect may not allow the development of resistance in addition the rapid evaporation of alcohol prevents extended exposure of microorganisms to subinhibitory concentrations of alcohol possibly reducing the risk of emergence of resistancemost of the experience accumulated to date is with low-viscosity rinses but gel formulations have recently been proposed to reduce the drying effect and irritation of alcohols potentially enhancing adherence to hand hygiene an in vitro study indicated that gel formulations had lower antimicrobial activity 07-11 log10 cfu than rinses with the same alcohol content p0131 however further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the relative efficacy of alcohol rinses and gels in reducing the transmission of nosocomial pathogens some gels may leave a sticky layer on the hands from the nonabsorbable gelling thickening system necessitating frequent washing of the hands after repeated applications of a gel formulation to date no studies of the acceptance by hcws of gels compared with rinses a critical determinant for good adherence to hand hygiene have been undertakenthe skin underneath rings is heavily colonized with bacteria but whether wearing rings results in greater transmission of pathogens is unknown in a recent study by trick et al32 ring wearing increased the frequency of hand contamination however contamination was considerably less frequent after the use of an alcohol-based hand rub than after washing with plain soap and water health care workers wearing artificial fingernails have been epidemiologically implicated in several outbreaks of infection caused by gram-negative bacilli especially p aeruginosa and yeasts33 therefore hcws should not wear artificial fingernails when involved in direct patient care whether the length of natural fingernails is a factor in the spread of pathogens is unknownswitching from hand washing to an alcohol hand-rub procedure requires a system and behavioral change in health care institutions once hcws become familiar with the alcohol hand rub most abandon the hand-washing procedure19 28 strategies to improve hand-hygiene adherence must be multifaceted and include the education and motivation of hcws the use of performance indicators and hospital management support writing new hand-hygiene guidelines alone is not enough simple training sessions for hcws should be held on each ward to introduce the advantages of alcohol hand rubs over hand washing in addition patients can be educated about the importance of hand hygiene and be encouraged to ask hcws to comply with hand-hygiene guidelines the efficiency of the hand-rub technique can be evaluated with an alcohol product supplemented with fluorescent dye and an ultraviolet light9 another way to estimate the quality of hand hygiene is to evaluate the consumption of soap and alcohol if hcws strictly follow the centers for disease control and prevention hand-hygiene recommendations the ratio between soap and alcohol consumption should be close to 110 in order to improve patient safety and reduce costs good hand hygiene should become one of the highest priorities in health care institutionsthe hands of hcws are the most common mode of transmission of pathogens to patients proper hand hygiene can prevent health careassociated infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistance factors that contribute to poor adherence to hand hygiene include poor access to hand-washing facilities sinks the time required to perform standard hand washing irritant contact dermatitis associated with frequent exposure to soap and water high workloads knowledge deficits among hcws and the failure of administrative leaders to make hand hygiene an institutional priorityscientific evidence and ease of use support the use of alcohol-based hand rubs for hand hygiene during patient care the alcohol hand-rub technique is microbiologically more effective more accessible and less likely to cause skin problems and saves time and human resources as a consequence alcohol hand rubs are associated with substantially better adherence to hand hygiene than hand washing the use of alcohol-based hand rubs should replace hand washing as the standard for hand hygiene in health care settings in all situations in which the hands are not visibly soiled

public health unlike medicine is not about doctors treating individual patients public health is about population health it is a collective social effort to promote health and prevent diseases  both communicable and noncommunicable  and disability that involves population surveillance regulation of determinants of health such as food safety and sanitation and the provision of key health services with an emphasis on prevention because private actors lack sufficient incentive and ability to undertake population-wide measures public health is a vital resource for which government is the crucial provider enabled by its police powers and its ability to regulate tax and spend the exercise of government powers for the health of its population raises ethical issues such as public welfare individual autonomy and freedom privacy and confidentiality just distribution of benefits and burdens transparency and public accountability these ethical concerns sometimes conflict pitting values against one another how they should be balanced will vary on a case-by-case basis this article discusses justifications for government action in public health the tension between individual freedom

its goal is to maximize public welfare through the protection and promotion of population health from a consequentialist point of view public health policies are justified and judged largely by their outcomes achieved by means of acceptable procedures public health measures seek to minimize harm from communicable and noncommunicable diseases from exposure to health-endangering substances and environments eg cigarette smoke and poor sanitation and from high-risk behaviors eg substance abuse and unprotected sex welfare is promoted through policies aimed at encouraging and facilitating behavior conducive to health eg hand washing smoking cessation education about the dangers of drugs and unprotected sex and establishing more healthful environments eg smoke-free public spaces mosquito extermination and adequate nutrientsin the course of protecting and promoting public health government authorities have the responsibility to ensure that public health policies themselves do no harm or at least that their harms are outweighed by their benefits public health policies are not entirely utilitarian however in that individuals are not considered expendable for the greater good the rights of individuals are important considerations in the formulation and implementation of public health measures as discussed laterthe protection of vulnerable groups is another ethical motive for public health action vaccination and nutrition supplements for example protect children from disease and malnutrition and smoking bans in bars and restaurants safeguard the health of workers who may not otherwise have the leverage to demand a smoke-free environment publicly funded health services can in principle help address the health needs of those who cannot afford private medical care or insurance such measures also may contribute to reducing health inequalities by bringing the health of vulnerable groups more in line with the general population reduction of inequalities can itself be considered an ethical justification as people with equal status eg citizenship should not suffer from those types of health inequalities that are due to morally arbitrary reasons eg birth into a poor family and other bad luckpoor health has collateral effects on an individual basis illness disability and their associated expenses can lead to absenteeism and decreased productivity that diminish income inability to pursue education reductions in essential consumption such as food and shelter bankruptcy and poverty high infant and child mortality may lead to the compensatory decision to have more children which decreases resources available for investment in health and education for each child high adult mortality leaves orphans with bleak prospects on a societal level employers and the health system also suffer economic losses from lower worker productivity and greater healthcare burdens poor population health can even be economically and politically destabilizing a particularly grim example is the human immunodeficiency virus hivacquired immune deficiency syndrome aids crisis in africa which lowered life expectancy by decades in some countries killing adult men and women in their prime productive years this is economically devastating for individual families and can potentially have larger implications if deaths cause an overall decrease in economic output the tax base funding health education police and the military would also shrink thus diminishing the perceived legitimacy of government lower life expectancy discourages long-term investment in education it also means fewer and less experienced civil servants reducing government administrative capacity low income and low government capacity create incentive for crime violence and radicalism which in turn may trigger more state repression foreign investment may be deterred by lack of productive workers and instability weak states are also more vulnerable to armed conflicts and terrorism increasing regional and international security risks public health problems can stand as obstacles to economic political and human development what can be achieved with a population debilitated and dying en massegood population health however can be part of a virtuous cycle of development higher life expectancy provides higher returns to education and human capital investment lower infant and child mortality helps lower fertility which results in greater health and educational resources available per child a healthier more educated work force is more economically productive and more capable to generate the tax revenue for crucial infrastructure and services that would further development and attract investments the connection between public health and development is less pronounced in developed countries that have long attained a high standard of population health in impoverished countries however public health is a key component of the fight against poverty generally speaking the justification for government public health action is ample it is the justifications for specific public health measures that tend to be more contentiouspublic health policies are population oriented because individual health  for example whether one is vaccinated infected a smoker  affects the health of others public health measures regulate individual behavior in order to achieve population health goals such policies apply broadly and are not tailored to specific individual circumstances they typically mandate certain behaviors eg vaccination and prohibit others eg congregating with others while infected with quarantinable diseases and sometimes take individual choice largely out of the picture eg water fluoridation all raise questions about how individual autonomy and freedom should be balanced against public health interestspublic health ethicists often invoke the harm principle which respects individuals sovereignty over their bodies and actions as long as their actions do not harm others ethicists generally agree that the greater the intrusion on individual autonomy and freedom the greater the public health benefit must be to justify the policy the public health situation that most starkly pits individual freedom against population health is infectious disease control the liberty of individuals and their right to associate with others are curbed by protocols to separate infected patients from the population to prevent exposing others isolation and to separate or restrict the activities of people who are not diagnosed as infected but who may have been exposed to infection or who may be ill without symptoms quarantinedisease control in the age of globalization has global health implications the conflict is no longer between individual freedom and domestic population health but between individual freedom and global population health as demonstrated by the rapid spread of hiv severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and pandemic flu via air travel the economic toll of outbreaks is also potentially significant losses from the 2003 sars outbreak have been estimated to run in the billions domestic efforts are an integral part of global outbreak prevention given the high health and economic stakes in disease containment the isolation of infected individuals to prevent spread of disease is fairly uncontroversial quarantine which applies to those who are not evidently ill is a more disputed practice sparking debates on its necessity and effectiveness only a small number of quarantined individuals are likely to be actually sick although rights and freedom are infringed for all individuals placed under quarantine a 2006 study by day et al suggests that quarantine is likely to be more useful and justifiable when isolation is ineffective or if disease can be transmitted asymptomatically when the consequences of exposure to others are severe fatal andor irreversible or if there is an intermediate asymptomatic period that is not too short or too longisolation and quarantine can be voluntarily observed or coercively imposed to the extent feasible public health measures should secure the voluntary compliance or participation of affected individuals allowing individuals the autonomy of informed consent the public health legal and ethical reasons for observing isolation or quarantine  and potential consequences for violating it  should be clearly communicated to affected individuals such that they have the relevant information to assess individual and societal benefits costs and risks and to make the decision to comply should an individual refuse to comply authorities should have a system in place to impose isolation or quarantine to protect public health there may be circumstances in which the urgency and gravity of a public health crisis may make a complete informed consent procedure less practicable for example an outbreak in progress of a virulent highly fatal disease like ebola may require swifter separation of the infected and the exposed from the general populationone persons infection has clear and direct negative health impact on others but public health policies also concern activities like smoking obesity and the wearing of motorcycle helmets that are arguably lifestyle choices with more indirect or minimal negative externalities smoking is an individual activity that may cause lung cancer emphysema and other diseases for the smoker but there is also substantial evidence for its harm to others through secondhand smoke illness from smoking and secondhand smoke can result in losses from lower economic productivity and greater burdens on the health system how should public health authorities weigh a smokers right to smoke versus other peoples right to a smoke-free environment do smokers really have full autonomous choice over smoking given that nicotine is an addictive substance should smokers be refused tax-funded health services for smoking-related illness to what degree should smoking be discouraged eg through sin tax or prohibited to protect especially vulnerable groups like restaurant workers who are exposed to secondhand smoke and the poor among whom smoking is more common and difficult to stopdifferent people have different answers for those questions reflected in the large variation in smoking regulations among the 50 us states and among countries worldwide such variation is also seen in laws governing the wearing of seat belts and vehicle helmets the consequences of which are confined overwhelmingly to the individual making that choice the fewer the negative public health externalities associated with particular behaviors the more paternalistic the government regulation of these behaviors policies are paternalistic when they seek to protect or benefit individuals against their expressed preferences  for example by legally requiring people to wear motorcycle helmets when they otherwise would notpaternalism comes in hard and soft versions hard paternalism interferes with choices of individuals who according to childress et al are competent adequately informed and free of controlling influences and is therefore hard to justify soft paternalism however deals with behaviors of individuals who are considered not competent not adequately informed or not free from external control to make that choice for example smokers may decide to smoke because they were insufficiently aware of the health consequences and they may continue to smoke because they have become addicted to nicotine obesity may be exacerbated by food marketing and the pricing and availability of healthy versus unhealthy foods among other factors such situations provide more valid grounds for government intervention which may take the form of education incentives eg taxes or subsidies to influence price and therefore consumption marketing restrictions and even outright bans if the benefits of strong regulation are deemed to outweigh the infringement of individual freedom a libertarian version of paternalism has been proposed by thaler and sunstein that would structure the choice environment such that people could more easily choose to act in their own best interest eg placing healthy foods at eye level in the store as a way to preserve greater individual freedomthe privacy and confidentiality of individuals are also important factors to consider in public health policymaking certain conditions and diagnoses  such as hivaids or mental illness  may carry social stigma or impede ones ability to gain employment or acquire health insurance if publicized the right to privacy and confidentiality must be balanced against the need to collect and disseminate information to achieve valid public health goals such as infectious disease contact tracing providing patients with treatment and screening to prevent transmission of diseases through blood or organ donation or from mother to childin the context of limited resources  which is always and everywhere  the question is how should resources be allocated the distribution of benefits and burdens is another ethical consideration in public health policy resource allocation and policy application should be fair extermination of mosquitoes for example should not be implemented in some communities while excluding others minority groups  such as homosexuals  should not be singled out for disease screening targeting programs and interventions could be justified if supported by empirical evidence but the costs of targeting should be weighed against the benefits targeted intervention may be a more efficient way to reach particularly affected groups and may help reduce health inequalities but it may also come with negative effects stigma may become attached to groups singled out for disease programs and the health of the nontargeted groups and individuals may be compromised if they do not receive the relevant health education and do not receive screening because they are not considered at sufficient risk where possible a universal voluntary screening policy should be implementedthe use of sin taxes to discourage consumption of unhealthful products like cigarettes is another instance of a targeted public health policy the sin tax affects smokers and redistributes that revenue to the rest of the population this unequal burden aims to discourage cigarette consumption which benefits the health of smokers and those subject to their secondhand smoke however cigarette taxes may also disproportionately affect lower income and minority individuals who are more likely to be smokers at least in the us which makes the tax regressive in practice just how regressive may depend on how the revenues would be spent eg funding other tobacco control efforts or folded into general revenues again public health authorities must balance the benefits against the coststhe distribution of benefits and the allocation of scarce resources are important issues in designing publicly funded healthcare packages what kind of services should state-funded healthcare packages include how much emphasis should prevention receive relative to treatment should resources go toward improving average health which can be done without special attention to people with special health needs or should resources be devoted to reducing health inequalities which implies greater resources to the least healthy to bring them closer to the general population what should be done about people who have exorbitantly expensive health conditions with little prospect of big improvementthe consequentialist orientation of public health and limits in resources make the balancing of costs and benefits a major concern in public health policymaking costs are weighed against benefits using methods such as cost-benefit cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses cost-benefit analysis translates all benefits into monetary units that account for direct eg medical and indirect eg productivity effects cost-effectiveness analysis shows the cost of each unit of gain in health as indicated by measures such as years of life gained or deaths averted cost-utility analysis presents costs associated with a subjective measurement unit that combines preferences for length of life with preferences for quality of life these kinds of analyses are used in the hopes of maximizing health benefits while minimizing cost the national institute for health and clinical excellence in the uk for example draws on cost-effectiveness analyses to help direct coverage of medicines and treatments under the national health servicethe use of such welfare economic assessments in public health policymaking is not without controversy for instance the us despite extremely high healthcare costs has so far rejected using such measures in health policy although welfare economic methods offer a way to maximize health value for money in an evidence-based fashion they have other implications that can be politically and morally difficult to accept these methods account only for aggregate welfare without considering the distribution of benefits and burdens they tolerate significant health inequalities inequalities may even be exacerbated for the disabled old and very sick the health benefits for whom cost-utility analysis assigns less weight due to their reduced capacity to benefit from health resources this goes against peoples intuition found in research to prioritize resources for the sicker and the more disabled even though they are less able to benefitaggregation problems can result when weighing a small benefit for many against a large  perhaps vital  benefit for a few yielding counterintuitive assignments of priority to minor procedures such as tooth-capping ahead of a life-saving surgery for ectopic pregnancy which hadorn reported from the oregon medicaid experiment in which policymakers attempted to determine a medicaid state-funded healthcare for the poor health package using cost-utility analysis welfare economic methods also treat all health conditions as directly comparable but blindness and loss of limb for instance are arguably not comparable to cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure which further suggests that those methods alone may not be sufficient to direct resource allocation efforts to include weights eg age or distribution and other modifications have not satisfactorily solved these problemsresource allocation issues go beyond healthcare because poverty and social class are strong predictors of health some ethicists also argue that public health has a role in poverty reduction and improvement of social conditions  such as housing education sanitation and female empowerment  in order to address the structural causes of ill health and to increase peoples ability to protect health for themselves and others eg more educated and empowered women are better able to secure nutrition for and prevent diseases in their childrenpublic health-related distributive justice can take on a global dimension poor countries often have more acute resource allocation problems in that they have little resources to begin with and what resources they have they must devote significant portions to servicing foreign debts because poor countries must often reduce social spending in health and sectors with impact on health in order to pay debts or to comply with loan conditions wealthy creditor countries and international financial institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund have been urged on moral grounds to forgive loans and reverse structural adjustment policies that hinder vital public spending in addition to providing more assistancebroad questions of how resources should be allocated involve conceptions of what justice and equity entail and what obligations a state has in ensuring the health of its populations  whether it should aim for a basic minimum standard or something higher within the constraints set by resource availability and the needs of legitimate state duties besides health on a global level there are additional questions about the existence and extent of duties to redistribute resources between rich and poor countries different moral perspectives eg humanitarianism human rights communitarianism and realism will have different answers for those questionsfor specific public health measures conflicts in ethical concerns will vary on a case-by-case basis but scholars have presented guidelines to help assess ethicality one example of such guidelines is the 5 justificatory conditions formulated by 10 ethicists in 2002 the satisfaction of these conditions would justify the pursuit of a given public health measure over competing ethical values these five conditions are effectiveness proportionality necessity least infringement and public justification the effectiveness condition requires the public health measure to have a good chance of protecting public health proportionality demands that the probable health benefits exceed adverse effects the necessity condition directs policymakers to show good faith belief and plausible reasons for using their proposed approach over a less coercive alternative that is to show that a given degree of coercion is indeed necessary out of all effective proportional and necessary options the option that least infringes other ethical values should be chosen and policymakers should publicly offer justification for their public health measure as well as explanation and justification for infringement in a transparent process that truthfully and fully discloses the risks scientific uncertainty and moral values to relevant parties and those who will be affected by the policy whose input should also be solicitedthese five criteria are representative of basic elements of public health ethical guidelines which also tend to advocate respect for individual privacy and confidentiality a transparent participatory public process to justify policy proposals and to deliberate the weighing of benefits costs and risks is appropriate for developing and evaluating both narrower public health interventions and more general public resource allocation allowing people to take part in the public health policymaking process can build and maintain trust in public health authorities it also strengthens agency and autonomy and gives fuller meaning to informed consent

epidemiologic data on respiratory viral infections are available in many nations and many factors have been studied in predicting outcome and guiding national policy on management of these infections respiratory viral infections cause significant morbidity and misery affecting millions of children annually worldwidealthough most infections are short-lived and managed by the general practitioner some children are seriously affected and require hospitalization 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 these viruses account for a large workload in many pediatric departments and are responsible for upper respiratory infections croup bronchiolitis and pneumoniain a study of nearly 100000 pediatric admissions the commonest childhood hospital admissions were associated with respiratory viral infections 2 chiu and colleagues 8 also described that influenza infections were the commonest assessing disease burden of respiratory disorders in hong kong children with hospital discharge data and linked laboratory data nelson and colleagues 3 found that a primary diagnosis of a respiratory disorder was common upper respiratory 301 tonsillitispharyngitis 105 crouplaryngitis 23 acute otitis media 27 bronchitischest infection 26 bronchiolitis 102 pneumonia 209 influenza 4 asthma and allergic rhinitis 165 in a recent study viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections were identified by using a broad-capture rapid and sensitive method multiplex polymerase chain reaction pcr assay to detect 20 different respiratory pathogens from respiratory specimens of 475 children hospitalized over a 12-month period for acute respiratory tract infections including influenza a subtypes h1 h3 and h5 influenza b parainfluenza types 1 2 3 and 4 rsv groups a and b adenoviruses human rhinoviruses enteroviruses human metapneumoviruses human coronaviruses oc43 229e and sars-cov chlamydophila pneumoniae legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae
12 the overall positive rate 47 was about 2 times higher than previous reports based on conventional methods influenza a parainfluenza and rsv accounted for 51 and noncultivable viruses accounted for 30 of positive cases influenza a peaked in march and june influenza b was detected in january february and april parainfluenza was prevalent throughout the year except from april to june most rsv infections were found between february and september adenovirus had multiple peaks whereas rhinovirus and coronavirus oc43 were detected mainly in winter and early spring rsv infection was associated with bronchiolitis and parainfluenza was associated with croup otherwise the clinical manifestations were largely nonspecific in general children infected with influenza a adenovirus and mixed viruses had higher temperatures in view of the increasing concern about unexpected outbreaks of severe viral infections a rapid multiplex pcr assay is a valuable tool to enhance the management of hospitalized patients and for the surveillance for viral infections circulating in the communityamong hospital admissions a small percentage of children would require pediatric intensive care unit picu support 13 14 15 16 hon and colleagues 17 reported the clinical pattern and outcome of all children with a laboratory-proven diagnosis of respiratory virus infection admitted to the picu of a teaching hospital three respiratory virus species rsv n  17 influenza n  13 and parainfluenza n  12 accounted for 86 of cases picu admissions due to influenza a were more common than influenza b whereas parainfluenza type 3 was the commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection comparing these 3 common viruses the mean age of children admitted with rsv was lower than with influenza or parainfluenza preexisting conditions such as prematurity and chronic lung disease were only present in children with rsv infection these respiratory viruses caused both upper croup and lower respiratory tract diseases bronchiolitis pneumonia extrapulmonary presentations were less prevalent and included encephalitis seizures cardiac arrest coexisting diabetes ketoacidosis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia one patient with rsv and another with influenza a died during their picu stay nearly half of these patients required ventilatory support or received systemic corticosteroids and 88 received initial broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage approximately 1 in 5 of them had nebulized adrenaline airway endoscopies or bacterial coinfections adenovirus was isolated in 4 patients and 2 both with adenovirus type 3 died during the picu stay similar findings in picu were reported 14 15 in particular influenza infection causes significant morbidity and mortality in young children 15 immunizations are recommended for all children aged 6 months to 18 years although severe forms of influenza are rare in children the disease may be life-threatening and most occur in children with underlying disease 16 during the 2003 influenza season there was an increased number of children with influenza a infection admitted to an australian picu and an increased number of deaths compared with previous years 16 the cost of influenza-related hospitalizations in children is high 13 in a united states study high-risk patients had higher mean total costs than low-risk patients and cardiac metabolic and neurologicneuromuscular diseases and age of 18 to 21 years were independently associated with the highest hospitalization costs 13the influenza viruses are rna viruses of the family orthomyxoviridae influenzavirus a influenzavirus b and influenzavirus c are the genera that affect humans 18 influenzavirus a has one species influenza a virus the type a viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the 3 influenza types and cause the most severe disease 19 the influenza a virus has different serotypes based on the antibody response to these viruses 20 influenzavirus b also has only one species the virus almost exclusively infects humans 20 and is less common than influenza a this virus mutates at a lower rate than type a and consequently is less genetically diverse with only one influenza b serotype 20 21 this reduced rate of antigenic change combined with its limited host range ensures that pandemics of influenza b do not occur 18 22 influenzavirus c has only one species influenza c virus causes mild disease in children 23 24 indeed seroepidemiological studies have revealed that influenza c virus is widely distributed globally nevertheless because the isolation of this virus is difficult there have been few reports on its clinical features 23 severe illness and local epidemics from influenza c have been reported 19 23 25 hay and colleagues 20 summarized the evolution of influenza viruses which results in recurrent annual epidemics of disease that are caused by progressive antigenic drift of influenza a and b viruses due to the mutability of the rna genome and infrequent but severe pandemics caused by the emergence of novel influenza a subtypes to which the population has little immunity the latter characteristic is a consequence of the wide antigenic diversity and peculiar host range of influenza a viruses and the ability of their segmented rna genomes to undergo frequent genetic reassortment recombination during mixed infections contrasting features of the evolution of recently circulating influenza ah1n1 ah3n2 and b viruses include the rapid drift of ah3n2 viruses as a single lineage the slow replacement of successive antigenic variants of ah1n1 viruses and the cocirculation over some 25 years of antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza b viruses constant monitoring of changes in the circulating viruses is important for maintaining the efficacy of influenza vaccines in combating diseasethe diagnosis of influenza based on clinical impression is problematic in a prospective study children 13 years old or younger with respiratory infections were examined 26 at each visit a nasal swab specimen was obtained for the detection of influenza and the physician recorded his or her opinion on whether the child had influenza among 2288 infections the overall sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis of influenza was 38 and the positive predictive value was 32the transmission of influenza can be mathematically modeled to help predicting how the virus will spread in a population 27 28 people who contract influenza are most infectious between the second and third days after infection and infectivity lasts for around 10 days 27 children are much more infectious than adults and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until 2 weeks after infection 27 29 for influenza control it is very important to investigate viral shedding and resistant viruses 29 according to mitamura and colleagues 29 viral loads are decreased after the start of antiviral agents but resistant viruses are detected in some patients influenza can be spread by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus into the eyes nose or mouth of another person through people inhaling the aerosols produced by infected people with coughing sneezing and spitting and through hand-to-mouth transmission from contaminated surfaces or direct personal contact 30 31 the relative importance of airborne droplet and contact transmission of influenza a virus and the efficiency of control measures depends on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media weber and colleagues 31 systematically reviewed information on the environmental inactivation of influenza a viruses and modes of transmission the airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments the importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more dependent on behavioral parameters than airborne transmission however the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode in the airborne route it has been demonstrated that the inhalation of just one inhalable droplet 055 m in diameter might be enough to cause an infection 31 although a single sneeze releases up to 40000 droplets 32 most of these droplets are large and will quickly settle out of the air 31 the influenza virus can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces successful control of a viral disease requires knowledge of the different vectors that could promote its transmission among hosts thomas and colleagues 33 assessed the survival of human influenza viruses on banknotes given that billions of these notes are exchanged daily worldwide banknotes were experimentally contaminated with representative influenza virus subtypes at various concentrations and survival was tested after different time periods influenza a viruses tested by cell culture survived up to 3 days when they were inoculated at high concentrations the same inoculum in the presence of respiratory mucus showed a striking increase in survival time up to 17 days bhong kong3352001 virus was still infectious after 1 day when it was mixed with respiratory mucus when nasopharyngeal secretions of naturally infected children were used influenza virus survived for at least 48 h in one-third of the cases the investigators concluded that unexpected stability of influenza virus in this nonbiological environment suggests that unusual environmental contamination should be considered in the setting of pandemic preparedness 33 bean and colleagues investigated the transmission of influenza viruses via hands and environmental surfaces the survival of laboratory-grown influenza a and influenza b viruses on various surfaces was studied both influenza a and b viruses survived for 24 to 48 hours on hard nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic but survived for less than 8 to 12 hours on cloth paper and tissues measurable quantities of influenza a virus were transferred from stainless steel surfaces to hands for 24 hours and from tissues to hands for up to 15 minutes virus survived on hands for up to 5 minutes after transfer from the environmental surfaces their observations suggest that the transmission of virus from donors who are shedding large amounts could occur for 2 to 8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues the investigators concluded that the transmission of influenza virus via fomites may be possible under conditions of heavy environmental contamination 34 however if the virus is present in mucus the virus can survive for longer periods 31new influenza viruses are constantly evolving by mutation or by reassortment 20 definitive means of prophylaxis is by vaccination in particular high-risk patients may develop life-threatening primary viral pneumonia or complications such as bacterial pneumonia 35 vaccination against influenza with an influenza vaccine is recommended for all children 6 months to 18 years old due to the high mutation rate of the virus a particular influenza vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years the world health organization annually predicts which viral strains are most likely to be circulating in the next year allowing pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines that will provide the best immunity against these strains 35 the vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains hence it is possible to be vaccinated and still get influenzain an influenza pandemic the benefit of vaccines and antiviral medications are often constrained by limitations on supplies and effectiveness nonpharmaceutical public health interventions are vital in curtailing disease spread good personal health and hygiene habits such as hand washing avoiding spitting and covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing are reasonably effective in reducing influenza transmission 36 in particular hand washing with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand rubs is effective in inactivating influenza viruses 37 these simple personal hygiene precautions are recommended as the main way of reducing infections during pandemics 36 37 surface sanitizing may also help prevent influenza and respiratory viral infections 38 alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses quaternary ammonium compounds can also be used with alcohol so that the sanitizing effect lasts for longer 39 a wide variety of active chemical agents biocides are found in these sanitizing products many of which have been used for hundreds of years including alcohols phenols iodine and chlorine 39 in hospitals quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to sanitize rooms that have been occupied by or equipment used for patients with influenza symptoms 39it is uncertain if reducing public gatherings by for example closing schools and workplaces will reduce transmission because people with influenza may just be moved from one area to another such measures would also be difficult to enforce and are often unpopular 36 when small numbers of people are infected isolating the sick might reduce the risk of transmission 36 influenza infects many animal species and transfer of viral strains between species can occur birds are thought to be the principal animal reservoirs of influenza viruses 40 phylogenetic analysis showed that nucleoprotein genes have evolved into 5 host-specific lineages including i equineprague56 eqpr56 ii recent equine strains iii classic swine h1n1 swine eg aswineiowa1530 and human strains iv gull h13 viruses and v avian strains including north american australian and old world subgroups the presence of avian and human nucleoproteins in some swine isolates demonstrates the susceptibility of swine to different viral strains and supports the hypothesis that swine may serve as intermediates for the introduction of avian influenza virus genes into the human virus gene pool 40 some strains are highly virulent to poultry and may cause more severe symptoms and significant mortality 41 42 an avian-adapted highly pathogenic strain of h5n1 called hpai ah5n1 for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type a of subtype h5n1 causes h5n1 flu or avian influenza which is endemic in many bird populations especially in southeast asia this asian lineage strain of hpai a h5n1 is spreading globally at present there is no evidence suggesting efficient human-to-human transmission of hpai a h5n1 nevertheless h5n1 may mutate or reassort into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission the exact changes that are required for this to happen are not well understood and there is a need to find better predictors of both seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza 43outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality 44 in 2009 an outbreak of influenza a virus subtype h1n1 occurred in mexico the virus is being commonly referred to as swine flu but there is no evidence of transmission from pigs to people instead the virus is spreading from person to person this strain is a reassortment of several strains of h1n1 that are usually found separately in humans birds and pigs 45parainfluenza viruses belong to the rna paramyxovirus family and are a common cause of respiratory infections in children 46 47 48 these viruses are the second most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in younger children 48 human parainfluenza viruses hpivs are second to rsv as a common cause of lower respiratory tract disease in young children similar to rsv hpivs can cause repeated upper respiratory tract infections throughout life hpivs can also cause serious lower respiratory tract disease with recurrent infection eg pneumonia bronchitis and bronchiolitis 48 each of the 4 hpivs has different clinical and epidemiologic features the most distinctive clinical feature of hpiv-1 and hpiv-2 is croup ie laryngotracheobronchitis hpiv-1 is the leading cause of croup in children whereas hpiv-2 is less frequently detected both hpiv-1 and hpiv-2 can cause other upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses hpiv-3 is more often associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia hpiv-4 is infrequently detected possibly because it is less likely to cause severe disease the incubation period for hpivs is generally from 1 to 7 days 49 the virion is unstable in the environment surviving a few hours on environmental surfaces and is readily inactivated with soap and water hpivs spread from respiratory secretions through close contact with infected persons or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects infection can occur when infectious material contacts mucous membranes of the eyes mouth or nose and possibly through the inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or cough hpivs can remain infectious in aerosols for over an hour hpivs are ubiquitous and infect most people during childhood the highest rates of serious hpiv illnesses occur among young children serologic surveys have shown that 90 to 100 of children aged 5 years and older have antibodies to hpiv-3 and about 75 have antibodies to hpiv-1 and -2 the different hpiv serotypes differ in their clinical features and seasonality hpiv-1 causes biennial outbreaks of croup in the fall presently in the united states during odd-numbered years hpiv-2 causes annual or biennial fall outbreaks hpiv-3 peak activity occurs during the spring and early summer months each year but the virus can be isolated throughout the year infection with hpivs can be confirmed either by isolation and identification of the virus in cell culture or by direct detection of the virus in respiratory secretions usually collected within 1 week of onset of symptoms using immunofluorescence enzyme immunoassay or pcr assay or by demonstration of a significant increase in specific igg antibodies between appropriately collected paired serum specimens or specific igm antibodies in a single serum specimen in particular the multiplex reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr assay can be used as a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for the viruses 50 accumulating knowledge on the molecular structure and mechanisms of replication of hpivs has accelerated research on prevention and treatment several strategies for vaccine development such as the use of live attenuated inactivated recombinant and subunit vaccines have been investigated and it may become possible to prevent hpiv infections in the near future nevertheless no vaccine is currently available to protect against infection caused by any of the hpivs 51 passively acquired maternal antibodies may play a role in protection from hpiv types 1 and 2 in the first few months of life highlighting the importance of breastfeeding strict attention to infection-control practices should decrease or prevent spread of infection frequent hand washing and not sharing items such as cups glasses and utensils with an infected person should decrease the spread of virus to others excluding children with colds or other respiratory illnesses without fever who are well enough to attend child care or school settings will probably not decrease the spread of hpivs because the viruses are often spread in the early stages of illness in a hospital setting spread of hpivs can and should be prevented by strict attention to contact precautions such as hand washing and wearing of protective gowns and glovesrhinoviruses rvs are nonenveloped single-strand rna viruses that belong to the picornaviridae family the virus is most frequently associated with common cold rhinovirus plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of otitis media and asthma exacerbations 52 53 current evidence indicates that viral and not bacterial infections are the most important respiratory illnesses that increase the severity of asthma 52 the most significant risk factor for the development of preschool childhood wheezing is the occurrence of symptomatic rhinovirus illnesses during infancy which are clinically and prognostically informative based on their seasonal nature 54 rvs have proven to be the virus most often found in association with increased asthma severity 52 with the use of sensitive rt-pcr methods respiratory viruses are found in approximately 80 of wheezing episodes in children and in approximately one-half of such episodes in adults 53 in one study rv rna was detectable in more than 40 of asthmatic children 6 weeks after an acute exacerbation 55 asthma exacerbations were more severe in patients with persistence of rv rna suggesting that the severity of acute asthma might be linked to prolonged and possibly more severe rv infections most cases of rv infection are mild and self-limited despite its high incidence and prevalence nasopharyngitis croup and pneumonia are occasionally caused by rv rvs can be transmitted by aerosol or direct contact the primary site of inoculation is the nasal mucosa the conjunctiva may be involved to a lesser extent rv attaches to respiratory epithelium and spreads locally rv does not efficiently replicate at body temperature the optimal temperature for rv replication is 33 to 35c this fact may explain why rv replicates well in the nasal passages and upper tracheobronchial tree but less well in the lower respiratory tract the incubation period is approximately 2 to 4 days 49 rv is shed in large amounts with as many as 1 million infectious virions present per milliliter of nasal washings but viremia is uncommon viral shedding can occur a few days before cold symptoms are recognized by the patient peaks on days 2 to 7 of the illness and may last as long as 3 to 4 weeks a local inflammatory response to the virus in the respiratory tract can lead to nasal discharge nasal congestion sneezing and throat irritationrv possesses various transmission modes and can infect a huge population at any given time aerosol transmission is the most common transmission mode for respiratory tract infections transmission occurs when small airborne particles are inhaled or large droplets are directly touched direct hand contact with infected secretions or indirect contact with fomites is also important patients then infect themselves by touching their noses or conjunctivae highly contagious behavior includes nose blowing sneezing and physically transferring infected secretions onto environmental surfaces or paper tissue contrary to popular belief behaviors such as kissing talking coughing or even drooling do not contribute highly to the spread of disease infection rates approximate 50 within the household and range from 0 to 50 within schools which indicates that transmission requires long-term contact with infected individuals brief exposures to others in places such as movie theaters shopping malls friends houses or doctors offices incur low risk of transmissionpleconaril is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug being developed for the treatment of infections caused by picornaviruses 56 this drug acts by binding to a hydrophobic pocket in vp1 and stabilizes the protein capsid to such an extent that the virus cannot release its rna genome into the target cell when tested in volunteers during the clinical trials this drug caused a significant decrease in mucus secretions and illness-associated symptoms 57 however the food and drug administration has not approved this drug for treatment of common cold and the gastrointestinal side effects are not insignificantcoronavirus is a genus of animal virus belonging to the family coronaviridae and the virus is enveloped with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome and a helical symmetry 58 human coronaviruses are difficult to grow in the laboratory coronaviruses primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds the most publicized human coronavirus sars-cov which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and can also cause gastroenteritis coronaviruses are believed to cause a significant percentage of all common colds in human adults primarily in the winter and early spring seasons 49in 2003 following the outbreak of sars that had begun in the previous year in asia and secondary cases elsewhere in the world the world health organization issued a press release stating that a novel coronavirus identified by several laboratories was the causative agent for sars 59 the virus was officially named the sars coronavirus sars-cov the genome of sars-cov is 29727 nucleotides in length and has 11 open reading frames and its genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons show that sars-cov is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses 60 the sars epidemic resulted in more than 8000 infections about 10 of which resulted in death 61 following the high-profile publicity of sars outbreaks there has been a renewed interest in coronaviruses for many years scientists knew only about the existence of 2 human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 the discovery of sars-cov added another human coronavirus to the list by the end of 2004 3 independent research laboratories reported the discovery of a fourth human coronavirus named nl63 nl or the new haven coronavirus by the different research groups 62 screening of clinical specimens from individuals suffering from respiratory illness identified additional hcov-nl63infected individuals indicating that the virus was widely spread within the human population 62adenovirus infections most commonly cause illness of the respiratory system as well as various other illnesses such as gastroenteritis conjunctivitis and cystitis symptoms caused by adenovirus infection range from the common cold syndrome to pneumonia croup and bronchitis 49 63 patients with compromised immune systems are especially susceptible to severe complications of adenovirus infection adenoviruses are transmitted by direct contact fecal-oral transmission and occasionally waterborne transmission some types are capable of establishing persistent asymptomatic infections in tonsils adenoids and intestines of infected hosts and shedding can occur for months or years adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year but outbreaks of adenovirus-associated respiratory disease are more common in the late winter spring and early summer antigen detection pcr assay virus isolation and serology can be used to identify adenovirus infections because adenovirus can be excreted for prolonged periods the presence of virus does not necessarily mean it is associated with disease most infections are mild and require either no therapy or only symptomatic treatment because there is no virus-specific therapy serious adenovirus illness can be managed only by treating symptoms and complications of the infection deaths are rare but have been reported 17 strict attention to good infection control practices is effective for stopping nosocomial outbreaks of adenovirus-associated disease such as epidemic keratoconjunctivitis maintaining adequate levels of chlorination is necessary for preventing swimming pool associated outbreaks of adenovirus conjunctivitishuman metapneumovirus hmpv was first isolated in 2001 in the netherlands by using the rna arbitrarily primed pcr rap-pcr technique for identification of unknown viruses growing in cultured cells 64 65 serologic studies showed that by the age of 5 years virtually all children in the netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years 64 hmpv is a negative single-stranded rna virus of the family paramyxoviridae and is closely related to the avian metapneumovirus ampv subgroup c hmpv may be the second most common cause after the rsv of lower respiratory infection in young children although infection with hmpv tends to occur in slightly older children and to produce disease that is less severe 63 66 67 68 coinfection with both viruses can occur and is generally associated with worse disease 69 hmpv has been shown to have worldwide circulation with nearly universal infection by age 5 years similar to influenza and rsv activity is greatest during the winter in temperate climates 63 66 67 most of the available data on the clinical manifestations of hmpv infection are from studies of children in whom the virus causes upper respiratory tract infections bronchiolitis and pneumonia 63 66 67 reinfections with hmpv occur throughout adult life and hmpv infection has been documented in 1 to 9 of adults each year using rt-pcr and serology for diagnosis illness is generally mild in young adults with serologic evidence of asymptomatic infection in many cases 65 human metapneumovirus accounts for approximately 10 of respiratory tract infections that are not related to previously known causative agents 70 the virus seems to be distributed worldwide and to have a seasonal distribution with its incidence comparable to that of the influenza viruses during winter 63 64 67 71 serologic studies have shown that by the age of 5 years virtually all children have been exposed to the virus and reinfections are common human metapneumovirus usually causes mild respiratory tract infection although small children and immunocompromised individuals are at risk of severe disease and hospitalization 64 the identification of hmpv has predominantly relied on rt-pcr technology to amplify directly from rna extracted from respiratory specimens treatment is symptomatic no effective treatment or vaccine for hmpv is currently available but ribavirin has shown effectiveness in an animal model 70 72the symptoms of common cold or upper respiratory tract infection resemble symptoms of influenza disease except that they are usually milder symptoms of influenza can start abruptly 1 to 2 days after infection 73 usually the first symptoms are chills or a chilly sensation and fever with body temperatures ranging from 38 to 39c 74 75 suzuki and colleagues 74 studied the natural course of fever during influenza virus infection in children and found that fever was most prominent in ah3n2 and young children secondary fever was observed frequently at 72 to 132 hours in all types the duration of fever was associated negatively with the age of the child and positively with the maximal temperature 74 symptoms of influenza may also include aches especially joints and throat extreme coldness fatigue headache irritated watering eyes and reddened eyes face mouth throat and nose 73 it is difficult to distinguish between the common cold and influenza in the early stages of these infections 73 75 but flu can be identified by a high fever with a sudden onset and extreme fatigue 75 in the subtropics influenza is an important cause of hospitalization among children with rates exceeding those reported for temperate regions 8 and influenza-related hospitalizations among children in hong kong 7 the influenza viruses are significant human respiratory pathogens that cause both seasonal endemic infections and periodic unpredictable pandemics the worst pandemic on record in 1918 killed approximately 50 million people worldwide it is striking that the spectrum of pathologic changes described in the 1918 influenza pandemic is not significantly different from the histopathology observed in other less lethal pandemics or even in deaths occurring during seasonal influenza outbreaks 19 coronaviruses parainfluenza and rsv are important viruses that can cause the clinical syndrome of common colds other viruses such as adenoviruses and influenza viruses can cause common colds but are more likely to cause acute nasopharyngitis and more severe respiratory infectionsseveral studies demonstrate the incidence of the common cold to be highest in preschool and elementary school-aged children an average of 3 to 8 colds per year is observed in this age group with an even higher incidence in children who attend daycare centers because of the numerous viral agents involved and the many serotypes of several viruses especially rv it is not unusual for younger children to have new colds each month during the winter season adults and adolescents typically have 2 to 4 colds per year a seasonal increase in incidence during the winter months is observed worldwide the most common manifestation of rv the common cold is mild and self-limited common colds by definition do not have objective evidence of pharyngeal irritation and rv is an uncommon cause of acute nasopharyngitis however severe respiratory disease including bronchiolitis asthma exacerbations and pneumonia can occur in infants and young children 76 indeed rv may be associated with more severe lower respiratory tract infection in children than previously reported particularly in the noninfluenza rsv season 76 because antibodies to viral serotypes develop over time the highest incidence is found in infants and young children in addition young children are more likely to have the frequent close personal contact necessary to transmit rhinoviruschildren with common cold are usually afebrile although temperatures of 38 to 39c may occur in younger children profuse nasal discharge can be clear and watery or mucopurulent purulent secretions are common after the first few days of illness and do not imply bacterial sinusitis unless symptoms and signs of an upper respiratory infection persist for more than 10 days without appreciable improvement 77 despite sore throat the pharynx has a normal appearance without any erythema exudate or ulceration infection occurs rapidly with the virus adhering to surface receptors within 15 minutes of entering the respiratory tract rvs preferentially grow at 32c as opposed to the body temperature of 37c and hence infect mainly the upper respiratory tractinfluenza can cause pneumonia which can be fatal particularly for the young and the elderly although it is often confused with other influenza-like viral infections such as the common cold influenza is generally a more severe disease 73 influenza is typically transmitted through airborne aerosols created by coughing or sneezing infections also occur through contact with infected body fluids or with contaminated surfaces influenza viruses can be inactivated by sunlight disinfectants and detergents 78vaccinations against influenza are available 79 80 the most common human vaccine is the trivalent influenza vaccine tiv that contains purified and inactivated material from 3 viral strains this vaccine typically includes material from 2 influenza a virus subtypes and 1 influenza b virus strain the tiv carries no risk of transmitting the disease and it has very low reactivity a vaccine formulated for 1 year may be ineffective in the following year because the influenza virus evolves rapidly and new strains quickly replace the older ones most people will recover completely in about 1 to 2 weeks but some will develop life-threatening complications young children people with chronic medical conditions and pregnant women are at risk for complications from influenza 81 82 guillain-barr syndrome can be a rare side effect of influenza vaccines with an incidence of about 1 case per million vaccinations 83 adverse event reporting rates have been reasonably constant over time and no new safety concerns emerged after review of 15 years of postlicensure surveillance data 83patients with flu are advised to get plenty of rest drink plenty of liquids avoid using alcohol and tobacco and if necessary take medications such as paracetamol acetaminophen to relieve the fever and muscle aches associated with the flu children and teenagers with flu symptoms particularly fever should avoid taking aspirin during an influenza infection especially influenza type b because of the risk of reye syndrome 84 antibiotics have no effect on the infection unless prescribed for secondary infections such as bacterial pneumonia the 2 classes of antiviral drugs used against influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors and m2 protein inhibitors adamantane derivatives 85 neuraminidase inhibitors are currently preferred for flu virus infections because they are less toxic and more effective 35 antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir trade name tamiflu and zanamivir trade name relenza are neuraminidase inhibitors that are designed to halt the spread of the virus in the body 86 these drugs are often effective against both influenza a and b 87 the cochrane collaboration reviewed these drugs and concluded that they reduce symptoms and complications 88 all the aforementioned antiviral drugs shorten the course of influenza disease by approximately 1 day and relieve symptoms to some extent 89 different strains of influenza viruses have differing degrees of resistance against these antivirals and it is impossible to predict what degree of resistance a future pandemic strain might have 90 the increase in influenza vaccinations among young children together with the routine therapeutic use of neuraminidase inhibitors has led to a decrease in the influenza-associated mortality rate 91 to determine the interventions most likely to curtail an influenza pandemic carrat and colleagues 27 and grassly and colleagues 28 mathematically modeled the transmission of influenza to predict how the virus will spread in a population these results support the stockpiling of antiviral drugs and accelerated vaccine development nevertheless neuraminidase inhibitors should not be used in routine seasonal influenza control in a serious epidemic or pandemic neuraminidase inhibitors should be used with other public health measures 88the most common syndrome that often affects infants and children younger than 6 years is laryngotracheobronchitis 92 the condition is commonly known as croup due to the characteristic croupy cough associated with infection and inflammatory of the subglottic region 92 croup is characterized by a barking cough varying degrees of inspiratory stridor and hoarseness as a result of laryngeal or tracheal obstruction 93 the condition may be mild moderate or severe and even fatal croup is most often caused by parainfluenza virus with types 1 and 2 responsible for the majority of cases 92 93 however other viral infections can also cause it 17 croup is most common in the fall and winter but can occur year-round with a slight predilection for males 92 the respiratory distress is caused by an inflammatory response to the infection rather than by the infection itself respiratory distress usually occurs in young children as their airways are smaller and differently shaped to those of adults making them more susceptible the treatment of croup depends on the severity of symptoms it is important to maintain a calm atmosphere for the parents and child most children can be managed effectively at home antipyretics should be given if the child is febrile adequate hydration should be maintained corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy 93 corticosteroids have potent vasoconstrictive and anti-inflammatory properties and can reduce airway inflammation vascular permeability and mucosal edema 93 good evidence now exists to support the use of corticosteroid in the management of severe moderate or even mild croup 94 dexamethasone is often used due to its prolonged physiologic effects the severe form requires emergency medical treatment in the intensive care unit nebulized epinephrine should be considered for children with moderate to severe croup and should be used with caution in children who have tachycardia or ventricular outlet obstruction racemic epinephrine works by stimulation of the -adrenergic receptors in the airway with resultant mucosal vasoconstriction and decreased subglottic edema and by stimulation of the -adrenergic receptors with resultant relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle randomized studies comparing racemic epinephrine with either placebo or no treatment have shown significant improvements in croup scores in the treated patients over controls 95 the simultaneous use of corticosteroid helps to reduce the rebound phenomenon associated with the use of epinephrine and obviates the need for hospitalization 93 children who have moderate or severe croup with blood oxygen saturation of less than 92 should receive oxygen antibiotics have no value children with moderate to severe croup are hospitalized for observation intubation is rarely needed 17bronchitis is a common disease in the adult population but is less frequently described in children bronchitis is usually due to common viral infections but can occasionally be complicated by secondary bacterial infections jartti and colleagues 96 detected metapneumovirus by pcr in 10 8 of 132 consecutive children admitted to turku hospital finland for acute expiratory wheezing median age 7 months range 425 months the mean duration of hospital stay was 25 days standard deviation 16 and mean duration of respiratory symptoms was 19 days the white blood cell count c-reactive protein and rantes regulated on activation normal t-expressed and secreted cytokine concentrations in nasal secretion remained low whereas interleukin-8 concentrations in nasal secretion were high human metapneumovirus is a clinically important causative agent of acute wheezing in young children 96 smuts and colleagues 97 evaluated the role of the novel respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus hmpv human coronavirus nl63 hcov nl63 and human bocavirus hbov in wheezing illness in children consecutive children presenting with acute wheezing to a pediatric hospital from may 2004 to november 2005 were prospectively studied a nasal swab was taken for rt-pcr and pcr for hmpv hcov nl63 and hbov when positive the genes were sequenced shell vial culture for rsv influenza a and b viruses adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1 2 and 3 was performed on every fifth sample two hundred and forty-two nasal swabs were collected from 238 children median age 124 months a novel respiratory virus was found in 44 of 242 182 hmpv hbov and hcov nl63 was found in 20 83 18 74 and 6 24 of samples respectively fifteen of 59 25 samples were positive for other respiratory viruses viral coinfections occurred in 6 of 242 25 viruses are an important cause of wheezing in preschool children hmpv hcov nl63 and hbov are less common than the usual respiratory pathogens 97the term usually refers to acute viral bronchiolitis of infancy in temperate climates bronchiolitis is most frequently seen during winter and early spring in tropical countries the disease occurs more frequently during the rainy season 98 bronchiolitis is most commonly caused by rsv or human pneumovirus 1 4 other common respiratory viruses that may also cause the same clinical entity include metapneumovirus influenza parainfluenza coronavirus adenovirus and rhinovirus 66 coryza mild cough fever lethargy and decreased appetite are common at the onset of illness this then progresses to noisy raspy breathing and wheezy cough physical examination is characterized by prolonged expiratory phase wheezing tachypnea dyspnea intercostal retractions hyperresonance on chest percussion and tachycardia 98 the diagnosis is usually made by clinical examination in ambulatory settings chest radiography is not routinely indicated but may sometimes be useful to exclude pneumonia testing for specific viral cause such as rsv by nasopharyngeal aspirate can be performed but the testing usually has little effect on management identification of rsv-positive patients can be helpful for disease surveillance patient cohorts in hospital wards to prevent cross-infection and reducing the need for other unnecessary diagnostic proceduresrespiratory complications are common in infants with severe rsv bronchiolitis which include apnea and hypoxemia 98 children with rsv bronchiolitis in early life are at increased risk of developing asthma later in childhood although the association is lost by 13 years of age 99 100there is no effective specific treatment for bronchiolitis therapy is primarily supportive frequent small feeds are encouraged to maintain hydration as evidenced by good urine output and sometimes oxygen may be required to maintain blood oxygen levels suction of the nasopharynx to remove excessive secretions is often performed to maintain a clear airway in severe cases nasogastric tube feeding or intravenous fluids are required in extreme cases mechanical ventilation might be necessary kellner and colleagues 101 102 performed a meta-analysis of bronchodilator therapy in infants with bronchiolitis and reported that bronchodilators produced a modest short-term improvement in clinical scores the rate and duration of hospitalization however were not affected by bronchodilator therapy the investigators concluded that routine use of bronchodilators in those who wheeze for the first time is not justified given the modest short-term clinical improvement along with the high cost of the medication in theory epinephrine has an added advantage over 2-adrenergic selective bronchodilators because its -adrenergic component may diminish catarrhal secretions and mucosal edema of the airway a meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials that included inhaled or systemic epinephrine as one of the bronchodilators showed that epinephrine may be favorable to salbutamol and placebo among outpatients with bronchiolitis 103 however there is insufficient evidence to support its use for the treatment of bronchiolitis among inpatients because some children will respond to bronchodilators if bronchodilators are to be tried careful clinical evaluation of the response to the first few doses must be made in order for a decision to be made about continuance or discontinuance of the medication a recent multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial that included 800 infants with bronchiolitis seen in the emergency department suggests that combined therapy with dexamethasone and epinephrine may significantly reduce the rate of hospital admission 104 the use of ribavirin in treating rsv infection is controversial ribavirin is used sometimes for infants with preexisting lung heart or immune disease 105 106 107 108 the american academy of pediatrics has recommended that decisions about ribavirin administration should be made based on the particular clinical circumstances and physicians experience 109 antibiotics are usually not indicated in uncomplicated bronchiolitis 110 111 nevertheless thorburn and colleagues 112 found that up to 40 of children with severe rsv bronchiolitis requiring admission to the picu were infected with bacteria in their lower airways and were at increased risk for bacterial pneumonia in general prevention of bronchiolitis relies on measures to reduce the spread of the viruses that cause respiratory infections such as hand washing and avoiding exposure to those symptomatic with respiratory infectionspremature infants and others with certain major cardiac and respiratory disorders may benefit from passive immunization with palivizumab a monoclonal antibody against rsv palivizumab is administered intramuscularly at a dosage of 15 mgkg monthly beginning just before the onset of the rsv season for a total of 5 months as recommended by the american academy of pediatrics for prophylaxis in high-risk children 109 113 the use of palivizumab in asian cities with no winter or definite seasonality is controversialrisk factors for bronchiolitis deaths in the united states have been described and multiple cause-of-death and linked birthinfant death data for 1996 through 1998 were used to examine bronchiolitis-related infant deaths 114 risk factors were assessed by comparing infants who died with bronchiolitis and surviving infants during 1996 through 1998 there were 229 bronchiolitis-related infant deaths resulting in an average annual infant mortality rate of 20 per 100000 live births the majority 55 of infant deaths occurred among infants younger than 3 months the bronchiolitis mortality rate was highest among infants weighing less than 1500 g at birth very low birth weight vlbw as compared with infants weighing 1500 to 2499 g low birth weight lbw and 2500 g or heavier at birth 298 64 and 13 per 100 000 live births respectively vlbw and lbw infants remained at an increased risk of dying of bronchiolitis after controlling for other risk factors other risk factors included increasing birth order low 5-minute apgar score young maternal age unmarried mother and tobacco use during pregnancy the investigators concluded that vlbw and lbw infants are at increased risk of dying of bronchiolitis 114leader and colleagues 115 provide current estimates of the incidence associated risk factors and costs of severe rsv infections among infants in the united states defined as emergency department visits hospitalization and death between 1997 and 2000 there were 718008 emergency department visits by infants with lower respiratory infection diagnoses during the rsv season 2281000 and 29 were admitted costs of emergency department visits were approximately us202 million rsv bronchiolitis was the leading cause of infant hospitalization annually total hospital charges for rsv-coded primary diagnoses during the 4 years were more than 26 billion an estimated 390 rsv-associated postneonatal deaths occurred in 1999 low birth weight and prematurity significantly increased rsv-associated mortality rates the investigators concluded that rsv is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality severe rsv is highest among infants of black mothers and medicaid-insured infants prematurity and low birth weight significantly increase rsv mortality ratesadmission criteria for bronchiolitis can be derived based on the severity of the disease 116 a clinical score is useful in the evaluation and grading of bronchiolitis severity 117 clinical deterioration requiring picu admission is an uncommon occurrence in previously healthy infants admitted to a general pediatric inpatient unit with rsv infection extreme tachypnea and hypoxemia are both associated with subsequent deterioration however only a small proportion of patients who clinically deteriorate present in this way the clinical usefulness of these parameters therefore is limited 118 adequate oxygen saturations should be maintained to avoid hypoxia 119 chest physiotherapy using vibration and percussion techniques does not reduce length of hospital stay oxygen requirements or improve the severity clinical score in infants with acute bronchiolitis 120 121 the course of rsv disease is variable in an east denmark study the clinical course was milder than reported elsewhere possibly as a result of the low prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in denmark 5 however rsv constitutes a considerable burden to the danish pediatric health care system and the investigators suggest that prophylaxis against rsv is desirable 5severe forms of respiratory viral infections are rare in children but may lead to life-threatening conditions such as severe pneumonia necessitating picu admission and occasionally resulting in death 17 122 community-acquired pneumonia cap is a significant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide viral etiology is most common in young children 68 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 in cap viral coinfection especially rsv human bocavirus rhinovirus human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses ranges between 282 and 688 children with viral coinfection more frequently require hospital admission than those with single viral infection suffice to say viral coinfections are frequent in children younger than 3 years with cap and can be a poor prognostic factor 130 although a possible microbial cause is identified in less than half of the patients clinical findings and results of blood cultures chest radiographs and white blood cell and differential counts usually do not distinguish patients with a defined cause from those without a known cause for pneumonia 124 128 129 131 132 children with typical bacterial or mixed bacterialviral infections have the greatest inflammation and disease severity michelow and colleagues 133 evaluated consecutive immunocompetent children hospitalized with radiographically confirmed lower respiratory infections from january 1999 through march 2000 one hundred and fifty-four hospitalized children with lower respiratory infections were enrolled median age was 33 months range 2 months to 17 years a pathogen was identified in 79 of children typical respiratory bacteria were identified in 60 of which 73 were streptococcus pneumoniae viruses in 45 mycoplasma pneumoniae in 14 chlamydia pneumoniae in 9 and mixed bacterialviral infections in 23 multivariate logistic-regression analyses revealed that high temperature 384c within 72 hours after admission and the presence of pleural effusion were significantly associated with bacterial pneumonia 133oxygen therapy is life-saving and should be given when oxygen saturation is less than 92 127 antimicrobials are often used to cover for possible coinfections with bacteria 124 128 134 135 mechanical ventilation is often required for respiratory failure 17 125 death is uncommon 17 125 136hand hygiene through washing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub is highly effective in reducing influenza a virus on human hands 37 appropriate hand hygiene may be an important public health initiative to reduce pandemic and influenza transmission influenza immunization can be given to children as young as 6 months there is no vaccine available for parainfluenza adenovirus rhinovirus or metapneumovirus rsv prophylaxis is available but expensiveone of the clinical problems facing pediatric intensivists is the differentiation between viral and bacterial infections when an acutely ill child with or without respiratory manifestations is admitted an empirical course of antibiotics is often used in the initial management to avoid missing any treatable bacterial coinfections 17 a low threshold for negative-pressure reverse isolation should be considered whenever possible so that other critically ill patients are not put at risk rapid diagnosis of respiratory viral infections in children is important as prompt diagnosis results in significantly reduced hospital stays antibiotic use and laboratory use 137upper airway obstruction in croup is usually caused by the parainfluenza virus however influenza may be more common than parainfluenza in causing croup in the picu 17 in lower respiratory disease such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia radiographic abnormalities are often present rendering differentiation from bacterial infections and coinfections difficult 10 sometimes parenchymal involvement as evidenced by abnormal radiography is more common with rsv than influenza infection 17 as it is often difficult to delineate viral from bacterial infection in the acute setting initial broad-spectrum antibiotics are used in the majority of patients to cover for pneumonia and sepsis 138 139 antibiotics can be discontinued when viral studies are positive and the patients have stabilizedin one study the mortality potentially attributable to the 4 respiratory viruses rsv influenza parainfluenza and adenovirus was low during the picu stay 17 adenovirus was notorious in its preponderance in causing severe diseases like encephalitis bronchiolitis obliterans and myocarditis in the series of hon and colleagues 17 2 of the 4 patients with adenovirus died during their picu stay three of the patients had the serotype 3 which is known to be able to cause severe respiratory infection 140 bacterial coinfections were often present and included various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria cultured in the tracheal aspirate urine or blood 17 the most common organism was streptococcus pneumoniaeextrapulmonary manifestations of viral infection are an important cause of morbidity and range from seizures to cardiac arrest 141 142 143age is an important demographic factor among the 3 respiratory viruses rsv infections in particular can cause significant morbidity and mortality in young children chronic lung disease and prematurity have been found to be associated with infection with the rsv virus 144 145 146 147monthly intramuscular injection of palivizumab has been advocated in patients vulnerable to rsv infections 5 148 149 universal influenza vaccination of children older than 6 months may help prevent infection by influenza and is now recommended in the united states 11 15respiratory viral infections leading to picu admissions may lead to significant morbidity and mortality 17 presentation can be pulmonary and extrapulmonary prompt diagnosis will ensure that the appropriate treatment such as corticosteroid for croup can be instituted as soon as possible vaccination of the high-risk groups may help to prevent infection and icu admissionthe causes of severe childhood respiratory virus infections are heterogeneous and the infections may at time be life-threatening many of these respiratory viral infections share similar symptomatology and occasionally cause outbreaks and severe respiratory disease the misleading abbreviation sars was coined in 2003 150 the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome was based on a clinical definition in that patients who had fever respiratory symptoms not necessarily severe and with an epidemiologic link were considered to have sars patients clinically diagnosed to have sars may or may not have sars-cov 150 151 overdiagnosis may lead to stigmatization and inconvenience in the workplace or at school in contrast underdiagnosing the condition may lead to the disease being unrecognized and the potential for the pathogen to spread in the community imprecise definition therefore carries serious public health consequences in fact the clinical features of many patients with sars were neither severe nor respiratory in nature 150 many new surveillance guidelines and confusing abbreviations appeared a new abbreviation ili was introduced to mean influenza-like illness the definitions for many of these abbreviations are nearly identical if not the same as the clinical definition of sars ie contact  fever  respiratory symptomatology  other symptoms this can cause unnecessary confusion indeed the only difference between ili influenza avian flu swine flu and sars is the virus applying the initial clinical definition of sars to avian or swine influenza these patients all had sars because their symptoms and epidemiologic links were just like sars 150 152 however the term sars is no longer used unless sars-cov is isolated from the patient regardless of whether severe respiratory symptoms and epidemiologic links are present outbreaks of severe acute respiratory infections with epidemiologic links will occur from time to time although sars-cov is out and may never come back the sars concept of index surveillance and epidemiologic and prognostication studies for severe respiratory viral infections is here to stay sars is very much alive among us 150 152by the time youre reading this much will have transpired thats the story with the exponential spread of an infection across the globe it all happens so faston december 31 2019 the health commission of hubei province peoples republic of china announced a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia the virus was isolated its genome was sequenced and it was identified as the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on february 11 2020 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses defined the virus as acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 with the associated respiratory disease covid-19 co-rona vi-rus d-isease 2019 the covid-19 pandemic brought unique challenges to the global healthcare community with rapid escalation of the number of affected individuals and associated mortality over a handful of weeks clinical and public health guidance has tried to minimize the potential health impact using the best available scientific advice and evidence to inform decision making to help contain the virus delay its spread and mitigate its effect on those infected with it countries have adopted their own timing of risk-reduction strategies reflecting their differential risk assessments with italy having the largest number of affected cases outside of china the impact and reorganization of clinical services that have been required by italy will likely be faced by those around the globe in the weeks ahead given the anticipated trajectory of covid-19the covid-19 epidemic in italy started on january 30 when two tourists tested positive an outbreak was subsequently detected in a few patients in lombardy on february 21 which quickly became 60 patients the next day as of march 17 2020 there were 31506 positive cases from the 148657 swabs tested with 2941 people who have fully recovered since testing positive and 2503 who died among the measures to contain the infection as early as february 11 municipalities had been quarantined nobody could enter and leave those territories following the expansion of the areas with confirmed infection the area of limitation of human activities was extended to various northern regions including lombardy emilia and veneto and from march 9 the entire country with 60 million citizens was placed in lockdownthe societal and economic impact of these changes at this time is too large to assess all schools are closed requiring childcare to be provided at home social and professional meetings are cancelled public spaces closed the mobility of people is restricted to only attend work or for health reasons and many businesses are closed including all restaurants and entertainment venues these measures are combined with existing recommendations from the world health organisation for people to wash their hands frequently avoid touching their eyes nose and mouth by covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and disposing of the tissue immediately and washing hands keeping an interpersonal distance of at least one meter avoiding gatherings and using a surgical mask in the presence of people suspected of being sick the primary aim of these measures is to flatten the growth curve of new cases thereby reducing the number of people who will simultaneously require intensive care as well as the overall mortality as of march 11 2020 1028 of the approximately 5200 intensive care beds within italy were already occupied with covid-19 patients 1 parallel to these governmental directives the ministry of health implemented extensive reorganization of national healthcare services to facilitate the treatment of the large numbers of patients who will need intensive support therapyprofessional bodies including the american college of obstetrics and gynecology acog 2 and the british royal college of obstetricians  gynaecologists rcog 3 have provided specific guidance for pregnant women based on very limited data and experience with prior coronaviruses including sars-cov and mers-cov compared with the general population pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe illness morbidity or mortality and adverse perinatal outcomes including preterm birth 4 5 there is little historical information available for women considering pregnancy or embarking on assisted conception given the modelling of the pandemic including the time to peak and subsequent tail considerable delays in conception to substantially mitigate risk may be required which will inevitably impact overall success ratesreproductive medicine units in italy that continue to offer clinical treatments necessitate specific changes to their organization these include strict adherence to the generic health precautions with clearly visible signs within the clinics at the entrance and throughout the clinics including private spaces to remind patients of these general measures exposure by scheduled in-person meetings may be reduced by cancelling attendance and all staff are to consider personal risk when commuting all non-essential visits by external businesses or academic collaborators are to be avoided and replaced by telecommunications and online platforms patient informational events may be held via webinars outpatient consultations can be moved to a telemedicine model where feasible with strict adherence to scheduled appointments for ultrasounds and lab tests to reduce waiting room exposure coupled with a request to patients to attend alone and to wait outside in their own vehicle until the scheduled appointment to reduce overall risk of transmission working agendas are altered to reduce the sharing of common spaces by staff including the creation of shift teams to reduce the risk that the whole clinic staff is affected and required to self-isolate managerial administrative and it staff are similarly to be moved to a rotational schedule to reduce the risk of all being infected simultaneously access to common areas of the clinic is strictly limited with deliveries made outside at specific entrances all staff must be trained in the processes and protocols for dealing with covid-19 cases and the use of general precautions and certified particulate filtering face masks to reduce transmission should the team members themselves present with respiratory symptoms the italian authorities have mandated that if accompanied by a fever they are required to abstain from workfor patients it is very useful to develop a written multi-lingual summary of the scientific evidence of pregnancy with the coronavirus including frequently asked questions which align with international guidance and are under daily review that is available both online and within the clinics patients are screened by telephone prior to attendance and instructed not to come to the clinic and to postpone their treatment if they are suspected to have an acute respiratory infection with at least one of the following symptoms fever cough dyspnea or they were in the previous 14 days in a country with community transmission of the virus according to the cdc or in close contact with a confirmed case of covid-19 or have been in a hospital where covid-19 patients were hospitalized websites must be updated with the most recent available information and links when entering the clinic patients are again interviewed regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or at-risk behaviorshould medical staff suspect that a patient has covid-19 a strict protocol is invoked the healthcare staff isolate the patient in a designated insulated room and wear the following protective health equipment a waterproof gown viral particulate-filtering face mask eye protection and double gloves the patient is also provided with a face mask decisions are made based on the stage of medically assisted reproduction therapy if the patient is positive during ovarian stimulation the optimal solution is to cancel the cycle if the patient has already had oocyte retrieval then cryostorage of oocytes or embryos will be undertaken with avoidance of embryo transfer until the patient is proven disease-free due to the risks of further disease deterioration particularly during pregnancy on completion of the consultation and the explanation that treatment will be deferred the patient is transported outside the clinic using a predetermined route to minimize the possible exposure of health personnel other patients and visitors all rooms and areas are then carefully sanitized using an alcohol-based disinfectant containing  75 alcohol or 5 chlorine after use the disposable protective devices are carefully removed folded in on themselves with hand sanitization with alcohol gel at each stage of removal before final disposal in an appropriate container for infected waste the patient is then directed to the appropriate regional or national centerfor patients receiving ovarian stimulation mitigation of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is grave as covid-19 infection in a woman experiencing the hypovolemic and electrolyte imbalance typically associated with the syndrome may lead to an amplified risk of lung and kidney complications consequently the use of mild stimulation gnrh antagonist control of the luteinizing hormone lh surge gnrh agonist triggering and single embryo transfer or freeze-all are the first choice in this period for women entering in vitro fertilizationthe italian authorities have mandated that even in the absence of evidence of transmission of the virus within reproductive cells all donors should be interviewed regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms and for recent travel to high-risk areas for donors who have returned from an area at risk a 2-week suspension is required and in the case of respiratory symptoms a 2-week suspension from the end of symptoms is necessitated as compared to the 28-day period recommended by the joint united kingdom blood transfusion and tissue transplantation services professional advisory committee jpac for homologous fertility treatments there are no specific regulatory restrictions except for patients with symptoms in progress suggestive for covid-19 with separate closed cryostorage systems when importing gametes from abroad an additional declaration is required from the sending center indicating that the risks of sars-cov-2 infection for the specific donor have been assessed the declaration is necessary only for new donations and not for material cryopreserved prior to the sars-cov-2 outbreak patients are advised not to pursue fertility tourism due to the strict travel bans in placewe have described how italy was consumed by the covid-19 pandemic and how we adapted our reproductive medical system to its challenges its a moving target and our processes will continue to adjust other countries will face this threat and we hope that others can learn from our experience on march 15 2020 the european society of human reproduction and embryology eshre published a statement recommending a precautionary approach that all fertility patients considering or planning treatment even if they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for covid-19 infection should avoid becoming pregnant at this time for those patients already having treatment it is suggested to consider deferring pregnancy with oocyte or embryo freezing for later embryo transferon march 17 2020 the american society for reproductive medicine asrm issued guidance for patient and clinical management during the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic key recommendations were to 1 suspend initiation of new treatment cycles including ovulation induction intrauterine inseminations iuis in vitro fertilization ivf including retrievals and frozen embryo transfers as well as non-urgent gamete cryopreservation 2 strongly consider cancellation of all embryo transfers whether fresh or frozen 3 continue to care for patients who are currently in-cycle or who require urgent stimulation and cryopreservation 4 suspend elective surgeries and non-urgent diagnostic procedures and 5 minimize in-person interactions and increase utilization of telehealth recognizing that the situation is highly fluid this guidance would be revisited periodically as the pandemic evolvescovid-19 is an unprecedented challenge to our healthcare systems italy was the first in line after china to experience the explosion in infections from this pandemic as we write this the united states is close behind with an infection incidence mirroring that of italy and with a time shift of approximately a week and a half the federal government has declared a national emergency and many states and cities are implementing measures like cancellations of entertainment and sporting events and closures of schools bars and restaurants but there is as yet no fully coordinated response we fear the worst is yet to come and in parts of the world for example mexico with its population approximately twice that of the united kingdom at the time of this writing no substantial measures are underway it is likely that we are only at the beginning of this pandemicwe must learn from our experiences what italy is doing in reproductive medicine may not be enough but taking action is the first step and communicating it to the world community is the second educating ourselves with the experiences of our colleagues around the world is critical at fertility and sterility weve created a virtual real-time conversation in our dialog where doctors and scientists can share what theyre learning about covid-19 and reproductive medicine please

 mindfulness may not be a term usually associated with personal protective equipment ppe but it is a useful concept for the discussion of putting together layer by layer the protective barriers that allow the safe provision of care for patients with highly hazardous communicable diseases each piece of the full ppe ensemble will have limitations that must be understood by the wearer close and careful attention to behaviors in the patient care environment becomes good ppe etiquette donning or putting on ppe carefully and fully before attending to a patients needs is fundamental but not intuitive doffing or removing ppe is a high-risk procedure that can be performed safely with practice coaching and observation mitigating risk depends on awareness to all areas of potential contamination and a mindful approach to delivering safe patient carethe recommendations concerning ppe for healthcare workers hcws have evolved in fits and starts frequently prompted by outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and emerging pathogens such as hiv it is inconceivable to many current healthcare workers that disposable glove use was neither mandatory nor recommended until the 1970s 1 the recommendations for isolation ppe use and hand hygiene have continued to change as recently as the ebola virus disease evd outbreak of 20142016from the time it was recognized that germs could cause disease ways to avoid those germs have been sought barrier methods including early gloves made of sheep intestines were the beginning of personal protective devices aimed to provide a boundary isolating the healthcare provider from some aspect of the patient thought to be infected such as a wound 2 isolating patients is another means of separating hcws from potentially infectious patients as the understanding of pathogens and transmissibility has evolved so has the use of isolation and barriers for protectionthe categories for isolation correspond to the type or portion of a patient that requires some barrier method for instance gloves for wound care in the 1970s become gloves for all blood and bodily fluids by the 1980s table 141patients themselves are not the only source of risk for healthcare workers as early as the 1500s it was recognized that surfaces and materials that had contact with patients or their body fluids could also serve to spread disease from patient to patient and from patient to staff 3 a fomite is any article or surface that can harbor pathogens the length of time a pathogen can remain viable on such surfaces is highly variable from minutes to hours and days all surfaces within the patient care environment including bed linens walls and floors can be potential sources for contaminationthe method by which a person is inoculated inadvertently by a pathogen can be either through direct or indirect contact direct inoculation occurs when infective blood or body substance comes in contact with another persons mucous membranes or broken skin indirect inoculation occurs when contact is first made with a contaminated intermediary and then into the eyes nose mouth or non-intact skin 1 the goal of all ppe is to prevent direct inoculation adherence to ppe etiquette and a doffing protocol serves to minimize the potential for indirect inoculationprotective equipment from the early gloves to n95 masks and new impervious surface gowns has become a routine part of working inside western healthcare facilities it is easy to assume that what is common is also simple and that assumption has been extended to ppe use it is common in the hospital setting to assume healthcare workers are proficient in all aspects of ppe the use of ppe by healthcare workers came under scrutiny during the west african outbreak of evd in 20142016 concerns were raised about the readiness to treat patients with highly hazardous communicable diseases within us hospitals 4 while caring for patients in isolation is something that us healthcare workers do every day that familiarity does not assure competencymultiple studies conducted before and since the ebola outbreak confirm that contamination to the wearer can occur even with careful use of ppe 5 6 while healthcare workers may believe that adding more layers and items to their ppe ensemble increases their safety this has not been demonstrated to be true 7 in caring for patients with highly hazardous communicable diseases risks are mitigated with information about disease transmission the choice of the right ppe ensemble training and practice and the use of trained observers the margin for error is small inside biocontainment units it must be recognized by all team members that violations of infection control protocols including ppe use and etiquette can negate the compliant work of others and put everyone at risk 8in examining the makeup of a ppe ensemble the advantages and the liabilities of each piece will be examined ppe etiquette or good form will be evaluated from the donning of ppe through its use at the bedside to the importance of a safe and observed doffing procedurethe cdc has issued guidelines for the ppe to be worn by healthcare workers in the care and treatment of ebola patients guidelines that were updated frequently during the outbreak 9 those guidelines and the choices of ppe made by the hospitals that cared successfully for patients with ebola reflect the need for total body coverage including respiratory protection while ebola virus disease is not generally considered an airborne disease the care of these patients may keep healthcare workers in close proximity to patients for extended periods of time and require them to perform tasks and procedures that generate aerosols thus respiratory protection is warrantedthe choice of a ppe ensemble is dependent upon other previous decisions many of which are made far from the bedside ultimately the ppe that is worn by staff is made up of items that can be sourced reliably and affordably complies with all safety regulations and in which the staff have competency in using through regular training and education deciding on one uniform type of ppe is also dependent on facility design and work flow below is list of questions to consider that may affect the choice of ppe and the protocols for its use these questions can help guide the formation of a ppe matrix ensuring that all staff are protected commensurate with their level of risk all personnel who come in direct contact with the patient patient belongings patient waste including packaged waste as well as the patients direct environment must use appropriate ppe and be trained in its use 10will all staff wear the same ppewhere will staff don their ppewhat will staff wear under their ppe including footwearcan staff don and doff independently or will they need assistanceis there a chair stepstool or grab bar available where donning and doffing occurhow long will each professional likely remain in the room delivering carewill the staff sanitize their ppe in some manner before or during doffingwhere will staff doffis there a mirror for staff to check their ppecan staff be observed while doffingwill you use a trained observerwhat will a trained observer wearwhat ppe will ancillary personnel such as environmental services wearif ppe is reusable who cleans it and what is worn while it is being cleanedputting together the best ppe ensemble depends on availability price ease of use and the amount and type of protection required in the usa most of the gowns and suits worn for isolation purposes are disposable contrary to the reusable suits worn in most of europe 11 it is imperative that infection prevention personnel supervisors and purchasing agents all understand what items are being used in the biocontainment unit or with the care of any patient with a highly hazardous communicable disease and what level of protection they provide international standards exist for the fabrics gowns are made from as shown in table 142it is important for those planning purchasing and writing protocols for the use of ppe suits and gowns to recognize that only level 4 material has been tested using fluids with lower specific gravity than water which is true of most bodily fluids 12 materials in levels 13 have not been tested with fluids of similar specific gravity to bile blood or liquid stool and may have no resistance to thesechoosing ppe that provides the highest level of protection against synthetic blood and simulated blood-borne pathogens exclusively allows staff to train in and use one ensemble that provides protection against various pathogens regardless of their transmission route while it may be argued that this is over-isolating this approach mitigates concerns when dealing with new pathogens unknown pathogens or as information emerges about the existence and persistence of pathogens in varying body fluids 8risks to ppe exist in varying forms defects in manufacturing and assembly can leave seams and zippers open to penetration both the person donning and the trained observer should inspect ppe as it is being put on suit materials can be torn or cut by sharp edges within the environment and breaches in suit integrity can occur with use while staff bend stoop and reach special populations of patients can also pose hazards to ppe integrity by grabbing pulling or holding onto staff whether intentional or unintentional the potential for a contaminating breach must be mitigated by the care team to the extent it is possible and foreseeable patients who are delirious or agitated frightened or simply active as in the case of toddlers pose higher risks to staff and to the integrity of a ppe ensemble if a breach occurs protocols must be in place first to guide the staff member in the safest extrication from danger and then to assess treat and monitor the employee as neededgown and suit choice should consider ease of donning and doffing as well as how it functions during use gowns are generally easier and safer for staff to don may be more familiar to hcw and usually can be put on without assistance some other considerations for gowns involve a fit that does not allow the front of the gown to touch the floor when performing patient care tasks that covers the entire back of the wearer and that remains securely positioned during usesuit style ppe can offer additional coverage of underclothing does not have a risk of falling off shoulders in use and does not drape the floor with bending or stooping but is more difficult to don and because of sizing limitations may fit better in certain areas of the body than others employees should know which size of suit fits them safely reducing redundant fabric without compromising the wearers ability to bend crouch or sit seams and zippers if any should be covered donning and doffing suit style ppe is a skill that should be practiced and considered a part of staff competencyboth gown and suit style ppe compliant with the level 4 astmamsi standards are fluid impervious under pressure which is beneficial for many of the intimate contact tasks that may be required while caring for patients an unintended consequence of that fluid repellence is an increased risk of liquid and body fluid running off to the lower legs shoes and floor boot and shoe covers should be worn 13 if gowns are used shoe covers should extend to an area higher on the leg than the lowest portion of the gown suits with built-in booties  should be worn with shoe covers that can be changed in the case of gross contamination figs 141 and 142gloves and glove etiquette is another area where familiarity with a product does not necessarily infer safe use staff may need to practice methods of glove removal that discourage contamination whether a glove-in-glove or other method is utilized fluorescing solutions and uv flashlights make this an easy exercise and one that is key to good technique studies have demonstrated an increased safety to staff with double gloving but most of these determinations were made when the threat to the staff was from substances such as bone cements and glues 2 double gloving by itself does not prevent contamination of the wearer from either poor technique or from unrecognized loss of glove integrity 14 balancing the need for increased protection with required tactile sensation is not easy staff will need practice performing required skills while in extra layers of gloves because the cuffs of gowns and suits are not required to be fluid impervious it is important that gloves extend over that portion completely and may require the use of an extended cuff glove 11 some institutions have chosen to use longer and heartier sterile gloves as their outer layer while others have opted for extended cuff length exam gloves designed for chemotherapy use to offer a similar level of protection triple gloving is another option which provides an additional glove which can be exchanged during patient care activitiesthe use of alcohol-based hand rubs abhrs on gloved hands allows for sanitizing without exposing skin while in a patient care area the application of alcohol-based hand rubs has not been shown to have a negative effect on the gloves themselves 15 at least during limited use sanitizing the outer layer of gloves after touching the patient or a patient care device or surface is an important step in reducing further contamination of the care space when outer gloves have been in contact with known areas of contamination or with patient body fluids they should be sanitized and then changed 2another strategy for glove safety is to employ gloves that are different in color layer to layer this allows a visual queue when the outer glove has been compromised gloves should be inspected when they are donned and again before they are doffed to ensure that they have remained intact breaches in glove integrity if they involve both layers or the inner layer alone should be regarded as a potential staff exposureto provide a continuous impervious surface along the hand wrist and forearm some facilities tape their gloves to their suits or gowns decisions to tape gloves should be considered in the larger context of the donning and doffing procedure to ensure that staff understand both the rational and the timing of applying and removing tape the benefit of a smooth continuous wipeable surface in one of the high-risk zones for contamination must be weighed against the risk for damage to the suit or gown the potential of micro-spray created during tape removal and adding complexity to the donning and doffing procedure droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures and situations can be abrupt and unpredictable they include coughing without appropriate mouth coverage sneezing spitting suctioning pouring liquid waste into toilet emptying bedpans catheter bags or urinals and being near patients when they are urinating or defecating or when staff assist with activities such as tooth brushing a powered air-purifying respirator provides the greatest and most complete protection from these potential events especially for caregivers within the critical 3-foot zone around the patient 16 for facilities and staff who do not have access to or have not been trained in the use of these respirators an n95 face mask and shield or a n95 face mask and goggles may need to be usedwhile likely less protective than the enclosed head piece of a powered air-purifying respirator papr for short periods of time in biocontainment units or when patients are no longer exhibiting symptoms a combination of face shield or goggles and a mask may be used eye protection serves to avoid the two mechanisms for worker exposure  direct splash into the eyes and self-inoculation with contaminated hands goggles like eyeglasses may move on the face during wear tempting the wearer to reach up and adjust them with contaminated hands face shields have the advantage of being able to be worn with eyeglasses top-down full face shields lend more protection as users lean forward while delivering care than the smaller shields that are attached to surgical type masks  which can expose eyes to sprays and droplets when the wearers head is downmasks fall into two larger categories isolation type single use and the n95 respirator 17 an n95 or its equivalent in protection or a papr is required for all airborne pathogens as well as high-consequence pathogens when the care of the patient requires staff members to be within 3 feet of the patients mouth and nose and when that patient is coughing and sneezing or has copious oral or nasal secretions again because aerosol-generating incidents such as a sneeze can occur without warning when staff are required to be in very proximity to any patient suffering from high-consequence pathogens appropriate eye nose and mouth coverage should be maintained an isolation type surgical mask may be worn in conjunction with a face shield to prevent the direct inoculation of staff mucous membranes only when there is not a risk of airborne transmissionmask removal must occur with clean hands and staff should be encouraged not to touch their faces eyes nose or mouth until they have thoroughly washed once a mask has been used it should be discardedas is true with other types of personal protective equipment paprs require training and practice to be used effectively and efficiently with highly hazardous communicable diseases ease of use is a lesser factor than the protection that a piece of equipment provides surgical masks are the easiest for wearers to put on and take off correctly n95 masks require training and fitting and annual competency 18 paprs require training and practice and many facilities using paprs have staff retrain on a more frequent basisgenerally the papr motor and fan are attached to or contiguous with head covering that contains a large face shield airflow is directed past the face to maintain a continuous positive pressure inside the face portion of the hood motors  and the battery pack powering them can either be worn on a belt at the waist or can be integral to the helmet structure beneath a disposable hood care must be taken to assure that a battery pack does not lose power while in usepaprs may offer improvement in comfort and cooling compared to n95 masks and face shields or goggles when workers wear ppe longer and more comfortably they can stay at the bedside longer reducing the number of required doffings per day this can substantially reduce overall risk as each doffing episode confers risk of contamination to staff and the work environment 14 table 143additions to the ppe ensemble may be aprons gowns shoe covers and hairhead covers hats and hair covers may be integral to the hood or head piece or may be applied separately generally these hair covers must also be impervious if they serve as the outermost layer care should be taken to ensure that they do not slip or move while being worn and do not compromise visibility aprons and gowns can help create a smooth wipeable surface on the front high-risk area of the wearer mitigating the risk along seam and zipper lines aprons afford covering to the chest and torso while surgical or plastic gowns add protection to the arms each addition to the ppe ensemble must also be considered with relation to where the item will fit in the donning and doffing procedures staff should consider whether these items can be safely cleaned while in use with sanitizing wipes or whether they can be removed and replaced safely while within the patient care environment the addition of a gown or apron is now recommended by the cdc as the outermost layer of a ppe ensemble as it avoids the folds and seams of underlying fabrics and can provide a wipeable surface and allows for additional protection in what are considered the high-touch areas of the anterior chest torso and arms 12 shoe covers are utilized over existing foot and lower leg coverage to allow the outer layer to be removed if soiled soiling of the shoe and lower leg areas can occur from splashes of body fluids that fall from the impervious layers of the ppe above them as well as from spills and splashes that reach the floor protocols for staff are needed to ensure that they can remove and replace contaminated foot coverings if needed especially during the cleanup of spills suits that have built-in foot coverings should still have a removable foot covering added for likely contamination eventsthe duty of a trained observer in a biocontainment unit is like that of a safety officer watching but not participating in patient care donning and doffing unless needed in an emergency in such a case another trained individual should be ready and able to step in to the role of trained observer the role is not designed as punitive or for score keeping but for identifying potential breaches that could compromise safety it is not possible for staff in full ppe to know when a portion of their ensemble has come in contact with the patient or part of the environment even with practice bedside caregivers may occasionally omit hand hygiene or a step in the doffing process all members of the care team should be aware of the actions of those around them and be watchful for omissions that could compromise safetyby itself no ppe ensemble protects staff if it is not used and maintained properly ppe etiquette involves every step a staff member takes while providing safe patient care from avoiding touching their own ppe and hand hygiene while gloved to proper cleaning of papr motors helmets and belts gloved hands can be sanitized with alcohol-based hand rubs abhrs but should not be washed while in the patient care environment to avoid splashing beds and bed linens doors tables and chairs and all items within easy reach of the patient such as tv remotes and call lights should be considered contaminated even without visible soiling once a staff member has touched those high-risk areas they should perform hand hygiene or change outer gloves cleaning those areas of high risk repeatedly becomes part of the work day for clinicians at the bedside of the patient with a highly hazardous communicable diseaseperforming tasks that are normally routine for staff can pose hazards when performed in ppe so they should be practiced and drilled staff proprioception is altered in their ppe and developing a new sense of where the edges of their ppe-encapsulated body are in space is vital through practice staff can become accustomed to the hoses battery packs  helmets hoods and boot covers that alter this proprioceptionmindfulness of where and what has been touched during the performance of clinical duties can be augmented by using a trained observer but is ultimately a change in the fundamental way staff deliver care clinicians must become keen observers of what surfaces and objects a patient may have contacted from call lights and bedside tables to door handles bed rails and bathroom fixtures every action inside the patient care area must be taken with safety in mind avoiding those hazards that can be difficult to see while in a papr or face shield to feel while double gloved or to hear due to the background hum of the papr motoras employees prepare to leave the patient care area they should examine their ppe for breaches and visible soiling sanitizing wipes may be used to clean high-risk or likely soiled areas of ppe a trained observer may be used outside the patient room or in an anteroom or hallway to observe the doffing process if the observing staff is not separated by a physical barrier such as a wall door or window they must be protected from potential splashes that can occur during the removal of ppe or be in ppe themselvesa mirror may be helpful for the staff member to see their entire ensemble the doffing protocol may be posted so that both the person doffing and their trained partner can ensure that each step is followed or staff can follow an electronic version that records their complianceeach ppe ensemble will require a unique doffing protocol and many employ the use of abhrs or other sanitizing devices such as uv light sources to reduce the risk of contamination during the doffing process 19 a step-by-step approach avoids errors that can result in the unapparent transfer of infective materials where doffing occurs will be best determined by the physical layout of the unit and the space available but should occur a minimum of 6 feet from the patient in an area that has been dedicated to this purpose and is maintained as cleanly as possibleonce the entire ppe ensemble has been doffed and the staff member is outside of the direct patient care area they should be reminded not to touch any part of their bodies until they have thoroughly washed their hands this final redundancy prevents indirect inoculation of staff from disposing of their used ppeperhaps one of the greatest challenges when clinical duties require ppe is for hcws to place the safety of themselves and their team first nothing including the sudden loss of airway patency consciousness or pulse should drive a clinician into the room of a patient with a highly hazardous communicable disease without proper ppe being mindful of how long it can take to don ppe and how difficult it can be to move both quickly and safely in the patient environment means that staff members in biocontainment units must be even more vigilant than usual in observing patients for early signs of decline in condition the ability to anticipate critical needs can prevent staff from reacting dangerously and without the proper ppe we must consider the patient care area to be our scene and our first question must remain is the scene safe the right ppe donned in the correct order worn in a safe manner is what makes that scene safe for bedside healthcare providers the safe observed step-by-step doffing of ppe is what ensures the safety of the rest of the unit staff and facilitywhile healthcare workers use ppe routinely we are also responsible for at least some of the nosocomial infections that plague modern healthcare facilities in biocontainment units as well as many other areas in the healthcare system such microbe spread can have deadly consequences research is needed to determine best practice with respect to ppe including the type of gloves and glove removal techniques that avoid hand and clothing contamination development of ppe suits that fit all sizes and meet the needs of the bedside clinician is also necessary decontamination procedures for reusable suits that are efficacious and cost-effective could reduce the enormous cost associated with the disposable suits now in usein addition behavioral research could lend credence to the frequency timing and scope of ppe training and protocols for doffing that are proven to reduce staff contamination new technologies in sanitation including the use of ultraviolet light may reduce in-room fomites the future is likely to be filled with larger and more frequent outbreaks of highly hazardous communicable diseases when we can be assured that hcws are using the right ppe with good ppe etiquette and following protocols that have been validated through robust research the healthcare setting will be safer for everyoneindia and the rest of the world are going through a difficult decisive and stressful phase of existence due to novel severe acute respiratory syndrome- sars cov2 covid-19 pandemic1 2 3 in these unprecedented circumstances where covid-19 pandemic has

4 the high infectivity rate of covid-19 has not only created a health emergency in most parts of the world but overwhelmed the existing health system of all countries alike to avoid such a situation and to contain its spread social lockdown and isolation being practiced by india and most countries and it is the best prophylactic measure the impact of the pandemic is so colossal that in these times all medical specialities have ceased to exist and there remains only one speciality and that is covid doctors in affirmation of the new role orthopaedic surgeons were and are manning frontline covid-19 duties but post easing of lockdown measures they will have to increase their outpatient dispensation which are already running meagerly with limitations in time and census to bring orthopaedic healthcare on track to pre-covid era considering the fact that 69 of covid -19 patients are asymptomatic its highly infectious nature and realizing that the disease may remain in society for a longer period of time it is imperative that the outpatient department follows standard and universal operating protocols so as not to lose the health gains of lockdown1

in order to gradually return orthopaedic practice to relative normalcy due to covid 19 pandemic pelt ce et al have described four phases of response similarly de caro f et al have reviewed the literature and guidelines by various bodies and proposed a multi-level gated approach for both the patient population and the orthopaedic team for safety8 the approach describes different levels from 0 to 5 are as followslevel 0 screening of symptoms and testing of the orthopaedic team including physicians nurses administrative stafflevel 1 routine self-questionnaire that routes the patients to the most convenient time slotlevel 2 temperature screening before entering the clinic symptomatic patients cough dyspnea may be sent to the emergency surgical masks should be provided to each patientlevel 3 maintain social distancing no crowded waiting rooms patients waiting in the car until they are called inlevel 4 clinical visit made efficiently and swiftly subjective history digitally recorded before entering the roomlevel 5 digital scheduling of follow-up visits and payment avoiding the exchange of documents11
first and foremost the patient should decide that heshe has an orthopaedic problem significantly affecting lifestyle and locomotor function and is not being relieved by rest if one is not sure that the orthopaedic problem can be tackled at home or not there are two options one is to visit the hospital and the other better way is to contact the concerned telemedicine portal of the particular hospital for consultation this will reaffirm his decision to visit the hospital in these timesafter the decision to visit the hospital has been made the next step is to register and the best way for the time being should be online registration at hospital portal patients should be encouraged to use this online facility by wide publicity on hospitals websites hospital social welfare department and media the hospital needs to update its existing online service or develop a new online registration portal which is convenient to use and multilingual it should host basic services likeahow to fix an appointment online- video presentationball in one basic faq frequently asked questions related to registrationchow to register and filling registration formdpatients dos and donts while visiting the hospital table 1

even then there may be patients who are uneducated or have no access to a computer smartphone or internet the other options are as followsi
telephonic registration patients can register by phone advertised by the hospital or through the central helpline number patients will receive sms replies for their registrationiia novel app or better the existing aarogya setu app httpsmygovinaarogya-setu-app can be updated to allow for hospital opd registration like the online consultation facility for covid patientssuspects already available on aarogya setu app via aarogya setu mitr

2 cs must be followed by the patients while fixing an online appointment one should select a time which is convenient so that heshe has ample time to follow safe anti-covid measures and the second most important is that the patient registers in the correct out patient department opd so as to avoid unnecessary intra-hospitalhealth care facility travel the hospital portal may use artificial intelligence technology to automatically suggest to him the opd he needs to visit for his complaint on filling the form or a patient can take help from the general toll-free helpline of the hospital to ask for the department he should visitwe propose that the hospital should give online time slots of 1 h with a gap of 20 min the time of which can vary from opd to opd as physio-therapy and rehabilitation opd will require more time for patient consultation and management this avoids overcrowding and the buffer intervening time allows for some overshooting of patient-doctor consultation and may be used for sterilizing the opd premises the number of patients should be restricted to 25 in a day per doctor 9330 pm so the number of slots can vary according to the number of opd rooms and doctors author perspectiveeach 12 by 10 feet opd room that is approximately 365  304 square meter should allow 2 doctors with computer tables and 2 patients at a time maintaining a social distance of atleast 1 m at one end is stationed an examination table of 24-28cms in a glassaluminumplastic sheet enclosure if rooms are smaller 10  10ft304  304 m only one doctor and examination table or 2 doctors without an examination table are proposed as needed so if you have 6 rooms keep 3 as buffers which are sanitized for next day use 3 rooms will house 6 doctors the number of patients to be seen per day is 6x25 150 patients at 9 am -3 pm if consultation time is 8-10 min per patient a doctor will spend 25x10  250 or approximate 4 hours of patient-doctor consultation this with a 20 minutes interval after each hour for sanitization nature call and lunch break equal to 20x5100 minutes or1hours 4omin making a total of 5hrs 50minutes this along with 20minutes each donning  doffing of mini ppe kit and sanitization protocol to be followed pre and post-opd 5hrs 50 minutes  40 min equals 6 hours and 30minutes of opd timing from 9-4 pm fig 3
the patient needs to fill a registration form as in table 1 correctly and follow the instructions given thereof when visiting hospital opd every patient should upload his previous records treatment and investigation to the hospital site after taking an appointment the site should unambiguously state which opd of the hospital tackles to which health problem it should inform the benefits of online registration over the physical system of registration at the hospital that is it maintains minimum contact with hospital staff is faster avoids fomite born spread of disease and will help in maintaining social distancing in crowded hospitals its duty of receptionhelp desk- opd staff to arrange digital documents of the appointments for the day submitted online and transferred by central hospital portal of registrations done through aarogya setu app and helplineeach patient should visit the hospital after taking a hygienic bath wears a triple-layered mask disposable clean headgearcap preferably keep a handy70 alcohol sanitizer carry own foodothers medicines prescribed and come in clothes which can be sanitized  temporarily discarded for next 6 days they should be informed of the procedure of opd visit by computer animation at the hospital website table 2
 each hospital can customize their opd animation according to their infrastructure for entry and safety measures patients must download the aarogya setu app check their status to be safe before visiting in the queue and after leaving hospital premises containment zones and covid positive patients should attend hospital only in case of emergency and after the quarantine restriction of that area are lifted and that too at designated covid points of the hospital location of whose is made available by telephonic helpline and website
main entrance  there should be a single separate entrance and exit separated by at least 2 m for smooth patient flow better to have them located diagonally or at ends of hall length or breadth allowing one person at a time to the main opd hallcomplex the entrance should have installed thermal monitors running video screens and posters on patient information  what health service this opd offers it should clearly state in the bold form bilingual and audio format that patients with fever and acute respiratory infection should visit the fludesignated fever clinic firstthe main gate is to be manned by security staff trained paramedics and an mbbs resident with an erected fixed barricaded perimeter of 1 m by roperemovable tapes it is proposed that personnel here should wear a mini ppe consisting of water repellent surgical gown triple-layer medical mask headgear face shield waterproof shoe cover and gloves as he is the first contact and has to triage patients into covidsuspectnon-covid this kit can be used for the whole day with proper repeated sanitization of gloves unless a mishap occurs they will thermal scan each and every patient ask for a basic history of cccattt that is containment zone contact with covid positive patient cough aarogya setu app indication of himself and patients travel health trouble and temperaturehere they have to filter patients into three categoriesa
containment zone and covid positive patients should have been directed to separate exclusive covid facilities by helpline or telemedicine consultation and if still someone visits they should be directed to it and reported immediately to local health authoritieshospital managementcmocivil surgeon-as per locality as per emr guidelinesb
covid suspected patients with symptoms should be referred to designated flufever clinicscthe patients with no such history or symptoms these patients should standwait apart by physical-social distance 1 m in a queue they should be allowed in the premises after they have shown their appointment -timing slot on mobile are wearing proper three-layer mask above nostrils and have sanitized hand with foot operable wall-mounted hand sanitizer as per norms kept at the entrance they should enter singularly to avoid overcrowding in the designated waiting hallarea the entry of caregivers should be limited and the only patient is to be allowed into the opd but if needed one attendant preferably legal guardian in case of a minor and functionally impaired patient be allowed to enter in the opd with all precautions of wearing mask proper hand sanitization and cccatt clearance
an intercom facility with the reception should be provided at the entry gate this helps in case of digital-uneducated functionally impaired or poor patients who have not been able to register online or by other means may be registered by the mbbs doctor on calling the reception they can book a time slot of that day if some appointment is cancelled or some other day with the receptionist hence a 2 buffer of such patients should be allowed without disturbing the load of the number of patients per doctor this should be rare rather than common the documents or investigation reports of such patients can be photo-digitized and transferred to reception with no touch technique by the doctor at the gate no documents folder or investigation should be allowed inside patients in an hour will be approximately 30 of which 20 can be allowed as per the size of waiting hall maintaining 1-m social distance or 23 empty seats in between and the rest can wait outside in their private vehicle if possible5
two trolleys and wheelchair duly sanitized by 1 hypochlorite solution with hospital attendant ppe as above since they may have to bring unscreened patients from the vehicle and be the first contacts should be kept ready at the gate behind temporary glassplastic partitions for non-ambulatory patientsat the reception 2 medical data operator and a helper located 1 m apart wearing a triple-layered medical mask and latex examination gloves are seated behind an easily cleaned smooth tabletop counter with glass partitions at the opd reception the patient should first show his virtual time allotmente-registration slip so that the reception staff can retrieve his form and uploads for forwarding to the doctor besides this the receptionist have to complete and forward forms of patients who have done spot registration via intercom at the entry gate its duty of receptionhelp desk- opd staff to arrange the digital documents of the online appointments and of registrations done through aarogya setu app and helplinetransferred by central hospital portal a day in advance after further ensuring that the patient is wearing a proper face mask above his nostrils heshe should be directed to the designated opd roomclinic or in the waiting halleach opd room should always have a paramedical staff stationed at its door with mini ppe these staff should be allowed to work in shifts of 6 h the paramedic at this stage will check again the cccattt status and ensure that the patient is wearing a triple-layered mask the patients hand should be sanitized with 6080 alcohol solution before entry in the room12 at this point only the patient should be allowed and in only exceptional circumstances eg for non-ambulatory patients one attendant may be allowed into the opd with a face mask and hand sanitization the patient and his attendant should be asked to maintain social distancing13
in opd waiting area hand hygiene station should be installed television tv screens should be installed to educate the people regarding signs and symptoms of covid 19 hand hygiene how to wear and make a homemade mask social distancing not to worry videos and prevention  treatment of coronavirus dos and donts and other health education videos the opd waiting hall should have a minimum number of furniture and instruments and that too should be adequately spaced it is necessary to convert opd air conditioner into a non-circulatory system this can be done by blocking off the return air vents of the air conditioner additionally an independent exhaust blower shall be installed to extract the room air14 the hepa filter hepa filters shall be a minimum of h13 en1822-1 filter class or equivalent of ac should be approved by the concerned authorities according to the norms the opd hall should have a trained floor supervisor paramedicsupport staff who has two is as duties a infection control-to ensure social distancing 1 m no crowding seats are properly spaced and the opd furniture and floor including computers screens and keyboards are properly sanitized daily 3 hourly twice in a shift of 6 h or earlier in inadvertent spillage and b health information-ensuring that patient information video and displays are running properlythere should be a security staff stationed in the opd hall for the help of patients and health staff the toilets should be frequented one at a time properly sanitized with 1 hypochlorite solution after every patient visit and so should the drinking water facility by maintaining social distance1
doctors should have ready access to fill online forms and uploaded documents of patients on computer duly forwarded by receptionists after seeing them the patient is called by a bell or patient digital display board or a single health staff operated token number system the paramedic at doorstep should allow the patient whose consultation is complete to exit first and give an interval time of 35 min for doctors to get sanitized -ready before allowing the other patient inside the doctors room the bed sheet of the examination couch and anything contacted by a patient should be sanitized as per above normsdoctor and all staff in opd must wear ppe kit httpswwwmohfwgovinorthopaedician consisting of triple-layer medical mask and latex examination gloves no aerosol-generating procedure agp should be performed in opd doctor and other staff should perform hand hygiene using proper technique15 and according to instruction known as my 5 moment of hand hygiene16 before donning and doffing of this mini ppe patients should be seated at a distance of 1 m and should be examined by a doctor swiftly behind a plastic curtain the patients body part may be cleaned by soap solutionspirit before examination at the table station discussed in the model above fig 3 before and after each patients examination doctor should sanitize his hand with prescribed alcohol sanitizer and change gloves after every examination the female patient may be examined in the presence of a sister with the above ppe only the digital-uneducated patients may be given opd prescription slips by the doctorthe prescription and diagnostic test ordered may be paperless as far as possible with prescription emailed to the patient or sent by an app and to the hospital laboratory services the investigations should be written which are essential for a particular patient as the x rays  diagnostic films can be the source of infection it should not be handled the hospital should have or develop a serverpicture archive and communication system pacs so that imaging and investigative procedures are available online to the orthopaedician teleradiology may be used for x rays mri and ct scan services if pac services are in developing stage x rays prescribed by doctors should be done hand to hand this will limit the further visit of patients to the hospital for collection of filmsreports and brought by staff not patient with due covid precautions entry to the diagnostic facilities in house should be separate and all precautions as above in an opd should be takenpatients should be prescribed a safe and longest possible period of medicine to avoid frequent visits to the hospital with monitoring of adverse events to be done by teleconsultation as far as possible patients should be given health facility number in case of emergency and should be encouraged for teleconsultation for future problems this requires developing or updating an integrated hospital computer network with a fast server-broadband robust secure bandwidth enabling access to the patient investigations done in the hospital pharmacy in house should follow the same precautions as opd and ppe recommended for pharmacists is triple layer medical mask latex examination gloves and frequent sanitization over glovesthe world health organization defines telemedicine as the delivery of health-care services where distance is a critical factor by all health-care professionals using information and communications technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis treatment and prevention of disease and injuries research and evaluation and the continuing education of health-care workers with the aim of advancing the health of individuals and communities a telemedicine visit has the advantage that it can be conducted without exposing the staff to covid and thus reducing the risks to both health care workers and patients it can provide rapid access to medical practitioners who are not immediately available thus achieving the goal of quality care to all in addition it makes available extra working hands for providing physical care at the respective health institutions the cdc has also recommended changing outpatient practice patterns and specifically they advise to reduce unnecessary healthcare visits and explore alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits a major challenge during this crisis is to keep patients and the healthcare team safely distant while providing patients with effective and efficient care and telemedicine is a logical solution to help address this challenge thus health systems that are invested in telemedicine are well-positioned to ensure that with covid-19 patientssuspects and those in containment zones also receive the timely care they need7

the basic details and an orthopaedic prototype teleconsultation has been depicted in fig 4 fig 5
as per telemedicine practice guidelines enabling registered medical practitioners to provide healthcare using telemedicine by the board of governors in supersession of the medical council of india17 it is important to choose a telemedicine portal that is quite simple for the concerned health facility under the existing framework of law and medical ethics as 1 for district-level hospitals it is patient to registered medical practitioner rmp consult by audiotext and for tertiary care it is patient to rmp rmp to specialist consultation via videoaudiotext alongwith the provision of teleradiologytelepathologyteleorthopaedics services there needs to be an efficient and well-connected telemedicine chamber 16megabitssec for video communications on phones and 25megabitssec for computers with a recording facility for audio and video consultation at every hospital in the working hour9 the main telemedicine chamber of the hospital should accommodate a general physician mbbs or resident doctorrmp who can advise on general orthopedic problems rmp to patient consult if the patients problems are beyond his medical capability he can transfer the call to the concerned orthopaedic department which has its own local telemedicine facility manned by an orthopaedic surgeon rmp to specialist consultthe patient should be explained clearly regarding the limitations of telemedicine and informed consent may be taken in this regard the telemedicine will avoid overcrowding unnecessary hospital visits and help in providing consultation to the covid 19 positive cases  patients of containment zones recently the medical council of india has officially allowed and issued guidelines telemedicine practice in india17 the technology used for telemedicine services carries the potential for abuse some of the risks drawbacks and limitations can be mitigated through appropriate training enforcement of standards protocols penalties and guidelines it is suggested that initially only audio or text can be used for telemedicine and gradually as norms become clearer and get established one can shift to video consultation the field of teleradiology and telepathology services can be practiced from the beginning under the hospital standard of care as they are carried out in controlled environments by trained professionals and therefore carry a lesser risk online consultation facility is already available for covid patientssuspects on the aarogya setu app via aarogya setu mitr it is suggested that a similar facilityapp may be created to facilitate telemedicine in all specialities including orthopaedics see fig 6in covid era more and more patients will be treated by old-established conservative methods the number of plaster applications and removal will be more all undisplaced fractures of the upper or lower limb should have proper plaster of paris cast application and visit at the expected fracture union time they should be instructed about the cast precautions to be followed fractures which require reduction should be treated by standard orthopaedic conservative care and visit facilities at 35 days for child and 710 days for adults for check reduction x-ray the follow-up imaging should be performed only if it is likely to make a significant change to care next visit should be at 46weeks in children and 68 weeks in adult and then at the time of fracture union thus a total of 34 hospital visits in displaced and 2 in un-displaced fracture stable spine fractures may be immobilized in a readymade spinal brace and spinal precautions explained they may visit at 68 weeks at follow-up if need be and then at fracture healing unstablespine fractures with increasing neurological deficit may need surgery and are not in the manuscript domain interim teleconsultation can be done when necessary18 relatively non-urgent plaster-like congenital talipes equinovarus cast can be avoided or delayed for long19 although guidelines are not specific the boa has confirmed with nhs england that uses of a plaster cutting cast oscillating saw is not considered an agp if used safely the survival of the covid-19 virus on casting materials has not been determined20
it is advisable to use methods which wont require the use of plaster saw for removal like removable splints pop slab and braces pop should be the favourite material and fiber-resin cast should be avoided as they will need cutting with plaster cutting saw though a slab of synthetic material may be used warm water should be readily available for faster cast setting the container holding it should be adequate in number and rinsed with a bleach solution after every plaster or better it should be applied after wetting the pop bandage directly from faucettap the paramedic standing out at the doctors room can alert regarding the type of plaster advised by the doctor enabling him to be ready with raw materials before a patient visit
removal as cast removal both with and without a saw is not considered an agp the personal protection equipment ppe for cast removal should be recommended for patient encounters within 2 m the guidance states that for both covid positive and covid unknown the plaster technician should wear mask fluid resistant iir type single-use apron and gloves  protective eyewear a pop cast can also be removed after soaking in water and unwinding the british society for childrens orthopaedic surgery bscos have created helpful videos on this20 the use of cast shears should be preferred oversaw the removal of plaster should be done after donning of aforesaid ppe the plaster blade should be efficient heavy-duty sharp for faster removal of cast and the system should have a suction mechanism to suck all cast-dust the plaster room should have its own heavy-duty exhaust fan a dedicated sanitation worker who sanitizes 1 hypochlorite for 1min-surface cleaning after every plaster and changes the disposable bed sheet all dressing and pop are disposed of as per local biomedical waste norms after being sprayed by bleaching powder solution
cast removal in covid-19 positive patients covid-19 positive patients or self-isolating patients should follow self-isolation guidelines prevalent and consult on the phone whether they can continue cast without any serious adversedetrimental effects till they recover while doing this it should be reemphasized upon them the standard cast precautions they have to takeonly 50 opd rooms should be utilized in a day every day when opd is finished the hall toilets and rooms should be sanitized with 19 dilution of 5 concentrated liquid bleach21 or 1hypochlorite solution and closed for the next day and the next set of opd rooms are utilized for the next day a thorough cleaning should be done twice a day fogging is no longer recommended gloves and face shields should be disposed of in a red bag and disposable masks gown gloves and respirators in a yellow bag after use1

a roster is made for doctors and staff only 50 doctors and staff should be utilized to attend for opd in the first 14 days remaining 50 should come to the hospital and be in reserve for any emergency telemedicine frontline duties as some may be on leave or quarantined or backup in the next 14 days the backup team should attend opd and the previous opd team to remain for backup the other alternative is to operate opd in two shifts 9 am-12 pm and 1230330 pm but it will expose all doctors of the center to risk at the same time in contrast to the above modelthe opd hall should have ventilation of more than 6 air changes per hour and minimum hourly averaged ventilation rates of more than 40 lspatient with an adequate number of windows and exhaust fans23

it should be sanitized as any operation theatre is that is fumigated every night each table should have disposable waterproof bed sheets floor and table sanitized after each patient visit the instrument and dressing autoclaved as per local hospital norms the doctordresser should wear a mini ppe as at entry and patients should wear a gown and cap besides mask the sister in charge should ask the patient cccattt history and sanitize his hand all staff should change dress and sanitize themselves and ot with carbolic and bleaching powder after every dressing intra-articular soft tissue and perineural steroid injections should be avoided whenever possible during the covid-19 pandemic to reduce the risk of reduced immunity to viral exposure25

lockdown period due to the ongoing shelter-in-place and stay-at-home restrictions in covid pandemic the operational suggestions include1 to suspend all physical therapy treatments except respiratory physical therapy in hospitalized patients post-operative intervention to reestablish mobility and respiratory function intervention after trauma with fractures and intervention in the immediate post-acute phase of disabling heart disease and neurological patients all with appropriate personal protective equipment as for doctor above 2 to transform all non-essential treatments into a telerehabilitation modality telephone or webcam counselling with the patient or caregiver
post lockdown it is prudent to reassess in relation to the epidemiological evolution of the pandemic the feasibility of reintroducing certain contact situations but only in circumstances where the health of the patient could degenerate due to hypomobility or respiratory dysfunction guidelines by international professional bodies of physiotherapists are also available for further reference 26the opd set up and guidelines will remain the same as above for entry reception and entry into the physiotherapy modality rooms the physiotherapist should wear the same protection kit as worn above by an orthopaedician additional precautions that need to be followed are a patients coming for different physiotherapy modalities to be designated to specific rooms at reception to avoid crowding in the corridorwaiting hall b in the physiotherapy section a maximum of 45 patients may be allowed for electrotherapy rehabilitation advice while ensuring adequate adequate personnel distancing c doctors may be encouraged to prescribe electrotherapy modalities selectively d physiotherapy protocols to be personalized and advised in such a way that repeat visits to the hospital can be avoided physiotherapy hand-outs for various conditions should be prepared e modalities need to be sanitized with 1 hypochlorite solution as per norms of mohfw after every use f home exercises are to be encouraged and patients should be guided to watch internet videos on a particular exercise disposable or easily sanitizable equipment and accessories should be usedthe above-proposed workflow if followed allows smooth functioning of opd but all may not go according to plan and there are bound to be untoward incidences and emergencies1

the patient and health staff at the facility should minimize or avoid mobile phone use use the intercom perform handwashing after usage and use of washable disposable coverspoly packs for mobiles should be encouraged the mobile companies have recommended 70 isopropyl alcohol or clorox disinfecting wipes for cleaning mobile phones in the off mode with mobile disconnected from all cables27

elevator etiquettesfacing the wall inside the elevator limiting the number of people to three in each elevator waiting for the next elevator to avoid crowding avoiding touching of the face after pressing the elevator buttons washing or sanitizing hands after leaving the elevator using the elbow to press buttons should be followed28

continuing medical education of staff and case review meetings with infectious disease specialists should be done regularly
all mail and courier services being brought from outside is given to the security ic at the entrance and unnecessary footfall in the opd is avoidedknowledge and best practices about covid-19 are rapidly evolving this guideline is evolving and subjects to change with time with new evidence and guidelines the guidelines here are being suggested as per recommendations of government and various national and global associations international evidence-based holistic guidelines on resuming elective orthopaedic surgery are already available29 and also considerations for resuming orthopaedic surgery the indian scenario30 these guidelines offer suggestions to support and enhance care safety of orthopaedic outpatient and health staff at one place while reducing variation all practicing orthopaedic surgeons are advised to read these guidelines carefully and follow updated health advisory available at government websites

no conflict of interest to be disclosedthe 18th19th centuries brought industrialization and large-scale population migration into cities of europe including london one result of this demographic shift was overcrowding in poor housing served by inadequate or nonexistent public water supplies and waste-disposal systems in london the introduction of sewers and flushing toilets directly draining into the thames led it to becoming an open stinking sewer due to high tides and strong winds pushing seawater upstream these conditions resulted in repeated outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as cholera dysentery tuberculosis typhoid fever influenza yellow fever and malaria and other infectious diseases as well as the loss of the fishing industrycholera is an acute diarrhea caused by infection with the bacterium vibrato cholera it is endemic in over 50 countries and also the cause of large epidemics since 1817 cholera spread rapidly throughout the world largely due to inadvertent transport of bilge water in ships mainly from the bay of bengal the indian subcontinent has been a long-term focus of cholera and the source of six worldwide epidemics between 1817 and 1923 the seventh cholera pandemic which began in 1961 affects on an average 35 million people annually with 120000 deaths with large scale epidemics in haiti yemen and in central africa in the second decade of the 21st century
between 1848 and 1854 a series of cholera outbreaks occurred in london with large-scale loss of life one epidemic of cholera occurred in the area of broad street golden square in soho a poor district of central london with unhygienic industries and housingjohn snow was born in 1813 in york england the first of nine children his father was a laborer and later a farmer john saw unsanitary conditions in his hometown with a river contaminated by town sewage as a medical apprentice from age 14 he experienced a cholera epidemic in a coal-mining village snow vowed to resist drink gambling and marriage and became a vegetarian at age 23 he began medical studies and graduated from the university of london in 1844 john snow a physician now considered a founding father of modern epidemiology was the personal anesthetist to queen victoria and founding member of the london epidemiological society in 1848 snow was developing his anesthesia practice in the cholera afflicted district when he undertook an independent investigation of the epidemicby 1849 about 53000 cholera deaths were registered for england and wales snow was skeptical of the predominant miasma theory and theorized that the cause of cholera was due to contaminated water as the main form of transmission in 1854 a cholera epidemic broke out affecting resident families of tailors and clerks from the shops of nearby regent street the epidemic caused violent diarrhea and very high mortality with some 600 deaths in one week during september 1854the prevailing miasma theory was that cholera was caused by airborne transmission of poisonous vapors from foul smells due to poor sanitation at the same time the competing germ theory that inspired snow was still an unproven minority opinion in medical circles eventually the foul smells popularly known at the time as the great stink from the thames river flowing past the houses of parliament were so severe that the mps decided to take action finally in 1864 with the plan of sir joseph bazalgette two enormous sewers were laid along the thames diverting the sewage downstream with development of sewage farms to manage the effluent the system is still in use but becoming too small to cope with the demands being placed on it as a result of increasing population and land developmentthe report of the committee on scientific inquiries in relation to the cholera epidemic of 1854 concluded thateither in air or water it seems probable that the infection can grow often it is not easy to say which of these media may have been the chief scene of poisonous fermentation for the impurity of one commonly implies the impurity of both and in considerable parts of the metropolis where the cholera has severely raged there is rivalry of foulness between the two
when the next cholera epidemic struck london from august to september 1854 primarily in the soho area adjacent to broad street snow investigated it and traced some 600 cholera deaths occurring in a 10-day period he was struck by the observation that the cases either lived close to or were using the broad street pump for drinking water he also determined that brewery workers and poorhouse residents in the area both of whom relied on local wells escaped the epidemic snow concluded that access to uncontaminated water prevented them from cholera infection while users of the broad street pump became infected he persuaded the doubtful civic authorities to remove the handle from the broad street pump and the already subsiding epidemic disappeared within a few daysas noted in snows report on cholerathe most terrible outbreak of cholera  took place in london in broad street golden square and the adjoining streets a few weeks ago  there were upwards of five hundred fatal attacks of cholera in ten days the mortality  probably equals any that was ever caused in this country even by the plague and it was much more sudden  the mortality would undoubtedly have been much greater had it not been for the flight of the population  in less than six days  the most afflicted streets were deserted by more than three-quarters of their inhabitantsthere were a few cases of cholera in the neighborhood of broad street golden square in the latter part of august and the so-called outbreak which commenced in the night of 31 august and the 1st september was in all similar instances only a violent increase of the malady i suspected some contamination of the water of the much-frequented pump in broad street  but on examining the water i found so little impurity in it of an organic nature  i requested  to take a list at the general registrars office of the deaths of cholera registered during the week ending 2nd september  eighty-nine deaths from cholera were registered during the week in the three sub-districtsi found that nearly all the deaths had taken place within a short distance of the pump  with regard to the deaths  there were sixty-one instances in which i was informed that the deceased persons used to drink the water from broad street either constantly or occasionallythe workhouse in poland street is more than three-quarters surrounded by houses in which deaths from cholera occurred yet out of five hundred and thirty five inmates only five died of cholera  the workhouse has a pump-well on the premises in addition to the supply from the grand junction waterworks and the inmates never sent to the broad street for water if the mortality in the workhouse has been equal to that in the streets immediately surrounding it  upward of one hundred persons would have diedthere is a brewery in broad street near the pump and  no brewers men were registered as having died of cholera  above seventy workmen employed in the brewery none of them had suffered from cholera  at the time the disease prevailed the men  do not drink water at all  there is a deep well in the brewery in addition to the new river waterthe result of the inquiry then was that there has been no particular outbreak or increase of cholera in this part of london except among the persons who were in the habit of drinking water of the above-mentioned pump-well i had an interview with the board of guardians of st james parish  the handle of the pump was removed the following day
the cholera epidemic which was already declining fell off and disappeared once the pump usage stopped as a result of this episode benjamin disraeli together with other members of parliament adopted the plan of the thames authority and passed legislation forcing the overhaul of londons water and sewage systems which after completion contributed to the nonreturn of cholerain the next london cholera epidemic of september to october 1854 the highest rates of cholera occurred in areas of the city where two companies with overlapping water mains supplied homes one of thesethe lambeth companymoved its water intake to a less polluted part upstream of the thames river while the southwark and vauxhall company left its intake in a part of the thames heavily polluted with sewageagain suspecting water transmission snows investigation identified cases of mortality from cholera by place of residence and by the two water companies that supplied the homes during the first four weeks the impure water of southwark and vauxhall accounted for fatalities 14 times as great as those of the lambeth water supply snow calculated the cholera rates for a 7-week period in homes supplied by each of the two in possibly the most famous presentation table in epidemiology table 51

homes supplied by the southwark and vauxhall water company were affected by high cholera death rates whereas adjacent homes supplied by the lambeth company had rates lower than throughout the rest of london this provided overwhelming epidemiologic support for his hypothesis that the source of the cholera epidemic was the contaminated water from the thames river distributed to homes in a large area of south londonsnows pioneering epidemiologic investigation proved the mode of transmission of a waterborne disease that ravaged many parts of the world in the 19th century and still occurs in the 21st century the v cholera organism was originally grown in 1854 but was reported in local italian medical literature and not recognized internationally international recognition for the definitive identification and growth of the organism during his investigation of an epidemic of cholera in egypt was given to the eminent german bacteriologist robert koch in 1883 filipo pucini was ultimately recognized for the discovery in 1984 when the organism was formally named vibrio cholerae pucini 1854 robert koch was the discoverer of anthrax in 1880 and tuberculosis in 1882 and leader in defining criteria for causation of infectious diseases he was awarded a nobel prize in medicine in 1905 see chapter 7the broad street pump episode demonstrated that cholera was water-borne and thus the means to prevent it had already been identified almost 30 years before snow also established the basic methodology of modern public health for infectious disease investigation and contributed to establishing the validity of the germ theory which was still highly controversial at this timewith the understanding of the causal relation between microorganisms and diseases at the end of the 19th century the process for reducing large-scale morbidity and mortality via disinfection was initiated the first use of chlorine as a disinfectant for water facilities was in 1897 in england the first use of this method for municipal water facilities in the united states was in jersey city new jersey and chicago illinois in 1915 other cities followed and the use of chlorination as standard treatment for water disinfection rapidly grew during the 20th century death rates from waterborne diseases decreased significantly and although other additional factors contributed to the general improvements in health such as sanitation improved quality of life and nutrition the improvement of water quality was without doubt a major reason the decline in typhoid fever in the united states between 1900 and 1945 as a result of improved water supply systems and use of chlorination is seen in figure 51
the disinfection of drinking water through both filtration and chlorination processes has been one of the major achievements of public health clean water was responsible for nearly half the total mortality reduction in major cities three-quarters of the infant mortality reduction and nearly two-thirds of child mortality reduction
in 2014 an estimated 35 million cases of cholera occurred globally with more than 100000 deaths mainly in developing countries without safe drinking water treatment and sanitationepidemics of cholera also occur in natural disaster situations particularly in those areas where sanitation systems break down a current example of such events is seen in haiti where an earthquake in 2010 killed over 200000 people and displaced over one million persons this was followed by a massive cholera outbreak 10 months later with over 665000 cases and 8183 deaths intensive efforts of the haitian ministry of health together with the centers for disease control cdc world health organization who and other international organizations with massive vaccinations against cholera prevented thousands of deaths from cholera but transmission of the disease continued in the following yearsmaking matters worse while haiti was already struggling with effects of the cholera outbreak since 2010 a major hurricane hurricane matthew struck in october 2016 the who shipped a million cholera vaccines to haiti attempting to minimize the risk of further increases of cases the un reports that since the cholera outbreak of 2010 some 780000 persons have been infected with cholera and 9145 have died of the disease moreover since the hurricane in 2016 almost 800 new cases arise each week
the cholera epidemic in haiti since 2010 has been attributed to importation of the vibrio bacterium by un peacekeeper forces from nepal still a cholera-endemic country the sewage contamination in un peacekeeper camps with poor sanitation spread to nearby camps for displaced homeless haitians following the earthquakecholera can be imported via travelers from areas still endemic with cholera exposure to street or other contaminated foods cholera and other waterborne diseases remain major global public health problems in the 21st century particularly in areas of poverty both the who and the united nations have recently acknowledged that the haitian epidemic resulted from entry of the organism into poor hygienic camps by un troops that were sent in to maintain order epidemiologists identified that the cholera strain found in haiti was the same as one that originated in nepal where the disease is still endemic improving haitis water and sanitation infrastructure is critical to achieving large health gains and reducing the opportunity for cholera to spread with responsibility attributed to united nation peacekeeper soldiers from nepalduring the 1970s in the medical and public health professions public health community there was a widespread idea that infectious diseases were gradually going to disappear under the combined influence of hygiene antibiotics and vaccines this false sense of security was shattered with the advent of aids in the 1980s and the subsequent return of diseases previously thought to be under control such as tuberculosis malaria dengue and plague the complacency was replaced by a high degree of concern as new infectious diseases continued to arrive such as hiv in the 1980s bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse in the 1990s severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 ebola in 2015 and zika virus in 2016 is now seen as a global public health crisis with few new antibiotics in the pipeline of development testing licensure and production growing resistance of many organisms to currently available antibiotics and health care associated infections as well as spread of diseases from tropical areas to temperate zone countries in north america europe and other regions such as west nile fever chikungunya and zika a further concern was the return of old diseases thought to be controlled such as the sexually transmitted diseases as well as diphtheria and pertussisin the early 21st century the spread of infectious diseases as weapons of terror and even war including anthrax came to grip the public and created a whole new spectrum of terrorism in 2004 another concern came to the fore with the lack of an influenza vaccine to protect vulnerable people in the population due to difficulties with production and regulation in particular this placed caregivers at high risk of infecting patients or bringing the disease home from the hospital settingtoday waterborne disease is given less recognition as standards of water and sewage treatment are assumed to be part of modern living however waterborne enteric disease continues to be among the major killers in many parts of the world especially among children waterborne disease may be so common that it escapes detection in many countries especially those where hepatitis especially a and e is endemic and where incidence of gastroenteritis from shigella escherichia coli rotavirus and many other enteric infectious agents remains high another example is helicobacter pylori the cause of chronic peptic ulcer disease and the recognized cause for gastric cancer helicobacter which affects nearly half of the worlds population and is related to poverty and poor hygiene is also waterbornein western industrialized countries waterborne disease outbreaks have become relatively uncommon due to high levels of water management water contamination and enteric disease can also occur from organisms for which routine testing is not currently practiced for example testing for rotaviruses which cause enteric disease and organisms such as campylobacter and giardia is not routinely done but water is tested if there is a suspicion of contaminationin 1999 the cdc reported on achievements of public health during the 20th century in the united states addressing the problem of waterborne disease as followsby 1900 however the incidence of many of these diseases had begun to decline because of public health improvements implementation of which continued into the 20th century local state and federal efforts to improve sanitation and hygiene reinforced the concept of collective public health action eg to prevent infection by providing clean drinking water by 1900 40 of the 45 states had established health departments the first county health departments were established in 1908 from the 1930s through the 1950s state and local health departments made substantial progress in disease prevention activities including sewage disposal water treatment food safety organized solid waste disposal and public education about hygienic practices eg foodhandling and handwashing chlorination and other treatments of drinking water began in the early 1900s and became widespread public health practices further decreasing the incidence of waterborne diseases
in 2003 bacterial contamination of the municipal water system in walkerton ontario canada resulted in a public health disaster with 7 deaths and 2300 persons ill a public inquiry revealed that improper practices and systemic fraudulence by the public utility operators privatization of municipal water testing absence of mandatory criteria governing quality of testing and the lack of provisions for notification of results to multiple authorities all contributed to the crisis warnings of significant concerns two years before the outbreak were ineffective as budgetary cuts destroyed the checks and balances needed to ensure municipal water safetysafe water also includes ensuring chemical safety through measures such as prevention of lead poisoning from deterioration in distribution systems such as occurred in flint michigan in the united states in 2015 safe water supply requires exacting physical treatment as well as disinfection especially of all surface water sources effective water management can reduce the burden of gastroenteric disease even in a relatively well-developed countrywater treatment is one of the fundamentals of preserving public health not only at the sources residual chlorine throughout the distribution system prevents secondary contamination from faults in the pipes and leakage of sewage into the system many steps are essential for assurance of safe water supplies including well-organized sanitary and laboratory monitoring by the public health authorities and not only the supplier yet waterborne diseases can occur and spread due to error negligence or as in the case of haiti unintended consequences of well meant interventionscholera typhoid fever dysentery and hepatitis a and e and many other bacterial viral and parasitic diseases are waterborne diseases ie caused by pathogens transmitted via water supplies an immensely important public health challenge at the beginning of the 20th century was therefore the improvement and safety of drinking water quality aiming to significantly reduce illness and death caused by contaminated drinking waterin 1991 v cholera o1 apparently arrived in a cargo ship from china whose sewage was spread into the harbor of lima peru it contaminated shellfish popular among the local population and therewith created a local epidemic that continued to spread in central and south america between 1991 and 1994 the pan american health organization paho reported a total of over one million cases and almost 10000 deaths case-fatality rate 09 from countries in the western hemisphere in this period in southern asia an epidemic caused by a newly recognized strain of v cholera which began in late 1992 then spread to several areas of central america brazil and argentina in 2011 58 countries from all continents reported a cumulative total of 589854 cholera cases representing an increase of 85 percent from 2010 with the greatest proportion of cases in haiti and the african continent in 2014 55 percent of all reported cholera cases were from africa and 15 from the americas the latter clearly resulting from the haiti outbreak that started in 2010 the case fatality rate for cholera increased by 47 percent from 2013 compared to 2014 in 2014 a case fatality rate of 117 percent represented 190549 cases and 2231 deaths mainly in afghanistan democratic republic of congo drc ghana haiti and nigeriawaterborne disease outbreaks reported in the united states between 1920 and 2002 included at least 1870 events associated with drinking water an average of 225 per year with 883806 illnesses for an average of 10648 cases per year of more recent cases just over half of the outbreaks had no organisms that were specifically identified but were epidemiologically identified as viral in origin in addition to the disease outbreaks these waterborne organisms constitute a special risk of death for persons with compromised immune systems including cancer patients being treated with chemotherapy hiv-positive persons and patients being treated with immunosuppressants outbreaks of waterborne giardia and cryptosporidium in the united states raised concerns because these organisms are not efficiently eliminated by standard water treatmentthe principal ethical issue is implementation of existing technology of public health globally to save human lives now being lost to waterborne and other diarrheal diseases diarrheal disease caused by contaminated water food or transmission from person to person can be caused by many bacteria viruses and parasites together these are the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age killing some 760000 children every year the most serious complication of severe diarrheal disease in young children results from dehydration due to the loss of fluids and salts necessary for survival dehydration is mostly treatable with oral rehydration solutions ors one of the great public health innovations of the past half century now used globally children most at risk are those that have been previously malnourished or with impaired immunity prevention includes access to safe drinking water improved sanitation handwashing with soap exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life good personal and food hygiene health education about how infections spread and rotavirus vaccinationclearly the issues related to control of infectious diseases are not gone nor are they likely to be without major new breakthroughs in vaccine production and new modes of treatment but control of waterborne enteric diseases continues to depend on well-tested and effective traditional means of infectious disease control public health organizations require strong emphasis on monitoring of water security adequate waste disposal systems disease reporting systems training of health workers and the public and strong laboratory capacity and supportother causes of diarrheal disease morbidity are no less important rotavirus is a major cause of disease and death among children up to age five years even in high- and medium-income countries but the burden is mainly on low-income populations especially in low-income countries led by india nigeria pakistan and sub-saharan african countries oral rotavirus vaccines introduced in the industrialized world in 2006 have had a great impact in the united states reducing hospitalizations for severe rotavirus by as much as 80 percent rotavirus globally is estimated by the who to cause annually approximately 111 million episodes of gastroenteritis 25 million clinic visits two million hospitalizations and 352000592000 deaths median 440000 deaths in children up to five years of agerotavirus causes severe acute gastroenteritis with diarrhea and vomiting primarily in infants and young children the oral vaccine has been introduced in 90 countries by the end of 2016 with global child coverage estimated at 25 percent having been adopted in most high- and many medium-income countries and gradually introduced in low-income countries adoption of rotavirus vaccine in routine national immunization programs resulted in reduction of over 85 percent of rotavirus hospitalizations in belgium and similar reductions in hospitalizations for rotavirus-induced diarrheal conditions showed the high effectiveness of the rotavirus vaccines over 85 in many countries the vaccine is only partially reimbursed on a per-prescription basis a systematic review of ecological studies from eight countries reported a 4989 percent decline in laboratory-confirmed rotavirus hospital admissions in children less than five years old within two years of vaccine introduction increasing the use of rotavirus vaccine with proven efficacy and cost effectiveness along with efforts to improve access to safe water supplies improved food and sewage management and personal hygiene will continue to reduce the burden of disease and death in the vulnerable child population where sanitation is still poor clean sanitary facilities in homes supported by safe public sewage collection and treatment systems are essential for prevention of enteric infections a world bank data base review of percentage of homes with access to improved sanitary faclities with change between 1990 and 2015 showed high income countries such as the us canada uk netherlands and australia with 99100 in both years china increased from 48 to 77 percent and india from 17 to 40 percent global coverage increased from 53 to 67 percentmeeting the goal of clean safe drinkingpotable water requires implementing a multibarrier approach that includes protecting source water from contamination appropriately treating raw source water especially surface water and ensuring safe distribution of treated water to the consumers while chlorination is a mainstay in protecting water supplies filtration and coagulation are equally important filtration coagulation and disinfection of water are the optimal combination known to date where chlorination kills or inactivates bacteria and viruses and filtration completes the action of eliminating pathogens in particles and eliminating parasitic protozoawastewater includes water with human waste food scraps oils soaps and chemicals from homes from industry and from storm runoff untreated wastewater discharged to nature can damage the environment and groundwater making treatment essential nature copes well with small amounts but can be overwhelmed by large amounts of untreated wastewater and sewage treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level nature can handle government regulation of business industry and local authorities is a vital part of modern public health business and industry are legally accountable but not well enforced for ensuring their wastewater runoff is within accepted standards use of wastewater for irrigation after extensive treatment for irrigation is part of modern water economies and within supervised standards for field and orchard crops and even in vegetables and other ground crops including for newly emerging pathogens and chemicals
chemical disinfectants in water treatment and sewage usually can result in the formation of chemical byproducts however the risks to health from these byproducts are extremely small in comparison to the risks associated with inadequate disinfection disinfection efficacy should not be compromised in attempting to control such byproducts the main advantage of chlorine-based water disinfection over other methods such as ozone and uv radiation is its long-lasting effect its presence also prevents the regrowth of microorganisms thereby protecting clean water throughout the distribution system chlorine as a disinfectant is also easily monitored and controlled as a drinking-water disinfectant and frequent monitoring is recommended wherever chlorination is practicedprivate water supplies such as wells used by millions of people even in high-income countries are not government regulated or well protected contamination by animal excretions and agricultural runoff are of serious concern these sources of water can be made safe by fencing and hard surrounding platform along with regular use of household chlorine 525 bleach potential contaminants include microorganisms of human and animal waste products chemical contaminants from natural and man-made sources can be equally hazardouscholera continues to spread across many countries with dramatic consequences overwhelming stretched health systems and diverting resources from other crucial prevention-oriented programs global priority for increasing safe water supply as part of the mdgs did achieve its targets of increasing access to safe water but cholera itself has not been a topic of major priority in global healththe un report on mdgs indicates that the global target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was met five years ahead of schedule between 1990 and 2015 26 billion people gained access to improved drinking water sources worldwide 21 billion people have gained access to improved sanitation despite progress 24 billion are still using unimproved sanitation facilities including 946 million people still practicing open defecationhowever who reestablished a global task force on cholera control in 2012 to increase the visibility of cholera as an important global public health challenge this emphasizes disseminating information about cholera prevention and control and conducting advocacy and resource mobilization activities to support cholera prevention and control at national regional and global levels with participation by the international community of donors and public health professionalscholera can appear in disaster situations such as in severe floods and other natural calamities including earthquakes tsunamis and floods as well as manmade catastrophes including civil wars and refugee situations as wellin the second decade of the 21st century major epidemics of cholera are wreaking havoc in man-made and natural disaster settings in post-hurricane haiti as a result of imported vibrio by un peacekeeper forces and recklessly poor sanitation contamination of water used by a displaced persons camp in 2010 resulted in a devastating cholera epidemic persisting for years this has killed more than 11000 people and left more than 880000 infected by june 2017 a deadly cholera epidemic is raging in war torn yemen with over 200000 cases and 1500 deaths reported by who cholera is also rampant in strife-torn east africa with red cross reports of 51000 cholera cases in somalia and nearly 5000 in south sudan associated with famine poor supply of food aid in a vicious tragedy mainly of man-made causesin 1993 in the united states contamination of water sources with the parasite cryptosporidium caused major waterborne disease outbreaks in milwaukee wisconsin and elsewhere the milwaukee outbreak was the largest reported waterborne disease outbreak in us history with approximately 403000 ill persons with 4400 hospitalizations attack rates were as high as 50 percent in some parts of the city cryptosporidium is transmitted from person to person and from animals to humans but can also be transmitted in swimming pools and community waters cryptosporidium was reportedly present in 6587 percent of surface water samples tested in the united states the total cost of illness in this outbreak was calculated at 963 million 317 million in medical costs and 646 million in productivity losses
giardia lamblia is another parasite that can be transmitted in inadequately filtered surface water and for which chlorination is inadequate to disinfect in the period 201112 in the united states 32 drinking water-associated outbreaks were reported with at least 431 cases of illness 102 hospitalizations and 14 deaths legionella was responsible for 66 percent of these outbreaks and 26 percent of illnesses other bacteria and viruses accounted for 16 percent of outbreaks and 53 percent of illnesses
helicobacter pylori as the major cause of acute and chronic peptic ulcer disease pud and gastric cancer is known to be related to hygienic conditions including water safety and is thought to be prevalent in more than half the world population with a high economic impact on health systems one of the important measures for its control is water security especially for low- and medium-income countries see chapter 22prevention of waterborne diseases requires high standards for community food and personal hygiene sanitation including garbage disposal supply and treatment of safe drinking water and prohibiting the use of raw or partially treated sewage for irrigation of crops sanitation particularly the filtration and chlorination of drinking water prohibiting the use of raw or partially treated sewage for the irrigation of ground crops crucial treatment for diarrhea is prompt fluid therapy with sugar electrolytes in large volumes to replace all fluid loss with oral rehydration therapy ort using this form of treatment can successfully treat up to 80 percent of cholera cases tetracycline shortens the duration of the disease and chemoprophylaxis for contacts following stool samples may help in reducing its spread a vaccine is also available which can help to control outbreaks rehydration is a cornerstone of treatment and can reduce the fatality rate to less than one percentcholera and its burden on a country serve as indicators of poverty and inadequate social infrastructure and development it persists as a major public health challenge in developing countries that lack fundamental sanitary infrastructure with effective public health systems capable of providing clean safe water due to unsanitary living conditions these populations and communities are at high risk of major cholera outbreaks as well as other diarrheal diseasescholera infection still endemic in more than 50 countries is caused by v cholera o1 99 of cases worldwide which produces a toxin causing severe watery diarrhea that can be rapidly fatal without treatment of dehydration globally gastroenteric infections kill some three million children per year and must remain one of the high priority issues in international aid for the coming decades even industrialized countries with proper sanitation and water supply systems face the risks of waterborne disease outbreaks since these can occur due to malfunctions and human error in monitoring water supply and safety as the examples of milwaukee and walkerton canada in 2003 showedthe united nations 1966 international covenant on economic social and cultural rights icescr confirmed the right to water in international law noting that such a right is indispensable for leading a life in human dignity and a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights this international commitment was reaffirmed in 2002 that the human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient safe acceptable physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses see box 51

earned him the title the father of modern epidemiology his work led directly to steps taken to improve water safety in london setting new standards for other urban centers across the industrialized world resulting in cholera typhoid and other enteric infectious diseases largely disappearing in many countries and saving of millions of lives over the years yet cholera along with many other waterborne diseases remains a serious challenge to public health with severe health economic and social effects globally particularly on the poorest populations especially those in developing countries or in disaster situations in the 21st centurythe potential to relieve suffering and death from cholera and other gastroenteric infections from contaminated water and food resulting from john snows work is still far from being fully achieved but his contribution has saved millions of lives improving sanitation and reducing poverty are still closely linked issues in public health today in

infections hai are reported in the united states resulting in 99000 deaths and an increased cost to the national health care system of us20 billion cdc 2018a many of these can be prevented by compliance with recommended disinfecting protocols disease outbreaks in recent years are more severe due to global travel large scale food processing adaptation of microorganisms and reduced vaccination rates cdc 2018b natural disasters in recent years have had a more severe impact particularly when large metropolitan areas are affected these events may disrupt water sanitation healthcare access and hygiene practices in addition those who require sheltering during and after such events are at higher risk for illness due to crowded conditions watson et al 2007higher health care costs and limited access to health care may cause some individuals to avoid treatment thus causing the spread of illness in the us 44 of persons failed to get health care due to cost and 12 did not have a regular place to obtain health care cdc 2018c it is estimated that illnesses cost the us economy 273b in lost producitivity forbes 2018 the average school age child in the us misses 45 days of school per year impacting schools where funding is based on school attendance deb group 2018chronic illnesses particularly respiratory have been attributed to exposure to mycotoxins and allergenic proteins resulting from mold growth in built environments pestka et al 2008 effective remediation of infected spaces is difficult and expensive mold requires the presence of both moisture and an organic food source many building materials will suffice to thrive mold growth in buildings thus typically results from plumbing leaks in buildings poor humidity control poor building design appliance breakdown and disasters such as floodsmany clinical studies have found benefits to the use of hard surface antimicrobials to prevent exposure to pathogens that cause illness for example antimicrobials help prevent exposure to escherichia coli in household cleaning sponges gerba et al 2017 rossi et al 2012 and frequent washing helps lower levels of coliform bacteria in kitchen towels gerba et al 2014 children in classrooms where disinfecting wipes were used were over two times less likely to report absenteeism due to illness than children in classrooms where no disinfectant was used bright et al 2010 significantly lower populations of norovirus were found in classrooms where disinfectants and hand sanitizers were used than where they were not sandora et al 2008 the united states centers for disease control recommend the use of disinfectants in health care settings as part of an infection control program cdc 2018dsurfactants and detergents which lift soils from surfaces are a recommended part of disinfection and sterilization in healthcare to work in concert with other antimicrobial agents cdc 2019a in this brief overview of a complex and dynamic field of research the effect of surfactants as antimicrobials themselves will be explored first to set the context for the interfaces to be studied with surfactants the chemical composition of microbial interfaces is discussed in the next sectiongram positive bacteria are detected by their ability to respond to a gram stain generally crystal violet which detects peptidoglycan a polymer of sugars and proteins in the cell wall of these species a highlevel diagram of the interface of a gram positive bacterium is shown in fig 1 the key features that distinguish grampositive bacteria from gramnegative bacteria are a thick peptidoglycan layer the presence of teichoic acids copolymers of glycerol phosphate and carbohydrates and lipids together these form lipoteichoic acids which serve as chelators and also aid in adherence to the cell wall brown et al 2013 percy et al 2014 the crosslinking by ddtranspeptidase of peptidoglycan chains to form rigid cell walls and a much smaller volume of periplasm than that in gramnegative bacteria madigan et al 2006 some grampositive bacteria such as clostridium difficile form spores the stabilized spore coat proteins have been studied by permpoonpattana et al 2013 this coat makes it more difficult for antimicrobials to penetrate and killmany grampositive species are known to cause illness including staphylcoccus aureus skin eye and upper respiratory tract infections c difficile intestinal illness mycobacterium tuberculosis leprosy and listeria food poisoning buchanan and gibbons 1974a simple schematic of a gramnegative bacterial cell wall is shown in fig 2 gramnegative bacteria display these characteristics baron et al 1996 a thin peptidoglycan layer is present this is much thicker in grampositive bacteria an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides lps which consists of lipid a a phospholipid consisting of two glucosamine units with phosphonates and acyl chains attached to each this links the core and antigen components to the inner leaflet core polysaccharide comprised of oligosaccharides linking o antigen with lipid a and o antigen strainspecific repetitive polysaccharide on the outermost surface of the cell in its outer leaflet and phospholipids in the inner leaflet raetz and whitfield 2002 and porins proteins in arrangements like pores to enable transport of particular molecules university of hamburg 2019 between the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane there is a space filled with periplasm a concentrated gellike substance comprised of proteins and ions the slayer is directly attached to the outer membrane rather than to the peptidoglycan flagella if present have four supporting rings instead of two there are no teichoic acids or lipoteichoic acids lipoproteins are attached to the polysaccharide backbone and most with very few exceptions do not form sporesmedically relevant gramnegative species include types that cause sexually transmitted disease e g neisseria gonorrhoeae meningitis neisseria meningitidis respiratory symptoms moraxella catarrhalis haemophilus influenza klebsiella pneumoniae legionella pneumophila and pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary tract infections e coli proteus mirabilis enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens and gastrointestinal disease helicobacter pylori salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhisome bacteria excrete extracellular polymeric substances after adherence to a surface in which the bacteria grow and colonize typically coating a surface the resulting film is called a biofilm these polymeric substances typically consist of polysaccharides dna proteins and lipids aggarwal et al 2016 hallstoodley et al 2004 lpez et al 2010 the resulting polymeric matrix protects the microbes from attack including that of antimicrobials and can enable survival of bacteria outside a host for extended periods of time hokkanson 2018 penetration of this matrix is key to killing it can be done through additional chemical attack andor physical disruption biofilm contamination can be a key issue with plumbing food and water handling systems and medical devices and can cause health issues such as gingivitis eye infections from contaminated contact lenses and middleear and urinary tract infections rogers 2008to prevent biofilm formation on a surface surface charge can be modified by the adsorption of polymers or the surface can be made hydrophobic to lessen the affinity for polar and ionic groups in cells and biofilms for the surface guo 2013 smallscale surface roughness also known as the lotus effect can also be effective in repelling the adherence of bacteria and the generation of films jansen and kohnen 1995 antimicrobial ingredients may be incorporated therein contrerasgarcia et al 2011 stobie et al 2008viruses exist in particles that consist of rna or dna genetic material surrounded by a protein coat or capsid that protects the genetic material clinical gate 2018 virus particles take on a variety of shape including helical icosahedral or more complex structures in some cases the capsid is further surrounded by a lipid membrane or envelope those viruses that possess the lipid membrane are referred to as enveloped viruses those that do not are nonenveloped viruses a simple rendering of the structure of a virus is shown in fig 3enveloped viruses include groupings such as herpesviridae e g herpes infections chickenpox poxviridae eg smallpox hepadnaviridae e g hepatitus b flavivirus eg west nile zika togavirus eg rubella encephalitis coronavirus sars colds and mers hepatitis d orthomyxoviridae influenza types ad paramyxoviridae measles mumps and respiratory infections rhabdoviridae e g rabies encephalitis bunyavirales hantavirus crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever filoviridae ebola marburg and retroviruses viruses that change viral genomes used in gene therapy but also causative of some types of cancer to remain active the lipid membrane envelope must remain wet the envelope can also be readily disrupted by cleaning agents and antimicrobials thus making them more dependent on direct human contact or bodily fluid contact to spreadnonenveloped groupings include adenoviridae colds pneumonia tonsillitis gastroenteritis conjunctivitis and meningitis papillomavirus hpv which can cause cancer and picornavirus polio coxsackie and colds the capsids for these species are more robust than with enveloped viruses the uk national health service 2018 notes that norovirus a nonenveloped virus that causes gastrointestinal illness can survive on and transmit illness from hard surfaces for days to weeksmolds are fungal organisms that grow in multicellular filaments hyphae mold support structures consist predominantly of the carbohydrate polymers chitin and beta13glucan munro 2013 a highlevel schematic of a mold structure is shown in fig 5 the external structure is rigid and difficult to penetrate in addition the allergenic proteins and mycotoxins emitted by mold species particularly stachyborys can be a problem even after the mold organism has been killed unless those proteins and toxins are deactivated yang 1972 chlorine bleach kills mold reynolds et al 2012 additional use of surfactants helps the bleach wet and penetrate through the mold and building materials to be more effective wisconsin dhs 2018yeast fungal organisms in contrast to the multicellular structures of molds are singlecelled there are many types of yeast including some that are used in fermentation and baking processes for this discussion the focus will be on two pathogenic yeast species those of the candida and cryptococcus types the cell wall of candida albicans the most commonly isolated yeast and one attributed to common yeast infections in humans consists of glucans chitin to a lesser extent than the molds discussed earlier and mannoproteins glycoproteins containing mannose attributed to the immune response in host organisms chaffin et al 1998 cryptococcus yeasts have a shell comprised of polysaccharides that help to transport nutrients from their soil habitat bose et al 2003 the bestknown pathogenic species c neoformans can cause serious illness such as respiratory illness or meningitis in immunocompromised individuals cdc 2019bnow that the chemical compositions of various microbial species have been shown the next section will document studies of the antimicrobial action of different surfactant typescationic surfactants are the best known class of antimicrobial surfactants due to the widespread use of selected quaternary ammonium compounds quats in particular alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride adbac alkyldimethylethylbenzylammonium chloride adebac and didecylammonium chloride ddac shown in fig 6 have found common use in hardsurface disinfection applications these distinguish themselves from quaternary compounds used in antistatic or conditioning applications with a shorter alkyl chain length opposed with a benzyl substitution typically c10c16 versus the c16c18 dialkyl structures found in conditioning products resulting in higher water solubilitycationic surfactants particularly when applied at alkaline to neutral ph show a high affinity for the interfaces of all three microbial classes of interest due to the negative charge of the microbial interfaces vieira and carmonaribeiro 2006 found that charge reversal from negative to positive that occurred for c albicans exposure to dioctadecyldimethyl ammonium bromide and hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide was correlated with viability however a proposed mechanism mcdonnell 2007 for the antimicrobial action of quats demonstrates the effect beyond adsorption to the interfacefirst adsorb and penetrate cell wallsecond react with cytoplasmic membrane to cause disorderthird leakage of lowermw intracellular materialfourth degradation of proteins and nucleic acidsfifth cell lysis and death
quats are often referenced by generations which are defined as gerba 20151st benzalkonium alkyl chains c12c182nd aromatic rings with hydrogen and chlorine methyl and ethyl groups3rd dual quaternary ammonium compounds qac mixture of alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride lower toxicity4th dialkylmethyl aminos with twin chains5th synergistic combinations of dual qac6th polymeric qac7th bisqac with polymeric qac
succeeding generations demonstrated increased efficacy ioannou 2007 shows that equilibrium ddac adsorption 3rd generation on microorganisms is significantly higher than that for adbac first generation ddac appears to form multiple layers or perhaps accumulation in the cells begins to happen at a lower concentration than for adbac kill rates for adbac were also demonstrated to be significantly faster for ddac than adbac notably a plateau was achieved in the killtime curve indicating that kill effectively stopped at a certain time point this time was independent of concentration for ddac in the study but decreased with increasing concentration of adbacquats are most effective in the monomer form where they can readily interact with cell interfaces thus higher cmc values yield a higher monomer concentration when formulating with quats rosen 1989 notes the effect of the alkyl chain length on cmc where the addition of one methylene group is estimated to decrease the cmc by half corrin and harkins 1947 indicates that the increase of salinity can impact the cmc of an ionic surfactant a 1 m nacl solution is estimated to decrease the cmc of cetylpyridinium chloride by 100 again reducing the monomer concentration in addition walker et al 2004 found that the zeta potential of bacteria can be affected by the presence of salts potentially lowering the affinity of quats to cell interfaces should one seek to thicken a quatcontaining formulation with the use of salt microefficacy of the formula should be evaluatedanionic surfactants have been leveraged as antimicrobials block 2001 notes that acidanionic formulas were first leveraged in the 1930s acidic ph of 23 particularly an anionic surfactant with polyvalent cations and alkyl chain length with a good match to the cell wall lipid structure c12c16 aids in efficacywith acidic ph values of 23 nelson et al 2017 show that isoelectric points of many proteins are in this range thus causing a switch in cell charge from negative to positive this results in an improved affinity for anionic surfactants particularly those sourced from strong acids that maintain negative charge in this range such as sulfates and sulfonatesanionic surfactants without acids can also demonstrate antimicrobial activity tsujimura et al 2015 and incio et al 2011 showed that viruses can be deactivated with linear alkylbenzene sulfonate las and sodium lauryl sulfate sls respectively johnston et al 2000 show disinfection of s aureus with an sds solution sls is well known to denature proteins and is a useful part of cell lysing solutions for assays las is used as a food contact sanitizer epa 2018a and was shown to have antimicrobial efficacy in laundry however some las resistant strains were identified maehara 2017 las acid neutralized with sodium carbonate showed inhibition of several microorganisms recovered from jewelry the las ammonium salt was less effective isitua 2016 sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs is registered as an antimicrobial active that can be used in organic food processing usda 2018the best known materials in this class are amine oxides and betaines as amphoteric materials at acidic ph they can take on a positive charge thus yielding stronger affinity for cell membranes provided the cell membrane isoelectric point is not achieved birnie et al 2000 notes efficacy against s aureus and e coli with best performance at myristic or palmitic c14c16 chain lengths krasowska et al 2012 notes that a synergy in antimicrobial performance was found between cocoamidopropyl betaine and alkyl dimethyl amine oxide however the minimum inhibitory concentration of the blend was still much higher than that of benzalkonium chloride subik et al 1977 found that heterocyclic amine oxides demonstrated antimicrobial activity against bacillus yeast and molds the inhibitory concentration decreased with increasing alkyl chain length indicating that the longer chain lengths appear to interact more strongly with the cell membraneglycinebased surfactants such as dodicin dodecyldiaminoethylglycine block 2001 copello et al 2008 show efficacy on bacteria and some viruses optimal ph depends on the structure as added aminoethyl functionality demonstrates peak efficacy at higher ph values in copellos work dodicin was formulated into an antimicrobial coating that demonstrated efficacymoore 1997 reported that c10e6 and c12e6 surfactants showed efficacy against e coli the c10 material adsorbed on the cell wall whereas the c12 material entered the membrane bilayer both pathways interfered with viability c14 and c16 materials had no microbial effect in maeharas studies noted earlier polyethoxylated lauryl ether had only a minor antimicrobial effect in laundry applicationssurfaceactive glycolipids such as sophorolipids and rhamnolipids are derived biologically and have demonstrated antimicrobial activity sleiman et al 2009 magalhes and nitschke 2013 kim et al 2002 found that a sophorolipid caused the release of intercellular enzymes in grampositive bacteria indicating membrane damage and showed inhibition of mold growth but was not effective against e coli gramnegative efficacy thus varies by the type of microorganismthus if you seek to target killing a particular type of microbe a glycolipid may be a good choice cortessanchez et al 2013surfactin a cyclic polypeptide derived from species of bacillus has surfaceactive properties heerklotz and seelig 2001 antibacterial sabate 2013 and antiviral jung et al 2000 activity have been demonstrated its ability to lyze many types of cell membranes makes it a potential candidate for cancer treatment however to avoid lysis of noncancer cells targeting cancer cell receptors is needed wu 2017kabara 1972 found that fatty acids demonstrated efficacy against bacteria and yeast lauric acid was found to be the most effective of the saturated fatty acids indicating that optimal hydrophobicity plays a role in microefficacy monoenoic and dienoic cisconfiguration acids showed improved efficacy over saturated acids transconfigurations had no microefficacy among derivatives of fatty acids esterification reduces microefficacy but derivatization to aldehyde alcohol or amine forms improves it desbois and smith 2010 indicates that free fatty acids target cell membranes and disrupt electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation and may play a role in cell membrane lysis and interference in other cellular metabolic pathwayssurfactant raw materials even those that demonstrate some antimicrobial activity may require preservation this is because surfactants may not be effective against contaminating species for example they may be effective only against gramnegative bacteria or not against molds susceptible raw materials have high water activity and ph between 30 and 10 if the surfactant can tolerate ph values above 10 or below 30 ph adjustment may be an effective way to preserve the raw material vendors of preservatives can be consulted to identify the best preservative for the chemistry the processing requirements and equipment the regulations in the jurisdiction of sale and the final use of the raw material shaw 2014 srikanth 2018antimicrobial chemistry and advertising claims related to their efficacy are regulated in many countries e g epa 2018b hse 2018 cirs 2018 ec 2019 active ingredients and formulations must be registered with proof of efficacy and demonstration of safetyenvironmental impact inert ingredients must be registered as well testing protocolsregulations vary by jurisdiction and final product application these protocols require complete or nearly complete kill in a limited amount of time with a significant inocula population significant lead time may be required to process registrations for both actives and formulations and chemical efficacy and safety testing may be extensive and require significant financial investment this registration is above and beyond that for chemical registries such as the united states toxic substances control act tsca and the european inventory of existing commercial chemical substances einicsantimicrobial activity as described in this article or the references therein is not a guarantee of passing antimicrobial tests required for claims substantiation those who wish to make such claims for products they intend to market need to consult regulatory agencies in their jurisdictions for specific requirementsin this brief overview of a large and complex topic presented at the 2018 surfactants in solution conference the chemical nature of microbial interfaces was shown through case studies it was demonstrated that surfactants aid in the killing of microbes that cause illness examples of microefficacy have been demonstrated in all major surfactant classes but not all surfactants will demonstrate microefficacy not all microbes will be equally susceptible to surfactants and structural differences in a particular surfactant type can have an impact on antimicrobial efficacy microefficacy may also vary with formulation variables such as ph and ionic strength formulators who seek antimicrobial claims on disinfecting products should consult local regulations for the appropriate testing methodologies and requirements for making claims this article as it was derived from a conference presentation is not intended to be a full review of this topic but an overview to guide those formulating antimicrobial cleaning products for inanimate surfacesthe author declares no conflict of interestour hospital was the first outside the united states to be accredited by the joint commission and to subsequently maintain accreditation by the joint commission international the organization has state-of-the-art infection control practices and procedures the hospital was one of the first in the world to deal with mers-cov cases when 99 patients who met the case definition of suspected mers-cov were admitted of those cases 17 tested positive and 82 tested negative for mers-cov between april 1 2013 and june 3 201311 12 13 of the positive cases as described previously 30 had healthcareassociated infections because the hospital received patients in transfer from other facilities2 in this study we aimed to re-evaluate the impact of these cases on infection control practices including the use of gloves surgical masks n95 respirators alcohol-based hand sanitizer and soap expressed as ml per 1000 patient-days data on the monthly use of gloves pairs surgical masks and n95 respirators were obtained from the central supply service assessed based on retrospective analysis of overall supply ordering by the hospital and expressed per 1000 patient-days we also evaluated any change in monthly hand hygiene compliance rates the data span from may 2012 to july 2013 and include the pre-mers period may 2012 to march 2013 the mers period april to may 2013 and the post-mers period june to july 2013 data were extracted from the infection control database and monthly patient days were obtained from the health information unit this study was approved by the institutional review board of the johns hopkins aramco healthcareduring the observation period the utilization of personal protective equipment ppe with cases of mers-cov compared with the period before mers-cov cases increased dramatically from 29474 to 102839 per 1000 patient-days p  0000001 for surgical masks and from 22 to 232 per 1000 patient days p  0000001 for n95 masks fig 1
 it is interesting to note that the increase in utilization of n95 masks preceded the increase in surgical mask utilization by about 1 monththe utilization of alcohol-based hand sanitizer and soap is shown in figure2
 there was a significant increase in the used amount p  0000001 hand hygiene compliance rates are shown in figure2 the hand hygiene compliance rate increased from 73 just before the occurrence of the first mers case to 88 during mers cases p  0001 fig 3
 the monthly added cost was 16400 for the included infection control items such as hand sanitizers soap surgical masks and n95 respiratorsin the most recent updates by the world health organization a total of 2040 31 cases were healthcare facilityassociated infections14 in addition initial mers-cov symptoms tend to be nonspecific and might not be noticed thus adherence to standard precautions is a critical factor in the prevention of mers-cov transmission14 this adherence as well as the initial uncertainty about transmission routes early in the course of the disease had resulted in widespread fear of mers-cov it is known that application of standard infection control results in the termination of mers-cov outbreaks2 4

15 16 here we showed a significant increase in the use of ppe mainly surgical masks respirators alcohol-based hand sanitizer and soap there was a significant increase in the utilization of surgical masks and respirators during the study period there are mixed recommendations for the care of patients with mers-cov with regard to placing patients in airborne isolation and thus the use of n95 respirators droplet precautions and surgical masks7 15

17 18 the use of surgical masks was noted to increase significantly during the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic with a reported 52 increase in use19 this increase in the use of ppe is paralleled by an increase in cost it is recommended that hospitals maintain an adequate supply of ppe for use during infectious disease outbreaks in 1 study it was calculated that 4 sets of ppe n95 respirators double gloves gowns and goggles per day are needed for each healthcare worker in the high-risk group and 2 sets of ppe are required for medium- and low-risk groups20 another implication for the increased use of ppe is the generation of medical waste which we did not address in this study in 1 simulation exercise an additional 570 l of waste was generated per day21
we were not able to show a significant increase in hand hygiene practices despite the significant increase in utilization of alcohol-based hand sanitizers this observation may be related to the fact that baseline hand hygiene was about 88 in the preceding months however the hand hygiene compliance rate dropped to 73 just before the occurrence of the first mers case and then picked up to 88 p  0001 it has been shown that both observation and a multifaceted approach increase hand hygiene compliance22 23 and that utilization of secret shoppers may give a false sense of the actual rates of hand hygiene compliance24 another possible explanation is that the utilized soap and hand sanitizer may have been used by patients and visitorsalthough the data are from 2013 which may be considered a limitation they are still valid because this is the only study documenting the burden of this new virus on health infrastructure even though 5years have elapsed since its emergence other limitations of the study include the fact that the presented data are small and represent only one nonministry of health hospital and it was not possible to use the data to draw conclusions regarding a national estimate of disease burden there are multiple hospitals supervised by the ministry of health in addition to other hospitals supervised by various institutions and the private sectorthere was a significant increase in the utilization of surgical masks respirators soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the study period such an increase is a challenge and adds cost to the healthcare systempaleopathology enables us to discover the high incidence of diseases in the early inhabitants of the earth especially where such diseases left their mark on bones it is thus possible to detect remnants of tumors infections necrosis osteoporosis and malformations as also traumatisms dental alterations rickets rheumatism and other diseases of the bones today laboratory analysis allows the possibility of detecting remnants of other diseases germs or lesions in animal or human remains including of course the famous mummies from the first settlements in the fertile crescent changes have taken place in the relationship of man and animals with their environment and it is possible to establish an extensive catalog of diseases that have largely subsisted down to this very day particularly significant are the forms of settlement the crops and hunting and the contact of man with cattle pets and parasites as well as the relations between peoples through mixing and trade wars and migrationsmalaria originated in tropical africa accompanying the dawn of humanity from plasmodia infecting animals and hominids caused by different plasmodia plasmodium vivax and plasmodium falciparum among others with different geographical distribution its relation with human populations is shaped by migrations and deforestation hunting and farming climate and soils crops animals and foods and a complicated immunity resulting from ancient genetic mutations and new infections thus with the early human emigrations it expanded through eurasia and in the third millennia bc malaria had already set in the early civilizations in marshy areas where the water the climate and the crops provided the conditions for the anopheles mosquitoes to infect in crowded populations evidence for the existence of intermittent fevers is already to be found in ancient cultures finding suitable conditions along the yellow indus ganges euphrates or nile riversdifferent interpretations considered the disease to originate from climatic or environmental factors from particles or small animals because of spirits or gods or from unbalanced or disharmonic alterations the connection between fevers splenomegaly and marshy areas appears in the hippocratic texts such as on airs waters and places deforestation agriculture temperature and a greater population density as well as military and commercial movements favor the spread of the disease in italy in republican times the disease becomes acute and it was recommended that the marshy lands be either abandoned or sold and that people should dwell on high ground  the latter being traditional advice and here defense reasons also counted also the cleaning and draining of swamps was considered this being the origin of systems of engineering sanitation the spread of malaria got worse and worse in rome owing to negligence and flooding climate and agricultural changes wars travels and migrations and it reached its zenith at the time of the fall of the roman empire a cataclysm to which it may have contributed but when the old empire declined another frightening ghost traveled through the mediterranean seaplagues were considered in ancient cultures as diseases originating in gods punishment with a violent pattern and quick and terrible diffusion affecting and killing a large number of persons destructive epidemic catastrophes were narrated frequently in mesopotamian biblical egyptian indian or chinese sources and in 430426 bc thucydides describes the plague of athens in the war against sparta but it is doubtful that this case refers to the bubonic plague this epidemic death is considered the beginning of the decline of athenian hegemony the crisis of the democracy and culture of the pericles era fear war siege of the city and its maritime port were accompanied by the death of the great ruler pericles later on the first reliable description of this disease is that given by rufus of ephesus in the ad first to the second century in the epoch of trajan and in the sixth century the plague of justinian initiates the first great epidemic cycles of bubonic plague soldiers and merchants animals and merchandises and slaves and prisoners all contribute to linking up the extremes of the known world a consequence of this contact was the antonine plague in the second century this plague and others  is attributed to smallpox a disease that had already existed as far back as 3000 years ago as certain mummies showin the middle ages leprosy spread widely allegedly as a result of the increasing eastwest relations trough trade travels and wars this biblical and present day disease is accompanied by social repulse and malignant connotations since dirtiness and overcrowding provided the conditions for the spread of the otherwise not extremely contagious mycobacterium leprae in this respect the way to santiago de compostela where pilgrims slept in groups and under unhealthy and dirty conditions provided a fertile ground for this disease another markedly religious character is to be found in the sacred fire st anthonys fire or ergotism a disease that developed in people eating rye infected by ergot it was soon prevented but reappeared during the course of severe faminesthese diseases are linked to many others that owed their spread to squalor and poverty for example parasites and infections scabies mycoses and lice anthrax and ophthalmia natural catastrophes wars poverty and famines were escorted by mental diseases tuberculosis and pneumonia traumatisms and poisonings diarrheal diseases and fevers as well as smallpox and measles in the mediterranean basin malaria continued to be endemic with the population tending to resort to residing on the hills and mountains far from marshy lands the extension of malaria involved south and southeast of asia central china and japan and also north europe the plague set in the growing cities with the burden of rats and fleas making this disease an explicative example par excellence of epidemic history a second epidemic cycle began with the black death in 1348 commerce and the cities collapsed giving rise to the origin of the modern european kingdoms at this time venice established control over persons and ships in order to avoid the spread of plague arriving from distant lands dark ages are ending and new worlds are opening in culture and geographyeuropean expansion meant a sudden traffic of diseases mostly toward the new world the discovery of america with its scattered population devoted to agriculture where there were no dirty cities and where the inhabitants were devoid of immunity to the diseases of old europe produced an enormous demographic crisis certain diseases such as smallpox and measles ravaged the indigenous population this very contagious and harsh illness was introduced in the caribbean and mexico and destroyed american indigenous populations syphilis came supposedly from america although other human treponematoses were present in other continents brought back by the spaniards and it caused havoc since renaissance in europe and soon all around the world troop movements spread an unknown disease called tabardillo or typhus exanthematicus bringing about serious suffering for armies and poor people sea voyages led to the development of scurvy due to the lack of fresh foodother diseases also voyaged overseas such as yellow fever although it originated from africa due to the commerce of slaves and merchandise special temperature conditions and mosquitoes as vectors were required for the contagion in the seventeenth century it took root in brazil and also spread to the caribbean and throughout america reaching new york and boston and likewise colombia ecuador and peru it affected warm america and europe through the iberian peninsula immunity and cutoffs in commerce stalled the disease but it remains endemic in tropical areas of america and africa also malaria arrived to america with the european conquest in sixteenth century beginning in the caribbean and central america and soon spreading to south and north america becoming endemic in hot wet and low lands malaria was combated since the seventeenth century by the use of cinchona bark peruvian bark found in peru as an indigenous medical practice later on the quinine  the alkaloid obtained from the bark in french laboratories  gave rise to rich industry and trade trees were cultivated in british and dutch colonies mainly in java after being taken in the second world war by the japanese army synthetic products such as atebrine and chloroquine were obtained getting worse with agriculture mining and livestock changes settlements and slavery trade malaria became  together with yellow fever  a scourge along the warm and hot reaches throughout the american conflicts between european empires and later during the american independence wars both diseases played an important role infecting and killing nonimmune soldiersplague slowed demographic growth in europe since the wars between modern and powerful nations the crowded and dirty cities and the developing trades impeded protection against the disease the great writer daniel defoe remembered the terrible contagion in london in 1665 in journal of the plague year after the great european plague of marseille in 1720 the relative peace of the eighteenth century allowed western europe to set up sea and land defenses with austria becoming a solid bulwark in the face of the ottoman empire thus sealing off all possible spread of the plague toward the middle of the nineteenth century the third wave of the disease broke out and with the exception of europe it spread to all countries including asia africa and paradises like america and australia leaving remnants in many places the eradication of plague in europe was a result of the advent of public hygiene immunity to disease and the disappearance of rats and of the old and dirty wooden buildings the great london fire in 1666 purified the city since the hygienic rebuilding was carried out in stone eliminating animals and dirtthe disappearance of plague from europe was followed by the outbreak of cholera which had been endemic in india for centuries this disease was described by western travelers in the sixteenth century and its spread to europe and america was a consequence of pilgrimages trade and a lack of cleanliness in water a great pandemic broke out in 1817 from india and spread through eastern africa and southern asia arriving to china and the philippines and in a second wave it spread through persia reaching russia and poland in 1830 then this second wave swept across europe and reached america by 1832 throughout 100 years terrible waves spread from the east however the timely and necessary cleansing of urban water supplies helped to progressively stall its advance nevertheless as late as 1892 the free hanseatic city of hamburg suffered an outbreak of cholera epidemic while the neighboring altona governed by the prussian reich was able to avoid the disease thanks to the successful filtering of its water local and national governments advanced in hygiene and they attempted to bring about healthier cities by means of appropriate public health measures the nineteenth century sees the beginning of the demographic revolution in europe followed by developing countries in america for example with a sharp decline in mortality especially maternalinfant mortality old inoculation and the new vaccination proposed in 1798 by edward jenner fought smallpox successfully studies about human immunity since the last decades of nineteenth century began a new medical approach to the prevention and understanding of illness being successful in the contention of many diseases which have a long record of burdens and deaths mother care also advanced both throughout pregnancy and at childbirth and during lactationthe rise of great and industrial cities with low-grade outskirts and the emigration of peasants to the city favored the spread of maladies associated with poverty hard work squalor lack of appropriate food and exposure of people devoid of defenses some of the diseases were strictly occupational as in the case of miners and textile workers who were exposed to injury and to industrial poisons that affected the proletariat sir percivall pott described in the eighteenth century the cancer produced in professional cleaners chimney sweep by chemical toxics contained in soot many other diseases such as cancers will be attributed to chemical and physical aggressions including radioactivity other diseases were closely related to the harsh and dirty conditions of life such as spread of typhoid fever and pulmonary diseases tuberculosis spread over the turn between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and while it was represented as the disease in fashion affecting notable and distinguished people it struck the proletariat much more severely the same can be claimed regarding the enormous spread of syphilis and drug abuse beginning with alcohol and continuing with cocaine and morphinethe discovery of the microbiological origin of infectious diseases and of effective therapies against them and the development of public health changed the pathological landscape in developed countries the long way between ignaz semmelweis and alexander fleming arrived to the contention of infections in health care the twentieth century marked the descent of the high mortality rates in countries that reached high standards of sanitary development investing in health care and public health such advances have been due to public health services hospitals antibiotics surgery and vaccination and they have been reinforced by the developments in immunology and microsurgery pharmacology and biotechnology and with the promising future of genetic engineering the international health solidarity promoted by the world health organization who and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations ngos including church missionaries were accompanied by better governance of nations and internationalization of information and resources the twentieth century established a serious change in geopathology of diseases smallpox is the first disease to be considered totally eradicated with only some samples of the virus being kept at a few laboratories for study purposesa cuban doctor carlos finlay found the method by which yellow fever is transmitted through mosquitoes aedes aegypti after the cuban war and during the opening of the panama channel yellow fever and malaria were studied and faced by us army and american sanitarians walter reed william gorgas and later by the rockefeller foundation impeding mosquito reproduction and avoiding bites and spreading chemical products were useful fortunately an effective vaccine against yellow fever was later discovered during nineteenth century malaria expanded all around the world arriving to the central extensions of america and eurasia emigrations and settlements wars famines climate change and revolutions in travels such as railroads and steamships contributed during the napoleonic wars and the american civil war malaria was seriously extended as it was also during wars and revolutions in twentieth centuryin the interwar years the rockefeller foundation and the league of nations sponsored international campaigns against the disease many governmental campaigns also fought against malaria several national programs were effective from taiwan and china to the united states brazil and argentina passing across the mediterranean basin from italy to egypt opinions and campaigns oscillated between quinine treatment fighting against mosquitoes by dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt and improvements in life education and land sanitation clearing up the marshy areas malaria has been eradicated from europe thanks to drainage improvements in crop cultivation mechanical barriers quinine and modern drugs such as atebrine and chloroquine and insecticides colonial settlements entered tropical areas backed by quinine nets in beds hygiene and sanitation but transmissible diseases were continuously a serious burden for colonial armies in america africa or asia some chemical products such as ddt were a successful support for soldiers travelers merchants or settlers nevertheless in 1955 the world health assembly meeting in mexico warned against the resistance of the mosquitoes to insecticides mosquitoes are still today carrying both diseases and also dengue chagas disease produced by trypanosoma cruzi is endemic in america and sleeping sickness caused by trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and gambiense occurs in africatoday an effort is being made to involve governments in the fight against malaria a disease that represents a danger to nearly half of the worlds population in africa the situation is very serious due to the changes in agriculture and irrigation as well as in work and migrations the political and economic problems the severe droughts famines and wars the bad sanitary conditions following in the wake of housing expansion and deforestation and harsh social and economic exploitation together with the who and the united nations international childrens emergency fund unicef regional institutions such as the pan american health organization and the us government are financing programs of eradication the who through the 51st world health assembly of 1998 set up the program roll back malaria and with aid from unicef and the world bank is endeavoring to bring about economic and sanitary improvements in developing countries in twenty-first century the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria is attaining important amount of resources and success nets treated with insecticides are very useful for protection against mosquitoes today hope is also placed on vaccination and in the sterilization or genetic modification of the mosquitoes yet malaria continues to be endemic in warm zones of america asia and with severe cruelty in africathe rapid increase of world population in huge metropolitan areas was accompanied by new settlements and emigrations wars conflicts and revolutions and marginalization of aboriginal cultures and disinherited peoples throughout the past two centuries economical social and political expansion of the west led to studies on tropical medicine creating hospitals and laboratories and institutions on public health and sanitary departments cholera continues to be feared in asia between india and the far east and also in warm zones in america and africa wars and catastrophes travels and migrations as well as famines and unhealthy conditions allowed the expansion of the cholera germ the vibrio cholerae isolated by robert koch in 1883 as was the case of the recent tragedy of haiti at the end of nineteenth century the third outbreak of bubonic plague allowed its bacteriological and epidemiological description the germ of bubonic plague yersinia pestis discovered by yersin and kitasato is still to be found throughout the world the germ is carried by rats rattus rattus rat fleas are the arthropod vectors transmitting epizootic plague to humans from rodent hosts and related species but transmission among humans is also possible almost forgotten in the developed world with several and very effective antibiotic therapies there is nevertheless always the possibility that the devil may once more send his rats to the old rich citiesbut other viruses have taken its place in the twentieth century thus the very old and common influenza caused several cruel and heavy outbreaks among many others influenza pandemics began in 1918 and reappeared in 1957 1968 and 2003 these were known respectively as the spanish flu which perhaps originated in the united states the asian flu the hong kong flu and the avian flu mostly coming from asia vaccines are very useful in its prevention as they are also in the control of many infectious childhood diseases such as measles rubella mumps chicken pox whooping cough diphtheria and so on old diseases such as poliomyelitis exploded in the united states and europe affecting nonimmune children and this disease has only been controlled in developed countries by means of vaccination during the past century individuals have observed astonished the spread of new or reemerging diseases from plague cholera influenza measles and malaria to aids west nile fever avian flu severe acute respiratory syndrome resistant tuberculosis hemorrhagic fever ebola virus disease transmissible spongiform encephalopathy creutzfeldt-jakob disease and others unfortunately today many frequent or rare diseases do not have adequate treatment and many germs are developing resistance to antibiotics a serious threat for its affectivityaids has meant a development in the study of viral infections and this disease has associations with the exploitation of poor people unsafe sex and drug trading but it also affected an elite sector which has sprung rapid research in the field the world commotion surrounding this disease has served both to reveal human altruism on the one hand and on the other contempt toward those infected by the disease since aids became more and more the lot of the poor mostly in large areas of africa or india and of downcast or marginal groups such as the chronic patients drug addicts prostitutes and homosexuals nevertheless heterosexual transmission through unsafe sex and transmission from mother to child are today serious dangers safe sex and antiretroviral treatment are the best contention while a vaccine will be obtained perhaps in the coming futuremental affections were considered till modern times as devilish criminal or vicious behaviors more an ethical or social than a medical problem in the eighteenth century the natural explanation of mental disease was established according to alexander crichton or philippe pinel and in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries its psychogenic process following sigmund freud from pinel to freud the possibility of treatment and remedy of mental disease was established leading the soul of the patient with convictions and health measures to the cure the discovery in recent times of some effective pharmacological drugs acting on human mind and conduct has allowed better treatment reclusion was considered a doubtful possibility restricted to some severe problems the old lunatic asylums founded since middle ages were being abolished or completely renewed nevertheless mental illnesses wreak serious havoc at present times all around the world affecting all ages genders and conditions without any distinction sometimes the misunderstanding regarding mental diseases still produces cruel treatments harsh restrictions or punishmentduring the past decades economic and social improvements led to quick globalization and urbanization with longer human life and changes in disease patterns political sanitary and economic development managed to stamp out infectious morbidity and forms of suffering or living illnesses are changing unicef and who in collaboration with governments foundations and ngos promote successful campaigns of vaccination especially focusing on children the burden of infectious parasitic and transmissible diseases changed to chronic diseases and sufferings related with aging and lifestyles likewise nutritional disorders cancer or heart and brain vascular diseases on the other hand the increase in life expectation favors the development of alzheimer and other chronic and degenerative diseases neurological and muscular diseases mental affections such as schizophrenia mania and depression diabetes vascular diseases and of course the terrible presence of cancer accidents and traumatisms due to traffic and sports factories and radiation or even home accidents are something that the twenty-first century is inheriting blindness deafness dumbness and other frequent physical and mental disabilities with multiple origins in traumatisms or accidents genetic metabolic and degenerative diseases infectious diseases such as poliomyelitis or cerebral and vascular affections make daily life difficult and at the same time make economical institutional and social support necessary incapacitating and chronic diseases lead to severe dependency and so the need for protection of disabled individuals is leading to the founding of patients associations looking for help and justice creating new rights and demands ghettos and migrations hard work poverty and unemployment and some of the old drugs such as alcohol heroine and tobacco or new synthetic ones are causing havoc even to the rich worldbut in developing countries the old morbidity due to transmissible diseases continues to exist maintaining a very low life expectation certainly the increase of migrations and of urban population are requiring more water food and energy producing climate warming deforestation and agriculture changes and dangerous issues such as waste toxics and pollutants potable water health services medical care or medical drugs sanitation and hygiene are urgently requested environmental degradation and the confrontations between national social and ethnic groupings are a serious danger for healthy life china japan and south korea and other expanding countries have lived through these challenges in different ways from diverse british colonies such as australia or india different traditions and cultures are extremely important to understand the relations between peoples and diseases death is most rampant amid the least protected and poorest people especially women children and the elderly with harsh sufferings such as wars famine and exploitation under such circumstances diseases caused by deprivation and infection continue to be the most rampant causing high death rates among the population old and new diseases such as malaria and aids are ruining great stretches of africa leprosy and cholera tuberculosis and tetanus and many child diseases such as mumps measles tetanus or meningitis are in poor countries and populations the salt of the earth private and public funds and international solidarity are always necessary for relieving these harsh sufferings the united nations millennium development goals are also facing themaccording to the who report global health risks 2009 the better or worse conditions for mortality and for the burden of disease are seriously conditioned by several circumstances related to lifestyles blood pressure blood glucose physical activity alcohol and tobacco weight safe sex safe water sanitation and hygiene obviously these circumstances and their consequences are very different depending on the social level of individuals and the public health governance of nations and peoples if developing countries are freeing themselves from transmissible diseases now they are fighting against noncommunicable diseases related to social level health organization and hygienic customs some american asian and african countries are still supporting a terrible burden of disease which is also shared by low-income population in developed countries the rio political declaration in the world conference on social determinants of health who-rio de janeiro brazil 21 october 2011 is a new call looking for equity justice and universality of health it has recommended adopting better governance for health and development promoting information justice and participation in policy making and during the implementation process including civil society like indigenous people and reducing health inequities in the health sector this declaration promotes research on the relationships between social determinants and differences economic ethnic and gender inequalities and health equity we are all convinced about the relation between poverty social discrimination low education and low sanitation and diseases and death

action so that court decisions or new laws are needed to adjudicate precedents for the futurethe 20th century was replete with mass murders executions and genocide with nationalistic ideological and racist motives perpetrated by fascist stalinist and radical xenophobic political movements when gaining governmental power by election or by revolution in some cases using then-common public health terminology and concepts in the 21st century radical jihadist terrorist groups and governments such as in syria not only conduct mass killing of civilians but also target ethnic minorities and religious groups with active genocide including deliberate use of chemical weapons mass starvation rape murder and enslavement against civilians with bombings of civilians medical workers and hospital facilitiespublic health policy is guided by two distinct but interactive paradigms the biotechnological disease and the social-ecological health paradigms in the 19th century these were the germ theory and the miasma theories long at loggerheads yet both produced enormous gains in public health the biomedical paradigm addresses alleviation of disease risk or manifest diseases with immunizations screening and risk-factor reduction the social health paradigm addresses the improvement of the physical and socioeconomic environment and healthy living with the objectives of reducing disease and inequities in health between socioeconomic and regional population health disparitiesduring the early part of the twentieth century a segment of the social hygiene movement adopted ideas of racial improvement by compulsory termination of pregnancies and sterilization of the mentally ill retarded and other undesirable persons by 1935 when the nazi sterilization laws were passed about 20 states in america already had sterilization laws in effect with concurrence of the us supreme court american eugenics policies were praised by hitler and these ideas were adopted in nazi germany leading to execution of half a million undesirables under the eugenics concept and were adapted for mass extermination of jews gypsies homosexuals and others during the holocaustthe policies of eugenics were widely promoted by medical professionals in sweden the united states and canada this led to adoption of policies and programs to force legally sanctioned sterilization of mentally handicapped or mentally ill patients this practice was attractive to nazi policy before and after its rise to power in 1933 with wide support among the medical and psychiatric professions between 1939 and 1941 180000 psychiatric and physically handicapped patients were killed in germany with the active participation by medical doctors psychiatrists nurses and ancillary personnel under direct guidance of the so called t4 program named after the address of hitlers headquarters from where it was directedthis corruption of public health distorted a socially oriented concept of public health to a racially oriented policy with horrendous actions of mass murder in the name of racial purity as a public health policy this policy was supported and implemented by leading psychiatrists in a number of western liberal democratic countries providing a precedent adopted and expanded in monstrous manners in nazi germany with nearly total support and participation of a highly nazified medical profession the t4 program utilized starvation and gassing to kill helpless people and these methods became the direct antecedent to the mass murder of jews gypsies homosexuals soviet prisoners and other undesirablesa noted cambridge professor of modern history sir richard evans wroteat the heart of german history in the war years lies the mass murder of millions of jews in what the nazis called the final solution to the jewish question in europe this book provides a full narrative of the development and implementation of this policy of genocide while also setting it in the broader context of nazi racial policies toward the slavs and toward gypsies homosexuals petty criminals and asocials preface xivevans continues for many years and not merely since 1933 the medical profession particularly in the field of psychiatry had been convinced that it was legitimate to identify a minority of handicapped as a life unworthy of life and that it was necessary to remove them from the chain of heredity if all the many measures to improve the health of the german race under the third reich were not to be frustrated virtually the entire medical profession has been actively involved in the sterilization programme and from here it was but a short step in the minds of many to involuntary euthanasia page 82 by the time the main killing programme had ended in august 1941 a large part of the medical and caring professions had been brought in to operate the machinery of murder the circle of those involved had grown inexorably wider until general practitioners psychiatrists social workers asylum staff orderlies nurses and managers drivers and many others had become involved through a mixture of bureaucratic routine peer pressure propaganda and inducements and rewards having proved itself in this context it was ready to be applied in others on a far larger scale p 101the t4 euthanasia program was administered directly from hitlers main office the euthenasia program was preceded by mass sterilization of nearly 400000 unfit germans before the war broke out p 105evans rj the third reich at war new york penguin press 2006
the human and national cost of genocide lasts for generations the hatred and fear may wane but the trauma goes deep it lasts with the victims and their descendants but also with the perpetrating country and its culture the nazi holocaust has downstream effects in public health in german-speaking countries over 65 years since the events took place the eugenic theory assumption was that a healthy population must be free of racially contaminated individuals and inferior groups which led to a public policy to eliminate racially unclean members through forced sterilization and murder opening the door to a euthanasia program of mass execution of mentally and physically handicapped germans and others in psychiatric facilities which provided a working model for the industrialized murder of the holocaust this was in direct conflict to a 200-year tradition of germanys socially-oriented public health grounded in the political philosophy of human rights and social justice many of whose advocates were mostly exiled or murdered many of the nazi oriented academic medical leaders during world war ii remained in key positions in the german public sector for many following decadesthe nuremberg doctors trial in 194647 convicted many leading nazi physicians of crimes against humanity with severe punishments including hanging or long prison terms however many in the medical profession aligned with these horrors remained in leading positions in the medical communityone even being elected to head the world medical association then discussing the helsinki declaration of ethics in biomedical research before being forced to resign the nuremberg trials and the subsequent helsinki declaration laid the fundamentals of biomedical ethics with regulations and requirements of ethical procedures and the institutional research board often referred to as helsinki committees these were established by individual research centers universities hospitals and other health care facilities to supervise and approve or refuse applications seeking funding conducting and publishing research involving human subjectsthe reappearance of genocide in the late twentieth century in the balkans and rwanda and in the twenty-first century in darfur with over 300000 deaths and 25 million displaced persons highlight this as a public health concern and its prevention as a public health and international political responsibility incitement to genocide is now considered a crime against humanity and was the basis for trials and convictions of leaders of the rwandan tutsi tribe as well as inciters to ethnic violence and the political leaders and perpetrators of mass murders in the former yugoslav republic the threat and practice of genocide is still present whether it is the murderous raids of sudanese janjaweed militias in darfur and south sudan or the threats of genocide by iran and associated terrorist organizations against israel and jews in general the killing of christians in northern nigeria muslims in myanmar and the genocidal civil war in syria incitement to genocide is now accepted as part of international discourse including the united nations which acted to accommodate the rwanda massacres in 2003the risk of silent genocide is present in the 21st century with forced migration limiting access rights of refugees to host countries use of chemical weapons against civilian targets use of starvation mass rape and abuse of civilian displaced persons and persecution including mass murder expulsion and slavery of minority ethnic religious and refugee populationsthe unicef report of 2017 states 2016 was one of the most dangerous years to be a child in recent memory millions of children were threatened and displaced by crises around the world millions more faced poverty deprivation violence exploitation and discrimination there are 66 million displaced persons in the world in 2017 who are refugees from war endemic violence terror sexual violence and slavery ethnic violence chemical warfare bombing civilians and medical facilities hazardous journeys to safety and starvation as a tool of warfare all forms of genocide all of this in the 21st century when never again was the slogan following the holocaust and other horrors of the 20th centurygenocide represents the most extreme assault on human rights and protection for life in the 20th century an estimated 200 million have perished from genocide an outline of genocides of the past 100 years is seen in box 132

demonization delegitimization disinformation and denial are danger signs of potential genocidal actions genocide results from human choice and bystander indifference one lesson of the holocaust and subsequent genocides is that silence by nations and international organizations constitutes complicity the public health community has a responsibility to speak out publicly on genocidal threats and its early warning signs see box 131human experimentation has been a subject of great concern since the nazi and imperial japanese armed forces horrific experiments on prisoners and concentration camp victims during world war ii the nuremberg trials set forth ten principles of professional responsibility to comply with internationally acceptable medical behavior in regard to research on humans see table 132

standards have become the international norm for experiments with national- state- and hospital-helsinki committees regulating research proposals within their jurisdiction funding agencies require standard approval by the appropriate helsinki committee sometimes called institutional review boards irbs or ethical review boards erbs before considering any proposal with informed consent on any research project the process recognizes that medical progress is based on research that must include studies involving human subjects but medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for human subjects and protect their health and rights the key issues examined includeresearch objectives should outweigh the risks and burdens to the research subjectsresearch should conform to generally accepted scientific principles and literatureparticipants are volunteersinformed consent must be obtained including warning of potential risksrisks are minimized and monitoredrespect for privacy and confidentialityrespect for human rightsscientific integritysocial solidarity and paternalismfairness and equityif the results are definitively positive the research should be stopped
the tuskegee experiment see box 133
 conducted in alabama from 1932 to 1972 by the us public health service usphs was a grave and tragic violation of medical ethics it was initiated in the context of the 1930s and consistent with widespread and institutionalized racism detached from humanist values and historical medical ethics of first do no harm the tuskegee experiment and a following similar study conducted by the usphs in conjunction with the ministry of health in guatemala are remembered as important ethical transgressions which have had repercussions until the present time resulting in suspicion of public health endeavors particularly among the african-american community in the us even after a public apology in 1997 by then president bill clintonbox 133the tuskegee experimentthe tuskegee experiment was carried out by the us public health service between 1932 and 1972 it was meant to follow the natural course of syphilis in 399 infected african-american men in alabama and 201 uninfected men the men were not told that they were being used as research subjects the experiment had been intended to show the need for additional services for those infected with syphilis however when penicillin became available in 1942 the researchers did not inform or offer the men treatment even those who were eligible when drafted into the army in 1942 the experiment was stopped in 1972 as ethically unjustified when the media exposed it to public scrutinythe case is considered unethical research practice because in the time it was conducted it did not provide the patients with information on the research nor on the availability of curative care when it became available the patients well-being was put aside in the interest of a descriptive studya similar experiment was conducted by the us public health service in full cooperation with the guatemala ministry of health during 19461948 in which soldiers prisoners and others were deliberately exposed to prostitutes known to be infected with syphilis this experiment was terminated when it was revealed in the us media by a historianin 1997 president bill clinton apologized to the survivors and families of the men involved in the experiment on behalf of the us government the tuskegee experiment is the source of widespread lingering suspicion of public health in the african-american community to the present timesource adapted from tulchinsky

between practice and research is not always easy to define in public health which has surveillance of population health as one of its major tasks this surveillance is mostly anonymous but relies on individually identifiable data needed for reportable and infectious disease control as well as for causes of death birth defects mass screening programs and other special disease registries it may also be necessary to monitor the effects of chronic disease for example to ascertain repeat hospitalizations of patients with congestive heart failure to assess the long-term effects of treatment and the effects strengthening ambulatory and outreach services to sustain chronic patients at a safe and functional level in their own homespreventive care practiceseg sanitation healthy and safe food and diets health promotion immunizations prenatal care newborn screening pap smears mammography and colonoscopiesas well as access to medical care and hospital utilization are all part of public health monitoring and impact assessment of preventive programs may require special surveys such as those conducted by the us national health and nutrition studies nhanes and are important to assess health and nutritional status as well as other measures of health status and risk factors such as smoking and exercise every effort in public health research must be made to preserve anonymity and privacy for the individual but in some cases such as reporting of contagious diseases or birth defects case contact is crucial this can entail identifying people who attended an event or were on an airplane where an infected person may have been  such as with measles or antibiotic resistant tuberculosis  so as to take appropriate preventive measuresthe general distinction between research and practice has to do with the intent of the activity clinical research uses experimental methods to establish the efficacy and safety of new or unproven interventions many drugs and procedures in common use have never been subjected to randomized controlled trials in practice many methods are devised that are held to be effective and safe by expert opinion and documented as such researchers comparing hiv or hepatitis b transmission rates among intravenous drug users not using needle exchange programs would be doing unethical research according to accepted current standards by giving safe needles to the experimental group and withholding them from the control group the scientific justification of an experiment must be made explicit but would not likely be approved by an ethical review board helsinki committee in some cases of new therapy for life threatening conditions the fda will fast track what are called orphan drugs urgently needed as happened with the nih recommendation for antiretroviral art drugs for hivaids this turned out to be a major success for treatment and prevention of hiv faucci 2014 clinical equivalence is a necessary condition of all clinical and public health research and provision of standard of care treatment to control groups is a minimal requirement for most research ethics boards determination of the standard and whether it should be place time and community specific is an area of ongoing controversya 1996 us public health service study supported by the us national institutes of health nih and who compared a short course of zidovudine azt to a placebo given late in pregnancy to hiv-positive women in thailand measuring the rate of hiv infection among the newborns the experiment was terminated when a protest editorial appeared in a prominent medical journal this study confirmed previous findings that azt given during late pregnancy and labor reduced maternal-fetal hiv transmission by half the findings indicate that azt should be used in developing countries and the manufacturers agreed to make it available at reduced costs the result has been a major success with more recent medications to reduce maternalfetal transmission of hiv in many places in africa with important financial and professional support from the global alliance for vaccine initiatives gavi international donors and a slowing of the spread of hiv- and aids-related

 the importance of responsible medical journalism to keep a watchful eye on the possibilities of misleading scientific publications is of great importance for the ethical and legal aspects of public healthbox 134the wakefield effectin 1998 one of the top medical journals in the world lancet published an article by a number of well-known researchers headed by dr andrew wakefield the article reported on 12 cases of autistic children and allegedly showed a connection to immunization with mmr vaccine measles-mumps-rubellathe immediate effect of this revelation was widespread alarm in the united kingdom and abroad concerning mmr vaccine and a drop in immunization coverage with measles-containing vaccines in the united kingdom and elsewhere this was mainly triggered by mothers refusing to have their child vaccinated with the risk of autism as a result measles epidemics occurred in the united kingdom and in many other countries with the disease again becoming endemic in many parts of europe and spreading to north and south america by travelers and touristsafter a long series of investigative journalism in the british press the article came under scientific scrutiny and the withdrawal of many of the coauthors but consistent insistence by the lead author of its authenticity coauthors admitted to having been credulous and insufficiently vigilant in agreeing to be associated with the paper british medical authorities later found dr wakefield guilty of medical fraud and the uk general medical council withdrew his license to practice medicine in 2000 12 years after the original publication lancet formally withdrew the article this fraudulent scientific publication caused a serious loss of the credibility of immunization in general and especially regarding mmr vaccine one of the greatest life savers of public healththe return of measles in europe to endemicity with frequent international transmission fostered loss of confidence by mothers in immunization measles-containing vaccines were particularly affected due to the publicity given to the wakefield case and issues of scientific integrity fraud and conflict of interests were proven in this case the journal editors failed to ensure the scientific integrity of the lead author and coauthors and were negligent in failure of the journal to retract fraudulent and disproven publications in real time instead of waiting 12 years after publicationin other public health issues single publications of findings of small sample and poorly assessed studies published in haste without adequate critical review occur frequently in electronic media the problem of disinformation provokes great anxiety and rejection of well-established successful public health interventions such as fluoridation and folic acid fortification of flour with unsubstantiated and disproven claims that they may cause cancer asthma and other ill effectsthe interface between ethics law and science in public health requires continuous sensitivity to the downstream effects of reducing public trust and reduced parental compliance with immunization of their children and putting other children at risksource adapted from tulchinsky th varavikova ea the new public heath 3rd edition san diego ca academic presselsevier 2014 chapter 15 box 1518 page 814 wakefield aj murch sh anthony a linnell j casson dm malik m et al ileal lymphoid nodular hyperplasia non-specific colitis and pervasive developmental disorder in children retracted lancet 1998351637641 accessed 17 april 2017 office of research integrity definition of research misconduct available at httporihhsgovmisconductdefinitionmisconductshtml murch sh anthony a casson dh malik m berelowitz m dhillon ap et al retraction of an interpretation lancet 2004363750 available at httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed15016483 accessed 21 april 2017 godlee f smith j marcovitch h editorial wakefields article linking mmr vaccine and autism was fraudulent bmj 2011342c7452 available at httpwwwbmjcomcontent342bmjc7452 accessed 17 april 2017 tulchinsky th varavikova ea the new public health 3rd edition san diego ca academic presselsevier 2014 page 814the office of research integrity of the us department of health and human services defines research misconduct as fabrication falsification or plagiarism in proposing performing or reviewing research or in reporting research results
fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them
falsification is manipulating research materials equipment or processes or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record

plagiarism is the appropriation of another persons ideas processes results or words without giving appropriate credit
research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion
the prevalence and publication of erroneous information and compromised research findings is an ongoing issue in the 21st century which can spread false information in the media such as the internet this can have serious negative consequences for population health pseudoscience can feed populist movements with tragic consequences in public healthhelsinki research ethics committees or institutional review committees are responsible to ensure that ethical principles are maintained in research proposals and publication of results of such research these principles include informed consent confidentiality and scientific integrity publication in peer-reviewed journals is essential for establishing and advancing the evidence base for public health practice poor or fraudulent science can have a substantial adverse impact on public opinion both on health issues and on the priorities in the allocation of resources it is essential that journal editors and reviewers adhere to high ethical and professional standards they must be vigilant to avoid allowing poor professional standards of articles to be published or allowing non-professional factors or conflicts of interest to distort decision-making processes professional integrity and high scientific standards are vital to advance public health practiceethical issues between the individual patients and health care providers are important in health systems a doctor is expected to use diligence care knowledge skill discretion and caution in keeping with practice standards accepted at the time by responsible medical opinion and to maintain the basic medical imperative to do no harm to the patient patients should have the right to free choice of provider and treatment to observance of quality standards access to high quality health services to be informed of his or her condition give informed consent to confidentiality of personal and health information and to physical privacy during care and diagnosis to available alternatives for treatment to be informed of the risks and benefits involved and to complain and seek compensation for negligence ideally patients have the right of access to high quality health services to safety and freedom from harm caused by lack of resources geographic inequality poor functioning of health services and from medical malpractice and errors patients rights include the right of access to innovative procedures including diagnostic procedures according to international standards and independent of economic or financial considerations patients may seek alternative medical opinions but this right is not unlimited as any insurance plan or health service may place restrictions on payment for further opinions and consultation without the agreement of a primary care provider which is called the gatekeeper rolehealth insurance providers have responsibility beyond that of payment for health service and individual care by a physician in institutions or through services in the community or the home the contract for service is becoming less between an individual physician and the patient but increasingly among a health system provider group staff and a client this places a new onus on the physician to ensure that patients receive the care they require conversely the us provider often faces the dilemma of knowing that a patient may not access needed services because of a lack of adequate health insurance and the terrible practice of exclusions due to prior health conditionsthe imperative to save a life is an important ethical and practical issue in health care principles of physician-assisted euthanasia were based on a legal process including psychiatric assessment physician-aided suicide of a patient is facilitated by providing the means or informationeg indication of a lethal medication dosageprovided by a physician who is aware of the patients intent both are based on the right of the patient to decide to die with dignity when their illness is terminal and the individual is suffering excessively this is not a medical decision alone it is also an agonizing issue for society to addressthe nazi euthanasia program in germany in the 1930s and its subsequent application as mass extermination in the holocaust with grossly unethical human experimentation provided the direst of warnings to societies of what may follow when the principle of the sanctity of individual human life is breached the issue however returned to the public agenda in the 1980s and 1990s as advances in medical science have allowed the prolongation of human life beyond hope of recoverylegislation in the netherlands belgium the us assisted suicide in six us states washington dc oregon vermont california colorado and montana as of april 2017 northern australia and canada legally sanctioned passive euthanasia ie withdrawing medical assistance with various safeguards in a variety of circumstances such as long-term comas or late stages of terminal illnesses the legislation in canada known as dying with dignity  is the federal regulatory framework with strict criteria for eligibility and procedures provides for medical assistance in dying for those persons with a grievous and irremediable medical condition they have made a voluntary request for medical assistance in dying that in particular was not made as a result of external pressure and they give informed consent to receive medical assistance in dying after having been informed of the means that are available to relieve their suffering the person must be eligible for government-funded health services and be over 18 years doctors patients relatives and health care organizations need clear guidelines orientation procedures legal protection and limitations where failure to take the utmost steps to save the patient by intubation resuscitation or transplantation may cause legal jeopardy protection of the elderly or chronically ill from malicious application of this form of merciful death must ensure that it is truly the patients wish this requires well defined procedures with legal social psychiatric and medical participationeven though a distinction can be drawn theoretically between permitting and facilitating death in practice doctors in intensive care units face such decisions regularly where the line is often blurred hospital doctors routinely take extreme measures to prolong the life of hopeless cases such decisions should not be considered for economic reasons alone but in practice the costs of care of the terminally ill will be a driving force in debate of the issue living wills allow a patient to refuse heroic measures such as resuscitation with do not resuscitate standing orders and assignment of power of attorney to family members to make such decisions family attitudes are important but the social issue of redefining the right of a patient to opt for legal termination of life by medical means will be an increasingly important issue in the 21st centuryas in other spheres of medicine and health in public health the decision whether to intervene in an issue is based on identification and interpretation of the problem a case must be made of importance even if a rare condition establishing evidence of the potential of the intervention to improve the situation to do no harm and to convince the public and political leaders of the need for such intervention along with the resources to carry it out this process requires patience and a longer time frame than many other fields in healthsome interpretations of ethics in health consider that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a democratic community without asking individual permission and possibly against their will is to prevent harm to others however this is a dictum that is not always applied to public health which is obliged to act to protect health in so many spheres such as water sanitation food and drug safety and environmental health on a spectrum that extends to banning smoking in public places mandating food fortification and many other areas for improved population health in a civil societyfailure to act is an action and when there is convincing evidence of a problem that can be alleviated or prevented entirely by an accepted and demonstrably successful intervention then the onus is on the public health leaderauthority to advocate such action and to implement it as best as possible under the existing conditions failure to do so is a breach of good standards of practice and could be unethical inertia of the public health system in the face of evidence of a demonstrably effective modality such as adoption of state-of-the-art vaccines or fortification of flour with folic acid to prevent birth defects would come under this categorization and may even constitute neglect and unethical practice this is not an easy categorization because there is often disagreement and even opposition to public health interventions as was the case in opposition to vaccination long after jenners crucial discovery of this procedure in the late eighteenth century this idea is also a significant problem true today with opposition to many proven measures such as immunization fluoridation or fortification of basic foods box 135

source american public health association principles of the ethical practice of public health version 22 2002 available at httpswwwaphaorgmediafilespdfmembergroupsethicsbrochureashx accessed 15 april 2017the problem of refusals of vaccination has become an issue in the us mainly among upper middle class families in western europe delay in updating immunization programs such as the two doses of measles policy in the past has created a situation of measles outbreaks across europe since 2010 with many cases among unimmunized children or among young adults or those with only one dose and waning immunity in many low- and medium-income countries funding levels for health are minimal leading to the delay in professional or governmental acceptance of new vaccines this has been a serious issue but international donors have helped countries in sub-saharan africa to expand the range of vaccines in their routine programs with important life saving vaccines such as rotavirus and hemophilus influenza b underfunding for health is an ethical dilemma in many low- and medium-income countries in former soviet countries including the russian federation much of the overall low level of funding for health is due to their declining but still relatively high acute-care hospital bed supply with much longer average length of hospital stay leaving primary care and upgrading of immunization laggingclosure of hospitals involves difficult political and ethical decisions and is a source of dispute between central health authorities the medical professions and local communities health reforms in many industrialized countries such as reducing hospital bed supplies managed care systems promoting cost containment and reallocation of resources raise ethical and political issues often based on vested interests such as private insurance systems hospitals and private medical practitioners see chapters 8 and 15chapter 8chapter 15where there is a high level of cumulative evidence from professional literature and from public health practice in leading countries with a strong scientific base and case for action on a public health issue when does it become bad practice or even unethical public health practice to ignore and fail to implement such an intervention such ethical failures occur frequently and widely for example is it unethical to not fortify grain products with folic acid and salt with iodine when there is overwhelming evidence of safety and cost effectiveness should there be a recommended european immunization program should milk be fortified with vitamin d should vitamin and mineral supplements be given to pregnant and lactating women and children should all newborns be given vitamin k intramuscularly routinely other examples include the issues of fluoridation of water supplies and opposition to genetically modified crops or generic drugs in african countries these issues are continuously debated and the responsibility of the trained public health professional is to review the international literature on a topic and formulate a position based on the cumulative weight of evidence it is not possible to wait for indisputable evidence because in epidemiology and public health this rarely occurs this is another reason that guidelines established by respected agencies and professional bodies free from financial obligations to vested interest groups are essential to review evidence which accumulates on a continuing basis on many issues thought to have been resolved or which appear de novoa recent public health issue has been the banning of trans fats in baking and cooking with legislation in new york city and some upstate new york state counties the us food and drug administration usfda has declared trans fats found in many popular processed foods like baked goods and frozen foods to be unsafe for consumption as they contribute to heart disease the usfda promotes manufacturer compliance and will regulate banning of use of trans fats by 2018 which is expected to reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year the usfda reports that between 2003 and 2012 consumer trans fat consumption decreased about 78 percent and that the labeling rule and industry reformulation of foods were key factors in informing healthier consumer choices and reducing trans fat in foods while trans fat intake has significantly decreased the current intake remains a public health concern the institute of medicine iom recommends that consumption of trans fat be as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate dietthe who european region reports that five european countries are in the process of banning trans fats through regulation while others have decided to use self-regulatory mechanisms on the other hand virtually no countries in the european region fortify flour with folic acid to prevent birth defects neural tube defects a lapse in current international public health standards along with rising incidence of rickets in infancy due to lack of sun exposure and lack of vitamin d supplements in pregnancy care birth defects and severe rickets are increasing especially among dark skinned mothers in full body clothing for religious reasons most consumers do not know that some processed food categories contain large amounts of trans fats consumption in some population groups particularly poorer people can be very high removing trans fats from the food supply is one of the most straightforward public health interventions for reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and some cancers and improving diets a study comparing myocardial infarctions in new york counties that banned trans fat usage to counties that did not showed a greater reduction in acute myocardial infarctions in the counties that had banned trans fats the ethical issue will be to see the rate of acceptance of this finding in other jurisdictions versus traditional opposition to too much interference by the state the same issue regarding folic acid fortification of flour to reduce birth defects is similarly both a professional and ethical question virtually all european countries have ignored the evidence and fail to adopt mandatory fortification thus harming poorer population groups with less money to buy healthier foods the delay in implementation of proven safe and effective public health measures is one of the key ethical issues in public health practicethe aim of ethics education in public health should be to enhance the ability of public health professionals policy makers and citizens to reason rationally about the moral dilemmas and value conflicts inherent to human rights social justice and the application of knowledge and technology in the health sciences and in public health measuresethics analysis typically involves the capability to identify the public health issue and its contribution to health of the population this requires a review of the professional literature to know the state-of-the-art techniques and to be able to articulate the factual information to the decision-makers and the public this requires identification of the ethical issues of the case and to identify the stakeholdersthose whose rights and interests will be most directly affected by the decisions made and the values concerns and information at stake in the case the ability to identify options available to decision-makers in the case is vital to making the case for action and the decision-making process before during and after a public health event or process as in pandemic preparedness the cost of action versus inaction is a vital factortraining current faculty on public health ethics issues should be mandatory in schools of public health in order to incorporate ethics into existing courses of formal educational programs this requires specific and mandatory courses on public health ethics along with incorporation of discussion of ethical issues in core courses in the programdefining and applying ethical and high standards of practice of medical care as well as public health requires an ideological commitment to individual and community sanctity of life ethics in health also requires commitment to advancement of health care and use of best practices of international standards to the maximum extent possible under the local conditions in which the professional is working this is not an easy commitment as there is often dispute and outright hostility to public health activities in part because of past ethical distortions of great magnitude but this is an optimistic field of activity by virtue of the great achievements it has brought to humankind preparation for disasters and unanticipated health emergencies can raise issues of security quarantine isolation rationing of vaccines due to insufficient supplieseg in influenza epidemicsor restrictions on community events or family burials as in the case of ebola in west africa in 201416public health also faces slow responses to advances in the science of vaccines or in health promotion measures with proven efficacy addressing current issues is a vital part of the new public health and our ethical and professional commitments the role of public health in climate change is both a professional and ethical issue as are many other topics such as food fortification fluoridation of community water supplies access to birth control and other longstanding and new topics advancement in global health requires consensus of national governments and international bodies working together to alleviate poor health conditions with available professional standards and resource mobilization to achieve this goal most issues in public health have ethical aspects so that education on future public health requires adequate attention to the topic perhaps best presented in case studiesethical issues in public health include both definition of and decisions to act on a problem but also delay avoidance or inaction when best evidence available indicates action prevents harm to the population failure to act in a timely fashion or to allocate resources to meet clear health needs of a population can be unethical just as much as acting in a harmful way while resource allocation is a political decision failure to act can be as injurious and unethical as being directly responsible for harmful acts public health as a profession and a movement or ideology must be willing to point out the effects of nonaction as well as of ethical or nonethical acts compliance with evil is unethical and the preparation of public health workers requires understanding of how to differentiate and to how to advocate for the better choices in policy and its implementation

in 1918 the world was gripped with panic and apprehension as one of the most devastating pandemics ever recorded in human history the h1n1 influenza virus killed millions of people across the globe 12 dubbed spanish influenza the disease spread quickly ravaging the world at a time that there were no antibiotics and medicineas a fieldwas essentially infantile in its development without the benefit of modern technology data keeping was poor making it difficult to have accurate mortality and morbidity figures but even then estimates suggest that the flu killed 1 to 3 of its victims with the mortality rate reaching 10 in some communities 1 2 3 while a 1991 report 3 put the death toll in the range of 247393 million and related morbidity estimates between 25 and 90 recent publications suggest that 50100 million died as a result of the pandemic 14since 1918 the world has experienced more outbreaks of pandemic diseases the 1957 h2n2 asian influenza pandemic claimed more than two million lives the 1968 h3n2 hong kong influenza virus killed one million worldwide more recently the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov pandemic of 2002 claimed 774 lives and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov of 2012 resulted in about 300000 deaths 1 2 356 while the declining morbidity and mortality rate of each successive pandemic may be attributed to modern medicine early diagnosis ready availability of effective antibiotics to address secondary bacterial infections the availability of artificial respirators to support life and acute awareness of preventive measures gained from past pandemics the threat of a severe devastating disease of global concern remains highthe ongoing pandemic of novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 covid-19 serves as a vivid reminder that nature is unpredictable no one knows what disease epidemic might emerge and defy available clinical armamentaria with over 297 million confirmed cases and more than 260000 deaths worldwide within a mere four months as of sunday april 26 2020 the world hasonce againbecome gripped with untold fear and panic as the number of those sick or dying continues to climb by the minute 6 further raising the level of fear are the portentous economic consequences which has risen to hitherto unimaginable heights and continues to worsen that some of the worlds largest economiesthe us china germany france britain italy spain south korea and switzerlandrank among the worst hit countries cast a dark shadow on the future of the world as we know it these developments call for immediate mobilization of every available tool to fight the disease a frantic search for effective treatments is underway to stem the pandemic and give hope to billions quarantinedwillingly or unwillinglyworldwide however the world continues to race against time given the rate of spread and the long period usually required to develop effective vaccineswhereas some of the important lessons learned from past pandemics such as social distancing the use of facemasks and the search for new vaccines have been marshalled to mitigate the pandemic records indicate that phototherapy one of the most effective tools used to minimize the impact of the 1918 pandemic and other disease epidemics 7 8 9 has been overlooked this paper suggests that phototherapy a seemingly forgotten treatment for bacterial and viral infections has immense potential to reduce the impact of covid-19 pandemic and similar coronavirus infections particularly in view of recent developments in the field further it reviews contemporary evidence for this assertion and offers suggested ways that modern healthcare may integrate readily available inexpensive light technologies in its stash of clinical tools for patients with covid-19 and other infectionsin 1918 governments and the medical establishment frantically sought every means to fight the h1n1 flu pandemic but the results were mixed available reports clearly show that sunlight was effective in reducing flu-related mortality and morbidity and person-to-person infection 7 8 9 patients with severe infections exposed to sunlight therapy outdoors recovered better than those treated indoors and the treatment prevented death among patients and infections among the healthcare workers 8 9 10like the 1918 pandemic most of those succumbing to covid-19 pandemic today die from disease-related complications such as pulmonary inflammationedema pneumonia and acute respiratory disorder syndrome ards in the case of the 1918 flu overcrowding in poorly lit and poorly ventilated enclosures raised associated risks of infection a major reason that the city of boston was badly hit by the flu until exposure to sunlight was introduced 7 8 9 10 by one anonymous editorial account 9 the massachusetts state health department found sunlight therapy to be the most valuable factor in reducing mortality decreasing fatality of hospitalized patients from 40 to 13 boosting flu immunity among physicians and nurses and overall besting the outcome of vaccines which then were in their early stages of development 6 7 8 9 the benefit of exposure to the healing rays of the sun was so obvious that it became a common form of treatment against tuberculosisanother respiratory disorder as well as wound infections psoriasis acne vulgaris rickettsia depression jaundice and a host of other diseases 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 indeed records indicate that across north america many healthcare facilities built sunrooms to which patients were wheeled for sun therapy then known as heliotherapy 11 written accounts of the successes of heliotherapy abound and as the treatment became popular it was adapted to include treatment with various lamps 15 16 17 18 19none of the foregoing should come as a surprise because less than 25 years before the 1918 pandemic a danish physician niels ryberg finsen had developed a light source that was successful in curing patients with skin tuberculosis lupus vulgaris and other ailments 2021 between 1896 and 1901 he treated as many as 804 patients with skin tuberculosis and similar microbial infections at his medical light institute achieving 83 cure rate 2021 the finsen lamp became widely popular and was adopted in most of europe and north america earning finsen the nobel prize in 1903 finsen himself acknowledged the healing power of sunlight but erroneously assumed that his lamp took advantage of the uv spectrum of radiation it is quite conceivable that his pioneering work spurred many in the healthcare industry to use sunlight to treat victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic and beyond to date studies continue to extol the susceptibility of viruses to rays emanating from the sun 1116while it is obvious that finsen pioneered the scientific documentation of the bactericidal effect of light the use of light to treat a variety of diseases predates him perhaps the earliest record of sunlight as medical treatment dates back to the time of egyptian pharaohsmore than 5000 bceas evidenced by images archeological findings and artifacts 23 24 25 26 a popular ancient egyptian image clearly shows a family exposing themselves to the healing rays of the sun fig 1
 veneration of the sun and acknowledgement of its healing power remains a cultural practice in most of africa and early records indicate that the egyptians treated chronic ulcers successfully by exposing them to sunlight 2324 furthermore sunbathing was a common practice not just in ancient egypt babylonia and mesopotamia but ancient greece and rome 23 24 25 26the greeks and the romans clearly recognized the healing power of the sun they built solariums and sunbaths and the greeks even used them to enhance the strength of athletes preparing for the olympic games by exposing them to several months of sunlight treatment the word heliotherapy actually derives from the greek name for their sun god helios heliotherapy meaning sunlight therapy 23 24 25 26 furthermore ayurvedic medical records show that as far back and 1400 bce hindus used the combination of sunlight and photosensitive herbs such as furocoumarins to treat vitiligo and other conditionsa combined treatment which many refer to today as photodynamic therapy 27 moreover records indicate that heliotherapy was a cardinal method used in early daoism which lingyan tzu-ming introduced in china during the first century ce 28 in summary evidence from many parts of the world clearly show that communities worldwide used heliotherapy to treat a variety of diseases in those days the inimical effects of uv were unknown before uv was discovered in 1801 11the discovery of uv transformed the practice of heliotherapy into clinical phototherapy as the antimicrobial effects of uv became evident during the second half of the 19th century as early as 1877 studies showed that uv killed anthrax bacilli 11 and by 1890 it was determined that it played a role in rachitis rickettsia and peritoneal tuberculosis 111629 by this time lamps generating light from quartz mercury vapor and other sources were built and used to treat acne psoriasis syphilis leprosy and pellagra among others 111725 three years later finsen began to use filtered sunlight to treat lupus vulgaris and through careful documentation published his nobel-winning work in 1901 the use of lamps and other artificial light sources to treat skin diseases continued well into the second half of the 20th century but was quickly overtaken by easy availability of potent antibiotics which became popular for their quick results and ease of use 1125the development of lasers in the late 50s and the early 60s and the subsequent evolution of light emitting diodes transformed phototherapy it gave rise to laser therapy or light therapy which in turn evolved into photobiomodulation as a variety of light emitting technologies were devised today photobiomodulation which takes advantage of the photochemical effects of low power lasers leds and other monochromatic sources of light to treat various diseases and ailments has evolved scientifically allowing evidence-based practice this development now enables clinicians and others to exploit the specific effect of each wavelength or spectrum of light for treatment purposes detailed below are several studies which show that we do not need uv to kill bacteria viruses and other pathogens and that safer wavelengths adjacent to uv such as violet or blue light are antimicrobial against microorganisms furthermore evidence shows that red and near infrared light have immense therapeutic value as well and can be effective in treating a range of ailments including the respiratory complications of coronavirus diseaseadvances in light technology and steady development of photobiomodulation through research and continual adaptation evolving technologies have enabled science to uncovered the beneficial effects of several spectra of lightin particular violetblue light red light and near infrared light we now know that light in the blue 400470 nm range is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 and has the potential to mitigate opportunistic bacterial infections associated with covid-19 and other coronavirus infections furthermore as detailed below laboratory experiments show that red and near infrared light with wavelengths approximately in the range of 600700 nm and 7001000 nm respectively have the potential to reduce lung inflammation and fibrosis and hence acute respiratory disorder syndrome a major cause of death in every coronavirus pandemic including the prevailing covid-19 pandemic therefore as a part of the ongoing effort to mobilize every clinical tool with the potential to alleviate the disease and minimize its spread these recent studies offer compelling reasons to explore the potential effects of various spectra of light in reducing secondary bacterial infections associated with the disease and the possibility of suppressing covid-19 and other viral infectionsrecent studies demonstrate that various wavelengths in the blue spectrum are antimicrobial against the deadly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa 31323545 escherichia coli 3840 helicobacter pylori 39 listeria monocytogenes 40 pseudomonas aeruginosa 38 salmonella 37 acinetobacter baumannii 41 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 46 propionibacterium acnes 34 35 3647 neisseria gonorrhoeae 48 49 50 porphyromonas gingivalis 51 52 53 fusobacterium nucleatum 51 and others 4250 an analysis of the nobel-winning work of finsen supports these blue light studies because it shows that the finsen lamp used to heal many with tuberculosis infection did not produce uv as finsen believed rather it produces light in the violetblue range 59 fig 2
indeed the finsen lamp could not have emitted uv because the type of glass used to construct its lenses do not transmit uv thus when mller et al measured the radiation transmitted through the finsen lens systems and the absorption of the stain solution filters in the lamps relative to the lamps effect on mycobacterium tuberculosis they found that the lens and filters absorbed uv wavelengths below 340 nm 59 moreover the methylene blue solution used to absorb the heat generated by the system also blocked the transmission of wavelengths below 340 nm as well as light in the 550700 nm range thus allowing predominant transmission of light in the uv-a and violetblue range 57 furthermore the fluorescence of m tuberculosis shows the presence of endogenous porphyrins known to absorb blue light and engender the production of reactive oxygen species and bacterial suppression not uv absorption 3946 47 4860 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79this clearly explains finsens success in treating tuberculosis implying that unbeknownst to the world the 1903 nobel prize was awarded to finsen for demonstrating the antimicrobial effect of blue light therefore the only logical explanation of finsens success is that endogenous porphyrins in tuberculosis bacteria absorbed the violetblue light predominantly transmitted through his lamp system the absorption triggered downstream production of reactive oxygen species thus killing the bacteria and curing his patients of tuberculosis not uv light absorption as the nobel laureate assumedjust as an analysis of finsens lamp makes it clear that its effect was due to violetblue light and not uv so a thought analysis of the radiation from the sun renders vivid the fact that the bactericidal effect of sunlight often ascribed to uv is due to the immense amount of blue light reaching the earth from the sun atmospheric ozone substantially absorbs solar uv rays allowing transmission of violetblue light to the surface of the earth indeed the peak transmission at the surface of the earth is in the blue region and together with violet light is 10 times more than the amount of uv reaching the surface of the earth 80 given the absorption of violet blue light by most microbes and the resulting bactericidal effect it seems reasonable to attribute a good proportion of the suns environmental sanitization power to the violet blue spectrum of radiation and not uv as many assertmodern technology now makes flexible printed micro-leds readily available making it relatively easy to develop therapeutic tools with the potential to reduce bacterial and potentially viral infections in relation to covid-19 some relatively easy targets are the nasal and oral cavities and the upper respiratory tract particularly as the nasal passage is an acclaimed point of entry of the virus into the human body 81 antimicrobial blue light may serve another useful purpose in reducing the covid-19 pandemic it could be used effectively to sanitize equipment tools hospital facilities emergency care vehicles homes and the general environment as pilot studies have shown 54 55 56recent works now show that there may be as many as four mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial effect of blue light the first and most well-grounded of which is that blue light triggers endogenous bacterial chromophores such as porphyrins flavins nadh and other photosensitive receptors to produce reactive oxygen species which in adequate amount results in cell death 3946 47 48 49 5064 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 indeed porphyrins with absorption peaks in the 405 to 470 nm range have been identified in microbial cells 3946 47 48 49 5064 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 in three recent papers 34 35 36 we took advantage of this theory by timing in vitro irradiation of p acnes and mrsa to coincide with periods of abundant endogenous porphyrins and hence elicit maximal bacterial suppression the outcome was impressive the dominant chromophores in p acnes and mrsa emit red light with peak emission between 612 and 660 nm when excited with blueviolet light 36464764 thus by monitoring the fluorescencered glowemitted by both bacteria we were able to correlate bacterial kill rate with quantitated amounts of remnant bacterial colonies not only did it show bacterial suppression it revealed that their red fluorescence diminished as bacterial colonies were depleted and vice versa 36 further affirming the theory that porphyrins play a major role in antimicrobial blue light treatmentthe second mechanism which is continuing to gain traction is that irradiation with blue light alters bacterial cell membrane integrity with a consequent decrease in membrane polarization and rapid alteration of cellular functions 64 our recent electron microscopic study affirms this finding it shows that even at a sub-lethal dose level treatment with pulsed blue 450 nm light disrupts the structural architecture of mrsa cell membrane and its internal organelles the third and fourth mechanisms of action deserving further investigation and affirmation are that blue light alters a-dna 82 and upregulates prophage genes to promote bacteria kill 83these findings clearly explain finsens remarkable achievement in healing many patients with tuberculosis and suggests that similar successes could be attained in reducing secondary bacterial infections associated with coronavirus infectionsthe common flu sars mers covid-19 etc it would be highly beneficial to patients with coronavirus disease if their loads of opportunistic bacterial infection could be reduced with blue light such treatmentwhen fully developedwill give their immune systems a better chance of overcoming the deadly diseaseemerging data show that light in the red and near infrared light spectra can reduce lung inflammation lung fibrosis pneumonia acute respiratory disorders and other severe complications of coronavirus infections this is an encouraging development since the experience of those at the frontline of the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan china clearly show that acute respiratory disorder was the major cause of death 84 moreover lack of effective antiviral drugs against covid-19 remains a serious concern making it unlikely that such life-threatening complications may be resolved with medication in the short run early reports on the wuhan covid-19 outbreak show that commonly used antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir peramivir zanamivir and others acyclovir the corticosteroidmethylprednisolone and ribavirin were ineffectual in treating the disease 8184there are indications that acute respiratory distress syndrome ards a critical complication of covid-19 infection 8184 often characterized by airway edema pulmonary inflammation and lung fibrosis could be ameliorated with photobiomodulation as evidenced by early results in laboratory animals 85 86 87 for example following induction of pulmonary inflammation in rats de lima et al 85 showed that irradiation of the skin over the inflamed bronchus with a single dose of 13 j cm2 of continuous wave cw red 650 nm laser administered 1 h after induction of inflammation inhibited pulmonary edema and downregulated several measures of inflammation the treatment reduced activation and influx of neutrophils damage to endothelial cytoskeleton and the amount of tnf- and il-1 in the lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluidin a similar study brochetti et al 86 induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice and then treated the animals with red 660  20 nm light 5 j cm2 radiant exposure and 33 mw cm2 irradiance daily for eight days beginning from day 14 they found that the treatment reduced collagen production and the number of inflammatory cells in the alveoli decreased interstitial thickening and static as well as dynamic pulmonary elasticity further cultures of pneumocytes and fibroblasts obtained from the animals showed downregulation of pro-inflammatory cells and collagen deposits in the lungs 86 another study of the same murine model showed that infrared 780 nm light reduced inflammation and collagen deposits in the lungs of mice downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulated the secretion of il-10 from fibroblasts and pneumocytes moreover it significantly reduced total lung tgf 87 taken together these early results suggest that red and near infrared light have the potential to reduce some of the critical complications of coronavirus infections ie pulmonary inflammation and lung fibrosis the preliminary nature of these results and the need for improved experimental methods and data reporting should not diminish their significance rather it should draw attention to another spectrum of light that may be beneficial in the ongoing fight against coronavirus diseases that seems to challenge healthcare systems worldwidein the race against the anticipated devastation of covid-19 clinicians have deployed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquinetwo analogue medications commonly used to treat malaria but rarely used for coronavirus diseaseto mitigate the disease even though their mechanisms of action against viral infections remains poorly understood 8488 89 90 the rapid spread of covid-19 and its clear capacity to kill on a massive scale obviously justify deployment of treatments that seem to work even though their underlying mechanisms are not clear thus given the potential capacity of red and near infrared light to reduce the life-threatening respiratory complications of covid-19 it goes without saying that every effort should be made to advance the work so that an effective therapy can be fashioned from the body of research work achieved to date it will be a wise investment to urgently investigate these initial results clinically and not wait for another deadly coronavirus pandemic to remind us of the inherent potential of light as a therapeutic tool the urgency of this call is heightened by recent clinical results which indicate that patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and others with bronchial asthma and allergy improved significantly following treatment with light 9192even more striking are reports showing that certain wavelengths of light inactivate viruses light has been shown to inactivate baculoviruses 93 and prolonged exposure to blue light in the 420430 nm range inactivates leukemia virus 94 one may argue that baculoviruses are confined to invertebrates and are not known to replicate in humans but the fact that covid-19 traversed species barrier to humans 84 is a cause to worry one or more of the 76 species of baculoviruses could mutate to survive and replicate in human hosts more so because shrimps consumed by humans and mosquitoes that suck human blood are among their 600 or more invertebrate hosts these prospects make urgent the need to intensify efforts to test the effect of blue light on common viruses including covid-19 further that light in the visible spectrum constitutes the basis for photodynamic treatment of plasma to inactivate several viruses including herpes simplex and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 95 96 97 offers strong reason to suggest that blue lightparticularly pulsed blue light which recent reports have shown to be 40 to 100 times more potent than continuous wave blue light 33 34 35has great potential to inactivate coronavirusesalready fresh off the press is an early report that the common cold virusa coronavirusis inactivated by light 98 in this recent study broad spectrum lightmimicking sunlightwas tested on aerosolized influenza virus at 20 and 70 relative humidity while the decay constant and half-life of the virus were measured as indices of survival the results showed that relative humidity had no effect the simulated sunlight alone significantly inactivated the virus resulting in 029  009 min1 decay constant and a half-live of approximately 24 min compared to non-irradiated controls which had 002  006 min1 decay constant and 311 min half-life the resulting 93 increase in decay constant and the concomitant 923 decline in half-life due to light is impressive this is supported by news report of a recent us department of homeland security study which showed that exposure to the sun kills covid-19a more virulent form of the common influenza virus 99 these recent developments buttress the suggestion that blue light in particular pulsed blue light which recent reports have shown to be 40 to 100 times more potent the commonly available continuous wave blue light 34 35 36 has great potential to inactivate covid-19 and other coronaviruses in addition to suppressing related opportunistic bacterial infections this recent finding further elevates the urgency to explore the potential of blue light as an antiviral agent when convincing clinical results prove that blue light is antiviral in addition to being antibiotic against coronavirus opportunistic bacteria it would be a revolutionary paradigm shift considering the ubiquity of low cost blue light emitting devices and the low risk involved in terms of safety moreover the potential to disinfect equipment the environment and spaces difficult to sanitize with common disinfectants is huge

meager drug pipeline new antibiotics may help turn the tide but the current pace of progress is discouraging industry has precious few financial incentives to develop novel agents because the process is time-consuming and expensive and with resistance on the rise there is concern that new agents will have limited effective livesand thus limited profit potential a new public-private partnership model may be called for in which government incents industrial activity via financial rewards beyond traditional drug sales viewing these drugs as national assets rather than simple profitable commodities may yield meaningful change
ineffective infection control limiting the spread of infection between patients is common sense with an importance easily grasped by physicians however there are other crucial reasons to limit the transmission of pathogens bacteria are sometimes able to swap genetic information with each other across species many genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance are contained within mobile elements such as plasmids and integrons when infected patients are cared for in clinics or hospitals these genes may be transferred efficiently if hygiene protocols are breached even more alarming is the frequency with which this may happen in the built environment when sanitation practices are insufficient and human effluent mixes together and then enters the water supply without proper treatment fortunately simple interventions such as hand hygiene by healthcare workers and the installation and use of proper pit latrines or flush toilets in austere settings can have a huge impact
agricultural use of antibiotics the more selective pressure we assert on the microbiome the more we accelerate the evolution of mdros according to the food and drug administration fda over 80 of antibiotics in the united statesmore than 13 million kilograms annuallyare given to livestock to promote growth or prevent infection this practice has been associated with the development of mdr gram-negative rods such as fluoroquinolone-resistant campylobacter species which can be transmitted to humans via unsafe meat handling processes these massive quantities of antibiotics may also enter the water supply and then the human host leading to unpredictable alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome other nations have banned this practice without suffering detrimental increases in the cost of producing poultry or beef whether the united states will reduce this practice from a regulatory perspective or whether market demands will lead to change remains to be seen
injudicious use of antibiotics in human medicine although the use of antibiotics in humans is less than in animals in most industrialized nations medical providers around the world bear a huge portion of the blame for our current predicament multiple expert reviews of large patient cohorts reveal a stubborn truth that has not changed appreciably over the decades in general 50 of antibiotic prescriptions are inappropriate in terms of indication spectrum dose or duration the wise use of antibiotics is called antimicrobial stewardship all clinicians have important roles to play as good antimicrobial stewards resources are listed in the further reading section of this chapter fundamentals are included in table 291

mdro infections are part of the reality of traveling abroad and this topic should be included in pre-travel counseling core points to discuss with patients before leaving include the following
protect yourself without becoming a germophobe most of the toughest-to-treat mdros acquired overseas are gram-negative rods from the family enterobacteriaceae in other words human fecal bacteria prevention of gastrointestinal illness is an excellent way to prevent gut colonization with these mrdos hands should be cleaned before and after eating and after using the lavatory with soap water and a clean towelor a hand rub containing at least 60 alcohol if this is not possible food should be chosen wisely because of concern for contamination with human coliform bacteria introduced during preparation and storage the mantra peel it boil it cook it or forget it is a fine start but this may be difficult for patients to accomplish the principles of smart eating and drinking habits are reviewed in depth in chapters 7 and 8 wearing a surgical mask when in public has a very small chance of preventing bacterial mdro infections and is not usually recommended for this purpose
get all appropriate immunizations including seasonal influenza some bacterial mdro infections may be directly prevented by immunizations eg typhoid fever and pertussis but the prevention of viral infections can also reduce the risk of mdro bacterial infection principally by reducing the likelihood of developing a febrile illness that might lead to healthcare interactions and inappropriate antibiotic use add this to the list of the many reasons why travelers should receive all appropriate vaccinations before leaving
avoid medical tourism as the cost of surgical procedures seems to continue to rise in industrialized nations some patients seek more affordable care overseas particularly in mexico india and china certainly there are centers of excellence in these nations and elsewhere around the globe furthermore post-procedural infections still happen in north america with unacceptable frequency however numerous case reports substantiate the concern that infection control and quality assurance overseas are often provided at a level below that achieved in europe and north america patients may fail to grasp the impactpersonal and financialof healthcare infections acquired overseas these can be dangerous debilitating disfiguring infections and the cost of aftercare alone may meet or exceed the savings envisioned thus in general planning trips for medical procedures should be discouraged seeking care for an acute medical problem while overseas is quite different and patients should not be discouraged from seeing a healthcare provider if the need arises
use antibiotics wisely as described above antimicrobial stewardship can have major impacts on public health it can also benefit individual patients every prescription for antibiotics written pre-departure should come with clear guidance on when to initiate self-treatment during the trip patients who take antibiotics for uncomplicated secretory diarrhea put themselves at risk for c difficile infection prolongation of symptoms due to altered microbiota antibiotic-associated diarrhea and development of de novo antibiotic resistance within their own native bacteria for this reasonamong othersantibiotics should not be taken as routine prophylaxis but rather reserved for the unusual occurrence of high-risk infections such as dysentery except in exceptional cases as described in chapter 8
quit smoking most smokers acknowledge that their addiction is hazardous to their health and are interested in quitting here is another motivator respiratory infections are more frequent among smokers and thus they are more susceptible to mrdos they also require antibiotics more often which in turn puts them at even higher risk of creating new mdros in their own bodies
practice safe sex certain bacterial sexually transmitted diseases stds such as gonorrhea are becoming more and more drug resistant over time and may require higher doses longer courses and parenteral routes of therapy see chapter 42 pre-travel safe sex counseling should pay dividends in terms of preventing acquisition of mdro stds
probiotics are probably safe but of unproven benefit the health-savvy patient may seek your advice on probiotics the concept is attractive use friendly microbes to keep the bad ones at bay published studies to date vary in terms of designdifferent settings different interventions and different outcome measures recent meta-analyses suggest a trend toward benefit in the treatment arms but rarely a large enough benefit to achieve statistical significance given the complexity of our gastrointestinal microbiomes it is small wonder that taking megadoses of one or a few microbes fails to reliably set things to right including prevention of travelers diarrhea further complicating the issue is a lack of ingredient standardization or regulatory oversight by the fda for these products which are classified as dietary supplements rather than medications on the other hand probiotics are unlikely to harm the patientunless he or she has a suppressed immune system in which case the probiotic microbes can become invasive leading to colitis or bloodstream infection in summary patients should be told that the jury is still out but for those with a healthy immune system it is reasonable to add once- or twice-daily probiotic supplements to their diets while abroad although this is not a substitute for any of the other interventions outlined above
because most bacteria have the potential to become mdros and because they can infect virtually any part of the body a comprehensive discussion of the clinical presentation and management of these infections is beyond the scope of this chapter however advice regarding the most common mdro syndromes in returning travelers includes discussions about the following
silent colonization conceptually when a germ comes into contact with a human being one of four things happens the two simply ignore each other the germ kills the host the host kills the germ or an agreement is reacheda state referred to as colonization in colonization bacteria inhabit an ecological niche within the patient such as body hair follicles the anterior nares the oropharynx the lower gastrointestinal tract or the genitourinary tract by definition colonizers are clinically silent and cause no signs or symptoms of disease however colonizers can become pathogens in a moment if given the opportunity by the host this could happen with waning humoral immunity as during chemotherapy impaired cellular immunity as in untreated human immunodeficiency hiv infection anatomical injury as in surgical wound infections or alteration of the competitors within an ecological niche as in antibiotic-associated diarrhea surveillance data are lacking but clinical experience suggests that many patients who acquire mrdos while overseas have asymptomatic colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by itself this is harmless however if these germs are allowed to flourish under the selective pressure of antibiotics or if they migrate to other anatomic sites then infection may develop mdro colonization may last for days years or anything in between patients who have traveled overseas for any considerable period of time especially those who received health care during the trip are at elevated risk for gastrointestinal mdro colonization for at least the first 6 months after return however this is an arbitrary number and there are many cases in which patients have demonstrated sustained colonization years after their exposure this may have implications for infection control in the hospital or clinic currently there is no national consensus on whether to look for asymptomatic mdro colonization for example via a rectal swab or fecal culture in part because of the challenges this poses in the laboratory and because it is not entirely clear what to do with that information it may be simpler to assume these patients are colonized and thus to treat them using contact precautions diligent hand hygiene gowns and gloves however it is reasonable to consider surveillance cultures as part of a comprehensive infection control strategy if your clinic or center encounters these organisms frequently
gastrointestinal infection the gastrointestinal tract is a leading reservoir for mdro colonization although invasive infection is relatively uncommon as described in chapters 21 and 30 enteric fever due to salmonella enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi are leading causes of fever among travelers returning from the tropics in the past fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were reliable treatment options for these infections currently the majority of isolates acquired in southeast asia in particular south asia are partially or fully resistant to fluoroquinolones third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are more reliable empiric choices and can be used in uncomplicated disease but unfortunately resistance to this class is also on the rise someone who is septic with suspected salmonella infection acquired in india should be admitted and treated empirically with a carbapenem such as ertapenem until antibiotic susceptibility testing confirms a narrower-spectrum agent can be used similarly enterotoxigenic e coli etec which was once predictably susceptible to fluoroquinolones is increasingly resistantagain particularly in southeast asiaand alternative drugs such as azithromycin are more reliable today other mdr enterobacteriaceae including carbapenem-resistant species may require toxic agents such as aminoglycosides for treatment fortunately symptomatic infection of the gut is uncommonly caused by carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae presumably because these bacteria infrequently carry extra virulence genes drug resistance and increased virulence are not necessarily found together
urinary tract infection uti mdr gram-negative rods especially from the enterobacteriaceae group which includes e coli may be detected in the urine of returning travelers particularly women presumably this is because gastrointestinal colonization is a common source of mdros in travelers see above and proximity of the urethral meatus to the anal aperture facilitates bacterial entrance into the urinary tract just as happens with all utis because treatment can be challenging it is essential to distinguish between true uti and asymptomatic bacteriuria abu if a patient does not have signs or symptoms of uti such as urinary urgency or frequency hematuria pyuria suprapubic tenderness or an abnormal urinalysis or if her urine was tested for reasons that are unclear then by definition she has abu which should not be treated with antibiotics on the other hand if clinical suspicion for true uti is high then treatment is appropriate guidelines of the infectious diseases society of america suggest that uncomplicated uti be treated empirically without sending a urine culture unless symptoms persist or recur however patients who have recently been overseas may not fit into this category of uncomplicated and our practice is to send a clean-catch midstream urine specimen for urinanalysis and reflexively for culture if the urinanalysis is abnormal at the first presentation for these patients culture data will take time however so an empiric prescription will be necessary ideally these patients should receive one dose of fosfomycin 3 gm po because resistance to this drug is less common than to the alternative first-line treatments trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 1 dose po bid for 3 days or nitrofurantoin 100 mg po bid for 5 days alternative oral treatments are even less likely to succeed against mdr enterobacteriaceae such as ciprofloxacin or cefpodoxime
after culture and resistance data are available empiric treatment can be changed if the patient has failed to improve in many cases no oral treatment will have a favorable in vitro resistance profile this is an appropriate situation in which to consult a specialist in infectious diseases who may have access to experimental oral treatments or who can assist with parenteral treatment if indicated in many cases an intravenous course of a carbapenem such as ertapenem 1 gm iv daily for 5 days may be requiredsome patients will develop recurrent uti symptoms which can be stubborn and frustrating for everyone an emerging strategy that may hold promise involves resetting the microbiome of the vagina e coli does not belong in the vagina in substantial amounts and most utis in otherwise healthy women are caused by e coli ascending the urethra from the introitus a leading hypothesis is that the vagina is usually protected from high-level e coli colonization because of its low ph which is provided by the activity of human lactobacilli including lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus iners among other species these healthy bacteria may be wiped out inadvertently by antibiotic courses given for other reasons such as rhinosinusitis sadly most commercially available lactobacillus supplements contain bovine species such as lactobacillus rhamnosus which do not lower vaginal ph appropriately fortunately clinical trials of human lactobacilli in vaginal suppositories have shown a protective effect and there is hope that fda registry trials will result in approval of this product in the near future if so it would be appropriate to offer this technique to patients with recurrent uti regardless of their bacterial resistance profile this is also yet another reason to prescribe antibiotics prudently to prevent altering the vaginal microbiome in the first place patients who ask for antibiotics for inappropriate indications may respond to this teaching by their physician
skin and soft tissue infections in developed nations the origin of skin and soft tissue infections is relatively predictable cellulitis without purulence is usually caused by streptococcal species including group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus pyogenes whereas purulent infections such as boils furuncles carbuncles and abscesses are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus both methicillin-susceptible s aureus and methicillin-resistant s aureus in a returning traveler this pattern remains accurate see chapter 36 however other pathogens should be considered as well depending on host factors and environmental exposures providers must obtain a careful detailed history in order to avoid missing drug-resistant bacterial infections for example the risk of mdr gram-negative skin infections is greatly increased among patients who have undergone surgical procedures overseas or who sustained a wound exposed to fresh water such wounds may have become infected by environmental organisms such as acinetobacter pseudomonas aeromonas burkholderia and rapidly growing mycobacteria which can be profoundly resistant to most if not all antibiotics thus an interdisciplinary approach is required for these patients there should be a low threshold to admit severely infected patients to the hospital with full and aggressive contact precautions there tissue and blood specimens should be submitted for culture and sensitivity testing and consultation should be sought from specialists in both infectious diseases because toxic medications may be necessary such as aminoglycosides polymyxins or tigecycline and surgery because in some cases rapid debridement or even amputation may be life-saving
respiratory infections infections of the lung and respiratory tract among returning travelers are second only to gastrointestinal infections the great majority are either presumed or proven to be caused by viruses eg influenza parainfluenza rhinovirus or coronavirus these infections may be garden variety or novel forms acquired during travel such as highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai or middle east respiratory corona virus furthermore these viral processes may mask mimic or predispose patients to drug-resistant bacterial infections for example s aureus or haemophilus pneumoniae infections may follow influenza infection so-called atypical bacterial pneumonia due to legionella or chlamydia may have a clinical and radiographic appearance that looks very much like viral pneumonia these infections require early detection and antibiotic coverage in order to prevent substantial risk of morbidity and mortality all physicians know well the principle of occams razor in which the single answer with the fewest uncertainties should be selected this is usually a wise approach in infectious diseases medicine however because there are so many microbes that threaten people in austere settings multiple infections may present simultaneously or in close sequence thus caution should be advised in the ill traveler returning from the tropics where occams razor may grow rusty in the humid atmosphere so to speak
when pandemics manifest novel and sometimes unscientific ideas proliferate as to how they can be prevented treated and cured conspiracy theories can proliferate uscinski and enders 30 april 2020 anderson et al 1 may 2020 as douglas has observed people have an epistemic need to know the truth and they also have an existential need to feel safe in times of crisis these needs are unmet so conspiracy theories can seem appealing knapp 2020 van prooijen  douglas 2018there can be other consequences too anxiety fear and the beguiling temptations of a vulnerable patient group provide the unscrupulous with incentives for lucrative quackery and exploitation during a pandemic fuelled by alarmist saturation publicity and propagated by social media the contagion of fear stalks alongside the disease itself debiec 2020 honigsbaum 2009 honigsbaum 2020 resulting in a preparedness on the part of a cross-section of patients or potential patients to panic to suspend rationality and to invest hope in unlikely offerings of prophylactic agents treatments and cures taylor 2019 in addition during a pandemic more people than normal are spending time at home searching online for answers to the threats about which they have read in such a context false claims misinformation narratives and rumour-mongering on social media can achieve high levels of currency it is important in such a context for government messaging to work against fears dread honigsbaum 2013 and anxieties it is also essential for the community to be provided promptly and consistently with comprehensible

addition hospital and medical facilities can break down under the pressure of patient numbers to which they cannot cater there can be a feeling that the fabrics of our communities are buckling and social structures are faltering under the pressure of the medical crisisa pandemic arises from virulent pathogens shah 2016 206 and exposure in significant part is involuntary it can be fatal for any given person it is not visible and it is hard to prevent and problematic to treat effectively during a pandemic citizens are particularly dependent on government authorities for information guidance and protection but the ability of such authorities to manage the risk to the community often does not always command universal confidence lu 2015 non-compliance with governmental exhortations and even orders can exacerbate the levels of transmission risk media treatment and some authors accounts can be framed in a way that unhelpfully generates panic an archetypal example of such anxiety generation occurred when preston 1995 wrote of the ebola virus transforming virtually every part of the body into a digested slime of virus particles see too quammen 2014 46 preston 2009 perceptions of the relative impotence of doctors in the face of a pandemic can propel some who may already have been suspicious of mainstream medicine to become mistrustful and disillusioned with it and to search for other options even if from a rational perspective they are unlikely to be efficacious and they may be manifestly unscientificfor some years virologists have spoken apocalyptically about the potential for a plague that will endanger the viability of the human race larry brilliant in a 2006 ted talk for instance related how in a survey he undertook of leading epidemiologists 90 said they thought there would be a catastrophic pandemic in their lifetime in which a billion people would become ill and up to as many as 165 million people would die accompanied by a global recession see too shah 2016 in short pandemics are the domain of linguistic hyperbole unhelpful predictions of a viral armageddon and a forum for anxiety-inducing prognosticationsas sontag 1988 4142 observed in illness as metaphor
nothing is more punitive than to give a disease a meaning  that meaning being invariably a moralistic one any important disease whose causality is murky and for which treatment is ineffectual tends to be awash in significance first the subjects of deepest dread corruption decay pollution anomie weakness are identified with the disease then in the name of the disease that is using it as a metaphor that horror is imposed on other things the disease becomes adjectival
pandemic fear creates black humour brig 24 march 2020 but it also makes people hyper-vigilant it impels them to notice things they might not otherwise have noticed to pay attention to certain associations and ignore others to remember prophecies they might previously have dismissed as absurd spinney 2017 75 mediaeval chroniclers relate how bizarre sightings of unnatural phenomena occurred in the period leading up to the onset of the black death giving a fillip to public panic and the miasma theory of pandemics - that a miasma bad air unleashed by god was the cause of the diseasescapegoating and discrimination too are a common response in face of a pandemic mcneil jr 2009 cooke 2009 during the antonine plague of 166 ce for instance there was an eruption of persecution of christians who were blamed for the plague by reason of their rejection of local gods their blasphemies and their indulgence in black magic seaman 2018 between 1347 and 1352 during the black death there were multiple attacks on members of social minorities including those suffering from leprosy mental illness and foreigners colet santiveri ventura saula  galdacano 2014 they were an example of a fear-induced reaction in anticipation of or shortly after outbreaks of plague too jews were accused of poisoning food wells and streams they were tortured into confessions rounded up in city squares or synagogues and exterminated mostly by burning en masse cohn jr 2007 jedwab johnson  koyama 2019 mcneil jr 2009 more than 200 jewish communities across europe were devastated during the years of the

and kung flu restuccia 22 june 2020 sojo  bapuji 2020fear is apt to generate stress responses bennett 1998 meisenhelder  lacharite 1989 to which some persons are more predisposed than others by reason of a combination of genetic psychological biological educational and situational factors in face of the pressures of a pandemic we are all vulnerable but some amongst us have especial psychological frailties as a result of rigidities of personality particular levels of fearfulness or a propensity to anxiety that can be exploited this is the more pronounced in an era in which all forms of media including social media make information including alarmist and stress-inducing information the more accessible and ubiquitous it has been suggested that the speed of social media creates an echo chamber of skepticism and conspiracy theories gorter 2020 those who are less educated who have disabilities see kavanagh 2020 or who are socially isolated by reason of limited linguistic facility in their country of residence have additional vulnerabilities in terms of their ability to understand and process government-issued information this can leave them with impairments of health literacy at least in respect of the pandemic paakkan  okan 2020 emotionally and informationally isolated and prone to make decisions based upon fear and rumourthe diathesis stress model is useful in this context it postulates that if the combination of predisposition and stressor exceed a threshold this can result in the development of pathology lazarus 1993 however at a subclinical level vulnerabilities can render people at risk for poor decision-making and inhibiting their capacity for clear thinking and the analysis of available information about how they should respond to risk pandemics generate high levels of anxiety paranoia stigmatisation and xenophobia taylor 2019 with the potential for maladaptive decision-making such responses can be exacerbated by cultural educational and religiose overlays that are apt to engender confusion guilt and anxiety as well as by emotive tropes encountered in a variety of contexts religion literature films and board and online games are a significant part of our shared cultural experience that frame our expectations and influence our responses to reality dehority 2020for instance in the old testament of the bible plagues and pestilences which also ravaged the ancient world are depicted as a punishment by an often merciless god as a retribution for the commission of sins see eg exodus 9 14 numbers 11 33 1 samuel 4 8 psalms 8923 isaiah 9 13 as huremovic 2019 7 has observed throughout the biblical context pandemic outbreaks are the bookends of human existence considered both a part of nascent human societies and a part of the very ending of humanity the bhagavad purana pragmatically warned villagers to flee their dwellings as soon as dead rats were seen as dead rats were a harbinger of death in humans blaser 1998 liston 1924 in islamic tradition there are multiple exhortations as to how a person must respond in face of the danger of contagion  for instance the holy prophet recognised the urgency of preventative responses and preached the importance of travel bans and quarantine in places contaminated with disease in order to mitigate the spread of illness if you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land do not enter it and if the plague breaks out in a place while you are in it do not leave that place sahih al-bukharisimilar depictions are found in literature it was homer who first used the term epidemios to describe those returning to greece while hippocrates employed it in a medical sense to refer to that which circulates or propagates in a country this paved the way for awareness of the potential for an infection to spread uncontrolled from one community to another thucydides recounted the fearfulness of the plague in athens between 429 and 426 bce and the breakdown of law and order
there was no previous record of so great a pestilence and destruction of human life the doctors were unable to cope since they were treating the disease for the first time and in ignorance indeed the more they came into contact with sufferers the more liable they were to lose their own lives no other device of men was any help moreover supplication at sanctuaries resort to divination and the like were all unavailing in the end people were overwhelmed by the disaster and abandoned efforts against it history of the peloponnesian war ii viii512
the better part of a millennium later procopius in his account of the justinian plague in 543 ce history of the wars ii 22 which the emperor himself termed gods education and john of ephesus called the chastisement pearce 2017 commented that the whole human race came near to being annihilatedthe accounts of both chaucer 13431400 in the canterbury tales ther cam a privee thief men clepeth deeth that in this contree al the peple sleeth and boccaccio 13131375 in the decameron in this sore affliction and misery of our city the reverend authority of the laws both human and divine was all in a manner dissolved and fallen into decay for lack of the ministers and executors thereof who like other men were all either dead or sick or else left so destitute of followers that they were unable to exercise any office wherefore everyone had license to do whatever pleased him postulated amongst other things that fear of contagion increases vices such as avarice lust and corruption both alessandro manzoni 17851873 in the betrothed i promessi sposi 1827 revised 1842 and history of the column of infamy storia della colonna infame and daniel defoe 16591731 in the diary of a plague year catalogued reactions of anxiety and desperation within milan and london respectively during pandemics manzoni described the fears of poisoning arising from scaffolding carried by workers in a cathedral in the betrothed and in a history of the column of infamy the belief that the plague had been caused by the actions of the evil the untori who were possessed by the devil resulting in the execution of the innocent and erection of a column in milan to commemorate the imposition of death on two greasersin the last man mary shelley 17971851 portrayed the need of the central character to stay away from others for fear of being infected and edgar allan poe 18091849 meditated on the role of the plague in being a purveyor of death similarly in the scarlet plague published in 1912 jack london 18761916 portrayed a post-apocalyptic scenario in 2073 following the spread of the red death in which an uncontrollable pandemic had depopulated the world 60 years before albert camus la peste 1947 in which the plague was posting sentries at the gates and turning away ships was a critique of repugnant materialism as well as disturbing account of cohabitation with death he described reactions of complacency that placed all at risk many continued hoping that the epidemic would soon die out and they and their families be spared thus they felt under no obligation to make any change in their habits as yet plague was an unwelcome visitant bound to take its leave one day as unexpectedly as it had come and anxious fears about the threat to come a pestilence isnt a thing made to mans measure therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind a bad dream that will pass away but it doesnt always pass away and from one bad dream to another it is men who pass awaymultiple films have portrayed the catastrophic impact of epidemics and in particular pandemics as a genre they have been described as reel bio-horror films sutton 2014 the andromeda strain 1971 based on the novel by michael crichton for instance depicts the spread of a deadly organism of extraterrestrial origin death in venice morte a venezia 1971 relates the story of a composer who travels to venice for health reasons but the city becomes stricken by cholera and the health authorities do not inform holiday-makers of what is happening for fear of the consequences in outbreak 1995 the setting is a fictional ebola-form of motaba virus in zaire which then spreads to a california coastal village via a capuchin monkey which is host to the virus the plot focuses on strategies including sinister military interventions and conspiracies to conceal the virus so it can be used as a biological weapon fatal contact 2006 portrays an american businessman who becomes infected with a mutated bird flu virus and brings it back to the united states it spreads around the world and riots erupt with armed mobs attempting to hijack vaccines and the pandemic continues to mutate causing further international waves of panic contagion 2011 portrays the medico-scientific quest for a cure to a virus transmitted by respiratory droplets and fmites it includes a sub-plot in which the jude law character a blogger spreads rumors about forsythia wang xia liu et al 2018 a herbal treatment he claims works to cure the virus the last days los ltimos das 2013 centres around a trend of agoraphobia and the panic where people die if they leave shelter extinction 2015 goes a step further portraying a post-apocalyptic world in which a virus has turned the populace into zombies the series of resident evil horror films starting in 2002 and followed by sequels in 2004 2007 2010 2012 and 2016 is based on attempts to control the spread of the t-virus that has escaped from a secret underground genetic research facility in 2015 containment set in a southampton apartment block explores a world patrolled by figures in hazmat suits keeping people within their apartments which no longer have electricity water or contact with the outside world repeating the refrain please remain calm the situation is under controlthere are many other popular exposures to pandemics which generate associations of fear panic and the imminence of human annihilation for instance the popular board game pandemic 2008 was based on the premise that four diseases had broken out in the world each threatening to wipe out a region the game accommodates two to four players each playing one of seven possible specialists dispatcher medic scientist researcher operations expert contingency planner and quarantine specialist through the combined effort of all the players the goal is to discover all four cures before any of several game-losing conditions global catastrophe are reachedcomputer games about viral outbreaks are also prevalent and a potentially significant influence on the generation of gamers for instance in deus ex 2000 a lethal pandemic the gray death has ravaged the population there is no cure but a synthetic vaccine ambrosia can nullify the effects of the virus but is in short supply because of its scarcity ambrosia is available only to those deemed vital to the social order  and finds its way primarily to government officials military personnel the rich and influential scientists and the intellectual elite with no hope for the common people of the world riots occur worldwide and some terrorist organizations have formed with the professed intent of assisting the downtrodden in the last of us 2013 an outbreak of a mutant cordyceps fungus has ravaged

in a near-future washington dc in the aftermath of a potent strain of a smallpox pandemic engineered in new york city by an environmental terroristin christian tradition world literature film board games and computer games pandemics have been vividly and emotively portrayed in diverse ways requiring urgent prophylactic or avoidance responses all of which are redolent with fear and paranoid ideation thoughts of the reader the viewer and the gamer are turned toward the potential for dire outcomes sometimes offence caused to the godhead is mooted as a cause for the threat frequently doubts are ventilated around the bona fides and effectiveness of the measures taken by government and public health authorities to contain and eradicate viruses and bacteria helplessness is a prominent trope and catastrophising can find expression in the form of both eschatological and apocalyptic ruminations about the consequences of the pandemic for oneself all whom one knows and even the future of humanity in all contexts global disaster is at hand armageddon is close this creates a fertile field for opportunists and charlatans as porter 1989 26 observed in the face of invasions of epidemic sickness there is desperation which in turn creates a voracious demand for a multiplicity of healers amongst whom are quacksthus a variety of influences can combine to generate high levels of fear and anxiety all of which can exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities and militate against calm and informed decision-making during a pandemicthe russian flu is often described as the first modern influenza pandemic it took place between 1889 and 1892 and is believed to have killed more one million people honigsbaum 2020 including queen victorias grandson the duke of clarence honigsbaum 2011 mcginnis 1988 123124 newspaper advertisements touted many cures for the russian flu including castor oil bronchial inhalers and an electric battery quinine too was offered mcginnis 1988 doctors even promoted the idea that drinking brandy and eating oysters were a key to staving off infection knapp 2020the best known questionable remedy proposed for the russian flu though was the carbolic smoke ball which consisted of a rubber ball filled with powdered carbolic acid snell 2001 the patient squeezed the ball sending a puff of acidic smoke up a tube inserted into the nostrils it was advertised with testimonials by well known personalities as was common at the time in the pall mall gazette offering a 100 reward to anyone using it correctly who then contracted influenza mcginnis 1988 124 the purveyor of the smoke ball deposited 1000 in the alliance bank in regent street to show the money was there coleman 2009the carbolic smoke ball prophylaxis had a notorious legal outcome louisa elizabeth carlill purchased a ball from a chemist in oxford street london and used it as directed three times a day for nearly two months however she contracted the flu she claimed her reward but was rebuffed by the carbolic smoke ball company which replied to correspondence from her husband who had trained as a solicitor saying that if used properly it had total confidence in its product it failed to return her money this resulted in her suing the carbolic smoke ball company in the high court for breach of contract she succeeded carlill v carbolic smoke ball company 1892 but the company appealed to the court of appeal arguing that their advertisement was mere puff however this argument was rejected on the basis that the company had deposited 1000 to show its seriousness as mcginness 1988 127128 has observeda legal decision supporting that type of argument would only serve to encourage the telling of even more outrageous untruths advertisers could attempt with impunity to trap consumers with progressively bigger lies and then avoid liability by laughing at the gullibility of the gulled instead the court said that it was going to look at the contract as printed and to interpret it according to its plain meaning on the sensible assumption that what is exactly what mrs carlill and other buyers like her would have done
secondly the company maintained that it had no way of ascertaining whether mrs carlill had followed its instructions correctly this contention was rejected by the court of appeal out-of-hand carlill v carbolic smoke ball company 1893 thirdly the company argued that an offer such as it had made could not be understood to have been made to the whole world this argument too failed with the court of appeal finding that the offer was clear and to a group of consumers and anyone fulfilling its terms could be deemed to have accepted the offer finally the company argued that the requisite consideration for a contract did not exist however the court of appeal rejected this too concluding that any use of the smoke ball would be likely to promote sales and thus be of value to the company thus mrs carlills use of the smoke ball constituted valuable considerationthe outcome of the decision was an emphatic endorsement of contract law as a means by which the vulnerable could be protected against false representations which were not honoured during a pandemicthe editors of the lancet exulted
we are glad to learn that in spite of the ingenuity of their legal advisers the defendants have been held liable to make good their promise people who are silly enough to adopt a medicine simply because a tradesman is reckless enough to make extravagant promises and wild representations as to its efficacy may thank themselves chiefly for any disappointment that ensues still for this folly which is only foolish and nothing worse it is possible to feel sympathy when the disappointment comes it is a pleasant alternative to learn that the dupe has been able as in the present instance to enforce a sharp penalty and that the process of reaping a harvest from the simplicity of ones neighbours is attended with dangers of miscarriage which must materially diminish its attractiveness in the eyes of those people who supply the popular demand for quack medicines editorial 1892 see too simpson 1985

catharine arnold 2018 ch 12 has documented how willingness to try anything during the spanish flu era was accompanied by a proliferation of advertisements in the west for influenza-related remedies

carbolic soap was touted in the british midlands as a disinfectant and cleanser various forms of alcohol were touted as remedies for influenza
in denmark and canada alcohol was only available by prescription while in poland brandy was regarded as highly medicinal one brave soul in nova scotia recommended fourteen straight gins in quick succession as a cure for spanish flu the result of this experiment was unknown if the patient had survived he had doubtless forgotten the proceedings entirely in britain the royal college of physicians stated that alcohol invites disaster a conclusion which was ignored by many the barman at londons savoy hotel created a new cocktail based on whisky and rum and christened it the corpse reviver arnold 2018 ch 12

the body fined was associated with the genesis ii church of health and healing its leader mark grenon had written to donald trump the united states president telling him that that chlorine dioxide is a wonderful detox that can kill 99 of the pathogens in the body he added that it can rid the body of covid-19 a few days later at his daily coronavirus briefing at the white house president trump promoted the idea that disinfectant could be used as a treatment for the virus stating that disinfectant knocks it out in a minute one minute he went on to ask a public health official is there a way we can do something by an injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so itd be interesting to check that pilkington 25 april 2020in a number of countries concern has been expressed about the propagation of a diverse array of forms of false information online in relation to covid-19 in russia for instance investigators were announced to be considering whether to bring a criminal prosecution as a result of a youtube video falsely alleging that organs were being harvested from coronavirus patients for medical treatment of covid-19 prosecutors demand probe into fake news about harvesting of covid-19 patients organs 23 april 2020 in israel a rishon letzion resident allegedly sent a message in the name of the health ministry to his girlfriend who had returned from miami in an effort to get her to self-quarantine he was conveyed for investigation at the cybercrimes unit of the lahav 433 police anti-corruption unit for four crimes including publishing false information to cause fear and panic and transmitting false information he had used software to make his messages look as though they came from the health ministry he sent a message to the woman to quarantine herself and another to her friend telling her to keep her distance beiner 6 april 2020perhaps the extreme end of repression of fake coronavirus news though raising the risk for government action to constitute an unreasonable contravention of human rights mcdonald 23 march 2020 occurred in cambodia a 14 year-old girl in kampot was detained and compelled to apologise publicly for writing in a message on facebook that there were three people ill with covid-19 at her school and that others had died from the disease vicheika  tum 14 march 2020a number of factors can create a conducive environment for the making of false claims and communications online in the context of a pandemic anxieties and fears engendered by the pandemic can render people vulnerable especially in an online environment dread of contracting and being harmed by a disease such as covid-19 can be exacerbated by religious associations with pestilences and plagues literary traditions film portrayals and computer game tropes as well as factors such as personality issues educational deficits language limitations social isolation and disabilities alone and in combination such vulnerabilities are apt to be fanned by chronically anxiety-inducing media coverage an outcome is the potential for predatory opportunities to exploit those vulnerable to credulity and the suspension of faculties of discernmentthe reality of pandemic vulnerability raises the question of how most constructively public health authorities can respond in the context of the covid-19 pandemic to meet both conspiracy theories and therapeutic misrepresentations recent responses by some governments have provided a useful perspectivefirstly health messaging needs to be communicated in a calm and straightforward tone which does not exacerbate anxieties and irrational fears but rather encourages prudent care-taking conduct secondly there needs to be a continuing flow of medico-scientifically evidence-based education which works toward disabusing members of the community of misunderstandings fears and fallacies which otherwise may gain popular traction and exacerbate paranoid and anxiety pathologies as well as render people more prone to be victimisedthirdly there is a need for governments to be assertive in taking preventative and deterrent action against those who are misusing the covid-19 era to enrich themselves opportunistically or to take advantage of those who lack the capacity to be discerning about false claims of capacity to prevent treat or cure the disease for good reason the traditional public health approach to such misrepresentations is to provide a clear warning initially to those responsible for such misinformation in the form of what in the united states are called cease and desist orders however where there is non-compliance in face of such governmental communications robust legal action needs to be initiated with condign imposition of penalties to deter and punish unethical quackery during a pandemic

the tragedy of the haitian cholera epidemicwhere united nations peacekeepers introduced a previously unknown disease into the country causing the most serious cholera epidemic anywhere in the world in over a centuryhas propelled a range of complex international law issues into the public eye1 the most prominent among these have related to un accountability and justice for the victims of the epidemic2 these issues have been the subject of extensive advocacy efforts including high-profile legal proceedings on behalf of the victims3 only after more than six years did the united nations finally acknowledge a role in the epidemic and in a weakly worded apology accept its moral though not its legal responsibility to address the damage it caused4 in the absence of a binding legal decision the debate over accountability and the point where un immunity tips into impunity remains unresolved
despite the undeniable importance of these issues however they have overshadowed the violation of an even longer-standing principle of international law that remains at the epicentre of the haitian tragedy that the international community shares responsibility for taking measures to prevent certain infectious diseases and in particular cholera from spreading across borders while the boundaries of this principle continue to evolve particularly as new threats emerge ranging from avian flu to zika virus it was preventing the international spread of cholera that first brought nations together to lay the foundations of international health law over 160 years ago cholera was in turn the sole subject of the first binding multilateral agreement in international health lawindeed the first three such agreementsand the disease has remained a constant thread woven throughout the history and development of international health law to the present day the haitian epidemic thus serves as a reminder both of why the international community first came together to address the shared threat of cholera using the tool of international law and the deadly consequences of ignoring this longstanding principlelegal measures to prevent the international spread of cholera also offer an intriguing perspective on the development of international law as in contrast to other fields international health law is necessarily influenced by scientific knowledge alongside legal theory and state practice from the very first international sanitary conference onwards national delegations usually comprised both diplomats and scientists5 after all bacteria do not obey legal diktats rooted in abstract concepts such as state sovereignty6 thus effective rules to prevent the spread of disease must involve what we might now term evidence-based policythis being the case a historical analysis of international health law is complicated by the realisation that what may once have been accepted as scientific fact and therefore seen as a sensible basis for law and action may by modern standards seem inadequate or even entirely incorrect this is readily apparent in the early development of international law around cholera and will be discussed in detail later in this chapter for the time being it suffices to say that while acceptance of the principle that evidence-based measures should be taken to prevent the international spread of cholera is widespread and longstanding the precise measures thought capable of doing so have necessarily evolved alongside changes in scientific knowledge and understanding the evidentiary aspect has implications not only for what measures might be considered sufficient but also those that might be deemed excessive as discussed below one of the key goals of adopting international standards relating to the spread of cholera has been to avoid undue interference with international trade through overzealous application of measures like quarantines or import bans as such adherence to the underlying principle of preventing the international spread of cholera cannot be assessed by determining whether the practice of states or other international law actors is the same as it was a century ago rather it must be by whether their practice at any given time has been guided by contemporaneous evidence-based standards in the service of that principle nevertheless while our understanding of the manner in which the international spread of cholera could be prevented has evolved considerably over the last 160 years certain elements of our knowledge have changed more drastically than others some central concepts such as the importance of clean water and proper sanitation have long been well understood others such as the utility of vaccination as a preventative measure have fluctuated over time as new vaccines and evidence of their efficacy emerge furthermore collection and sharing of accurate information has also historically been a core component both of the law particularly in the recording and notification of cases and of the broader science that informs what measures the law should either require or in cases where overreaction is a concern permit in fulfilment of the principle of preventing the international spread of cholera although international health law has expanded over the past 160 years these core elements and cholera itself remain constant all these elements come into play in what unfolded in haitiimported diseases have played a crucial role in haitian history since long before the cholera epidemic european contact brought diseases like smallpox that devastated the original indigenous inhabitants removing a source of manual labour for the colonial powers and leading to their replacement with african slaves in turn yellow fever first brought from africa as an inadvertent by-product of this human cargo later took a serious toll on soldiers freshly dispatched from france playing a valuable supporting role in making haiti the first and only modern state to gain independence through a successful slave revolt7 it has even been suggested that popular perceptions associating haiti with the emerging hiv epidemic in the early 1980s caused a drastic reduction in american tourists in turn leading to a drop in income that helped destabilise and eventually topple the duvalier regime8 the bitter irony of these events is that historical records indicate haiti was one of the few countries to escape the scourge of cholera during the nineteenth century epidemics that propelled the very development of international health law that forms the focus of this chapter9
by the turn of the twenty-first century haiti was the poorest country in the western hemisphere beginning in 2004 it was also home to the united nations stabilisation mission in haiti better known by its french acronym minustah then on january 12 2010 an earthquake of magnitude 70 devastated the country estimates of the number of people killed have varied widely from the official haitian government figure of over 300000 to other estimates below 10000010 hundreds of thousands more were left homeless and haitis already inadequate health and sanitation infrastructure suffered considerable damagedespite concerns about the potential for the rapid spread of disease in crowded temporary camps housing displaced victims of the earthquake it was not until ten months later in mid-october of 2010 that the first cases of cholera appeared11 this unwelcome appearance was not in the capital city of port-au-prince but in the rural area of mirebalais it was here that a minustah base had recently welcomed a contingent of soldiers from nepal a cholera-endemic country in the midst of its own outbreak at least one of these soldiers was carrying vibrio cholerae the bacterium that causes cholera12 cholera is spread through water contaminated with infected faeces it causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea and can cause death by dehydration within as little as a few hours if left untreated due to improper sanitation practices infected faeces from the minustah base entered the artibonite river system which is relied upon by tens of thousands of haitians for farming bathing and drinking13 the disease spread rapidly throughout the country and was found in all ten regions of the country by the following month as well as over the border in the dominican republic14 it subsequently spread into cuba and mexico15
the cholera-nave population of haiti had no resistance to the disease exacerbating its toll although the number of new cases decreased considerably following the initial peak of the epidemic infections continued with spikes occurring in the wake of further natural disasters such as hurricane matthew in 201616 as of early 2017 according to world health organisation statistics the epidemic had killed over 9000 people and sickened close to 800000 more17 there is also evidence that these figures reflect substantial underestimates particularly during the early months of the epidemic18 sadly this previously unknown disease now appears to have firmly established itself in haiti where it will continue to pose a threat in the absence of access to clean water and sanitation a combination of basic shoe-leather epidemiological investigation and high-tech genetic analysis of disease samples demonstrates conclusively that the haitian strain of cholera has its origins in nepal and arrived via the minustah base19 had the un adhered to the longstanding international law principle of preventing the international spread of cholera this tragedy could have been preventedcustoms and binding rules to prevent the spread of disease have a long history in virtually every culture the bible which influenced the development of the law in many modern states provides examples of such rules for instance leviticus devotes two chapters to leprosy and how it should be dealt with coming out in favour of isolation as the preferred recourse all the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled he is unclean he shall dwell alone without the camp shall his habitation be20
in turn governments at all levels have long imposed rudimentary legal measures to keep disease from their own territories the term quarantine itself originates from the italian quaranta referring to the length of the forty-day isolation period imposed on incoming ships by city-states like venice to prevent the arrival of bubonic plague in the fifteenth century21 historically however such efforts focused on protecting the state from outside threats rather than collaboration among states to address mutual interests it took a new menace to bring nations together to explore novel ways of tackling shared concerns the menace in question was cholerathe landmark occasion bringing states together was the first international sanitary conference convened in paris in 1851 it would be the first of fourteen such conferences spanning a period of nearly ninety years today this first conference is widely recognised as the origin point of international health law22 the conference occurred at the beginning of a period of rapid change in the development of international law and policy thus also playing a role in the broader development of modern international relations23 to give some perspective at the time of the first conference foundational agreements in international law such as the first geneva convention as well as accords on other issues that underpin the modern diplomatic and legal order such as telegraphs and postal service were still a decade or more away the underlying goal of preventing the spread of disease was also an easy place to find common ground as one later conference delegate would state the only researches made in common by the different governments of europe were to oppose a barrier in the way of the march of epidemic diseases and especially of cholera24
historically found in the indian subcontinent and thus referred to as asiatic cholera in numerous sources choleras rapid spread echoed that of globalisation although both bubonic plague and yellow fever were also on the agenda of the conference it was primarily the initial two cholera pandemicsthe first approx 181724 sweeping across asia and lapping europes eastern boundaries and the second approx 182951 penetrating deep into europes heartthat provided the impetus for states to come together to address the threat posed by the international spread of disease unlike plague and yellow fever which posed a risk mostly to trade interests and colonial possessions cholera threatened europe itselfalthough endemic diseases like tuberculosis exacted a higher toll overall the trail of a cholera epidemic across the continent was a particularly obvious one with the arrival of the disease following soon after news of an outbreak in a neighbouring port moreover cholera was especially capable of making an impression the trappings of death by choleraprofuse vomiting and the characteristic rice-water diarrhoeawere particularly shocking to polite sensibilities carrying none of the romanticism of wasting away from consumption tb25 even today in the era of headline-grabbing diseases like ebola it retains the ignominious distinction of probably being the pathogen that can kill the most number of humans in the shortest period of time something that would also help stoke fear upon its arrival in haiti26
not only was cholera an early priority in developing a shared legal framework it was also intimately linked with other driving elements of globalisation in the nineteenth century such links have continued until the present day27 in particular its spread was tied directly to the increasing size and speed of international trade which was itself rapidly redefining international relations in turn striking the balance between preventing the spread of cholera and minimizing disruption to burgeoning international trade has been a constant theme in the development of the law other conditions in the nineteenth century helped facilitate its spread as well unlike many other diseases that increasingly drew the attention of european politicians and scientists in the age of colonial expansion cholera was readily adaptable to life outside the tropics it was spread through poor sanitation meaning it could be passed on as readily if not more readily in england or france as in its historical home in the ganges delta rapid european urbanisation in the era of industrialisation fuelled precisely such conditions crowded slums with inadequate sanitation proved a fertile breeding ground ultimately as one commentator describes it asiatic cholera has a good claim to be regarded as the classic epidemic disease of the nineteenth century above all of europe in the age of industrialisation28 taken altogether these factors ensured that cholera became the focus of the conferencenonetheless the international sanitary conference of 1851 is notable mostly for its significance as the starting point for international health law only twelve states participated in the initial event in a sign of the very different map of the world in 1851 four of these states would be absorbed into a unified italy shortly after29 furthermore although it brought control of disease into the international sphere its focus was not global collaboration against a mutual threat but rather regional collaboration to protect europe from foreign contagion an approach that from a modern perspective could be charitably described as eurocentric30
its tangible outcomes were even less impressive with no lasting multilateral agreement emerging from the conference however as discussed in detail below it was not ultimately disagreement over the value of preventing the spread of cholera that created the delay in agreeing upon the concrete and codified steps to address it rather it was lack of understanding of what those measures should be hindered by the dearth of basic knowledge such as what caused cholera and how it was spread interestingly the balance of the medical and the political was struck in the delegations for each participating country with each team of two consisting of a diplomat and a physician as howard-jones notes the voting system at the first conference allowed these two members to vote separately even contradictorily31 under such circumstances it is difficult to know what to make of the knowledge that in his address at the closure of the first conference the french minister of agriculture and trade congratulated the participants on their discretion and wisdom in divorcing themselves not only from all questions of politics - but also of science32 ultimately despite the involvement of an increasingly large and diverse set of countries over subsequent conferences a scientific consensus on cholera and its causes was not quickly forthcoming nevertheless birn argues that the meetings themselves far more than the elaboration of the germ theory the identification of vectors and microorganisms or the signing of conventions best characterise success in this initial stage33 this is fortunate given that it would take another six meetings over 41 years before sufficient consensus was found to permit a binding agreement to be reachedit is tempting to look at the history of the health sciences as a linear series of discrete progressive steps but the development of the international sanitary conferences serves to illustrate that this is certainly not the case as outlined by howard-jones in his masterful exploration of the progression of scientific knowledge over the course of the fourteen conferences medical concepts today considered basic facts were bitterly contested or entirely unknown at earlier junctures making it difficult to take evidence-based action34 as was subsequently said of the first conference both diplomats and doctors who participated in thesediscussions had in common their total ignorance of the nature and mode of propagation of the three diseases  cholera plague and yellow fever  under consideration35 and even as science was posited as objective and free of political considerations the discoveries of eminent scientistssuch as the german robert koch and louis pasteur of francecould also fuel national rivalries36
consider what is widely agreed to be the seminal moment in the field of epidemiology which itself stems directly from the cholera epidemics of the nineteenth century this moment did not even occur until three years after the initial international sanitary conference in 1854 doctor john snow mapped cholera cases during an epidemic in londons soho district his map allowed him to trace the source of the epidemic back to a well in broad street demonstrating that the disease was transmitted through contaminated water37 despite justified acclaim today the medical establishment of the era was not so accepting of snows theory that cholera was waterborne for decades afterwards other theories on the origins of cholera continued to hold sway at the conferences ranging from airborne transmission to some unique property of the soil or to elaborate combinations of such factors even after robert koch the founder of modern microbiology identified the cholera bacterium in 1884 helping advance the germ theory of disease in the process widespread acceptance of the cause of cholera was not immediate one of the most influential proponents of alternative theories the famed german hygienist max von pettenkofer would hold onto them until the end of his career38 indeed as a further illustration of the fickle integration of scientific discovery into mainstream medical thought vibrio cholerae had already been isolated and identified as the cause of cholera to virtually no acclaim by filippo pacini in 1854 the same year that snow had the handle removed from the broad street pump39 in the end unanimous acceptance of cholera as a waterborne disease would not come until the eleventh conference in 190340 as a result the desire to take effective steps to prevent cholera transmission was initially hampered by a lack of scientific knowledge further exacerbated by the slow mainstream acceptance of new discoveriesduring the course of the six international sanitary conferences that took place during the period leading up to the first binding agreement international interest had increased considerably with more than thirty countries and territories participating in at least one haiti itself would participate in the 1881 international sanitary conference in washington the only one of the conferences ever to take place in the western hemisphere this increasing internationalisation was due in large part to the fact cholera itself had become a truly global problem over the same period affecting almost all corners of the globe during the latter half of the nineteenth century the world suffered through the third approx 18521860 and fourth approx 18631875 cholera pandemics and it was in the midst of a fifth approx 18811896 by the time the first binding multilateral agreement on preventing international transmission of disease was signed at the seventh international sanitary conference in venicea landmark agreement in international law the international sanitary convention 1892 is the first link in an unbroken chain of international health law agreements that continue to bind countries today fourteen nations including all the major european and by extension colonial powers ratified the first convention41 given global concern about the disease it is little surprise that the sole subject of the first binding agreement in international health law was cholera despite its significance as the first agreement in international health law the scope of the first international sanitary convention is quite limited its focus was the suez canal which had shortened the travel time between europe and the indian subcontinent considerably since it opened in 1869 as such the convention addressed only westbound shipping through the suez canal in response to concerns about this direct path between the perceived source of the disease and european ports once sown however the seeds of international health law sprouted quickly in quick succession subsequent international sanitary conventions yielded the first expansions of the field of international health law or perhaps more precisely in the earliest years the field of international cholera law measures agreed upon in dresden 1893 included expanding the geographic scope of the agreement and adding notification provisions42 the next agreement this time in paris 1894 dealt specifically with the islamic pilgrimage to mecca continuing the emphasis on keeping asiatic cholera out of europe43
cholera thus remained the sole topic of international health law throughout the earliest three agreements not until 1897 did international health conventions expand to encompass a second disease with an agreement focusing on bubonic plague44 subsequently in 1903 the previous agreements were consolidated into a single new agreement which maintained the focus on cholera and plague but added reference to yellow fever45 the resulting list of three diseases would remain the three constants throughout the subsequent history of international health law even as later agreements would adjust both the roster of diseases addressed and the scope of measures countries needed to undertake in order to monitor prevent and address their spreadthe international sanitary conferences would continue until the outbreak of world war ii with further conferences in 1911 and 1926 before ultimately concluding with the fourteenth international sanitary conference in 1938 haiti itself participated in the 1926 conference and was among over 60 countries to be party to the resulting convention the 1926 international sanitary convention emphasised the importance of mandatory case notification for select diseases including cholera and highlighted the role of international organisations in the sharing of this information46 it also required states to prevent the embarkation onto ships of individuals showing symptoms or people whose relations with the sick placed them at risk and imposed measures in a range of circumstances regarding the disinfection of human waste where cholera was confirmed or suspected47 public health and national interests remained awkward companions the us surgeon general pronounced the agreement a decided improvement over the previous conventions with the caveat that it was still the result of negotiation among states with varying goals conducted by men of all degrees of intelligence48 meanwhile the inclusion of the first two diseases considered native to europe rather than necessarily imported from abroadsmallpox and typhuswas still outweighed by the addition of extensive further regulation around religious pilgrims in the middle east49
further conventions emerged from the conferences though they were not always completed in the same years for instance the international sanitary convention for aerial navigation came into force in 1935 just as steamships and railways had previously changed the speed with which diseases could disseminate this convention highlighted the role new technologies could play in rapidly spreading new diseases and prescribed special measures for six diseases including cholera50 cholera the first disease to be regulated under international law would thus remain a constant presence throughout the development of international health law within the first century of its development it would also justify its presence by continuing to pose an international threat to healthby the early twentieth century international cooperation on public health also led to the development of formal international health bodies including the office international dhygine publique ohip in 1907 and the health organisation of the league of nations in the aftermath of world war i at times politics came to the fore plans to combine the two were undone by objections of the united states a member of ohip but not the league51 these organisations were complemented by regional bodies like the international sanitary bureau the precursor to the pan-american health organisation paho this organisation was in fact the oldest of all international health bodies having been formed in 1902 it would promptly address cholera within its own regional convention in 190352 concern for cholera was evident at all levels for instance a 1920 report from a league of nations delegation highlights the role of foreign soldiersforeshadowing events in haitiin spreading cholera from russia to poland53
these organisations in turn have a direct lineage to todays world health organisation who which inherited their functions or in the case of paho absorbed the entire organisation under its umbrella since its formation in 1948 as a specialised agency of the united nations the who has assumed the role of coordinating international public health in the process it has moved towards creating a truly global approach to health shifting away from the eurocentric viewpoint of the early conventions towards a more universalist outlook in line with the objectives of the un system furthermore from its inception the who has had more power than its predecessor organisations in particular article 21 of the whos constitution gives the organisation the authority to create regulations to address sanitary and quarantine requirements and other procedures designed to prevent the international spread of disease54 further enhancing its reach is its opt-out model for such regulations replacing the opt-in nature of traditional treaties such as the international sanitary conventions thus ensuring the near-universal reach of its rules55 it is also important to note that in addition to its legal function the who also plays a key role in promoting international standards for cholera prevention and control from a scientific perspective56 although not themselves legally binding these standards influence national policy and international responses including around proper measures for the prevention of cross-border spread these standards thus necessarily inform the legal responseeven more direct is the lineage of the international sanitary conventions themselves they were inherited by the who and adopted by the fourth world health assembly as the international sanitary regulations isr in 1951 exactly a century after the initial international sanitary conference57 at the time of their adoption they covered six quarantinable diseases including cholera nonetheless after the initial adoption of the international sanitary regulations evolution over the next half century would be slow as fidler notes one of the only large-scale changes was to cut back drastically on the number of restrictions governing religious pilgrimages58 still the isr were revised and re-christened as the international health regulations ihr in 1969 at which time typhus and relapsing fever were removed from the list of diseases leaving only four cholera plague and yellow fever plus smallpox59 at this point improved sanitary standards had largely removed cholera as a concern in the european states that first gathered in 1851 but it remained a threat in many parts of the worldindeed by this time the seventh cholera pandemic was underway having begun in indonesia in 1961 further complicating matters the strain of cholera responsible el tor posed new challenges for detection and eradication as it was more both more resilient in the environment and more likely to be carried asymptomatically60 thus as a serious health concern cholera remained a focus of the international health regulations under the auspices of the who just as it had been the initial impetus for the first conferences and subsequent conventionshowever the threat of the seventh pandemic also demonstrated that the existing ihrs were inadequate to the task of preventing the international spread of cholera in 1971 the world health assembly requested the director-general of the who to undertake a study of the implications of the removal of cholera from the international health regulations and to report to the next meeting of the committee on international surveillance of communicable diseases61 the central debate at the twenty-sixth world health assembly 1973 consequently focused around the failure of the ihrs to effectively stop the spread of cholera in turn the decision to keep cholera in the ihrs while modifying the specifics of the response highlights the international consensus on the importance of maintaining binding legal rules hindering its international spread62 at the same time the resulting modifications reflect how emerging scientific evidence resulted in changes to the measures to be taken to prevent that spread the biggest modification to the ihrs at the time was to remove requirements around cholera vaccination including the right of countries to demand a vaccination certificate from incoming travellers what had once been considered an appropriate action was now judged an overreaction not supported by scientific evidence of its public health efficacy this is because it was determined that the vaccine then in use was ineffective63 as will be seen this shift in vaccine policy as a result of monitoring the effectiveness of existing tools holds lessons for what would occur in haitia similar discussion took place around cholera and the concept of preventive medication in international traffic the committee on international surveillance of communicable diseases tasked with examining the issue noted that preventive medication would be justified provided that the drug used was effective in preventing the spread of the disease when administered orally as a single acceptable dose without adverse effects and did not cause bacterial resistance64 however the committee concluded that existing evidence did not suggest any of the drugs under discussion for cholera would meet this standard this discussion too would gain renewed relevance four decades laterthe interaction of scientificmedical developments and the law is further illustrated by the subsequent revision of the ihrs in response to one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine the eradication of smallpox the firstand at this time onlysuccessful eradication of any human disease smallpox was removed from the ihrs in 1981 by contrast the need to keep cholera within the scope of the international health regulations was periodically reinforced as when it reappeared in latin america after a century-long absence in 1991 affecting over 330000 people and killing more than 3500 across 13 countries in the first nine months alone65 as such its capacity to emerge in new territories spread rapidly and cause drastic loss of life was aptly demonstrated nearly 100 years after the first binding agreement designed to prevent its international spreadthe next landmark development for international health law was the dramatic revision and expansion of the international health regulations in 2005 and their entry into force in 2007 as outlined in article 33 of the revised ihrs the implementation of these regulations shall be guided by the goal of their universal application for the protection of all people of the world from the international spread of disease66 to this end the international health regulations of 2005 cover a far broader range of infectious diseases accommodating new threats from emerging and previously unknown diseases alongside long-standing ones such as cholera immediately prior to the revisions by contrast the ihrs still focused only on the first three diseases to be tackled by international health law cholera plague and yellow fever the need for such a revision had been debated since the mid-1990s67 nevertheless the ultimate catalyst for revision was once again a new global threat much as cholera had been for the first international sanitary conference over 150 years earlier68
in this case the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic of 20023 highlighted numerous barriers to preventing and managing the cross-border spread of disease among these was the reticence of china to share information with the rest of the world about this novel disease consequently the revised ihrs expressly require states to develop appropriate surveillance with the capacity to detect assess notify and report events that according to a laid-out set of criteria could be termed public health emergencies of international concern rather than relying upon a small and finite list of diseases nevertheless given its intimate connection to the development of the ihrs and its long-held status as an internationally notifiable disease cholera can still be thought of as the definitive example of a disease whose spread is a matter of international concern this status is further supported by the fact that under the updated ihrs it remains explicitly identified as a disease for which any incident must always be evaluated using ihr criteria given cholera has demonstrated the ability to cause serious public health impact and to spread rapidly internationally69
the current ihrs require states to develop a minimum capacity to address public health emergencies of international concern at airports ports and other border crossings for the first time the ihrs also make explicit room for third parties such as non-governmental organisations ngos to provide information where state communication is insufficient this highlights the role of non-state parties in upholding an important legal principle furthermore in addition to minimum capacities the ihrs emphasise the need for any additional response measures taken by states to take into account scientific principles available scientific evidence and any available guidance or advice from the who70 establishing such standards also offers a degree of protection to states that might be reticent to report a disease for fear of disproportionate reprisal by other states thus who guidance and increasing scientific knowledge about a disease like cholera in general both explicitly inform the steps that must be taken to comply with the ihrsthe 2005 ihrs are the most recent iteration of a set of rules around the international spread of disease whose development began in 1851 in the often hazy world of international law where knowing who accepts the rules is as important as the rules themselves the current ihrs are one of the most widely accepted agreements in existence thanks to the whos opt-out structure they are legally binding on 196 states as of 2017more parties than there are members of the united nations itself71 certainly even these revised ihrs have their deficiencies perhaps most notably the absence of a proper enforcement mechanism however these weaknesses do not undo the virtually universal acceptance of the ihrs to paraphrase an analysis of a previous iteration of the ihrs in the aftermath of the reforms of the early 1970s despite their imperfections the present regulations remain the most acceptable means of trying to attain their underlying objective72 existing weaknesses also do not negate the underlying goal of preventing the international spread of diseasea principle whose development within international health law began with cholera as the haitian tragedy illustrates adherence to this principle remains as important today as it was in 1851 furthermore the ihrs are not the only place where cholera is integrated into international lawwhile the who is the primary un body dealing with rules to prevent the international spread of cholera other international legal instruments can help to further this goal some such instruments do so in broad strokes encompassing cholera within their ambit for instance the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights obliges states to take steps necessary for the prevention treatment and control of epidemic endemic occupational and other diseases73 at the same time evolving human rights norms also increasingly implicate cholera for example the united nations now has both a special rapporteur on the right to health and a special rapporteur on the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation in turn international humanitarian law highlights obligations not to destroy or render useless key infrastructure such as drinking water installations and supplies74 and the burgeoning field of international environmental law has numerous implications for preventing the spread of cholera this includes not only rules around clean water and sanitation that would necessarily affect the spread of the disease but also the emergence of both transboundary responsibility between states and the notion of the precautionary principle75
while these evolving areas of law have serious but indirect implications for cholera it also remains an explicit consideration in multiple fields of international law outside that of health even prior to the formal establishment of the un concerns about the international spread of cholera and other diseases found their way into other areas of what would soon become the un framework the convention on international civil aviation 1944 explicitly highlights the need for each state to take effective measures to prevent the spread by means of air navigation of cholera and other designated diseases76 although the convention under the auspices of the international civil aviation organisation icao has gone through eight revisions since that time this provision remains the same today and as such is binding on 191 state parties as of 2017 cholera has also been an explicit consideration in far more recent agreements for instance the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments which entered into force in 2017 under the auspices of the international maritime organisation imo explicitly includes cholera as the first of its indicator microbes as a human health standard for ballast water77 this is little surprise given that ballast water was a prime suspect in the international spread of cholera in the aftermath of the peruvian epidemic78 taken together it is clear that the international spread of cholera has been explicitly considered by states in the context of international law-making on multiple occasions even outside the auspices of the ihrsbut it is in the area of international trade that cholera has appeared most often one novel tool offered by international trade law is that it also supplies enforcement mechanisms largely absent from other areas of international law such as health as noted earlier minimizing trade disruption by standardizing measures taken against cholera was a primary goal from the first international sanitary conference onwards this objective was highlighted early in the first conference by the french minister of foreign affairs who stated that the imbalance created in the international system and trade by having separate sanitary regulations has to be eliminated79 when fidler outlines the classical regime of the first century of international health law he describes it as having two basic parts obligations on states parties to 1 notify each other about outbreaks of specified infectious diseases in their territories and 2 limit disease-prevention measures that restricted international trade and travel to those based on scientific evidence and public health principles80 these issues are reflected throughout the development of international health law for instance the international sanitary convention 1903 notes no merchandise is capable by itself of transmitting plague or cholera it only becomes dangerous when contaminated by plague or cholera products81 similar debates around the effectiveness of cholera prevention measures and their impact on trade have surfaced much more recently particularly in the context of states imposing excessive scientifically unsupported measures on others to prevent the importation of cholera the economic consequences can be severe as one example it is estimated the 1991 epidemic cost peru hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade and tourism82 as such highlighting the need for proportionate evidence-based responses is important in order to help minimise the possibility states will cover up epidemics for fear of the economic consequencesconsequently measures in excess of what is necessary to prevent the international spread of cholera have been the subject of trade disputes it is important to note that the motivation of preventing the spread of cholerawhen exercised in good faithis not questioned it is only the character and quality of the measures taken for this purpose that are today the most important agreement governing the question of scientifically appropriate measures for restricting trade in the interests of public health protection is the wto agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures83 this agreement has underscored the vital importance of scientific knowledge including the availability of evidence of the efficacy of measures undertaken by countries to avoid cholerafor instance in 1998 the wto committee on sanitary and phytosanitary measures met to discuss concerns raised by tanzania over the prohibition placed on fish imports from tanzania and other east african countries by the european commission over fears of importing cholera84 the meeting makes particular reference to standards set by both the who and the food and agriculture organisation fao reinforcing the importance of un bodies in developing the standards underpinning law85 once again it is important to note that while in this case the use of a total embargo on imports is criticised as excessive the underlying goal of preventing the international transmission of cholera is not thus international trade law highlights how seriously the issue of cholera transmission is taken as well as the importance of scientific standards in determining which measures are appropriate and which measures are not to prevent international transmissionthe examples discussed up until this point highlight unremitting attention to the principle of preventing the international spread of cholera not merely in international health law but in international law more broadly at the same time it is true that legal commentators have expressed scepticism about the strength of international law as it regards infectious disease86 certainly many of the criticisms frequently raised particularly in relation to specific rules that have been breached nearly as often as observed have some validity nonetheless in the case of cholera in particular states have demonstrated a continuous and consistent pattern of integrating the prevention of its spread into international law this is not simply a matter of historical inertia cholera has been inserted explicitly into new agreements in a variety of fields of law while the need to retain it during the reform of existing instruments has been explicitly debated and its presence reconfirmed at the same time ongoing discussion has ensured that both the minimum precautions that need to be taken to prevent the international spread of cholera and the maximum measures that scientific evidence will support have evolved over time at a minimum the development of international health law over the past century and a half shows a clear recognition by international law actors that the principle of prevention of the international spread of cholera is an important one indeed if any longstanding principle relating to any disease can be thought to have attained the status of customary international law it is this one unfortunately this would not be reflected in the actions of the united nations in haitithere remains some ambiguity as to precisely where the united nations fits in under international law a detailed exploration of this issue is well beyond the scope of this chapter nevertheless given its key role in the development of international law and promotion of respect for the same it does not seem credible to suggest the long-established principle of preventing the international spread of cholera should have no implications for the un this is all the more the case given that minustahs mandate explicitly involves assisting with the restoration and maintenance of the rule of law public safety and public order in haiti87 consider changs assertion thata factor that sets the un apart from an ordinary public organisation is its role as the guardian of international norms and order this role not only confers the un what is commonly referred to as a moral authority but carries with it a special responsibility to discharge duties in a manner that is consistent to the very standards it seeks to promote thereby demanding an ethical sense of accountability higher than those already required in the political legal or administrative realms88

in turn the status of forces agreement sofa between the un and haiti explicitly establishes that minustah shall cooperate with the haitian government with respect to sanitary services and shall extend to each other the fullest cooperation in matters concerning health particularly with respect to control of communicable diseases in accordance with international conventions89 furthermore although the focus of this chapter is on international law it is worth noting that were immunity removed from the picture the uns actions likely would have violated domestic haitian law haitian laws and regulations prohibit both a disposal of human waste in waterways and b negligence including the negligent transmission of a contagious disease90
given the role of the un and its specialised agencies not only in developing both binding laws and relevant standards around cholera but in responding to outbreaks on the ground in vulnerable settings the un cannot fail to be aware of what measures might be taken from open communication to basic sanitation to uphold the principle of preventing the international spread of cholera even if the principle were to be found to fall within the scope of the operational immunity afforded the united nations they would still generally be expected to act in accordance with it particularly in the absence of any justifications for departing from it thus it seems rational to conclude that the un would be expected to take reasonable steps and refrain from unreasonable ones to prevent the international spread of cholera based on scientific and public health principles while also sharing information about cholera with other international law actorsultimately the uns conduct in haiti both in the circumstances leading up to the epidemic and after its consequences became clear fail to demonstrate the respect that this longstanding principleone predating the un by nearly a century and codified over 50 years before its formationdeserves in 1851 when nations first joined together to recognise the threat posed by cholera it took over four decades to agree on appropriate measures as discussed earlier in this chapter that delay was rooted primarily in a lack of scientific knowledge necessary to put the underlying legal principle into effect the un in 2010 had no such excuseconsequently an evaluation of what occurred in haiti must also take the state of scientific knowledge into account here it is clear that the epidemic was entirely foreseeable particularly for an organisation experienced with post-conflict and post-disaster settings although disasters do not automatically result in outbreaks of disease they are a harbinger of conditions that may fuel such outbreaks the situation following the earthquake was aptly summed up by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc in a briefing document nine months before the epidemic beganan outbreak of cholera is very unlikely at this time for a cholera outbreak to occur two conditions must be met 1 there must be significant breeches sic in the water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure used by groups of people permitting large-scale exposure to food or water contaminated with vibrio cholera organisms and 2 cholera must be present in the population while the current water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure in haiti would certainly facilitate transmission of cholera and many other illnesses cholera is not circulating in haiti and the risk of cholera introduction to haiti is low most current travelers to haiti are relief workers from countries without endemic cholera and they are likely to have access to adequate sanitation and hygiene facilities within haiti such that any cholera organisms they import would be safely contained similarly importation of cholera through contaminated food has not been documented in haiti in decades and is unlikely to become a problem during the relief efforts91

under such circumstances and boasting similar expertise the un could not fail to be aware that the introduction of the cholera bacterium would be like throwing a lighted match into a gasoline-filled room92 yet although nepal is a cholera endemic country and despite the fact it was itself experiencing an increase in cholera cases at the time nepalese peacekeepers were deployed without effective measures to mitigate the possibility they might be bringing a deadly disease with them93 once they arrived terrible sanitation practices ensured that the local community would soon be exposedthere are some legitimate questions as to exactly what preventative measures the un should have taken in 2010 just as the state of knowledge was not the same in 1851 as it was in 1892 so too has it developed in the fallout from the haitian epidemic in fact the epidemic has served as a springboard for new research and knowledge gleaned in its aftermath will inform future actions for instance one review of the genetic evidence establishing the source of the epidemic not only proposes that genome sequencing should become a frontline screening method for promptly identifying the origin of infectious agents but that current barriers limiting such use such as the absence of a public database of recurring pathogens from different regions be addressed to make this possible94
however it is clear that risks arose even before the infected peacekeepers arrived in haiti one fundamental problem arises from the fact that at the time the epidemic began the medical manual for un peacekeeping then in use focused entirely upon preventing peacekeepers from falling ill without considering what threats peacekeepers might introduce into the populations they are meant to protect95 much like the fortress europe approach of the early international sanitary conventions this is an archaic approach treating disease as a one-way threat emanating from certain populations to menace others this is despite both hundreds of years of history of soldiers serving as vectors for disease and the more recent fact that un peacekeeping presents a unique set of risk factors for introducing outside diseases into vulnerable populations96 recall the cdc briefing document highlighted earlier which states most current travelers to haiti are relief workers from countries without endemic cholera97 by contrast the current model of un peacekeeping relies heavily on troops from lower income countries which themselves face higher domestic burdens of infectious disease in turn peacekeeping brings these troops into contact with vulnerable populations in interactions that would otherwise be unlikely to occur here trade serves to illustrate the unique international interactions facilitated by united nations peacekeeping given that according to nepalese government statistics bilateral trade with haiti in 2010 amounted to roughly us10000 peacekeeping appears to have been responsible for creating an interaction that would not have happened outside the auspices of the united nations98 this is not to suggest for a moment that such interactions are undesirable it is simply to note the importance of ensuring that the accompanying risks are evaluated and addressed indeed as international cooperation between countries of the global south increases outside the un framework it is important that the potential health ramifications are considered by both national governments and nongovernmental organisationsthus it is clear that guidance on specific pre-deployment measures to prevent the spread of cholera by un peacekeepers was lacking in fact cholera is mentioned only once in the manual and then only in a chart contained in an annex to the document99 the obvious inadequacy of the measures in place is underscored by the fact the united nations sought to untruthfully embellish what actions they had taken for instance edmond mulet then under-secretary-general in charge of minustah told media that peacekeepers were tested for cholera before deployment to haiti something repeatedly demonstrated to be untrue100 the lack of any such pre-deployment measures was confirmed by the nepalese armys chief medical officer among others101
while there is room for some debate over the precise pre-deployment measures that should have been taken based on the state of knowledge in 2010 there is no such ambiguity when it comes to sanitary practices on un bases even once the cholera bacterium was imported meeting basic sanitary standardsin essence ensuring that the water source relied upon by tens of thousands of haitians was not contaminated with human faeceswould almost certainly have prevented the epidemic as documented both by journalists and epidemiological investigators sanitary practices at the un base were deplorable with leaking pipes and overflowing open-air waste pits on the banks of the river102 in confirmation of these views a leaked un report reveals that an internal un investigation had itself revealed serious concerns with sanitation practices at the time of the outbreak103
it is also helpful to examine the actions of the un following the initial outbreak and how they conform with the principle of preventing the international spread of cholera here the uns actions do not reflect the importance of open sharing of information that helped catalyse the reforms leading to the 2005 international health regulations most immediately the un attempted to cover up what had happened including efforts to hide or repair facilities while issuing misleading press statements about sanitary standards on the base104 they also refused a request by haitian epidemiologists to examine the minustah soldiers at the base in the early days of the epidemic105 it is hard to justify such actions in the context of the legal principle discussed in this paper or even of the who guidance document on national cholera policies that states more detailed information on the sources and routes of transmission of infection should be sought by epidemiological investigation of outbreaks106
the uns actions have not greatly improved over the longer term this is most clearly illustrated in their response to the final report of the un-appointed independent panel charged with investigating the epidemic which made seven recommendations107 although secretary-general ban ki-moon promised a prompt follow-up on these recommendations such action was not forthcoming108 in 2013 two years after the report was made public an ngo report noted that of the seven recommendations made by the panel only two had been implemented and a further two partially implemented109 none of the suggested pre-deployment measuresprophylaxis screening and vaccinationhad been acted upon at all also not acted upon was the recommendation that un installations treat faecal waste using on-site systems that inactivate pathogens before disposalin 2014 three years after the seven recommendations were made the un posted a fact sheet online outlining their response to them notably it states that the un accepts the proposal to vaccinate peacekeepers for cholera an example of how both evolving technology and ongoing evaluation can change policy consider how cholera vaccination was accepted in the 1920s and rejected in the 1970s at the same time it rejects the recommendations on screening and prophylaxis110 the fact sheet does not provide the evidence relied upon to support this decision instead referring to a closed-door pahowho expert consultation on pharmacological measures for prevention of cholera introduction in non-endemic areas although a final report was generated in this consultation it has never been publically released111 thus while the actual results of the expert consultation may indeed be compelling it is impossible to evaluate them concealing from public and expert scrutiny what is presumably an objective evaluation by scientific experts of prospective methods of preventing cholera transmission is not in any way conducive to preventing the international spread of cholera in future by contrast where further research has been conducted and shared publically very different conclusions have been reached modelling from yale university suggests that not only would screening and prophylaxis be effective but that they would be more cost-effective than vaccination112 the un has yet to directly engage with this study and its implicationsas for the recommendation to treat faecal waste on-site the fact sheet notes the un has undertaken substantial actions to improve wastewater management in field missions however a subsequent internal audit of waste management in minustah facilities conducted in 2014 gives a final rating of unsatisfactory indicating serious on-going problems even four years after the epidemic began113 such revelations cast doubt on the efforts of the un to reform its practices that this audit report was not made public until 2016 does not help their casethis is not to say the un has not learned anything about the consequences of poor sanitation for instance leaked internal documents from the minusca peacekeeping mission in central african republic identify health hazards to the local population from a un dumpsite and state the mission should be highly concerned as this could easily culminate in litigation against minusca which should be avoided taking into account lessons learnt from the haiti case114 similarly given the inadequacy of the existing medical guidelines for peacekeeping missions the united nations also quietly updated its medical manual for peacekeeping operations five years after the epidemic began the updated version directly acknowledges the risks that peacekeepers pose to vulnerable populations noting the danger inherent in the introduction of diseases into the host countrys environment particularly where such diseases are assumed to be non-existent prior to peacekeeping115 it adds this is especially important for communicable diseases such as cholera the revised manual also explicitly includes extensive guidelines for educating peacekeepers about cholera while these changes are to be welcomed it remains to be seen how the updated manual will be applied in practiceimportantly it must also be noted that the more substantive changes focus heavily on cholera and preventing a repeat of the haitian scenario rather than effectively tackling the broader concern of introducing diseases into vulnerable populations malaria for instance already presents a risk to individual peacekeepers across multiple un missions where they are frequently exposed to malaria vectors in the field in turn this poses the threat of the introduction or re-introduction of malaria into malaria-free areas or the introduction of drug-resistant strains into areas where those drugs are still effective116 this latter scenario is of particular concern given that peacekeepers from countries where resistance to artemisinin-based drugs has emerged are frequently deployed in regions of africa where the burden of malaria is especially high and those drugs remain a vital public health tool117 this is a key example of the need for further practical reforms in the aftermath of haitilastly the haitian epidemic serves as a reminder of a fundamental concept drawn from the field of medicine applicable not only to the un but to any states or ngos engaging in activities that carry a risk of the international transmission of disease first do no harm this should be a primary consideration no matter how well intentioned the intervention particularly where it affects communities whose circumstances heighten their vulnerability to disease only time will tell if the un as flag-bearer for international cooperation will belatedly embrace this concept as a result of its experiences in haiti along with the related commitments to open communication and evidence-based approaches to disease that have formed part of international health law particularly in relation to cholera for well over a centurytwo centuries after the first pandemic kicked off the globalisation of cholera it remains both a threat to those who lack access to clean water and sanitation and an important topic under international law in 2017 controversy over sharing information about cholera erupted within the race for the directorship-general of the who although allegations that he had covered up cholera outbreaks while serving as ethiopias minister of health were not enough to derail the eventual winner tedros adhanom ghebreyesus118 at the same time cholera continues to claim victims around the world including the massive epidemic in conflict-ridden yemen that the un under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs has referred to as a man-made catastrophe and whose toll could soon eclipse that in haiti119 and in haiti itself a once novel disease threatens to become endemic in the absence of concerted actionas noted at the beginning of this chapter un responsibility for the haitian cholera epidemic touches on a wide range of international law issues at its core however it is a problem that would have been avoided if the un had only taken steps to adhere to the oldest principle of international health law with a history stretching back over 160 years including over a century of binding multilateral obligations it is evident that preventing the international spread of cholera is a robust and longstanding international legal principle it is also clear that the un violated it it is less clear what the practical implications of this principle and its violation are for the people of haiti going forward the term cholera forcing was pejoratively coined to refer to the idea that cholera epidemics both in the nineteenth century and today were and can be the key stimulus for procurement of safe water and sanitation120 this has not been the experience in haiti where the introduction of this previously unknown disease has only exacerbated serious pre-existing problems with access to water and sanitation as of the time of this writing a series of plans to address cholera has come and gone with none of them ever raising even close to the funds required to carry them out121 the more recent package accompanying secretary-general ban ki-moons apology in december of 2016 remains drastically underfunded122
furthermore despite the increased prominence of the issue as a result of the epidemic the precise boundaries between operationally necessary immunity and harmful impunity for the united nations have still not been delineated this leaves no legal stick to enforce unfulfilled promises and while the un has taken some steps to prevent a similar public health disaster from occurring in the future it is not yet clear if these steps will be sufficient or indeed whether they are being taken in practice as well as on paper by contrast the west african ebola outbreak which claimed a similar number of lives but garnered considerably more media coverage has attracted not only vastly greater sums of money but also drawn far more international attention to failures to implement the ihrs as well as broader questions about the capacity of the who and the wider international community to effectively tackle the international spread of disease123 the difference in attitude towards the two diseases was hammered home in the midst of the ebola outbreak when the un was quick to suspend the rotation of peacekeepers from the affected countries to minustah in haiti124 ebola perceived as a danger by wealthy and influential countries that have not felt threatened by cholera for decades may yet direct the course of changes of international law around the transmission of disease for haiti however a tragic first encounter with cholera occurring a century and a half after it served as the initial catalyst for states to come together to establish legal measures to prevent the international spread of disease has resulted in much legal debate but little justiceon 23 august 1793 facing possible defeat in its revolutionary wars with austria prussia spain britain and the united provinces as well as internal insurrections the french national convention issued a leve en masse its opening point declaredfrom this moment until that in which the enemy shall have been driven from the soil of the republic all frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the service of the armies the young men shall go to battle the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions the women shall make tents and clothing and shall serve in the hospitals the children shall turn old linen into lint the aged shall betake themselves to the public places in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach the hatred of kings and the unity of the republichalsall 2020
this call for mass conscription literally a mass uprising would transform the french military replacing the professional army within the year with a vast national army of 800000 trained soldiers made up of citizens but the leve meant more than the creation of a mass army being built on two key ideas the first was a new relationship to the state with an implicit post-revolutionary compact whereby all those united and protected as citizens owed a similar duty of protection to the state from now on the body of the citizen was intimately tied to the survival of the body politic the second following from this was that the entire society would be mobilized to support the military as ernst junger notes here the image of war as armed combat merges into the more extended image of a gigantic labour process now the military army is joined byand tothe modern armies of commerce transport foodstuff and munitions until there is no longer any movement whatsoeverbe it that of the homeworker at her sewing machinewithout at least indirect use for the battlefield junger 1991 126the leve-en-masse transformed warfare with conscription and mass armies becoming common and during conflict states increasingly transforming themselves into war-time economies diverting huge resources to military service wwi saw the fruition of these processes with the mass mobilization of populations for mass warfare supported by the mass mobilization of home industries for some this mobilization was insufficient in his 1930 essay total mobilization ernst junger complained of germanys only partial mobilization 1991 125 for revolutionary conservatives like junger true greatness required a total mobilization with its unlimited marshalling of potential energies a mobilization that requires extension to the deepest marrow 1991 126 this mobilization was itself a reflection of the kinetic rhythms of the machine ageit suffices simply to consider our daily life with its inexorability and merciless discipline its smoking glowing districts the physics and metaphysics of its commerce its motors airplanes and burgeoning cities with a pleasure-tinged horror we sense that here not a single atom is not in motionthat we are profoundly inscribed in this raging process total mobilization is far less consummated than it consummates itself in war and peace it expresses the secret and inexorable claim to which our life in the age of masses and machines subjects us1991 128
the totally mobilized peace of modernity therefore prefigured and produced the total mobilization of modern war jungers hopes for a new german youth who would throw themselves into this project of renewal-through-mobilization soon found its expression in nazisms blitzkrieg and the total mobilization of wwii that definitively erased the difference between civilian life and military actionthough conscription continued in the west in the post-war period gradually the experience of war changed for its populations becoming more remote from everyday life by the time of the 1991 gulf war smaller professional armies dominated again defined now by their total mobilization not of men but of technologies by then war itself was in crisis in the west with questions being asked as to whether western societies could sustain casualties and still support military action the solution was a new phase in the history of mobilization with the military and media collaborating in the gulf to produce and disseminate the global spectacle domestic populations would now be mobilized as its audience in this new leve-en-masse-medias the publics role was to watch television to consume the war to follow the press briefings marvel at the smart-bomb footage and clean war and applaud the military operationin this new imploded home front war now meant enjoying the scopic pleasures of a video-game war taylor 1998 75 knightley 2000 483 with little risk for western combatants and none at all for its viewers a steve bell cartoon of the time showed a penguin grandfather replying to his grandchilds question of

kosovo in 1999 afghanistan in 2001 and iraq in 2003 albeit one increasingly left behind as the war on terror developed with the move to unseen drone strikes and special-forces operations it was better if no-one knew what was happening hence the public were effectively stood down that demobilization would last until the 2020 covid-19 lockdown which inaugurated a new era of totaldemobilizationwhen

nevertheless suggests there are similarities between pandemics and war especially if a realistic view of modern war is adopted in terms of effects and governmental responses freedman 2020 but perhaps we can go even further perhaps our concept of war itself needs redefining perhaps biologically this is a warin 2000 the atmospheric chemist paul crutzen declared we are in the anthropocene ellis 2018 1a proposed new era marking the impact of humanity on the world distinguished from the holocene by the record of human activity in the geological strata we have long known that humans have transformed the world and have done so since hunter-gathering times but recent decades have seen a growing awareness that the scale and speed of human transformation has exponentially increased though the concept of the anthropocene remains controversial with disagreements as to what geological records to accept and when the anthropocene began with the mid-twentieth century being seen by many as a key moment the broader trends it identifies in climate change systemic pollution the transformation of habitats and ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity are beyond disputethere is of course a long history of pandemics and plagues stretching from the earliest time through outbreaks like leprosy in eleventh-century europe the black death in mid-fourteenth-century europe the first of seven cholera pandemics in 1817 the chinese plague from 1855 the 1875 fiji measles pandemic the 1889 russian flu the 1918 spanish flu the 1957 asian flu aidshiv after 1981 through to contemporary outbreaks such as sars many were spread by human activity and can thus be seen to have an anthropogenic element perhaps the most famous example here is the fifteenthsixteenth-century columbian exchange which included the transferral of small pox and other diseases to the americas killing up to 56 m people and eradicating entire civilizations ellis 2018 9596the global risk of a new pandemic had been known for decades even appearing in popular culture the first episode of the bbcs 1975 show survivors opened with a flu virus escaping an asian laboratory globally spreading via air travel and ending 50 minutes later

appearance of a war in its casualties impact and long-term implications as a global biological attack on the entire species the covid-19 pandemic is essentially anthropogenic as a zoonotic disease most likely arising out of changes in habitat and interaction with humans whilst the wuhan wet market is not the proven source of the outbreak these markets are an important example of humanly created transmissible environments though the dating of the anthropocene is still open and though earlier anthropogenic pandemics have existed we can see that covid-19 is the first global pandemic requiring a truly global response since our recognition of the anthropocene it is the first anthropocenic world warcovid-19 was intimately linked with globalization and the hyperconnected economy wuhan a city of 11 million is a major transportation hub a centre of manufacturing and as part of the post-2004 rise of central china plan a hub of hi-tech production and research benefitting from the movement of rural workers to urban centres the growth of cheap industrial labour and developments in it communications transport and shipping it is closely tied to the global economy and globalization liu 2020 even the wet market was linked to globalization in serving both the growing working population and in its trade in exotic animals for the wealthy despite this global character few in the west understood the risks western exceptionalism the belief that the virus would be contained in asia and the unthinkability of similar restrictions meant the threat was ignoredthose hit first were the countries most connected to china and the most globally connected with its spread the global system itself went into lockdown global travel stopped travel restrictions and quarantine were imposed and each nation forced its populations indoors with it came a lockdown on international relations the usiran hostility that only weeks earlier many feared would escalate into world war iii bogart 2020 was now forgotten with trump warning against any resumption barnes 2020 conflict shifted instead into posturing and soft power from trumps insistence on calling it the chinese virus and attacks on the who as pro-chinese al jazeera 2020 shear 2020 to chinas post-lockdown reframing of themselves as benevolent global providers of ppe the economist 2020the lockdown of the international order was also a lockdown of events at least as far as national audiences were concerned as covid-19 crowded out all other news the only international news of note was how other nations were coping with their own lockdowns the global system of communications was ruptured by the virus a system defined by motionby the hypercirculation of goods commodities people money data and communicationswas fundamentally interrupted slowed down and even paused forced in its extremes into idleness into furlough even hyperredundancy the whole remained in motion but with its systems disruptedwith employment and consumption locked-downit lacked both its meaning and the means to complete its circuitsthe greatest symbol of this pause of the global was the fate of oil the source of fuel for all global transport and motion demand crashed in the global lockdown and on 20 april for the first time ever the price of us oil went negative falling from 18 a barrel to 38 ambrose 2020a crucially the cause of that crash was not simply the lack of demand but the immobility of the oil itself as places to store the oversupply ran out now tankers that a few weeks earlier were crossing the world laden with up to 2 m barrels sat motionless around the coasts of the world full of the very means of movement itself ambrose 2020bwar at its heart is motion paul virilio the theorist of dromocracy is fond of quoting sun tzus claim speed is the essence of war as well as frederick the greats dictum to win is to advance virilio 1986 13355 indeed wars violence is first of all the violence of movement itselfthe speed of assaultrecall again sun tzu the onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course sun tzu 2020 ch5 part 12 war therefore is the rapid transferral of bodies and energies from one point in space and time to another point already occupied by other bodies with the aim of displacing or destroying them it is a kinetic phenomenon with the destructive force and character of a projectile one that begins and ends with movement with mobilization and demobilizationin the covid-19 world war however the entire war was demobilization within each nation the mass of the population was immediately demobilized being asked to do nothing to not leave the house to not move and to remain essentially inactive in a reversal of the leve-en-masse and of jungers call for total mobilization this global species-wide world war produced instead the total demobilization of the population the essence of war reverses here from speed into immobility and inertia whereas in modern societies junger suggests not a single atom is not in motion ours immediately dedicated itself to eradicating it if for virilio the speed of contemporary weapons technologies brings an advantage over the enemy in allowing us to gain fractions of seconds 1986 137 this was a war that worked in the opposite direction with demobilization hoping to gain weeks even months worth of advantage whereas marinetti proclaimed that the futurists would glorify war describing it as the worlds only hygiene marinetti 2009 22 here the proto-fascists desire to destroy human life reversed into a new defence of the human against covid-19 for today for the period of viral infection hygiene became the worlds only warif this was the potential end of the species it was a curious apocalypse lacking in the west at least the pain violence and collapse of civilization we had expected here for many the end was merely an entropic sloth anaesthetized with alcohol and marked by longer hair weight gain and binge watching this was the apocalypse as a dull sunday afternoonas alan partridges famous appeal to the heavens sunday bloody sunday brand 2014 for virilio when wwi ended as a war of spaceas a war of movementbogged down in the stalemate of the trenches it became instead a war of attrition a war of time where duration was survival 1986 525356 this was our fate too with the lockdown closing down space and movement this world war was turned into a war of time with duration again representing survival to live meant to bunker-down to cut oneself off from space and survive time life was reduced to endurance and especially to the endurance of oneselfwith the national invasion of the virus and the lockdown of events there emerged instead a global civilwar each infected nation withdrew closed itself off and declared their own war on the virus to win it each nation had first of all to wage war on human life itselfon our very being-in-the-worldthis global legal lockdown was historically unprecedented whole nations immediately transformed themselves into carceral societiesor rather in our compliance into self-incarcerated societies this was a self-imposed house-arrest a concept to be understood only secondarily in its legal sense for the word arrest means first of all to cause to stop from the late fourteenth-century-old french arester to stay stop with its roots in the latin arrestare meaning to stop restrain and this was our primary experience this stopping is traditionally a punishment as the arrested person is imprisoned and refused space to move whilst motionlessness has also been used as torturecentral to the enhanced interrogation techniques used against iraqi prisoners at abu ghraib for example were stress positions handcuffing people into painful prolonged immobility here therefore we put ourselves under house arrest we stopped ourselves locked ourselves in and placed ourselves into stress positions torturing the public body for weeks with enforced immobility or perhaps this was more medieval in toneresponding to the plague-like miasmic threat with a self-siege warfare with each individual retreating behind their walls to hold out with their storesthis atmospheric element is important sloterdijks 2002 book terror from the air explores the movement in the twentieth century from targeting the body to targeting the environment and

declared war virilio argues there are two atmospheres and not just one those we can breathe in and those which kill us 1994 42 hence bunkers became a shelter for man in this critical period the place where he buries himself to subsist 1994 46 so in this lockdown the terror from the air became a terror of the air and military bunker architecture was democratized and generalized to all as we locked ourselves in our casement literally a strong-house 1994 46 being-in-the-world became being-in-the-bunker with sloterdijks claim that we are condemned to being-in  describing now not only the fatality of phenomenological reality but the fate of the body within an unbreathable worldthere was something dystopian about the resulting exodus from public space echoing science-fiction warnings of abandoned landscapes from the domed bunker cities of logans run and blakes 7 set on a ruined earth to the environmental catastrophes of ballards the drowned world and the drought to the emptied urban

it is hard to read this without thinking of our lockdown in an isolated hyperextended present disconnected from the real experience of time and space and engaging through real-time interfaces for virilio this loss of the terrestrial body has another theological meaning as the loss of motion animathe root of animation is also the loss of our soul latin anima 1997 25 hence the body terminal in only being mobile on the spot 1997 20 is fundamentally a terminal bodyin committing us to this condition therefore the lockdown saved lives by killing life our survival machines became our sarcophagi ultimately threatening to be more dangerous than going out as virilio says stasis is death 1986 67the key battleground in this war against covid-19 was the reversed home front of everyday life where previously the front line was the battlefield supported by logistics and medical aid with the home front far removed now the home-front was the battlefield with the front line even reversing behind this to encompass the medical and logistical workers the health and care staff and gig-economy workers who risked their lives to keep the home front alive in recognition of this service uk tabloid the sun began a campaign to award the george cross media for gallantry to the nhs itself fairbairn 2020everyday life had long been theorized by post-war western marxists as a key site of ideological contestation and a space requiring liberation lefebvre 2014 2016 vaneigem 1994 marx in the german ideology famously ruminated on the future eradication of the division of labour for a life allowing one to hunt fish rear-cattle and criticize as one wished without ever becoming hunter fisherman herdsman or critic marx 2020 whilst the situationists dreamed of a liberation from drudgery and the opportunity for self-realization as raoul vaneigem convincingly explainsin an industrial society which confuses work and productivity the necessity of producing has always been an enemy of the desire to create what spark of humanity of possible creativity can remain alive in a being dragged out of sleep at six every morning jolted about in suburban trains deafened by the racket of machinery bleached and steamed by meaningless sounds and gestures spun dry by statistical controls and tossed out at the end of the day into the entrance halls of railway stations those cathedrals of departure for the hell of weekdays and the nugatory paradise of weekends where the crowd communes in a brutish weariness from adolescence to retirement each twenty-four hour cycle repeats the same shattering bombardment vaneigem 1994 52

violence perkins 2020 whilst trumps critics saw his handling of the crisis as a disaster in fact he was playing to his strengths what trump achieved was to transform the covid-19 civil war into an extension of his already successful political and cultural civil war against the american people and its democratic institutions this was politics as a continuation of civil war by identical meansin his 1990 essay postscript on the societies of control gilles deleuze argues we have left behind the nineteenth-century foucauldian disciplinary societies and moved to new societies of control deleuze 1992 34 we have passed from societies defined by concentration enclosure and the disciplinary power of incarcerationto new computer 1992 6 and code-based 1992 5 technologies and systems whose modulation 1992 4 allows continuous forms of control 1992 7 his example of this in practice is guattaris suggestion of a control mechanism able to track an individual around a city in real time with electronic systems modulating behaviour by giving or withdrawing access 1992 7 in the space of months we repeated this historical trajectory turning first back into societies of incarceration before our gradual remobilizationpassing back out into the world through the continuous controls of digital surveillancethis was not easy recent years had seen the systematic pathologization of the internet as the optimism of web 20s participative society gave way to an antipathy to public over-participation and fear of manipulation by the time covid-19 hit the internet was seen as an out-of-control toxic realm of trolling abuse death threats hate speech political extremism populism russian hacking information warfare and disinformation fake news electoral manipulation by paid targeted advertising cybercrime government surveillance and mass-harvested personal data with few privacy protections almost overnight this reversed again with the real world and human relations becoming toxic and the internet being transformed into our saviour allowing safe work education entertainment and communication within weeks we became like the cell-bound inhabitants of forsters tale afraid of human contact the outside world was no longer a site of possible risk but instead was absolutely impure the sacred caillois writes is always more or less what one cannot approach without dying 2001 21 and this was how we now treated life the arbitrary 2 m distancing was treated as a meeting point between the safe profane and the sacred world of contagion impurity and death to get close to another was not simply a risk it was a passage between orders of beinghence remobilization was more difficult and anxious than demobilization in the uk the relaxation of restrictions was confusing and the suggestion that some could return to work emphasized the reality of speed classes with middle classes more able to remain at home teleworking whilst the working classes had to take their chances with public transport and work jones 2020 despite the most effective model of remobilization being the labour-intensive process of mass testing contact tracing and isolation many nations preferred technological solutionism embracing the continuous controls of digital surveillance with electronic tagging replacing house arrest china pioneered this approach as a logical extension of their massive near-ubiquitous surveillance system deployed against the uighurs in xinjiang wall street journal 2017 byler 2019 and the social credit systems and facial-recognition cameras used against their domestic populations mistreanu 2018 dudley 2020 here cctv facial recognition drones qr codes location tracking by telecoms and technology companies and voluntary or mandatory apps formed a network of sensors enmeshing individuals in exactly that city-wide control-mechanism guattari foresaw the same systems were widely adopted beyond china highlighting an underlying trend within global political systems the movement of all governments towards informational totalitarianismwe are still too bewitched by twentieth-century totalitarianismdistracted by the spectacle uniforms speeches and rallies the symbolism and the public terror nazi germany stalinist ussr maoist china were all hypervisible aesthetically organized states aiming to abolish the separation of public and private life to lay everything open to its eyeespecially by forceand fulfil mussolinis dreams of totalitario all within the state nothing outside the state none against the state now at a historical distance from its political theatrics the essence of totalitarianism is finally revealed it is about the right of the state to penetrateto overseethe totality of life within it this is clearly an informational project stripped of its politico-aesthetics and aided by the rise of digital technology it reverses now from spectacle to secrecy and from public to private to silently access monitor and evaluate every aspect of personal interiority and singularityhence totalitarianism quietly fulfils itself today as an ideology of transparency of absolute recording access and exposure it is freed here not only from the burden of terror the manpower of policing and the cost of costumery but most importantly from ties to any political system or ideology existing simply as the technocratic aim and result of digital systems today therefore even western liberal democracies are informationally totalitarian in their mass surveillance their treatment of personal data and their systems of monitoring and control in their desireno different to that of authoritarian regimesto access everything and their absolute conviction that they have the right to do so once again this is for our benefitwhat was once for our security is now for public healthbut it nevertheless remains an internal attack on the data integrity of the states own citizens the us and uk governments had joked about this archly naming two of their spy programmes bullrun and edgehill after civil war battles ball et al 2013 that data civil war against private data has continued without a pause since snowdens revelations and it is likely that the advances allowed by the covid-19 crisis will never be rolled backthe heart of the post-covid-19 new normal therefore will not be the physical regimes of cleanliness and distancing but the new data regime we thought this had already been accomplished in the existing system of surveillance capitalism zuboff 2019 but covid-19 will supercharge this process representing the moment when our public and private spaces and lives imploded opening up previously limited areas for total data colonization as naomi klein argues the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives but as a living laboratory for a permanentand highly profitableno-touch future it is a future in which our homes are never again exclusively personal spaces but are also via high-speed digital connectivity our schools our doctors offices our gyms and if determined by the state our jails klein 2020 it is the future of the bunkerized terminal citizen with an increasing reliance on internet and phone infrastructures and remotely delivered services and systems delivering ever-greater quantities of personal data to private companies and statesthe work of remobilization will be one of the great state projects of our lifetime the movement of bodies out of homes of labour into the work place of the market back to life and the recirculation of capital will require great effort the cardiac-arrest of capitalismsaved in the uk only through the effective nationalization of the economy and a simulacral-communist state responsibility for the economic and physical welfare of the populationwill require a massive defibrillation of the economy to shock it back to life but there are doubts as to how fast this can be achieved the imf has warned that the world faces the worst recession since the great depression bbc 2020j or for the uk for 300 years morris 2020 whilst the who warns that covid-19 may never go away bbc 2020k with this economic slowdown the covid-19 civil wars will continue to be fought within each nation for years to comethe remobilization of the world order will also be difficult on 7 may trump commented that impact of the coronavirus on the usa was worse than pearl harbor  worse than the world trade center bbc 2020l judged by casualties this is certainly true the 73573 coronavirus deaths by 7 may far eclipsed the 2403 deaths at pearl harbor or 2977 killed in 911 but the meaning of those events really lay in their political significance and impact on the world order if we consider the global scale of this pandemic the global lockdown of populations the global death toll the halt to economic and international relations and the differential and ongoing impact of the virus we can see that covid-19 may prove an event of equally or potentially greater historical significance there was pre-covid-19 and there was the time after its first great wavethe hyperconnected world of global travel and contact will take a long time to recover and as with domestic life much that can be transferred online will be international conflict will not end but one possibility is nations will be more inward looking and less interested in others on 12 may it was revealed for example that the uks national security council had not met since january with the government focused on covid-19 sabbagh 2020 military action may be more difficult with the expected slashing of military budgets and a possible mindset that might resent spending on international action or aid when the domestic economy remains to be fixed warrell 2020 the emphasis may shift therefore to strengthening the national and civilian infrastructure in anticipation of future human or human-created threats military action is also physically difficult right now with the need for social distancing impacting on military bases ships and submarines on training and exercises and parades and future operationsbut that is why we can expect an acceleration of one particular trend in warfare since the 1991 gulf war with the allied air supremacy that allowed them to bomb with utter impunity through the zero-casualty aerial 1999 nato kosovo war to the development of drones the usa has led the way in socially-distanced warfare we can expect to see the post-covid-19 explosion therefore of drones surrogate robotics and autonomous systems all controlled from remote shipping containers or box-room bunkers this will be a new phase of clean war defined now not by the absence of civilian casualties but by the hand sanitizer available for the next shift of pilots and the plastic screen between them and the camera and weapons operators here the act of washing ones hands before taking over the controls will take on a macabre moral dimensionthere are other reasons why conflict may have an expanded future in a world where international powers are more reluctant to intervene regional powers will have far more leeway to pursue their aims chinas ongoing actions in the south china sea nicol 2020 and imposition of new security laws in hong kong kuo and davidson 2020 are one example of this but others have seen the opportunity data analytics company babel street recorded an apparent increase in military activity in may by iran despite being badly hit by covid-19 irans support for offensive cyber-operations and for proxy forces in yemen and iraq rose in the previous 2 weeks tucker 2020ainternational conflict has continued online during the pandemic already poor uschinese relations have worsened as trump tries to direct domestic anger towards china and as china tries to divert international attention from the viruss origins and their poor handling of medical reports this has all the making of a new viral respiratory cold war as the us cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency noted china and other authoritarian governments have promoted false claims about the origins of the virus in an attempt to shift blame overseas and divide free societies against themselves using tactics such as censoring news injecting false narratives onto social media platforms and promoting slick government-produced videos baksh 2020 on 29 april for example chinas state-run news agency xinhua posted an animated video titled once upon a virus showing lego-like figures representing china and the us trading barbs at each other with the us statue of liberty getting progressively sicker whilst claiming the virus is not dangerous but millions of chinese are dead even though the virus is not dangerous we are correct even though we contradict ourselves timsit 2020 this was not traditional state propaganda designed as viral sharable social media content this was troll-warfare instead of a hot war china had launched a burn war against the usa it did not matter that its own claims were false here you win with the lulzbeyond china russia and iran were also using the opportunity to extend their online disinformation campaigns against the west beaumont et al 2020 tucker 2020b even cyberwar was changing with espionage now targeting not military political or economic secrets but research into the coronavirus and vaccines as reports emerged of china russia and iran hacking western laboratories cole 2020a b davidson 2020 overall we can expect computer network exploitation cne disinformation propaganda and trolling to continue with perhaps greater impactthe post-covid-19 era has the potential for considerable national economic political and social instability including backlashes against governments and their responses the scapegoating of particular groups unrest at the economic impact so soon after the 2008 crash and its enforced austerity and a more nationalist isolationist anti-globalitarian mood the uk lockdown for example prompted a surge in hate crimes against asian communities grierson 2020 and continuing anger hostility and fear seem likely to be one inheritance of this crisis the entire post-covid-19 world will be more unpredictable and more volatile the virus did not affect each nation the same and within each country the responses of governments and populations will be different globally an already fragile world orderstill recovering from the 2008 crash suffering the after-effects of the war on terror facing the reassertion of russian power and the rise of china and india hit by the retreat of liberal democracy the success of populist strongmen leaders and ethno-nationalist movements and struggling with long-term civil wars refugees and immigration flows climate change and a us president pursuing an unpredictable random and often-dangerous foreign policywill only become more unstable if the seismic political shift of the fall of communism in 1991 led many to speculate about a possible new world order the seismic political shift of covid-19 brings the possibility of an epoch-defining new world disorderh g wells 1897 novel the war of the worlds told the story of the martian invasion of earth and the aliens eventual defeat not by human hands but by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared wells 2019 the book was an attack on hubris using invasion literature to question both evolutionary theory and imperialism and the idea that humanity in general and victorian colonial britain in particular were superior to all others for how superior were we if we had to be saved by the humblest things that god in his wisdom has put upon this earth actually bacteria were not the smallest thingsit would take years before the much smaller viruses were discoveredbut wells was correct about our hubris although in his scientific romance these bacteria were our microscopic allies we failed in the subsequent years to take seriously the threat of these microbial forces covid-19 was a reminder of the power of the world and our place within it with this anthropogenic pandemic the war of the worlds gave way to its inevitable sequel the war of the worldwhy the battle against covid-19 and the concept of anthropocenic war are important is because they help us recognize that from now on human conflict will be increasingly accompanied by exacerbated or even sparked by anthropogenic environmental factors environmental change or phenomena will increasingly impact upon human societies destabilizing them creating poverty and increasing political violence and competition hence the anthropocene has definitively announced itself as the final global superpower replacing the limited realms of human state power with its own singular environmental force the aftershocks of covid-19 will be serious as it spreads through the global south as it pits nations into competition as it introduces new pressures into areas already riven by natural disasters civil war or political extremism as it impacts domestically on each nations economy politics and world view and as it destabilizes the international ordergiven the likelihood of more pandemics to come and the growing impact of anthropogenic environmental problems the first anthropocenic war will not be the last the war of the world will continuecovid-19 stands for coronavirus disease 2019 and it refers to an outbreak of acute respiratory infection caused by a novel coronavirus the specific coronavirus strain was initially referred to as 2019-ncov 2019 novel coronavirus and finally designated as sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 it was first identified in late 2019 in the city of wuhan hubei province of china and it rapidly spread throughout other eastern countries eg south korea japan iran as well as europe and the united states 1 on march 2020 the who world health organization declared the covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic and all countries were urged to undertake effective measures for reducing transmission 2vaccines active against covid-19 are not available and ongoing prospects in formulating and developing preventive or therapeutic vaccines against sars-cov-2 are limited 3 in this context public health actions to prevent transmission are crucial in slowing the spread of the pandemic one of the essential recommendations that the who has issued for the populous is to wash their hands frequently and correctly in the process intensified hand washing may generate various changes in skin texture and even hand dermatitisthis article aims to review the potential dermatological adverse effects that may arise due to frequent hand washing as well as practical tips for preventing these uncomfortable skin reactions all clinical images included in the review section of the article were taken in the department of oncologic dermatology of emergency university hospital elias in bucharest using a digital camera nikon d3300 nikon corporation tokyo japan 
from frequent hand washing to hand dermatitis
frequent hygienization of hands may generate various changes in skin texture ranging from the development of cutaneous xerosis dryness of the skin up to irritant contact dermatitis icd or rarely even allergic contact dermatitis acd overall these skin disorders are induced by various physical chemical and immunological mechanisms when measures of diligent hand hygiene are implemented these mechanisms may be activated mainly by the following circumstances1 prolonged skin exposure to water and humid environment it creates extensive swelling of stratum corneum the skins outermost layer and disruption in the ultrastructure of intercellular lipids and heightens the skins permeability and sensitivity to physical or chemical irritants 4 in addition prolonged wearing of protective gloves can generate excessive sweating and increased humidity thus further increasing the inflammatory response elicited towards irritants2 repeated use of soaps surfactants detergents or solvents these substances used for domestic cleaning are weak irritants and are usually very well tolerated nevertheless repeated exposure to these substances can lead to chronic cumulative icd figure 1 mainly due to their capacity to remove skin surface lipids damage skin proteins denature epidermal keratin and even induce alteration of the cell membrane of keratinocytes 5 furthermore patients with a personal or family history of atopic dermatitis have a chronically dysfunctional cutaneous barrier that increases their sensitivity to skin irritants figure 2 6 rarely some individuals may even develop acd figure 3 a t-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to an ingredient in a hand hygiene-related product such as soaps or detergents 73 repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer the who states that using hand rubs that contain at least 60 alcohol is a reasonable alternative if water and soap are not available and as long as the hands are not visibly dirty 8 frequent use of these products can also result in skin dryness and irritation on the other hand allergy against alcohol itself is unknown and acd attributable to other compounds added to alcoholic hand gels is extremely rare this was illustrated by the experience of a large hospital in switzerland where health workers routinely used a commercial alcohol-based hand sanitizer for 10 years without reporting any allergic reactions to the product 9 management tipsin these times it is very important to adapt our hand washing habits to ensure efficient protection against the spread of covid-19 while lowering the risk of skin adverse reactions in this respect we find very useful the adoption of the following protective measures1 as the who recommends hands should be washed thoroughly including fingernails interdigital web spaces wrists for at least 20 seconds using lukewarm water and soap particularly after being in public areas before meals after coughing or sneezing after using the toilet and whenever the hands are dirty2 after washing we advise rinsing the hands by using gentle maneuvers without causing a physical irritation to the skin3 applying moisturizing skin care products after hand cleansing is the essential step in keeping the skin hydrated and preventing further abnormal skin reactions these hydrating products should be liberally applied multiple times per day particularly immediately after hand washing4 there are several subtypes of moisturizers but to efficiently improve the quality of the skin barrier it is largely indicated to combine humectants with occlusive emollients humectants eg topical urea propylene glycol are capable of attracting water to the stratum corneum from the environment and from the deeper layers of the skin occlusive emollients eg petrolatum-based products lanolin mineral and vegetable oils waxes prevent water loss and alleviate irritation a combination of the two is useful for attracting and sealing water at the level of the corneum layer and soothing the skin5 thick greasy creams and ointments eg petroleum jelly provide higher protection against xerosis than lotions to reduce the risk of contact sensitization it is highly recommended to use fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products6 when soap and water are not available the cdc advises that the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60 alcohol is an effective alternative in destroying the virus since these can be irritating it is important to hydrate the skin immediately after applying a moisturizing cream afterward does not interfere in any way with the properties and efficiency of this type of sanitizers7 for individuals working with protective gloves it is highly recommended to wash hands and apply moisturizer whenever gloves are taken off also to lower the humidity they should be changed systematically and applied only on dry hands8 for people with highly sensitive skin which easily develop disturbing forms of dermatitis short courses of topical corticosteroids may be used to reduce the signs and symptoms of inflammationcompliance with hand hygiene recommendations is essential in preventing the spread of covid-19 and under no circumstances should be diminished by the eczematous changes that may occur in the hands in this context the potential development of hand dermatitis is preventable and manageable by using the appropriate skin care products regular skin hydration is a key component in preventing hand dermatitis as a consequence of frequent washingthe primary role of an infection control program is to reduce the incidence of hospital-acquired infections hais by patients staff and visitors to a small animal hospital infection control programs in veterinary hospitals have largely evolved from evidence and protocols from the human health care setting together with our understanding of transmission pathways for veterinary pathogens in recent years several factors have led to an increased rate of adoption of infection control programs by veterinary hospitals such as an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections among small animal patients the appearance of more studies that support the common occurrence of transmission of hospital-associated and zoonotic pathogens in the veterinary setting the requirement for an infection control program in veterinary teaching hospitals for accreditation purposes and increased scrutiny of hospital-associated and zoonotic infections to protect hospitals against litigationevery small animal hospital should have an infection control program at a minimum this should consist of an infectious disease control officer a written infection control protocol regular training of staff and documents that record all training and surveillance efforts in large hospitals formation of an infectious disease control committee may be required in this situation the infectious disease control committee could consist of an internist or criticalist with an interest or training in infectious diseases a veterinary clinical microbiologist a nursing supervisor a safety officer the hospital administrator and the hospital director there should be adequate personnel and communication so that proper coverage is maintained when one individual is absent or unavailable all personnel who work in a veterinary hospital as well as visitors should be familiar with the infectious disease control personnel as well as procedures and policies listed in the infection control protocol documentation of training should be maintained for all hospital personnelthe objective of a hospital infection control protocol is to provide a standard procedure for the control of infectious diseases in the hospital in order to minimize animal-to-animal animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission of pathogens adherence to the infection control protocol can also reduce transmission of infectious agents between personnel through increased hand washing and reduction of fomite contamination the infection control protocol is a legal document and should be regularly updated by a designated hospital infection control officer or committee each hospital should develop a protocol that is tailored to address specific practice requirements and the hospital design purpose and equipment used additional special precautions may need to be described for hospitals that see avian and exotic pet animal species and in geographic locations where serious zoonotic diseases such as rabies and plague are endemic see chapters 13 and 55chapter 13chapter 55the infection control protocol details practices that optimize hygiene such as hand washing the use of protective clothing cleaning and disinfection and appropriate disposal of infectious agents specific infectious disease control procedures to be followed in different areas of the hospital radiology surgery the intensive care unit isolation wards can be included as well as policies on antimicrobial use the protocol can also be used to educate staff about routes of transmission the potential for zoonotic transmission specific transmission precautions for infectious diseases that are seen within the practice and immunization requirements such as those for rabies see chapter 13frequent and proper hand and wrist washing to remove transient flora on the hands has been proven as the most important component for prevention of the spread of infectious diseases in human hospitals1 signs that outline proper hand-washing technique including the use of paper towels to turn off the faucet posted adjacent to basins around the hospital can improve compliance among staff online videos that demonstrate proper hand-washing technique are available for educational purposes2 guidelines for hand washing are shown in box 11-1
 antibacterial soap should be used and all surfaces of the hands should be rubbed together which should include the backs of the hands between the fingers and under the fingernails for a total hand-washing time of at least 20 seconds in order to prevent chapped skin which can harbor bacteria water used for hand washing should not be too hot and hand lotion should be applied regularly behaviors such as keeping fingernails short avoidance of artificial andor polished fingernails or hand jewelry or wearing jewelry on a chain around the neck instead of on the hand can be encouraged meticulous hand hygiene is particularly important for personnel who work frequently with immunocompromised animals such as emergency and critical care personnel the use of touch-free taps and paper towel dispensers can also reduce transmission of bacteria during hand washingbox 11-1guidelines for hand washing and the wearing of disposable glovessituations that require hand washing

alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a more convenient form of sanitization these can be provided in multiple locations around a hospital or travel-sized bottles can be carried in a coat pocket at least one to two full pumps or a 3-cm diameter pool of the product should be dispensed onto one palm all surfaces of the hands and wrists should be rubbed with the product until it has dried use of soap and water rather than hand sanitizer is recommended when there is gross contamination with organic matter or when exposure to alcohol-resistant pathogens such as clostridium spp spores or parvovirus might have occurred however the availability of hand sanitizers improves compliance in busy hospital situations is associated with lower rates of dermatitis than medicated soaps and is recommended for routine hand sanitation in human health care settings by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the world health organization who3 4
the use of gloves prevents contamination of the hands with microorganisms prevents exposure to bloodborne pathogens and reduces the risk of transmission of microorganisms from personnel to animals however gloves are not a substitute for proper hand hygiene guidelines for wearing disposable gloves are shown in box 11-1 gloves should be promptly removed after use before other surfaces are touched and hands should then be washed if a glove is torn or punctured it should be removed and replaced as soon as possiblestaff should be encouraged to wear dedicated hospital attire that is not worn elsewhere so that hospital pathogens are not transported to and from locations outside the hospital at the minimum protective clothing such as clean laboratory coats or hospital scrubs and closed-toe shoes must be worn in nonsurgical areas sleeves must be short enough or rolled up to expose the wrists and laboratory coats changed whenever gross soiling occurs in the absence of gross soiling coats should be changed daily if neckties are worn they must be secured in place by an outer layer of clothing or a tie pin so that they cannot be contaminated as a result of contact with patients or environmental surfaces and act as fomites as has been shown to occur in human hospital environments5 long hair must be tied back so that it does not drape on animals and hospital surfaces face shields and a clean gown should be worn during procedures that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood and body fluids gowns must be made of impervious material and tied on securely and correctly soiled gowns must be removed as soon as they are no longer required and face shields cleaneddedicated operating room attire should be worn in surgical areas and should be changed after gross soilage and when leaving the operating room for the day caps and masks should be worn and hands thoroughly washed on entry to the operating room there is no evidence that dedicated footwear or foot protection should be worn for prevention of surgical site infections in human patients and major human guidelines do not advocate that footwear be addressed6 protective wear should be removed whenever staff members leave the operating room traffic in and out of the operating room should be limited to the minimum required for patient careall animals seen at a veterinary hospital should undergo a history and physical examination by a veterinarian to determine the likelihood and nature of any transmissible infections that might be present ideally client beds blankets collars and leashes should not be brought into the hospital where they could become contaminated animals should always be placed in cages that have been cleaned and disinfected appropriately disposable thermometer sleeves should always be used on thermometers equipment should not be shared between animals unless it has been cleaned and disinfected diets that contain raw meat and bones should not be fed or stored in the hospital because they commonly contain and can potentially transmit foodborne gastrointestinal pathogens7 the handling of sick animals should be minimized unless required for patient carebecause some infections can be transmitted through bites and scratches staff should be educated on bite and scratch avoidance such as the use of restraint devices protective gloves and warning signage on cages and medical records should bites or scratches occur they should be vigorously flushed and immediately washed with water and chlorhexidine or a dilute iodophor solution and the bite reported to appropriate officials as necessary deep wounds could be irrigated with pressure using a syringe without an attached needle if a bite occurs medical attention should be sought as soon as possible all bites or scratches must be documented and consideration be given as to why the injury occurred so that procedures or training to prevent future injuries can be implemented if necessaryconsumption of food and drink should be limited to parts of a hospital where patient care and the handling of biologic specimens and medications do not occur food and beverages should not be left out open on benches for long periods microwaves used for animal care purposes should not be used to heat food intended for peopletransmission-based precautions are instituted for selected patients that are confirmed to be or suspected to be infected or colonized with important transmissible pathogens transmission-based precautions are used in combination with standard precautions in the human hospital setting three types of transmission-based precautions have been developedairborne droplet and contact precautions table 11-1
8
airborne precautions are used to prevent the transmission of diseases by droplet nuclei particles 5 m transmission by droplet nuclei occurs with diseases such as measles varicella and pulmonary tuberculosis the precautions for human patients involve isolation in a single-bed negative-pressure room and the wearing of high-density respirator n95 masks these resemble surgical masks but filter 1-m particles with an efficiency of at least 95 and must be properly fitted airborne contact precautions are rarely necessary in hospitals that treat only dogs and cats but could be considered when animals suspected to have pneumonic plague tularemia or mycobacterium tuberculosis infection droplet precautions are used to prevent transmission by large-particle aerosols and do not require a negative-pressure room droplet precautions apply to dogs and cats with transmissible respiratory disease contact precautions are indicated for animals with infections that can be transmitted by direct contact with the patient or through fomite contactif it is known in advance that an animal with a suspected or known transmissible disease is to be seen at the hospital arrangements should be made to have the pet owner take the animal from the parking area directly to an examination room so that the animal does not contaminate the waiting area after the animal has been examined appropriate signage should be placed on the door of the examination room to prevent use until it has been properly cleaned and disinfectedif hospitalization is required animals with known or suspected transmissible disease must be admitted either to an isolation ward or to regular hospital cages with handling precautions based on the pathogen suspected immediately after hospitalization the name of the suspected or known pathogen should be posted on the cage or run together with a handling precautions notice animals that require contact precautions should be placed in cages away from other animals in the ward and should not be moved from one cage to another unless there is a medical need animals with transmissible respiratory disease should be placed in isolation and separated both horizontally and vertically from other patients by at least 4 feet gloves and a gown should be put on before the patient is handled and then removed and disposed of immediately afterward hands should be washed after the gloves are removed additional items of personal protective equipment masks gowns gloves booties may be required in some circumstances soiled linen and equipment should be handled transported and processed in a manner that prevents skin and mucous membrane exposures and contamination of clothing and that avoids transfer of microorganisms to other patients and environments all equipment that contacts the patient scales examination tables stethoscope heads floor should be cleaned and disinfected immediately after use medications and fluids from these patients should not be returned to the hospital pharmacy when possible personnel who handle these animals should not work with other immunosuppressed animals in the hospital or they should work with the infectious disease cases last if animals with contact precautions must be moved within the hospital personnel should ensure that precautions are maintained throughout and that equipment and environmental surfaces that come into contact with the patient are properly disinfected andor disposed of the cleaning and bandaging of wounds infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria should be conducted in low-traffic areas that can be properly cleaned and disinfectedthe owners of dogs and cats that have transmissible diseases should be provided with general information regarding the risk of disease transmission to in-contact animals and people that includes the mode of transmission duration of organism shedding and if there are special implications for young children or other immunosuppressed individuals if dogs and cats are diagnosed with a zoonotic disease the owners should be notified without delay the owners should be told to see their physicians if they become unwell or in some circumstances immediately and to advise a physician of the potential exposurein contrast to human hospitals where patients can be more readily isolated in single-bed rooms or cubicles isolation of veterinary patients can be more difficult because of the close proximity of one animal to another floor contamination with secretions and excretions can also occur more readily isolation rooms are available in many veterinary hospitals but they may be poorly visible andor accessible and may not provide access to an oxygen source or be amenable to intensive monitoring and care for some animals especially puppies and kittens suspected to have a transmissible disease housing in a general ward or icu area with as much physical and procedural separation as possible and with strict infection control practices may be acceptable if perhaps not optimal once a diagnosis is confirmed the animal should be moved immediately to isolation whenever possible patients chosen for strict isolation vary based on the specific situation and facilities available but suggestions are provided in box 11-2

only the individuals directly involved in the care of the patient should enter isolation pet owners should not be allowed into the isolation ward no equipment used outside isolation pens thermometers stethoscopes cell phones should be brought into isolation laboratory coats should be removed and personnel must put on protective wear such as a disposable gown gloves and booties when entering the isolation ward face protection may also be required depending on the situation a notice that outlines the required precautions should be posted on the door of isolation protective clothing should be removed before leaving isolation and hands should be washed once a patient has been discharged the room should be properly disinfectedsharps handling practices receive considerable attention in human medicine because of the risk of transmission of various bloodborne pathogens although the risks are less in veterinary medicine significant injury or illness can follow sharps injuries such as transmission of infectious agents from the patient allergic or inflammatory reactions from exposure to medication and inoculation of opportunistic pathogens from the injured persons own skin microflora care should be taken to prevent injuries when needles scalpels and other sharp instruments are used cleaned or disposed of used needles should never be recapped and they should not be removed from the barrel of a disposable syringe personnel should be instructed not to walk with uncapped needles and not to hold syringe or needle caps in the mouth used needles should not be carried in a pocket animals suspected of having an infectious disease that could be transmitted to humans through a needle-stick injury should be sedated before skin masses or peripheral lymph nodes are aspirated or venipuncture is performed contaminated sharps slides scalpel blades broken glass needles with attached syringes must immediately be placed into an approved puncture-resistant sharps disposal biohazard container personnel who perform necropsy examinations should take care to use sharp knives in the proper manner and to avoid rushed situations if a contaminated sharps injury occurs medical attention should be sought immediately if necessary
sterilization refers to complete elimination of all microbes including bacterial spores and is accomplished in hospital settings using processes such as pressurized steam dry heat ethylene oxide gas or liquid chemicals
disinfection is the process that eliminates many or all microbes from inanimate objects but not bacterial spores factors that influence the efficacy of disinfection include the type of microorganism present their number the amount and type of organic matter present the presence of biofilms and the porosity of the surface to be disinfected some disinfectants kill spores at high concentrations and with prolonged exposure times these are known as chemical sterilants at low concentrations and short contact times chemical sterilants inactivate all microbes except large numbers of bacterial spores and are known as high-level disinfectants low-level disinfectants inactivate most vegetative bacteria some fungi and enveloped viruses but not bacterial spores intermediate-level disinfectants inactivate mycobacteria vegetative bacteria most viruses and most fungi table 11-2 table 11-3

antisepsis is the process that reduces the number of microbes from living tissue and skin disinfectants are rarely used for skin antisepsis because they can injure tissues and skin sanitation is the reduction in the number of microorganisms on a surface to a safe level germicides are agents that inactivate microorganisms and include disinfectants antiseptics and sanitizers

cleaning involves the removal of all visible organic and inorganic material from objects and surfaces through the use of manual or mechanical processes and detergent or enzymatic solutionsaccording to the spaulding method of classification items to be sterilized or disinfected can be grouped into critical semicritical and noncritical items9 critical items enter tissue or the vascular system or devices through which blood flows critical items require sterilization before they can be used semicritical items are items that contact mucous membranes or nonintact skin and include endoscopes and balloon dilation catheters these generally require high-level disinfection noncritical items are items that contact intact skin noncritical items generally require low-level or intermediate-level disinfection and contact times of 1 to 10 minutes9
all personnel should be educated regarding the standard hospital germicides used for disinfection and antisepsis how they should be diluted and applied and the hazards associated with their use gloves and eye protection should be worn when disinfectant solutions are handled or mixed in large hospitals posters on hospital walls can be used to guide selection of appropriate germicides for different situations disinfectant solution should be readily accessible throughout the hospital because mops can spread infection cotton mops should be laundered daily or mops with detachable microfiber heads should be used microfiber heads absorb a large amount of water and are not returned to the mop bucket after use they can be laundered and reused the following daysteam sterilization involves the use of saturated steam under pressure in an autoclave to achieve sterilization this is the most effective form of sterilization is nontoxic and inexpensive and as a result is the most widely used as well the use of steam under pressure allows lower temperatures to be used for shorter periods of time when compared with dry heat sterilization table 11-4
 the most common temperatures used for steam sterilization are 121c 250f and 132c 270f cycle times vary depending on the autoclave used and whether items are wrapped or unwrapped but are generally less than 30 minutes see table 11-4 there are two basic types of autoclaves gravity displacement autoclaves and high-speed prevacuum sterilizers gravity displacement autoclaves admit steam at the top or sides of the autoclave which displaces air through a drain vent at the bottom of the chamber figure 11-1
 high-speed prevacuum sterilizers rapidly pump air out of the sterilizer before steam is admitted this leads to rapid penetration of steam into all surfaces as a result cycle times can be reduced to less than 15 minutes drying times are also reduced with prevacuum sterilizerssterilizers should be located away from potential sources of contamination such as sinks trash disposal or high-traffic areas before steam sterilization is performed instruments should be cleaned thoroughly to remove organic and inorganic material and then dried all jointed items should be opened or unlocked and items should not be crowded in the autoclave so that steam can circulate freely at least 3 inches should be left between the autoclave wall and items to be sterilized the manufacturers instructions for autoclave operation should be followedthe efficacy of autoclaving must be tested for every autoclaved item with additional quality control performed on a periodic basis autoclave indicator tape is routinely used although this only indicates conditions on the outside of the package steam indicator strips should be included in each surgical pack and evaluated by the person opening the pack biological indicators provide a more definitive assessment of autoclave efficacy and should be used periodically eg weekly and the results documented these consist of a standardized population of bacterial spores usually on a filter paper strip or contained within a vial the strip is then sent to the microbiology laboratory for culture or cultured in-house to ensure that the spores have been completely inactivated by the sterilization process any indicator failure should result in immediate inspection of the autoclave sterilization indicators should never be used as a substitute for proper autoclave operation and careful preparation packing and loading of equipment to be sterilizedafter steam sterilization instruments should be allowed to dry before they are removed which typically takes an additional 30 minutes items should then be stored in a location and manner that prevents further contaminationflash sterilization refers to the rapid sterilization of unwrapped instruments and is usually performed as an emergency procedure in an operating room setting when time is insufficient to perform the preferred sterilization of wrapped items in general it is performed for 3 minutes at 270f and 27 to 28 lbin2 each instrument must be carefully protected to ensure it does not become recontaminated during transport back to the operating room usually in a flash pan flash sterilization has occasionally been associated with intraoperative infections and should not be used for routine disinfection purposes
gas sterilization is used for sterilization of heat- and moisture-sensitive instruments but can have significant toxicity gases that can be used for sterilization include formaldehyde ethylene oxide eto hydrogen peroxide vapor and ozone gases the most commonly used gas in veterinary medicine eto has strong alkylating properties and causes protein coagulation enzyme inactivation and damage to nucleic acid when compared with heat sterilization eto sterilization takes longer 24 hours or more including the time required to allow eto to diffuse out of packages at the end of sterilization and is more expensive in addition it only achieves surface sterilization and requires sophisticated equipment and trained staff the gas is extremely flammable irritates the eyes and mucous membranes is mutagenic and carcinogenic and has a misleadingly pleasant smellgamma irradiation uses a cobalt-60 radiation source to destroy microorganisms through generation of high-energy photons health care product manufacturers use gamma irradiation to sterilize disposable medical supplies such as catheters gloves syringes and pharmaceuticalschemical sterilants are used when heat or eto gas sterilization is not available or would otherwise damage instruments such as endoscopes or laparoscopes disinfectants that act as sterilants when they are used at high concentrations and for adequate contact periods include certain solutions that contain glutaraldehyde eg 24 glutaraldehyde solutions 095 glutaraldehyde with 164 phenolphenate 055 ortho-phthalaldehyde opa 75 hydrogen peroxide or greater than or equal to 02 peracetic acid see section on disinfectants following chemical sterilants must be rinsed repeatedly with sterile water and dried once sterilization is complete chemical sterilants must be used with the proper contact times and at the right concentration solutions may lose efficacy become diluted or become contaminated with bacteria over time they should be replaced frequently according to the manufacturers recommendations and they should never be used in procedures that involve sterile body sites unless there is no other sterilizing optionglutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde glutaraldehyde solutions are relatively inexpensive are noncorrosive and can be used to disinfect rubber plastics and endoscopic equipment aqueous solutions require activation by alkalinization to a ph of 75 to 85 for sporicidal activity to occur when alkalinized glutaraldehyde is used at a concentration of 24 for adequate periods of time either chemical sterilization or high-level disinfection occurs depending on the contact time eg cidex contact times of at least 20 minutes at or above 20c are effective for high-level disinfection sterilization requires a 10-hour contact time and higher concentrations of glutaraldehyde eg cidex plus which contains 34 glutaraldehyde or formulations that combine glutaraldehyde with another disinfectantonce activated 24 glutaraldehyde solution retains activity for 14 days provided inadvertent dilution does not occur the solution is active in the presence of 2 organic matter inadvertent dilution can occur when endoscopes that contain fluid within their channels are immersed in the solution test strips are available from the manufacturer to monitor the activity of the solution but should not be used to extend the solutions expiration date they indicate inactivity when the concentration drops below 15 the minimum concentration required for activity
glutaraldehyde irritates mucous membranes of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and so endoscopes must be rinsed properly after disinfection it can also cause allergic contact dermatitis but it is not mutagenic or carcinogenic the wearing of nitrile rubber or butyl rubber gloves is recommended because of its relative expense and toxicity it is not used to disinfect noncritical surfacesopa eg cidex opa is favored over glutaraldehyde for high-level disinfection in the united states because it does not require activation is stable over a wide ph range does not cause irritation of mucous membranes and it has a barely perceptible odor its activity is greater than that of glutaraldehyde and high-level disinfection is achieved with a contact time of 12 minutes at or above 20c10 11 the primary disadvantage of opa is that it stains tissues and mucous membranes gray protective equipment must be worn when handling the solution and it must be rinsed thoroughly from items after treatment irritation can occur with eye contact opa is also more expensive than glutaraldehyde12 solutions can be reused for a maximum of 14 dayshydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a potent oxidizer hydrogen peroxide solutions are widely available are inexpensive and can enhance removal of organic matter when used at concentrations of 75 for contact periods of at least 6 hours hydrogen peroxide is a chemical sterilant eg sporox high-level disinfection can be achieved with contact times of 12 to 30 minutes unfortunately 75 hydrogen peroxide causes discoloration and functional changes within endoscopes and so is not suitable for endoscope reprocessing although nonirritating to mucous membranes serious ocular damage can occur with eye contact
accelerated hydrogen peroxide ahp is a patented hydrogen peroxide solution that contains surfactants an acid and hydrogen peroxide use of a 45 ahp gel with contact times of 10 minutes can inactivate bacterial spores13 even 05 solutions have some sporicidal activity and can inactivate non-enveloped viruses such as canine parvovirus14 15 ahp has gained popularity as a disinfectant among health care institutions because it is odorless does not generate volatile gas is nonirritating and is noncorrosive at dilutions used in health care settingsperacetic acid belongs to the peroxygen family of compounds when used at 50c to 56c in a specific peracetic acid reprocessing system steris system 1 steris 02 solutions achieve sterilization in very short time periods 30 to 45 minutes peracetic acid is active in the presence of organic matter and may actually enhance its removal nevertheless endoscopes must still be thoroughly cleaned before sterilization to avoid fixation of blood onto the instrument after sterilization the processor rinses the instrument thoroughly peracetic acid is stable but can be corrosive and causes discoloration of endoscopes over time it is more expensive than other chemical sterilants peracetic acid concentrates can cause irritation to mucous membranes and are corrosive to the eye and skin but 02 solutions are generally nonirritatinglike peracetic acid potassium peroxymonosulfate is an oxidizing agent and 1 solutions are high-level disinfectants that are capable of inactivation of non-enveloped viruses when contact times of 10 minutes are used16 thus it is suitable for inactivation of canine parvovirus and feline calicivirus potassium peroxymonosulfate retains some activity in the presence of organic matter solutions are prepared from powder and remain active for 7 days the powder is corrosive and can cause serious skin and ocular burns but the solution is nonirritating and less corrosive than bleach the solution stains fabric and may damage surfaces particularly metal over time if rinsing is not performedhousehold bleach which contains 525 to 615 sodium hypochlorite is widely available inexpensive and active in the presence of hard water when used at a 110 dilution for a 10-minute contact time household bleach is sporicidal but is irritating and can be highly corrosive to metal surfaces this 110 dilution is used to control outbreaks of clostridial diarrhea for most hospital situations 130 to 150 dilutions of household bleach provide more than 1000 ppm available chlorine and are effective for intermediate-level disinfection noncritical surfaces can be disinfected with 1500 dilutions of household bleach 100 ppm available chlorine with contact times of at least 1 minute sodium hypochlorite is inactivated by organic matter so cleaning is required before disinfection is performed solutions lose 50 of their activity over a 1-month period unless they are stored in closed brown bottles other disadvantages of bleach solutions are bleaching of colored fabric and the release of toxic chlorine gas when they are combined with other disinfectants such as quaternary ammonium compounds quatsquats are often used as low-level disinfectants for noncritical surfaces in health care facilities although they are generally fungicidal bactericidal and virucidal for enveloped viruses some bacteria resist and even grow within quats and such contamination has resulted in hais17 contact times vary by product so manufacturer recommendations should be followed however 10-minute contact times are often used advantages of quats include their low cost high stability and low toxicity quats are inactivated by hard water organic materials soaps and detergentsphenolics are one of the oldest known disinfectant classes phenol derivatives that are available for hospital disinfection include ortho-phenylphenol and ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol eg qualitrol vetnex effective contact times vary with the product they are active against enveloped viruses and bacteria but they are not sporicidal and have limited activity against fungi and non-enveloped viruses phenol derivatives are active in the presence of organic matter and hard water are stable and are noncorrosive they irritate skin and mucous membranes and have the potential to be highly toxic if ingested by cats because of these limitations and the availability of other effective disinfectants phenolics are rarely used in veterinary hospitalsethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol are bactericidal virucidal for enveloped viruses and variably fungicidal the optimum bactericidal concentration is 60 to 90 in water volumevolume they do not destroy bacterial spores or penetrate proteinaceous material and so are not recommended for high-level disinfection they can be used to disinfect noncritical items such as hospital fomites and have very low toxicity so they are often included in waterless hand sanitizer products together with emollients to prevent drying of the skin they are flammable and dry quickly so it can be difficult to achieve adequate contact times 1 minute as a result alcohol should not be used for routine environmental disinfectioniodine solutions are primarily used as skin antiseptics formulations for disinfection are also available which contain higher concentrations of free iodine than antiseptic preparations an iodophor is a combination of iodine and a solubilizing agent eg polyvinylpyrrolidone in povidone-iodine which serves to provide a sustained-release form of iodine dilutions of iodophors are more active against microbes than concentrated povidone-iodine so iodophores must be diluted correctly iodophors are bactericidal and virucidal their antibacterial activity does not persist for long periods on skin or in tissues so frequent reapplication is required iodophors are relatively nontoxic and nonirritating they are stable in solution but are inactivated by organic material and they can stain plastics and to some extent tissueschlorhexidine is a cationic bisbiguanide that disrupts microbial cell membranes and precipitates cell contents it is used widely for skin antisepsis in veterinary medicine chlorhexidine has persistent activity on the skin is nonirritating is active in the presence of body fluids and has rapid bactericidal activity like iodophors chlorhexidine has limited activity against fungi and mycobacteria a 2 chlorhexidine solution is preferred over 70 alcohol or povidone-iodine for skin preparation of central venous catheter sites in human patients18 and is the skin antiseptic of choice for collection of blood for blood cultures chlorhexidine may have slightly lower activity against gram-negative bacteria and fungi than povidone-iodine and both chlorhexidine and iodophors have a slower antimicrobial activity than 60 to 90 alcohol solutionsstandard operating procedures that describe preparation and application of disinfectants for all surfaces and objects used in a veterinary hospital as well as waste management should be developed and staff and visitors should receive education about the location of protocols and their use wards and procedure and examination rooms should remain uncluttered in order to facilitate effective cleaning because organic matter can inactivate disinfectants all visible debris should be removed before disinfection disinfectants are only active when applied to clean nonporous surfaces porous surfaces such as dirt and wood cannot be effectively disinfected using routine procedures hard porous surfaces should be scrubbed with disinfectant using brushes and then rinsed with water after the contact time has elapsedwhen hospital surfaces are cleaned attention should be paid to corners under cabinets chairs the bases of examination tables door handles elevator buttons shelves sinks faucets and other surfaces that might otherwise be ignored personal items such as cell phones and stethoscope heads should be regularly disinfected with disinfectant wipes cell phones should be disinfected at least daily and stethoscope heads wiped between patients stethoscope tubing should be cleaned regularly with soap and water disinfection of other fomites should be performed on a regular at least daily basis these include digital thermometers computer keyboards and mice land-line telephones calculators microscopes otoscopes and blood pressure cuffscleaning staff should wear gloves when general hospital disinfection is performed this may not be necessary for spot cleaning of areas such as examination room tables or fomites depending on the disinfectant additional protective attire such as a gown boots or face mask may be required if there is a probability of significant splashing during the disinfection process after disinfection is complete protective clothing should be removed and handwashing performed the individuals responsible for cleaning and disinfection at each time point situation and location in the hospital should be clearly identified a plan for the cleaning of outdoor areas that become contaminated with excretions or other biohazardous material should be outlinedwhen disinfection of cages or runs is performed animals should be removed and placed in a clean holding cage or run away from other patients solid waste and soiled laundry or paper should be removed and placed directly in waste or laundry containers taking care to avoid dripping onto the floor if laundry is contaminated with potentially infectious material it must be bagged and labeled with the contents and suspected infectious agent proper contact times should be used after application of disinfectant solution runs and cages should be allowed to dry completely before a new patient is introducedpeople are considered immunocompromised if they 1 have various comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus chronic kidney failure leukopenia immune-mediated disease hivaids congenital immunodeficiencies hepatic cirrhosis cancer or splenectomy 2 are being treated with immunosuppressive drugs or chemotherapeutics 3 are very young 5 and under or very old or 4 are pregnant although the immunosuppressive effects of pregnancy are considerably lower than those of the preceding disordersimmunocompromised staff members who work in small animal hospitals should discuss any necessary work restrictions and precautions in light of their specific condition with their physician or an infectious disease doctor the risks for a diabetic for example may be significantly different from those for a transplant recipient in general immunosuppressed individuals who work in small animal hospitals should avoid handling patients with suspected or known infectious diseases gloves should always be worn when handling animals and animal fluids or excreta and strict attention to general hand hygiene and any bites scratches or sharps injuries is critical children 5 years of age or younger should be kept out of patient care areas strict attention to hygiene and protective apparel is necessary when handling soiled cat litter or animal feces because of the risk for transmission of enteropathogens the reader is referred to other chapters in this book for public health implications of specific infectious diseases that may be encountered in small animal hospitals if possible small animal clinics should establish a relationship with a doctor who is prepared to consult on zoonotic exposures with staff membersa transmissible disease surveillance program allows collection of baseline data that establishes the prevalence of certain infectious diseases so that possible outbreak situations can be readily identified it can also provide background prevalence information on antimicrobial drug susceptibility patterns which can assist in the initial selection of antibacterial drugs for individual animal patients while culture and susceptibility test results are in progress information is generally collected for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections zoonotic diseases highly contagious diseases pathogens that are difficult to inactivate with disinfectants or agents of regulatory concern although surveillance may seem like a difficult time-consuming and expensive measure in reality it can be easy and cost-effective and can provide important informationthere are two main forms of infection control surveillance applicable to veterinary hospitals active and passive active surveillance involves collection of data specifically for infection control purposes this can provide the highest quality and most relevant information but it can be expensive and time consuming examples of this would be collection of swab specimens to screen for infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius mrsp from dogs before surgery as part of mrsp outbreak investigation active surveillance is a core component of infection control in most human hospitals but it is only sporadically used in veterinary medicine and is rarely needed in most veterinary clinics it is typically reserved for large facilities with increased infection control risks and personnel available to direct such testing or as a part of outbreak controlin contrast passive surveillance is a practical easy and cost-effective surveillance approach that can and should be performed in every veterinary clinic it involves the use of data that are already available such as information about surgical site infections collected during routine follow-up or culture results from clinical testing the quality of passive surveillance data can be limited by poor or incomplete record keeping or sporadic use of appropriate diagnostic tests but if properly collected and if potential biases are understood passive surveillance data can provide important insight into aspects such as endemic disease rates common pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility trends to facilitate passive surveillance clinicians should be encouraged to use appropriate diagnostic testing to determine the etiology of nosocomial infections even if the clinical consequences are not severe they also should be encouraged to confirm a diagnosis in animals with suspected transmissible disease this allows clients to protect their other animals and their families and friends who might be in contact with the pet and it benefits the hospitalanother form of surveillance that is easy to perform and potentially very useful is syndromic surveillance this involves surveillance for readily identifiable syndromes ie diarrhea cough instead of specific diagnoses although syndromes do not indicate a specific disease they can indicate an increased risk of infectious disease syndromic surveillance is an initial screening tool that can be used by all personnel including lay personnel to flag potentially high-risk cases and allow for early implementation of enhanced infection control practices all clinic personnel should be made aware of certain syndromes that indicate the need either for isolation or for further investigation such as diarrhea fever of unknown origin acute neurologic disease wound infections and acute respiratory tract disease protocols to deal with these animals on arrival should be developed as an example a dog with an acute onset of cough should be considered potentially infectious and if front office personnel note this syndrome at the time the appointment is made the dog can be handled appropriately on arrival eg admitted directly to isolation or an examination room with personnel wearing enhanced barrier precautions from the onset the role of lay staff ie front office stall is critical as these people are the ones who are most able to identify such cases before they enter the clinic and ensure that they are properly handled to prevent nosocomial or zoonotic transmissionenvironmental cultures are rarely informative and so are not considered a useful routine infection control tool they may be used to detect a specific pathogen if an outbreak of an hai is suspected when there is suspicion that the environment is a source of exposure however it is often difficult to distinguish cause from effect ie environmental contamination that leads to transmission vs environmental contamination that occurs as a result of contamination from a patient in the absence of a risk of transmissionalthough surveillance programs require time effort and expense in the long term they may save morbidity and mortality and reduce costs that relate to control of large outbreak situations or the legal ramifications of haiswhen zoonotic diseases are identified all in-contact individuals and if necessary public health authorities should be notified in the appropriate manner the specific diseases that must be reported to authorities vary among geographic locations examples of diseases that may be of interest to public health authorities are listed in box 11-3

the patients endogenous microflora is an important source of pathogens that cause ssis careful preparation of the patient therefore can help reduce contamination of the surgical site during surgery the goal of preoperative surgical site management is to eliminate potential pathogens while not creating a physical environment that is more conducive to bacterial colonization or infection postoperatively bathing of the patient preoperatively is reasonable if there is significant contamination of the haircoat19 and if the patients coat can be dried by the time of surgery in most situations bathing is not required rather careful hair removal and skin antisepsis are the main measures the goals of surgical scrubbing of patients are to reduce bacterial counts reduce debris and facilitate later antisepsis scrubbing should be done as atraumatically as possible minimizing skin damage during clipping and scrubbing is essential because skin damage from excessive attempts to clip all remaining pieces of hair or from forceful scrubbing of the surgical site can create an environment that is more amenable to bacterial growth this predisposes to infection rather than reducing the risk clipping should be performed after anesthesia to reduce the risk of trauma associated with a struggling patient and to minimize the time between clipping and surgery clipping should be done outside the operating environment there is currently no information that relates to optimal methods of cleaning and disinfecting clippers repeated use of clipper blades without sterilization not surprisingly results in higher levels of bacterial contamination of blades20 however the clinical relevance of this is unclear because the surgical site is cleaned and disinfected after clipping regular cleaning and disinfection of clippers are probably useful and they should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after use on an animal with a potentially transmissible infection eg an animal with diarrhea on an area where the skin is broken or on any area where the skin or hair is significantly contaminated with feces urine blood or other body fluidsafter hair removal various approaches for skin antisepsis can be used there is little outcome-based evidence of the relative efficacy of different approaches in the human literature typically a three-step process is used with initial scrubbing of the site with biocidal ie chlorhexidine povidone-iodine soap followed by application of alcohol for biocidal effects and to remove oils and a final application of a biocidal solution with residual activity eg chlorhexidinethe surgeons body and clothing are potential sources of ssi pathogens and standard practices have been developed to reduce the risk of contamination of the surgical site one aspect is the use of proper protective clothing every person in the operating environment should wear clean surgical scrubs these scrubs should be dedicated for use only in the operating room or should be covered with a clean laboratory coat whenever the individual is outside of the operating roomsurgical hand antisepsis is critical because of the close contact of the hands with the surgical site and the relatively high incidence of grossly evident breaks or micro-breaks in gloves surgical hand antisepsis is designed to greatly reduce bacterial burdens on the hands particularly the abundant transient microflora that contains most of the relevant pathogens that cause ssis surgical antisepsis must find a balance between effective elimination of pathogens minimization of trauma to the skin because skin irritation facilitates bacterial growth and time constraints the traditional approach to surgical hand antisepsis has involved structured scrubbing of the hands for a predetermined time recommended scrub times vary between products but are typically 2 to 4 minutesapplication of alcohol-chlorhexidine combinations has been evaluated as a replacement for surgical scrubbing and has been shown to be more effective than standard surgical scrub methods21 22 specific manufacturer instructions should be followed and hands and arms must be dry before application of gloves the use of alcohol-based surgical hand antisepsis products is encouraged as a replacement for traditional scrubbingregardless of the method used a thorough handwash with careful cleaning under the fingernails must be performed at the beginning of each day23 long 14-inch and artificial nails are prohibited in many human health care facilities and some veterinary hospitals because they harbor pathogenic bacteria24 and are associated with surgical glove tearsa cap and mask must be worn during hand antisepsis and sterile gown and gloves must then be donned using appropriate techniquethe use of antimicrobial drugs contributes to the selection for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria inclusion of a policy on antimicrobial drug use in the infection control protocol may help to reduce the prevalence of multidrug-resistant hais on their own fever and leukocytosis are not justification for antimicrobial drug treatment whenever possible when infection is suspected attempts to obtain material for culture and susceptibility testing should be made before antimicrobial drug treatment is initiated when secondary bacterial infection is likely attempts to identify and treat the underlying cause should be made in an effort to minimize the emergence of resistance in bacterial flora of animals in the hospital and decrease the risk of resistant hais the use of several antimicrobials eg certain parenteral third-generation cephalosporins vancomycin linezolid and carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem may be restricted unless criteria must be met box 11-4
box 11-4example of criteria specified within a hospital for use of restricted antimicrobial drugs
infection must be documented based on clinical abnormalities and culturesubclinical infections should not be treated with these antibiotics these antibiotics should be reserved for infections that are life threateningresistance to all other reasonable options and susceptibility to the chosen antimicrobial must be documentedthe infection must be potentially treatablethe clinician should contact the infectious disease control officer or a clinical microbiology faculty member by email or telephone to discuss antimicrobial susceptibility test results determine whether there are any other viable options and confirm that a restricted antimicrobial is necessary
attention to hand hygiene and proper disinfection of fomites and the environment as outlined for hospitals can also be used to reduce transmission of infectious pathogens in shelters and in breeding and boarding facilities box 11-5
 disinfectants with activity against parvoviruses and feline calicivirus should be used routinely such as a 130 dilution of household bleach potassium peroxymonosulfate or accelerated hydrogen peroxide solutions removal of organic matter the use of surfaces that can be adequately disinfected and proper contact times are essentialbox 11-5factors that should be considered for the reduction of infectious disease transmission in animal housing facilities

factors that increase stress should also be minimized such as high population densities the grouping of animals and poor nutrition cats and dogs should be separated from one another in cats the use of methods that reduce stress such as provision of a low-stress cage environment can dramatically reduce the frequency of upper respiratory tract disease compartmentalized housing allows animals to urinate and defecate away from areas where they rest and eat and provision of a hiding area so that animals can retreat from visual stimulation can also reduce stress a total of 10 to 20 air changes per hour is often recommended for animal housing but higher levels of ventilation may be needed with increased population density and concentration of airborne contaminants cages should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily the use of compartmentalized housing areas also facilitates cleaning and disinfection without requiring an animal to be removed from the housing area isolation areas for sick animals should be present and these should have separate airflow from areas that house healthy animals mass treatment of dogs and cats with upper respiratory tract disease with antimicrobials without attention to the underlying causes only results in selection for antimicrobial drug resistant organisms and is not recommended detailed information on the control of infectious diseases in shelter environments is beyond the scope of this book but can be found elsewhere25 the american association of shelter veterinarians and the humane society of the united states have published guidelines for operation of animal shelters26 27

sterilization is the complete elimination or destruction of all forms of microbial life and is accomplished in health care facilities by either physical or chemical processes steam under pressure dry heat ethylene oxide eto gas hydrogen peroxide gas plasma vaporized hydrogen peroxide and liquid chemicals are the principal sterilizing agents used in health care facilities sterilization is intended to convey an absolute meaning not a relative one unfortunately some health care professionals as well as the technical and commercial literature refer to disinfection as sterilization and items as partially sterile when chemicals are used for the purposes of destroying all forms of microbiologic life including fungal and bacterial spores they may be called chemical sterilants these same germicides used for shorter exposure periods may also be part of the disinfection process ie high-level disinfection
disinfection describes a process that eliminates many or all pathogenic microorganisms on inanimate objects with the exception of bacterial spores disinfection is usually accomplished by the use of liquid chemicals or wet pasteurization in health care settings the efficacy of disinfection is affected by a number of factors each of which may nullify or limit the efficacy of the process some of the factors that affect both disinfection and sterilization efficacy are the prior cleaning of the object the organic and inorganic load present the type and level of microbial contamination the concentration of and exposure time to the germicide the nature of the object eg crevices hinges and lumens the presence of biofilms the temperature and ph of the disinfection process and in some cases the relative humidity of the sterilization process eg with etoby definition then disinfection differs from sterilization by its lack of sporicidal property but this is an oversimplification a few disinfectants will kill spores with prolonged exposure times eg 3 to 12 hours and are called chemical sterilants at similar concentrations but with shorter exposure periods eg 12 minutes for 055 ortho-phthalaldehyde these same disinfectants will kill all microorganisms with the exception of large numbers of bacterial spores and are called high-level disinfectants low-level disinfectants may kill most vegetative bacteria some fungi and some viruses in a practical period of time 10 minutes whereas intermediate-level disinfectants may be cidal for mycobacteria vegetative bacteria most viruses and most fungi but do not necessarily kill bacterial spores the germicides differ markedly among themselves primarily in their antimicrobial spectrum and rapidity of action
cleaning on the other hand is the removal of visible soil eg organic and inorganic material from objects and surfaces and it normally is accomplished by manual or mechanical means using water with detergents or enzymatic products thorough cleaning is essential before high-level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments interfere with the effectiveness of these processes also if the soiled materials become dried or baked onto the instruments the removal process becomes more difficult and the disinfection or sterilization process less effective or ineffective surgical instruments should be presoaked or rinsed to prevent drying of blood and to soften or remove blood from the instruments decontamination is a procedure that removes pathogenic microorganisms from objects so they are safe to handle use or discardterms with a suffix -cide or -cidal for killing action also are commonly used for example a germicide is an agent that can kill microorganisms particularly pathogenic organisms germs the term germicide includes both antiseptics and disinfectants antiseptics are germicides applied to living tissue and skin whereas disinfectants are antimicrobial agents applied only to inanimate objects preservatives are agents that inhibit the growth of microorganisms capable of causing biologic deterioration of substancesmaterials in general antiseptics are only used on the skin and not for surface disinfection and disinfectants are rarely used for skin antisepsis because they may cause injury to skin and other tissues other words with the suffix -cide eg virucide fungicide bactericide sporicide and tuberculocide can kill the type of microorganism identified by the prefix for example a bactericide is an agent that kills bacteria14 15 16 17 18 19

critical items are so called because of the high risk for infection if such an item is contaminated with any microorganism including bacterial spores thus it is critical that objects that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system be sterile because any microbial contamination could result in disease transmission this category includes surgical instruments cardiac and urinary catheters implants arthroscopes laparoscopes and ultrasound probes used in sterile body cavities most of the items in this category should be purchased in sterile form or be sterilized by steam sterilization if possible if heat sensitive the object may be treated with eto hydrogen peroxide gas plasma hydrogen peroxide vapor or liquid chemical sterilants if other methods are unsuitable tables 301-1
and 301-2
list several germicides categorized as chemical sterilants and high-level disinfectants these include 24 or greater glutaraldehyde-based formulations hypochlorous acidhypochlorite 650 to 675 ppm free chlorine 112 glutaraldehyde with 193 phenolphenate 34 glutaraldehyde with 26 isopropanol23 75 stabilized hydrogen peroxide 20 hydrogen peroxide 735 hydrogen peroxide with 023 peracetic acid 83 hydrogen peroxide with 70 peracetic acid 02 peracetic acid 055 or greater ortho-phthalaldehyde and 008 peracetic acid with 10 hydrogen peroxide24 liquid chemical sterilants can be relied on to produce sterility only if cleaning to eliminate organic and inorganic material precedes treatment and if proper use as to concentration contact time temperature and ph is met25

semicritical items are those that come in contact with mucous membranes or nonintact skin respiratory therapy and anesthesia equipment some endoscopes laryngoscope blades and handles26 esophageal manometry probes endocavitary probes26 nasopharyngoscopes prostate biopsy probes27 infrared coagulation device28 anorectal manometry catheters cystoscopes29 and diaphragm fitting rings are included in this category26 these medical devices should be free of all microorganisms although small numbers of bacterial spores may be present intact mucous membranes such as those of the lungs or the gastrointestinal tract generally are resistant to infection by common bacterial spores but susceptible to other organisms such as bacteria mycobacteria and viruses semicritical items minimally require high-level disinfection using chemical disinfectants glutaraldehyde hydrogen peroxide ortho-phthalaldehyde peracetic acid and peracetic acid with hydrogen peroxide are cleared by the us food and drug administration fda and are dependable high-level disinfectants provided the factors influencing germicidal procedures are met see tables 301-1 and 301-2 when a disinfectant is selected for use with certain patient care items the chemical compatibility after extended use with the items to be disinfected also must be consideredthe complete elimination of all microorganisms in or on an instrument with the exception of small numbers of bacterial spores is the traditional definition of high-level disinfection the fdas definition of high-level disinfection is a sterilant used for a shorter contact time to achieve at least a 6-log10 kill of an appropriate mycobacterium species cleaning followed by high-level disinfection should eliminate sufficient pathogens to prevent transmission of infection30 31
semicritical items should be rinsed with sterile water after high-level disinfection to prevent their contamination with organisms that may be present in tap water such as nontuberculous mycobacteria8 32
legionella
33 34 or gram-negative bacilli such as pseudomonas
18 20 35 36 37 in circumstances where rinsing with sterile water rinse is not feasible a tap water or filtered water 02-m filter rinse should be followed by an alcohol rinse and forced air drying9 37 38 39 forced-air drying markedly reduces bacterial contamination of stored endoscopes most likely by removing the wet environment favorable for bacterial growth38 after rinsing items should be dried and stored eg packaged in a manner that protects them from recontaminationsome items that may come in contact with nonintact skin for a brief period of time ie hydrotherapy tanks bed side rails are usually considered noncritical surfaces and are disinfected with low- or intermediate-level disinfectants ie phenolic iodophor alcohol chlorine40 because hydrotherapy tanks have been associated with spread of infection some facilities have chosen to disinfect them with recommended levels of chlorine40

noncritical items are those that come in contact with intact skin but not mucous membranes intact skin acts as an effective barrier to most microorganisms therefore the sterility of items that come in contact with intact skin is not critical examples of noncritical items are bedpans blood pressure cuffs crutches bed rails bedside tables patient furniture and floors the five most commonly touched noncritical items in the patient environment have been quantitatively shown to be bed rails bed surface supply cart overbed table and intravenous-line pump41 in contrast to critical and some semicritical items most noncritical reusable items may be decontaminated where they are used and do not need to be transported to a central processing area there is virtually no documented risk of transmitting infectious agents to patients via noncritical items36 when they are used as noncritical items and do not contact nonintact skin or mucous membranes however these items eg bedside tables bed rails could potentially contribute to secondary transmission by contaminating hands of health care workers or by contact with medical equipment that will subsequently come in contact with patients14 42 43 44 45
table 301-1 lists several low-level disinfectants that may be used for noncritical items the exposure time listed in table 301-1 is equal to or greater than 1 minute many us environmental protection agency epa-registered disinfectants have a 10-minute label claim however multiple investigators have demonstrated the effectiveness of these disinfectants against vegetative bacteria eg listeria escherichia coli salmonella vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa yeasts eg candida mycobacteria eg mycobacterium tuberculosis and viruses eg poliovirus at exposure times of 30 to 60 seconds42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 thus it is acceptable to disinfect noncritical medical equipment eg blood pressure cuff and noncritical surfaces eg bedside table with an epa-registered disinfectant or disinfectantdetergent at the proper use-dilution and a contact time of at least 1 minute9 59 because the typical drying time for a germicide on a surface is 1 to 3 minutes unless the product contains alcohol eg a 60 to 70 alcohol will dry in about 30 seconds n omidbakhsh written communication one application of the germicide on all hand contact surfaces to be disinfected is recommendedmops microfiber and cotton string reusable cleaning cloths and disposable wipes are regularly used to achieve low-level disinfection60 61 microfiber mops have demonstrated superior microbial removal compared with cotton string mops when used with detergent cleaner 95 vs 68 respectively use of a disinfectant did significantly improve microbial removal when a cotton string mop was used61 mops especially cotton-string mops are commonly not kept adequately cleaned and disinfected and if the water-disinfectant mixture is not changed regularly eg after every 3 to 4 rooms no longer than 60-minute intervals the mopping procedure may actually spread heavy microbial contamination throughout the health care facility62 in one study standard laundering provided acceptable decontamination of heavily contaminated mop heads but chemical disinfection with a phenolic was less effective62 the frequent laundering of cotton-string mops eg daily is therefore recommendedhospital cleanliness continues to attract patient attention and in the united states it is still primarily assessed via visual appearance which is not a reliable indicator of surface cleanliness63 three other methods have been offered for monitoring patient room hygiene and they include adenosine triphosphate atp bioluminescence64 65 fluorescent markers66 67 and microbiologic sampling65 studies have demonstrated suboptimal cleaning by aerobic colony counts as well as the use of the atp bioluminescence and fluorescent markers64 66 atp bioluminescence and fluorescent markers are preferred to aerobic plate counts because they provide an immediate assessment of cleaning effectivenessin the health care setting alcohol refers to two water-soluble chemical compounds the germicidal characteristics of which are generally underrated ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol70 these alcohols are rapidly bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic against vegetative forms of bacteria they also are tuberculocidal fungicidal and virucidal but do not destroy bacterial spores their cidal activity drops sharply when diluted below 50 concentration and the optimal bactericidal concentration is in the range of 60 to 90 solutions in water volumevolume71 72
alcohols are not recommended for sterilizing medical and surgical materials principally because of their lack of sporicidal action and their inability to penetrate protein-rich materials fatal postoperative wound infections with clostridium have occurred when alcohols were used to sterilize surgical instruments contaminated with bacterial spores73 alcohols have been used effectively to disinfect oral and rectal thermometers computers60 hospital pagers scissors cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr manikins applanation tonometers74 external surfaces of equipment eg ventilators and stethoscopes75 alcohol towelettes have been used for years to disinfect small surfaces such as rubber stoppers of multiple-dose medication vials or vaccine bottlesalcohols are flammable and consequently must be stored in a cool well-ventilated area they also evaporate rapidly and this makes extended exposure time difficult to achieve unless the items are immersedhypochlorites are the most widely used of the chlorine disinfectants and are available in liquid eg sodium hypochlorite or solid eg calcium hypochlorite forms the most prevalent chlorine products in the united states are aqueous solutions of 525 to 615 sodium hypochlorite which usually are called household bleach they have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity ie bactericidal virucidal fungicidal mycobactericidal sporicidal do not leave toxic residues are unaffected by water hardness are inexpensive and fast acting74 76 remove dried or fixed organisms and biofilms from surfaces77 and have a low incidence of serious toxicity78 79 sodium hypochlorite at the concentration used in domestic bleach 525 to 615 may produce ocular irritation or oropharyngeal esophageal and gastric burns69 80 81 other disadvantages of hypochlorites include corrosiveness to metals in high concentrations 500 ppm inactivation by organic matter discoloring or bleaching of fabrics release of toxic chlorine gas when mixed with ammonia or acid eg household cleaning agents82 and relative stability83
reports have examined the microbicidal activity of a new disinfectant superoxidized water the concept of electrolyzing saline to create a disinfectant or antiseptic is appealing because the basic materials of saline and electricity are inexpensive and the end product ie water is not damaging to the environment the main products of this water are hypochlorous acid eg at a concentration of about 144 mgl and chlorine this is also known as electrolyzed water and as with any germicide the antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water is strongly affected by the concentration of the active ingredient available free chlorine84 the free available chlorine concentrations of different superoxidized solutions reported in the literature range from 7 to 180 ppm84 data have shown that freshly generated superoxidized water is rapidly effective 2 minutes in achieving a 5-log10 reduction of pathogenic microorganisms ie m tuberculosis mycobacterium chelonae poliovirus human immunodeficiency virus hiv mrsa e coli candida albicans enterococcus faecalis pseudomonas aeruginosa in the absence of organic loading however the biocidal activity of this disinfectant was substantially reduced in the presence of organic material 5 horse serum85 86
hypochlorites are widely used in health care facilities in a variety of settings76 inorganic chlorine solution is used to disinfect tonometer heads87 and for disinfection of noncritical surfaces and equipment a 1  10 to 1  100 dilution of 525 to 615 sodium hypochlorite ie household bleach88 89 90 91 or an epa-registered tuberculocidal disinfectant18 has been recommended for decontaminating blood spills for small spills of blood ie drops of blood on noncritical surfaces the area can be disinfected with a 1  100 dilution of 525 to 615 sodium hypochlorite or an epa-registered tuberculocidal disinfectant because hypochlorites and other germicides are substantially inactivated in the presence of blood54 92 large spills of blood require that the surface be cleaned before an epa-registered disinfectant or a 1  10 final concentration solution of household bleach is applied if there is a possibility of a sharps injury there should be an initial decontamination69 93 followed by cleaning and terminal disinfection 1  10 final concentration54 extreme care should always be used to prevent percutaneous injury at least 500 ppm available chlorine for 10 minutes is recommended for decontamination of cpr training manikins other uses in health care include as an irrigating agent in endodontic treatment and to disinfect laundry dental appliances hydrotherapy tanks40 regulated medical waste before disposal76 applanation tonometers74 and the water distribution system in hemodialysis centers and hemodialysis machines9 75 disinfection with a 1  10 dilution of concentrated sodium hypochlorite ie bleach has been shown to be effective in reducing environmental contamination in patient rooms and in reducing c difficile infection rates in hospital units where there is a high endemic c difficile infection rates or in an outbreak setting9 94 95 96 97 98 at our institution we use a sporicidal solution 5000 ppm chlorine in all c difficileinfected patient rooms for routine daily and terminal cleaning this is done by one application of the sporicide covering all hand contact surfaces to allow sufficient wetness for a greater than 1-minute contact timechlorine has long been favored as the preferred disinfectant in water treatment hyperchlorination of a legionella-contaminated hospital water system40 resulted in a dramatic decrease 30 to 15 in the isolation of legionella pneumophila from water outlets and a cessation of health careassociated legionnaires disease in the affected unit99 100 chloramine t and hypochlorites have been used in disinfecting hydrotherapy equipment75
hypochlorite solutions in tap water at a ph greater than 8 stored at room temperature 23 c in closed opaque plastic containers may lose up to 40 to 50 of their free available chlorine level over a period of 1 month thus if a user wished to have a solution containing 500 ppm of available chlorine at day 30 a solution containing 1000 ppm of chlorine should be prepared at time 0 there is no decomposition of sodium hypochlorite solution after 30 days when stored in a closed brown bottle83
glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant101 aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde are acidic and generally in this state are not sporicidal only when the solution is activated made alkaline by use of alkalinizing agents to ph 75 to 85 does the solution become sporicidal once activated these solutions have a shelf life of minimally 14 days because of the polymerization of the glutaraldehyde molecules at alkaline ph levels this polymerization blocks the active sites aldehyde groups of the glutaraldehyde molecules that are responsible for its biocidal activitynovel glutaraldehyde formulations eg glutaraldehyde-phenol-sodium phenate potentiated acid glutaraldehyde stabilized alkaline glutaraldehyde produced in the past 40 years have overcome the problem of rapid loss of activity eg now use life of 28 to 30 days while generally maintaining excellent microbicidal activity74 75 102 103 however it should be recognized that antimicrobial activity is dependent not only on age but also on use conditions such as dilution and organic stress the use of glutaraldehyde-based solutions in health care facilities is common because of their advantages which include excellent biocidal properties activity in the presence of organic matter 20 bovine serum and noncorrosive action to endoscopic equipment thermometers rubber or plastic equipment the advantages disadvantages and characteristics of glutaraldehyde are listed in table 301-2the in vitro inactivation of microorganisms by glutaraldehydes has been extensively investigated and reviewed104 several investigators showed that 2 or greater aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde buffered to ph 75 to 85 with sodium bicarbonate were effective in killing vegetative bacteria in less than 2 minutes m tuberculosis fungi and viruses in less than 10 minutes and spores of bacillus and clostridium species in 3 hours104 spores of c difficile are more rapidly killed by 2 glutaraldehyde than are spores of other species of clostridium and bacillus
105 106 and this includes the hypervirulent binary toxin strains of c difficile spores wa rutala unpublished data december 2012 there have been reports of microorganisms with relative resistance to glutaraldehyde including some mycobacteria m chelonae mycobacterium avium-intracellulare mycobacterium xenopi107 108 109

m chelonae persisted in a 02 glutaraldehyde solution used to store porcine prosthetic heart valves112 and a large outbreak of mycobacterium massiliense infections in brazil after videolaparoscopy equipment used for different elective cosmetic procedures eg liposuction was highly tolerant to 2 glutaraldehyde113 porins may have a role in the resistance of mycobacteria to glutaraldehyde and ortho-phthalaldehyde114
dilution of glutaraldehyde during use commonly occurs and studies show a glutaraldehyde concentration decline after a few days of use in an automatic endoscope washer115 this decline occurs because instruments are not thoroughly dried and water is carried in with the instrument which increases the solutions volume and dilutes its effective concentration this emphasizes the need to ensure that semicritical equipment is disinfected with an acceptable concentration of glutaraldehyde data suggest that 10 to 15 glutaraldehyde is the minimal effective concentration mec for 2 or greater glutaraldehyde solutions when used as a high-level disinfectant115 116 117 chemical test strips or liquid chemical monitors are available for determining whether an effective concentration of glutaraldehyde is present despite repeated use and dilution the frequency of testing should be based on how frequently the solutions are used eg used daily test daily used weekly test before use but the strips should not be used to extend the use life beyond the expiration date data suggest the chemicals in the test strip deteriorate with time118 and a manufacturers expiration date should be placed on the bottles the bottle of test strips should be dated when opened and used for the period of time indicated on the bottle eg 120 days the results of test strip monitoring should be documented the glutaraldehyde test kits have been preliminarily evaluated for accuracy and range118 but their reliability has been questioned119 the concentration should be considered unacceptable or unsafe when the test indicates a dilution below the products mec generally to 10 to 15 glutaraldehyde or lower by the indicator not changing colorglutaraldehyde is used most commonly as a high-level disinfectant for medical equipment such as endoscopes93 endocavitary probes spirometry tubing dialyzers transducers anesthesia and respiratory therapy equipment hemodialysis proportioning and dialysate delivery systems and reuse of laparoscopic disposable plastic trocars75 glutaraldehyde is noncorrosive to metal and does not damage lensed instruments rubber or plastics the fda-cleared labels for high-level disinfection with 2 or greater glutaraldehyde at 25 c range from 20 to 90 minutes depending on the product however multiple scientific studies and professional organizations support the efficacy of 2 or greater glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes at 20 c9 18 37 minimally this latter recommendation should be followed glutaraldehyde should not be used for cleaning noncritical surfaces because it is too toxic and expensivecolitis believed to be due to glutaraldehyde exposure from residual disinfecting solution in the endoscope solution channels has been reported and is preventable by careful endoscope rinsing69 one study found that residual glutaraldehyde levels were higher and more variable after manual disinfection 02 to 1595 mgl than after automatic disinfection 02 to 63 mgl120 similarly keratopathy and corneal damage were caused by ophthalmic instruments that were inadequately rinsed after soaking in 2 glutaraldehyde121
glutaraldehyde exposure should be monitored to ensure a safe work environment in the absence of an osha permissible exposure limit if the glutaraldehyde level is higher than the american conference of industrial hygienists ceiling limit of 005 ppm it would be prudent to take corrective action and repeat monitoring122
the literature contains several accounts of the properties germicidal effectiveness and potential uses for stabilized hydrogen peroxide in the health care setting published reports ascribe good germicidal activity to hydrogen peroxide and attest to its bactericidal virucidal sporicidal and fungicidal properties123 124 125 126 127 some other studies have shown limited bactericidal and virucidal activity of standard 3 hydrogen peroxide58 74 the advantages disadvantages and characteristics of hydrogen peroxide are listed in table 301-2 as with other chemical sterilants dilution of the hydrogen peroxide must be monitored by regularly testing the mec ie 75 to 60 compatibility testing by olympus america of the 75 hydrogen peroxide found both cosmetic changes eg discoloration of black anodized metal finishes93 and functional changes with the tested endoscopes olympus october 15 1999 written communicationcommercially available 3 hydrogen peroxide is a stable and effective disinfectant when used on inanimate surfaces it has been used in concentrations from 3 to 6 for the disinfection of soft contact lenses eg 3 for 2 to 3 hours123 128 tonometer biprisms ventilators fabrics129 and endoscopes130 hydrogen peroxide was effective in spot-disinfecting fabrics in patients rooms129 corneal damage from a hydrogen peroxidesoaked tonometer tip that was not properly rinsed has been reported131
an improved hydrogen peroxidebased technology has been introduced into health care for disinfection of noncritical environmental surfaces and patient equipment132 and high-level disinfection of semicritical equipment such as endoscopes133 134 135 improved hydrogen peroxide contains very low levels of anionic or nonionic surfactants or both in an acidic product that act with hydrogen peroxide to produce microbicidal activity this combination of ingredients speeds the antimicrobial activity of hydrogen peroxide and cleaning efficiency134 135 improved hydrogen peroxide is considered safe for humans and equipment and benign for the environment in fact improved hydrogen peroxide has the lowest epa toxicity category ie category iv based on its oral inhalation and dermal toxicity which means it is practically nontoxic and not an irritant132 134 136 it is prepared and marketed by several companies in various concentrations eg 05 to 7 and different products may use different terminology for these products such as accelerated or activated lower concentrations ie 0514 are designed for the low-level disinfection of noncritical environmental surfaces and patient care objects whereas the higher concentrations can be used as high-level disinfectants for semicritical medical devices eg endoscopesa recent study compared the bactericidal activity of a quaternary ammonium compound with two new improved hydrogen peroxide products the improved hydrogen peroxide products were superior or similar to the quaternary ammonium compound tested when the two improved hydrogen peroxide products were compared with standard 05 14 and 3 hydrogen peroxide formulations the improved hydrogen peroxidebased environmental surface disinfectants proved to be more effective 6-log10 reduction and fast-acting 30-60 seconds microbicides in the presence of a soil load to simulate the presence of body fluids than commercially available hydrogen peroxide only 30- to 60-second contact time was studied because longer contact times eg 10 minutes are not achievable in clinical practice additionally the improved hydrogen peroxide products have an epa-registered contact time that is substantially less eg 30 seconds 1 minute for bacteria than most epa-registered low-level disinfectants58 we have also recently shown that the 14 activated hydrogen peroxide is very effective in reducing microbial contamination of hospital privacy curtains in our study the activated hydrogen peroxide completely eliminated contamination with mrsa and vre and resulted in a 985 reduction in microbes only bacillus spp recoverable thus at our institution privacy curtains are being disinfected at the grab area by spraying the grab area of the curtain three times with activated hydrogen peroxide at discharge cleaningiodine solutions or tinctures have long been used by health care professionals primarily as antiseptics on skin or tissue the fda has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilanthigh level disinfectants with iodophors as the main active ingredient however iodophors have been used both as antiseptics and disinfectants an iodophor is a combination of iodine and a solubilizing agent or carrier the resulting complex provides a sustained-release reservoir of iodine and releases small amounts of free iodine in aqueous solution the best known and most widely used iodophor is povidone-iodine a compound of polyvinylpyrrolidone with iodine this product and other iodophors retain the germicidal efficacy of iodine but unlike iodine are generally nonstaining and are relatively free of toxicity and irritancy137
there are several reports that documented intrinsic microbial contamination of antiseptic formulations of povidone-iodine and poloxamer-iodine138 139 140 it was found that free iodine i2 contributes to the bactericidal activity of iodophors and dilutions of iodophors demonstrate more rapid bactericidal action than does a full-strength povidone-iodine solution therefore iodophors must be diluted according to the manufacturers directions to achieve antimicrobial activitypublished reports on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of iodophors demonstrate that iodophors are bactericidal mycobactericidal and virucidal but may require prolonged contact times to kill certain fungi and bacterial spores15 141 142 143 144
besides their use as an antiseptic iodophors have been used for the disinfection of blood culture bottles and medical equipment such as hydrotherapy tanks and thermometers antiseptic iodophors are not suitable for use as hard-surface disinfectants because of concentration differences iodophors formulated as antiseptics contain less free iodine than those formulated as disinfectants145 iodine or iodine-based antiseptics should not be used on silicone catheters because the silicone tubing may be adversely affected146
ortho-phthalaldehyde opa is a high-level disinfectant that received fda clearance in october 1999 it contains at least 055 12-benzenedicarboxaldehyde or opa and it has supplanted glutaraldehyde as the most commonly used aldehyde for high-level disinfection in the united states opa solution is a clear pale-blue liquid with a ph of 75 the advantages disadvantages and characteristics of opa are listed in table 301-2studies have demonstrated excellent microbicidal activity in in vitro studies74 75 93 111 147 148 149 150 151 152 including superior mycobactericidal activity 5-log10 reduction in 5 minutes compared with glutaraldehyde walsh and colleagues also found opa effective 5-log10 reduction against a wide range of microorganisms including glutaraldehyde-resistant mycobacteria and bacillus atrophaeus spores150
opa has several potential advantages compared with glutaraldehyde it has excellent stability over a wide ph range ph 3 to 9 is not a known irritant to the eyes and nasal passages does not require exposure monitoring has a barely perceptible odor and requires no activation opa like glutaraldehyde has excellent material compatibility a potential disadvantage of opa is that it stains proteins gray including unprotected skin and thus must be handled with caution93 however skin staining would indicate improper handling that requires additional training andor personal protective equipment gloves eye and mouth protection fluid-resistant gowns opa residues remaining on inadequately water-rinsed transesophageal echocardiographic probes may leave stains on the patients mouth meticulous cleaning use of the correct opa exposure time eg 12 minutes and copious rinsing of the probe with water should eliminate this problem because opa has been associated with several episodes of anaphylaxis after cystoscopy153 the manufacturer has modified its instructions for use of opa and contraindicates the use of opa as a disinfectant for reprocessing all urologic instrumentation for patients with a history of bladder cancer personal protective equipment should be worn when handling contaminated instruments equipment and chemicals148 in addition equipment must be thoroughly rinsed to prevent discoloration of a patients skin or mucous membrane the mec of opa is 03 and that concentration is monitored by test strips designed specifically for the opa solution opa exposure level monitoring found that the concentration during the disinfection process was significantly higher in the manual group median 143 ppb than in the automatic group median 035 ppb these findings corroborate other findings that show it is desirable to introduce automatic endoscope reprocessors to decrease disinfectant exposure levels among scope reprocessing technicians154
peracetic or peroxyacetic acid is characterized by a very rapid action against all microorganisms a special advantage of peracetic acid is its lack of harmful decomposition products ie acetic acid water oxygen hydrogen peroxide it enhances removal of organic material155 and leaves no residue it remains effective in the presence of organic matter and is sporicidal even at low temperatures peracetic acid can corrode copper brass bronze plain steel and galvanized iron but these effects can be reduced by additives and ph modifications the advantages disadvantages and characteristics of peracetic acid are listed in table 301-2peracetic acid will inactivate gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria fungi and yeasts in less than 5 minutes at less than 100 ppm in the presence of organic matter 200 to 500 ppm is required for viruses the dosage range is wide 12 to 2250 ppm with poliovirus inactivated in yeast extract in 15 minutes with 1500 to 2250 ppm a processing system using peracetic acid at a temperature of 50 c to 56 c can be used for processing heat-sensitive semicritical and critical devices that are compatible with the peracetic acid and processing system and cannot be sterilized by other legally marketed traditional sterilization methods validated for that type of device eg steam hydrogen peroxide gas plasma vaporized hydrogen peroxide after processing the devices should be used immediately or stored in a manner similar to that of a high-level disinfected endoscope156 157 158 the sterilant 35 peracetic acid is diluted to 02 with tap water that has been filtered and exposed to ultraviolet light simulated-use trials with the earlier version of this processing system have demonstrated excellent microbicidal activity74 158 159 160 161 162 and three clinical trials have demonstrated both excellent microbial killing and no clinical failures leading to infection163 164 165 three clusters of infection using the earlier version of the peracetic acid automated endoscope reprocessor were linked to inadequately processed bronchoscopes when inappropriate channel connectors were used with the system166 167 these clusters highlight the importance of training proper model-specific endoscope connector systems and quality control procedures to ensure compliance with endoscope manufacturers recommendations and professional organization guidelines an alternative high-level disinfectant available in the united kingdom contains 035 peracetic acid although this product is rapidly effective against a broad range of microorganisms168 169 it tarnishes the metal of endoscopes and is unstable resulting in only a 24-hour use life169
three chemical sterilants are fda-cleared that contain peracetic acid plus hydrogen peroxide 008 peracetic acid plus 10 hydrogen peroxide 023 peracetic acid plus 735 hydrogen peroxide and 83 hydrogen peroxide plus 70 peracetic acid the advantages disadvantages and characteristics of peracetic acid with hydrogen peroxide are listed in table 301-2the bactericidal properties of peracetic acid plus hydrogen peroxide have been demonstrated170 manufacturers data demonstrated that this combination of peracetic acid plus hydrogen peroxide inactivated all microorganisms with the exception of bacterial spores within 20 minutes the 008 peracetic acid plus 10 hydrogen peroxide product was effective in inactivating a glutaraldehyde-resistant mycobacteria171
the combination of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide has been used for disinfecting hemodialyzers172 the percentage of dialysis centers using a peracetic acid with hydrogen peroxidebased disinfectant for reprocessing dialyzers increased from 5 in 1983 to 72 in 1997173
phenol has occupied a prominent place in the field of hospital disinfection since its initial use as a germicide by lister in his pioneering work on antiseptic surgery in the past 40 years however work has been concentrated on the numerous phenol derivatives or phenolics and their antimicrobial properties phenol derivatives originate when a functional group eg alkyl phenyl benzyl halogen replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring two phenol derivatives commonly found as constituents of hospital disinfectants are ortho-phenylphenol and ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenolpublished reports on the antimicrobial efficacy of commonly used phenolics showed that they were bactericidal fungicidal virucidal and tuberculocidal15 53 75 141 174 175 176 177 178
many phenolic germicides are epa registered as disinfectants for use on environmental surfaces eg bedside tables bedrails laboratory surfaces and noncritical medical devices phenolics are not fda cleared as high-level disinfectants for use with semicritical items but could be used to preclean or decontaminate critical and semicritical devices before terminal sterilization or high-level disinfectionthe use of phenolics in nurseries has been questioned because of the occurrence of hyperbilirubinemia in infants placed in bassinets in which phenolic detergents were used179 in addition doan and co-workers demonstrated bilirubin level increases in phenolic-exposed infants compared with nonphenolic-exposed infants when the phenolic was prepared according to the manufacturers recommended dilution180 if phenolics or other disinfectants are used to clean nursery floors they must be diluted according to the recommendation on the product label phenolics and other disinfectants should not be used to clean infant bassinets and incubators while occupied if phenolics are used to terminally clean infant bassinets and incubators the surfaces should be rinsed thoroughly with water and dried before the infant bassinets and incubators are reused18
the quaternary ammonium compounds are widely used as surface disinfectants there have been some reports of health careassociated infections associated with contaminated quaternary ammonium compounds used to disinfect patient care supplies or equipment such as cystoscopes or cardiac catheters181 182 as with several other disinfectants eg phenolics iodophors gram-negative bacteria have been found to survive or grow in them140
results from manufacturers data sheets and from published scientific literature indicate that the quaternaries sold as hospital disinfectants are generally fungicidal bactericidal and virucidal against lipophilic enveloped viruses they are not sporicidal and generally not tuberculocidal or virucidal against hydrophilic nonenveloped viruses poor mycobactericidal activities of quaternary ammonium compounds have been reported49 141

the quaternaries are commonly used in ordinary environmental sanitation of noncritical surfaces such as floors furniture and walls epa-registered quaternary ammonium compounds are appropriate to use when disinfecting medical equipment that comes into contact with intact skin eg blood pressure cuffspasteurization is not a sterilization process its purpose is to destroy all pathogenic microorganisms with the exception of bacterial spores the time-temperature relation for hot-water pasteurization is generally greater than 70 c 158 f for 30 minutes the water temperature and time should be monitored as part of a quality assurance program186 pasteurization of respiratory therapy187 188 and anesthesia equipment189 is a recognized alternative to chemical disinfectionultraviolet uv light has been recognized as an effective method for killing microorganisms it has been suggested for use in health care for several purposes including air disinfection room decontamination see room decontamination later surface disinfection biofilm disinfection190 and ultrasound probe disinfection191 contaminated ultrasound probes can potentially transmit pathogens when the probe is only in contact with the patients skin there is a low risk for infection and low-level disinfection is recommended however a higher level of disinfection is recommended when the probe contacts mucous membranes or nonintact skin an evaluation of a new disinfection procedure for ultrasound probes using uv light demonstrated the median microbial reduction for uv light was 100 875 for antiseptic wiping and 88 for dry wiping191
surface disinfection with uv light 100-280 nm has been evaluated with three hospital-related surfaces namely aluminum bed railings stainless steel operating tables and scrubs laboratory coats acinetobacter baumannii were inoculated on small coupons 103 or 105coupon and exposed to 90 jm2 this exposure was effective in the inactivation of acinetobacter from the metal coupon surfaces but ineffective in the decontamination of scrubs192 a hand-held room decontamination technology that utilizes far-uv radiation 185 to 230 nm to kill pathogens was evaluated and found that it rapidly kills c difficile spores and other health careassociated pathogens on surfaces however the presence of organic matter reduces the efficacy of far-uv radiation possibly explaining the more modest results observed on surfaces in hospital rooms that were not precleaned193
flash steam sterilization was originally defined by underwood and perkins as sterilization of an unwrapped object at 132 c for 3 minutes at 27 to 28 pounds of pressure in a gravity displacement sterilizer208 it was intended for instruments eg dropped instruments when there is insufficient time to sterilize an item by the preferred package method the term flash arose out of the abbreviated time of exposure of the unwrapped instrument flash sterilization is an antiquated term that does not fully describe the various steam sterilization cycles now used to process items not intended to be stored for later use immediate use is defined as the shortest possible time between a sterilized items removal from the sterilizer and its aseptic transfer to the sterile field this implies that the sterilized item is used during the procedure for which it was sterilized and in a manner that minimizes its exposure to air and other environmental contaminants the same critical reprocessing steps eg cleaning decontamination rinsing and aseptic transfer from the sterilizer to the point of use must be followed immediate-use steam sterilization should not be used for convenience as an alternative to purchasing sufficient instrument sets or as a time saver209 210
eto is a colorless gas that is flammable and explosive the four essential parameters operational ranges are gas concentration 450 to 1200 mgl temperature 37 c to 63 c relative humidity 40 to 80 water molecules carry eto to reactive sites and exposure time 1 to 6 hours these parameters influence the effectiveness of eto sterilization211 212 213 214 within certain limitations an increase in gas concentration and temperature may shorten the time necessary for achieving sterilizationthe main disadvantages associated with eto are the lengthy cycle time and its potential hazards to patients and staff the main advantages are that it is highly penetrating and can sterilize occluded locations in medical items and can sterilize heat- or moisture-sensitive medical equipment without deleterious effects on the material used in the medical devices see table 301-3212 acute exposure to eto may result in irritation eg to skin eyes or gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts and central nervous system depression69 chronic inhalation has been linked to the formation of cataracts cognitive impairment neurologic dysfunction and disabling polyneuropathies69 occupational exposure in health care facilities has been linked to hematologic changes and an increased risk for spontaneous abortions and various cancers69 eto should be considered a known human carcinogen215
the use of eto evolved when few alternatives existed for sterilizing heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices however favorable properties see table 301-3 account for its continued widespread use216 two eto gas mixtures are available to replace eto-chlorofluorocarbon cfc mixtures for large capacity tank-supplied sterilizers the eto-carbon dioxide co2 mixture consists of 85 eto and 915 co2 this mixture has limited use in us health care facilities but is sometimes used in hospitals in india and china it is less expensive than eto-hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfc but a disadvantage is the need for pressure vessels rated for steam sterilization because higher pressures 28-psi gauge are required the other mixture which is a drop-in cfc replacement is eto mixed with hcfc hcfcs are approximately 50-fold less damaging to the earths ozone layer than are cfcs the epa will begin regulation of hcfc in the year 2015 and will terminate production in the year 2030 the eto-hcfc mixtures have been provided by companies as a drop-in replacement for cfc-12 one mixture consists of 86 eto and 914 hcfc and the other mixture is composed of 10 eto and 90 hcfc but will be phased out by the end of 2013216 an alternative to the pressurized mixed-gas eto systems is 100 eto partly because of the events just described the 100 eto sterilizers that use unit-dose cartridges will become the systems for eto use in us health care facilitiesthe excellent microbicidal activity of eto has been demonstrated in several studies25 161 162 217 218 219 and summarized in published reports220 eto inactivates all microorganisms although bacterial spores especially b atrophaeus are more resistant than other microorganisms for this reason b atrophaeus is the recommended biologic indicator organismlike all sterilization processes the effectiveness of eto sterilization can be altered by lumen length lumen diameter inorganic salts and organic materials for example although eto is not used commonly for reprocessing endoscopes39 several studies have shown failure of eto in inactivating contaminating spores in endoscope channels221 or lumen test units25 161 218 residual eto levels averaging 662 ppm have been found even after the standard degassing time130 failure of eto also has been observed when dental handpieces were contaminated with streptococcus mutans and exposed to eto222 it is recommended that dental handpieces be steam sterilized
eto is used in health care facilities to sterilize critical items and sometimes semicritical items that are moisture or heat sensitive and cannot be sterilized by steam sterilizationnew sterilization technology based on hydrogen peroxide and plasma was patented in 1987 and marketed in the united states in 1993 gas plasmas have been referred to as the fourth state of matter ie liquids solids gases and gas plasmas gas plasmas are generated in an enclosed chamber under deep vacuum using radiofrequency or microwave energy to excite the gas ie hydrogen peroxide molecules and produce charged particles many of which are in the form of free radicals eg hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl this system works by diffusing hydrogen peroxide into the chamber and then exciting the hydrogen peroxide into a plasma state the combined use of hydrogen peroxide vapor and plasma safely and rapidly sterilizes instruments without leaving toxic residues the biologic indicator used with this system is geobacillus stearothermophilus sporesthis process has the ability to inactivate a broad range of microorganisms including resistant bacterial spores studies have been conducted against vegetative bacteria including mycobacteria yeasts fungi viruses and bacterial spores25 161 219 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 like all sterilization processes the effectiveness can be altered by lumen length lumen diameter inorganic salts and organic materials

materials and devices that cannot tolerate high temperatures and humidity such as some plastics electrical devices and corrosion-susceptible metal alloys can be sterilized by hydrogen peroxide gas plasma this method has been compatible with most 95 medical devices and materials tested230 231
a new low temperature sterilization system uses vaporized hydrogen peroxide to sterilize reusable metal and nonmetal devices used in health care facilities the system is compatible with a wide range of medical instruments and materials eg polypropylene brass polyethylene there are no toxic by-products because only water vapor and oxygen are produced the system is not intended to process liquids linens powders or any cellulose materials the system can sterilize instruments with diffusion-restricted spaces eg scissors and medical devices with a single stainless steel lumen based on lumen internal diameter and length eg an inside diameter of 1 mm or larger and a length of 125 mm or shorter see manufacturers recommendations thus gastrointestinal endoscopes and bronchoscopes cannot be sterilized in this system at the current time although this system has not been comparatively evaluated with other sterilization processes vaporized hydrogen peroxide has been shown to be effective in killing spores viruses mycobacteria fungi and bacteria table 301-3 lists the advantages and disadvantages of this and other processesphysicians use endoscopes to diagnose and treat numerous medical disorders although endoscopes represent a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tool in modern medicine and the incidence of infection associated with use has been reported as very low about 1 in 18 million procedures232 more health careassociated outbreaks have been linked to contaminated endoscopes than to any other medical device4 5 6 233 to prevent the spread of health careassociated infections all heat-sensitive endoscopes eg gastrointestinal endoscopes bronchoscopes nasopharyngoscopes must be properly cleaned and at a minimum subjected to high-level disinfection after each use high-level disinfection can be expected to destroy all microorganisms although when high numbers of bacterial spores are present a few spores may surviverecommendations for the cleaning and disinfection of endoscopic equipment have been published and should be strictly followed9 37 234 235 unfortunately audits have shown that personnel do not adhere to guidelines on reprocessing236 237 238 239 and outbreaks of infection continue to occur240 241 to ensure that reprocessing personnel are properly trained there should be initial and annual competency testing for each individual who is involved in reprocessing endoscopic instruments9 38 167 234
in general endoscope disinfection or sterilization with a liquid chemical sterilant or high-level disinfectant involves five steps after leak testing1
cleanmechanically clean internal and external surfaces including brushing internal channels and flushing each internal channel with water and a enzymatic cleaner2
disinfectimmerse endoscope in high-level disinfectant or chemical sterilant and perfuse eliminates air pockets and ensures contact of the germicide with the internal channels disinfectant into all accessible channels such as the suctionbiopsy channel and airwater channel and expose for a time recommended for specific products3
rinserinse the endoscope and all channels with sterile water filtered water commonly used with automated endoscope reprocessors or tap water4
dryrinse the insertion tube and inner channels with alcohol and dry with forced air after disinfection and before storage5
storestore the endoscope in a way that prevents recontamination and promotes drying eg hung vertically
unfortunately there is poor compliance with the recommendations for reprocessing endoscopes which may result in patient exposure to bloodborne pathogens242 in addition there are rare instances in which the scientific literature and recommendations from professional organizations regarding the use of disinfectants and sterilants may differ from the manufacturers label claim one example is the contact time used to achieve high-level disinfection with 2 glutaraldehyde based on fda requirements fda regulates liquid sterilants and high-level disinfectants used on critical and semicritical medical devices manufacturers test the efficacy of their germicide formulations under worst-case conditions ie minimum recommended concentration of the active ingredient and in the presence of organic soil typically 5 serum the soil is used to represent the organic loading to which the device is exposed during actual use and that would remain on the device in the absence of cleaning these stringent test conditions are designed to provide a margin of safety by ensuring that the contact conditions for the germicide provide complete elimination of the test bacteria eg 105 to 106 
m tuberculosis in organic soil and dried on a scope if inoculated into the most difficult areas for the disinfectant to penetrate and in the absence of cleaning however the scientific data demonstrate that m tuberculosis levels can be reduced by at least 8 log10 with cleaning 4 log10 followed by chemical disinfection for 20 minutes at 20 c 4 to 6 log109 37 243 because of these data professional organizations at least 14 professional organizations worldwide that have endorsed an endoscope reprocessing guideline recommend contact conditions of 20 minutes at 20 c or 20 minutes outside the united states with 2 glutaraldehyde to achieve high-level disinfection that differs from that of the manufacturers label37 244 245 246 it is important to emphasize that the fda tests do not include cleaning a critical component of the disinfection process therefore when cleaning has been included in the test methodology 2 glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes has been demonstrated to be effective in eliminating all vegetative bacteriaemerging pathogens are of growing concern to the general public and infection control professionals relevant pathogens include cryptosporidium parvum c difficile severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-coronavirus helicobacter pylori e coli o157h7 hiv hepatitis c virus hcv rotavirus multidrug-resistant m tuberculosis human papillomavirus norovirus and nontuberculous mycobacteria eg m chelonae similarly publications have highlighted the concern about the potential for bioterrorism251 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc has categorized several agents as high priority because they can be easily disseminated or transmitted person to person can cause high mortality and are likely to cause public panic and social disruption252 these agents include bacillus anthracis anthrax yersinia pestis plague variola major smallpox francisella tularensis tularemia filoviruses ebola hemorrhagic fever marburg hemorrhagic fever and arenaviruses lassa lassa fever junin argentine hemorrhagic fever and related viruses252
with rare exceptions the susceptibility of each of these pathogens to chemical disinfectantssterilants has been studied and all of these pathogens or surrogate microbes such as feline-calicivirus for norovirus vaccinia for variola142 and b atrophaeus formerly bacillus subtilis for b anthracis are susceptible to currently available chemical disinfectantssterilants9 253 254 standard sterilization and high-level disinfection procedures for patient care equipment as recommended in this chapter are adequate to sterilize or disinfect instruments or devices contaminated with blood or other body fluids from persons infected with bloodborne pathogens emerging pathogens and bioterrorism agents with the exception of prions see later no changes in procedures for cleaning disinfecting or sterilizing need to be made9
in addition there are no data to show that antibiotic-resistant bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa vancomycin-resistant enterococcus vre multidrug-resistant m tuberculosis are less sensitive to the liquid chemical germicides that antibiotic-sensitive bacteria at currently used germicide contact conditions and concentrations255 256
creutzfeldt-jakob disease cjd is a degenerative neurologic disorder of humans with an incidence in the united states of approximately 1 casemillion populationyear257 258 cjd is believed to be caused by a proteinaceous infectious agent or prion cjd is related to other human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses that include kuru 0 incidence now eradicated gertsmann-straussler-sheinker gss syndrome 140 million and fatal insomnia syndrome ffi 140 million the agents of cjd and other tses exhibit an unusual resistance to conventional chemical and physical decontamination methods because the cjd agent is not readily inactivated by conventional disinfection and sterilization procedures and because of the invariably fatal outcome of cjd the procedures for disinfection and sterilization of the cjd prion have been both conservative and controversial for many yearsthe current recommendations consider inactivation data but also use epidemiologic studies of prion transmission infectivity of human tissues and the efficacy of removing proteins by cleaning257 259 260 on the basis of scientific data only critical eg surgical instruments and semicritical devices contaminated with high-risk tissue ie brain spinal cord and eye tissue from high-risk patients eg known or suspected infection with cjd or other prion disease require special prion reprocessing a moist environment after contamination reduces the attachment of both protein and prion amyloid to the stainless steel surface so moist conditions should be maintained261 after the device is clean it should be sterilized by either autoclaving ie steam sterilization or using a combination of sodium hydroxide and autoclaving262 using one of the options below257option 1autoclave at 134 c for 18 minutes in a prevacuum sterilizeroption 2autoclave at 132 c for 1 hour in a gravity displacement sterilizer9 257 263
option 3immerse in 1n sodium hydroxide for 1 hour remove and rinse in water then transfer to an open pan and autoclave 121 c gravity displacement or 134c porous or prevacuum sterilizer for 1 houroption 4immerse in 1n sodium hydroxide for 1 hour and heat in a gravity displacement at 121 c for 30 minutes then clean and subject to routine sterilizationsome data suggest the temperature should not exceed 134 c because the effectiveness of autoclaving may decline as the temperature is increased eg 136 c 138 c264 prion-contaminated medical devices that are impossible or difficult to clean should be discarded to minimize environmental contamination noncritical environmental surfaces should be covered with plastic-backed paper and when contaminated with high-risk tissues the paper should be properly discarded noncritical environmental surfaces eg laboratory surfaces contaminated with high-risk tissues should be cleaned and then spot decontaminated with a 1  10 dilution of hypochlorite solutions257
it has long been recommended in the united states that environmental surfaces in patient rooms be cleaned and disinfected on a regular basis eg daily or three times per week when surfaces are visibly soiled and after patient discharge terminal cleaning9 disinfection is generally performed using an epa-registered hospital disinfectant such as a quaternary ammonium compound recent studies have demonstrated that adequate environment cleaning is frequently lacking for example carling and co-workers assessed the thoroughness of terminal cleaning in the patients immediate environment in 23 acute care hospitals 1119 patient rooms by using a transparent easily cleaned stable solution that fluoresces when exposed to hand-held uv light272 the overall thoroughness of cleaning expressed as a percent of surfaces evaluated was 49 range for all hospitals 35 to 81 using a similar design carling and co-workers assessed the environmental cleaning in intensive care unit rooms in 16 hospitals 2320 objects and demonstrated that only 571 of sites were cleaned after discharge of the rooms occupant273 a recent study using atp bioluminescence assays and aerobic cultures demonstrated that medical equipment frequently had not been disinfected as per protocol274
investigators have reported that intervention programs aimed at environmental services workers resulted in significant improvement in cleaning practices65 66 such interventions have generally included multiple activities improved education monitoring the thoroughness of cleaning eg by use of atp assays or fluorescent dyes with feedback of performance to the environmental service workers or use of cleaning checklists or both we have found that assignment of cleaning responsibility eg medical equipment to be cleaned by nursing environmental surfaces to be cleaned by environmental service is also important to ensure all objects and surfaces are decontaminated especially the surfaces of medical equipment eg cardiac monitors improved environmental cleaning has been demonstrated to reduce the environmental contamination with vre275 276 mrsa276 and c difficile
277 importantly no study has reported in the postintervention period proper cleaning of more than 85 of objects further all studies have only focused improvement on a limited number of high risk objects thus a concern of published studies is that they have only demonstrated improved cleaning of a limited number of high risk objects or targeted objects not an improvement in the overall thoroughness of room decontaminationuv irradiation has been used for the control of pathogenic microorganisms in a variety of applications such as control of legionellosis as well as disinfection of air surfaces and instruments278 279 at certain wavelengths uv light will break the molecular bonds in dna thereby destroying the organism uv-c has a characteristic wavelength of 200 to 270 nm eg 254 nm which lies in the germicidal active portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of 200 to 320 nm the efficacy of uv irradiation is a function of many different parameters such as intensity exposure time lamp placement and air movement patternsan automated mobile uv-c unit has been shown to eliminate more than 3-log10 vegetative bacteria mrsa vre acinetobacter baumannii and more than 24-log10
c difficile seeded onto formica surfaces in patients rooms experimentally contaminated280 boyce and colleagues report the results of assessing the effectiveness of the same uv-c unit to reduce environmental contamination with vegetative bacteria measured using aerobic colony counts and c difficile inoculated onto stainless steel carrier disks281 room decontamination with the uv system resulted in significant reductions in aerobic bacteria on five high-touch surfaces mean c difficile log10 reductions ranged from 18 to 29 using cycle times of 342 to 1001 minutes surfaces in direct line-of-sight were significantly more likely to yield negative cultures after uv decontamination than before decontamination nerandzic and colleagues showed that uv-c at a reflected dose of 22000 mwscm2 for approximately 45 minutes consistently reduced recovery of c difficile spores and mrsa by more than 2- to 3-log10 colony-forming units cfucm2 and of vre by more than 3- to 4-log10 cfucm2282 thus there are now three studies that have demonstrated that a uv-c system is capable of reducing vegetative bacteria inoculated on a carrier by more than 3- to 4-log10 in 15 to 20 minutes and c difficile by more than 17- to 4-log10 in 35 to 100 minutes the studies also demonstrate reduced effectiveness when surfaces were not in direct line of sight280 281 282
several systems that produce hydrogen peroxide eg vapor aerosolized dry mist have been studied for their ability to decontaminate environmental surfaces and objects in hospital rooms hydrogen peroxide vapor hpv has been used increasingly for the decontamination of rooms in health care facilities283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 investigators found that hydrogen peroxide systems are a highly effective method for eradicating various pathogens eg mrsa m tuberculosis serratia c difficile spores clostridium botulinum spores from rooms furniture and equipment importantly using a before-after study design boyce and co-workers have shown that use of hydrogen peroxide vapor was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of c difficile infection on five high-incidence wards283
the uv-c system studied and the systems that use hydrogen peroxide have their own advantages and disadvantages268 and there is now ample evidence that these no-touch systems can reduce environmental contamination with health careassociated pathogens however each specific system should be studied and its efficacy demonstrated before being introduced into health care facilities the main advantage of both units is their ability to achieve substantial reductions in vegetative bacteria as noted earlier manual cleaning has been demonstrated to be suboptimal because many environmental surfaces are not cleaned another advantage is their ability to substantially reduce c difficile because low-level disinfectants eg quaternary ammonium compounds have limited or no measurable activity against spore-forming bacteria278 both systems are residual free and they decontaminate all exposed surfaces and equipment in the roomthe major disadvantages of both decontamination systems are the substantial capital equipment costs the need to remove personnel and patients from the room thus limiting their use to terminal room disinfection must preventminimize exposure to uv and hydrogen peroxide the staff time needed to transport the system to rooms to be decontaminated and monitor its use the need to physically clean the room of dust and debris and the sensitivity to use parameters there are several important differences between the two systems the uv-c system offers faster decontamination that reduces the down time of the room before another patient can be admitted the hydrogen peroxide systems have been demonstrated to be more effective in eliminating spore-forming organisms whether this improved sporicidal activity is clinically important is unclear because studies have demonstrated that although environmental contamination is common in the rooms of patients with c difficile infection the level of contamination is relatively low also true for mrsa and vre finally the hydrogen peroxide system was demonstrated to reduce c difficile incidence in a clinical study whereas similar studies with the uv-c system have not been published if additional studies continue to demonstrate a benefit then widespread adoption of these technologies should be considered for terminal room disinfection of certain patient rooms eg contact precautions in health care facilitieshealth care facilities that generate medical chemical or radiologic waste have a moral and legal obligation to dispose of these wastes in a manner that poses minimal potential hazard to the environment or public health the proper disposal of these wastes requires a dynamic waste management plan that conforms to federal state and local regulations and provides adequate personnel and financial resources to ensure implementationmedical waste disposal has been as a major problem in the united states for the past 40 years the problem has developed as a result of medical waste washing ashore in some coastal states in 1987 and 1988 and the perceived threat of acquiring hiv infection via this waste this has led to restrictive rules governing the disposal of medical waste in many states and an increase in the volume of waste defined as regulated medical waste coincidentally with an increase in volume of regulated medical waste formerly called infectious waste the options for medical waste treatment and disposal are diminishing because of space and environmental concerns this section will review some of the principles associated with medical waste management but a more detailed description of collection storage processing transporting treatment and public health implications of medical waste may be found elsewhere293 294 295 296 297
despite the attention given to medical waste by the public the media and all levels of government the terms hospital waste medical waste regulated medical waste and infectious waste are often used synonymously hospital waste refers to all waste biologic or nonbiologic that is discarded and not intended for further use medical waste refers to materials generated as a result of patient diagnosis immunization or treatment such as soiled dressings or intravenous tubing infectious waste refers to that portion of medical waste that could potentially transmit an infectious disease congress and the epa used the term regulated medical waste rather than infectious waste in the medical waste tracking act mwta of 1988 in deference to the remote possibility of disease transmission associated with this waste thus medical waste is a subset of hospital waste and regulated medical waste which is synonymous with infectious waste from a regulatory perspective is a subset of medical waste
293
as stated regulated medical waste or infectious waste is capable of producing an infectious disease this definition requires a consideration of the factors necessary for disease induction that include dose host susceptibility presence of a pathogen virulence of a pathogen and the most commonly absent factor a portal of entry for a waste to be infectious therefore it must contain pathogens with sufficient virulence and quantity so that exposure to the waste by a susceptible host could result in an infectious disease because there are no tests that allow infectious waste to be identified objectively responsible agencies eg the cdc epa or states define waste as infectious when it is suspected to contain pathogens in sufficient number to cause disease not only does this subjective definition result in conflicting opinions from the cdc epa and state agencies on what constitutes infectious waste and how it should be treated but it also gives undue emphasis to the mere presence of pathogensguidelines produced by the cdc have designated five types of hospital waste as regulated medical waste ie microbiology laboratory waste pathology and anatomy waste contaminated animal carcasses blood and sharps40 the epa guidelines consider the same types of waste as infectious or regulated medical waste but also designate communicable disease isolation waste296 in the mwta the epa modified its position on communicable disease isolation waste by including only certain highly communicable disease waste such as class 4 eg marburg ebola and lassa viruses as regulated medical waste298 table 301-4
 in a systematic random survey of all us hospitals conducted in july 1987 and january 1988 the overall compliance rates with the cdc and epa recommendations were 82 and 75 respectively not only were the majority of hospitals in compliance but the hospitals frequently treated other hospital waste as infectious including contaminated laboratory waste 87 surgery waste 78 dialysis waste 69 items contacting secretions 63 intensive care 37 and emergency department waste 41293
a key component in evaluating the impact of a medical waste management program is the quantity of waste produced per patient hospitalized patients generate about 15 pounds of hospital waste per day the amount of hospital waste generated by us hospitals is approximately 6700 tons per day us hospitals designate approximately 15 of the total hospital waste by weight as infectious about 1000 tons of infectious waste per day293 not surprisingly the percentage of medical waste treated as infectious increases with the number and types of medical waste classified as infectious for example about 6 of hospital waste would be treated as infectious waste if the cdc guidelines are followed but 45 of hospital waste could be considered infectious waste under the mwta293 299
the vast majority of us hospitals designate and treat microbiologic pathologic isolation blood and sharp waste as infectious293 in the late 1980s treatment of infectious waste by us hospitals was most commonly accomplished by incineration range 64 to 93 depending on the type of waste but emission regulations that limit air pollutants has reduced the number and use of incineration for medical waste for example in september 1997 there were an estimated 2373 medical waste incinerators in the united states but based on the epas 2010 inventory there are 54 infectious waste incinerators300 autoclaves or steam sterilizers have become the primary nonincineration technology used by hospitals to process their regulated medical waste except pathology waste e krisiunas written communication 2008 several other nonincineration alternatives have been proposed for treating regulated medical waste eg mechanicalchemical disinfection microwave decontamination steam disinfection and compacting297 nonregulated medical waste is generally discarded in a properly sited and operated sanitary landfill because this is a safe and inexpensive disposal method eg landfill disposal costs 002 to 005 per pound for nonregulated medical waste versus a contract incinerator cost of 020 to 060 per pound for regulated medical wastethe conflicting opinions of state and federal regulations are related to the paucity of microbiologic and epidemiologic evidence that medical waste represents a threat to the public health first with the exception of sharps such as needles which have caused disease only in an occupational setting there is no scientific evidence that medical waste has caused disease in the hospital or the community second data demonstrate that household waste contains on average 100 times as many microorganisms with pathogenic potential for humans than medical waste301 third detailed reports of the beach washups found that the vast majority of waste on beaches was debris about 99 such as wood plastic and paper not medical waste epa documents acknowledge that much of the medical waste that washed ashore in the summer of 1988 was syringe related 65 and came from home health care and illegal drug use fourth studies have shown that most us hospitals are in compliance with the cdc infectious waste guidelines fifth although the principal purpose of the mwta was to reduce medical waste on beaches it has not demonstrated its intended benefit the relative number of syringes on the beaches in the mwta states was significantly greater during implementation of the act 1723 than before the act went into effect 32299 if regulatory control were based on epidemiologic microbiologic and environmental data only two types of medical waste would require special handling and treatmentsharps and microbiologic wastefederal medical waste regulations have been promulgated by the us department of transportation and osha the department of transportation regulation involves the transport of infectious substances and medical waste and went into effect january 1996302 the osha bloodborne pathogen standard requires labeling to designate waste that poses a health threat in the workplace the osha definition of regulated waste is not intended to designate waste that must be treated in fact generators who apply the osha definition of regulated waste rather than state regulations to designate infectious waste for treatment by incineration or other means may unintentionally incur additional expenses247
when properly used disinfection and sterilization can ensure the safe use of invasive and noninvasive medical devices however current disinfection and sterilization guidelines must be strictly followedvirus infection often results in a number of changes that are detectable by visual or biochemical examination of infected cells these changes result from the production of virus proteins and nucleic acids but also from alterations to the biosynthetic capabilities of infected cells virus replication sequesters cellular apparatus such as ribosomes and raw materials that would normally be devoted to synthesizing molecules required by the cell eukaryotic cells must carry out constant macromolecular synthesis whether they are growing and dividing or in a state of quiescence a growing cell needs to manufacture more proteins more nucleic acids and more of all of its components to increase its size before dividing however there is another reason for such continuous activity the function of all cells is regulated by controlled expression of their genetic information and the subsequent degradation of the molecules produced such control relies on a delicate and dynamic balance between synthesis and decay which determines the intracellular levels of all the important molecules in the cell this is particularly true of the control of the cell cycle which determines the behavior of dividing cells see cell transformation by dna viruses below in general terms a number of common phenotypic changes can be recognized in virus-infected cells these changes are often referred to as the cytopathic effects cpe of a virus and include
altered shape adherent cells that are normally attached to other cells in vivo or an artificial substrate in vitro may assume a rounded shape different from their normal flattened appearance the extended processes extensions of the cell surface resembling tendrils involved in attachment or mobility are withdrawn into the cell
detachment from the substrate for adherent cells this is the stage of cell damage that follows that above both of these effects are caused by partial degradation or disruption of the cytoskeleton that is normally responsible for maintaining the shape of the cell
lysis this is the most extreme case where the entire cell breaks down membrane integrity is lost and the cell may swell due to the absorption of extracellular fluid and finally break open this is an extreme case of cell damage and it is important to realize that not all viruses induce this effect although they may cause other cytopathic effects lysis is beneficial to a virus in that it provides an obvious method of releasing new virus particles from an infected cell however there are alternative ways of achieving this such as release by budding chapter 4
membrane fusion the membranes of adjacent cells fuse resulting in a mass of cytoplasm containing more than one nucleus known as a syncytium or depending on the number of cells that merge a giant cell fused cells are short lived and subsequently lyseapart from direct effects of the virus they cannot tolerate more than one nonsynchronized nucleus per cell
membrane permeability a number of viruses cause an increase in membrane permeability allowing an influx of extracellular ions such as sodium translation of some virus mrnas is resistant to high concentrations of sodium ions permitting the expression of virus genes at the expense of cellular messages

inclusion bodies these are areas of the cell where virus components have accumulated they are frequent sites of virus assembly and some cellular inclusions consist of crystalline arrays of virus particles it is not clear how these structures damage the cell but they are frequently associated with viruses that cause cell lysis such as herpesviruses and rabies virus
apoptosis virus infection may trigger apoptosis programmed cell death a highly specific mechanism involved in the normal growth and development of organisms see chapter 6
in some cases a great deal of detail is known about the molecular mechanisms of cell injury a number of viruses that cause cell lysis exhibit a phenomenon known as shutoff early in infection shutoff is the sudden and dramatic cessation of most host-cell macromolecular synthesis in poliovirus-infected cells shutoff is the result of production of the virus 2a protein this molecule is a protease that cleaves the p220 component of eif-4f a complex of proteins required for cap-dependent translation of messenger rnas by ribosomes because poliovirus rna does not have a 5 methylated cap but is modified by the addition of the vpg protein virus rna continues to be translated in poliovirus-infected cells the dissociation of mrnas and polyribosomes from the cytoskeleton can be observed and this is the reason for the inability of the cell to translate its own messages a few hours after translation ceases lysis of the cell occursin other cases cessation of cellular macromolecular synthesis results from a different molecular mechanism for many viruses the sequence of events that occurs is not known in the case of adenoviruses the penton protein part of the virus capsid has a toxic effect on cells although its precise action on cells is not known addition of purified penton protein to cultured cells results in their rapid death toxin production by pathogenic bacteria is a common phenomenon but this is the only well-established case of a virus-encoded molecule with a toxin-like action however some of the normal contents of cells released on lysis may have toxic effects on other cells and antigens that are not recognized as self by the body eg nuclear proteins may result in immune activation and inflammation the adenovirus e3116k protein is synthesized in small amounts from the e3 promoter at early stages of infection and in large amounts from the major late promoter at late stages of infection chapter 5 it has recently been shown that e3116k is required for the lysis of adenovirus-infected cells and the release of virus particles from the nucleusmembrane fusion is the result of virus-encoded proteins required for infection of cells see chapter 4 typically the glycoproteins of enveloped viruses one of the best-known examples of such a protein comes from sendai virus a paramyxovirus which has been used to induce cell fusion during the production of monoclonal antibodies chapter 1 at least 9 of the 11 known herpes simplex virus hsvhhv-1 glycoproteins have been characterized regarding their role in virus replication several of these proteins are involved in fusion of the virus envelope with the cell membrane and also in cell penetration production of fused syncytia is a common feature of hsv infectionanother virus that causes cell fusion is human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection of cd4 cells with some but not all isolates of hiv causes cellcell fusion and the production of syncytia or giant cells figure 71
 the protein responsible for this is the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein of the virus gp41 and the domain near the amino-terminus responsible for this fusogenic activity has been identified by molecular genetic analysis because hiv infects cd4 cells and it is the reduction in the number of these crucial cells of the immune system that is the most obvious defect in aids it was initially believed that direct killing of these cells by the virus was the basis for the pathogenesis of aids although direct cell killing by hiv undoubtedly occurs in vivo it is now believed that the pathogenesis of aids is considerably more complex see viruses and immunodeficiency below many animal retroviruses also cause cell killing and in most cases it appears that the envelope protein of the virus is required although there may be more than one mechanism involvedat least two groups of viruses herpesviruses and retroviruses directly infect the cells of the immune system this has important consequences for the outcome of the infection and for the immune system of the host hsv establishes a systemic infection spreading via the bloodstream in association with platelets but it does not show particular tropism for cells of the immune system however herpes saimirii and mareks disease virus are herpesviruses that cause lymphoproliferative diseases but not clonal tumors in monkeys and chickens respectively the most recently discovered human herpesviruses hhvshhv-6 hhv-7 and hhv-8all infect lymphocytes chapter 8epsteinbarr virus ebv hhv-4 infection of b-cells leads to their immortalization and proliferation resulting in glandular fever or mononucleosis a debilitating but benign condition ebv was first identified in a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from burkitts lymphoma and in rare instances ebv infection may lead to the formation of a malignant tumor see cell transformation by dna viruses below while some herpesviruses such as hsv are highly cytopathic most of the lymphotropic herpesviruses do not cause a significant degree of cellular injury however infection of the delicate cells of the immune system may perturb their normal function because the immune system is internally regulated by complex networks of interlinking signals relatively small changes in cellular function can result in its collapse alteration of the normal pattern of production of cytokines could have profound effects on immune function the trans-regulatory proteins involved in the control of herpesvirus gene expression may also affect the transcription of cellular genes therefore the effects of herpesviruses on immune cells are more complex than just cell killing
retroviruses cause a variety of pathogenic conditions including paralysis arthritis anemia and malignant cellular transformation a significant number of retroviruses infect the cells of the immune system although these infections may lead to a diverse array of diseases and hematopoetic abnormalities such as anemia and lymphoproliferation the most commonly recognized consequence of retrovirus infection is the formation of lymphoid tumors however some degree of immunodeficiency ranging from very mild to quite severe is a common consequence of the interference with the immune system resulting from the presence of a lymphoid or myeloid tumorthe most prominent aspect of virus-induced immunodeficiency is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids a consequence of infection with hiv a member of the genus lentivirus of the retroviridae a number of similar lentiviruses cause immunodeficiency diseases in animals unlike infection by other types of retrovirus hiv infection does not directly result in the formation of tumors some tumors such as b-cell lymphomas are sometimes seen in aids patients but these are a consequence of the lack of immune surveillance that is responsible for the destruction of tumors in healthy individuals the clinical course of aids is long and very variable a great number of different abnormalities of the immune system are seen in aids as a result of the biology of lentivirus infections the pathogenesis of aids is highly complex figure 72
it is still not clear how much of the pathology of aids is caused directly by the virus and how much is caused by the immune system numerous models have been suggested to explain how hiv causes immunodeficiency these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and indeed it is probable that the underlying loss of cd4 cells see chapter 6 in aids is complex and multifactorial aids is defined as the presence of hiv infection plus one or both of the followinga cd4 t-cell count of less than 200 cellsml of blood the normal count is 6001000 per mldevelopment of an opportunistic infection that occurs when the immune system is not working correctly such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia pcp certain eye diseases encephalitis and some specific tumors such as kaposis sarcoma ks
the best way to avoid aids is not to become infected with hiv but that is not much help to the 35 million people worldwide who already are infected with the virus if we are to find a cure for aids we need to understand the mechanisms by which the virus causes the disease although the basic biology of hiv is well understood see further reading at the end of this chapter scientists have never had a complete understanding of the processes by which cd4 t-helper cells are depleted in hiv infection and therefore have never been able to fully explain why hiv destroys the bodys supply of these vital cellsthere have been many theories about how hiv infection results in aids soon after hiv was discovered in the 1980s it was shown that the virus could kill cd4 cells in culture early experiments suggested there might not be enough virus present in aids patients to account for all the cell loss seen later sensitive pcr techniques suggested that with the amount of virus present in infected individuals the cd4 cell count should in fact decline much faster and aids develop much earlier than it does after hiv infection researchers have used a tap and drain analogy to describe cd4 cell loss in hiv infection in this description of the disease cd4 cells like water in a sink are constantly being eliminated by hiv the drain while the body is constantly replacing them with new ones the tap over time the tap cannot keep up with the drain and cd4 counts begin to drop leaving the body susceptible to the infections that define aids cd4 cells that are activated in response to invading microbes including hiv itself are highly susceptible to infection with the virus and following infection these cells may produce many new copies of hiv before dying one explanation for cd4 cell loss is the runaway hypothesis in which cd4 cells infected by hiv produce more virus particles which activate more cd4 cells that in turn become infected leading to a positive feedback cycle of cd4 cell activation infection hiv production and cell destruction unfortunately mathematical models consisting of a series of equations to describe the processes by which cd4 cells are produced and eliminated suggest that if the runaway hypothesis was correct then cd4 cells in hiv-infected individuals would fall to low levels over a few months not over several years as usually happens this implies that the runaway hypothesis cannot explain the slow pace of cd4 cell depletion in hiv infection that leaves open the question of what exactly is going on between the time someone becomes infected with hiv and the time that they develop aids while virus adaptation antigenic variation is important in the biology of hiv this alone cannot explain the whole storyin general hiv is regarded as an incurable infection although in many cases doctors are able to stave off the onset of aids by giving patients sustained courses of antiretrovirus drugs as a retrovirus the biology of hiv including integration of the virus genome into host-cell chromosomes is a major problem in eradicating the virus from the body see chapter 3 in hiv-infected people receiving antiviral therapy there is a reservoir of latently infected resting cd4 t cells many hiv patients can manage their infection with a cocktails of antiretrovirus drugs which can reduce their viral loadthe amount of virus circulating in the blood plasmato undetectable levels but even in such noninfectious patients hiv is still lurking in gut tissues and still infecting other immune cells in the blood mathematical modeling and clinical observations suggest it might not ever be possible to completely eradicate the virus from the body with current therapies the hope is that new approaches such as rnai see chapter 6 might one day be able to tackle this latent virus pool and completely eliminate the virus from the body curing the infection recent work has focused on the development of therapies to disrupt virus latency and expose the virus to replication-blocking drugs and to the immune response which exists in hiv-positive people even if this is possible the cost of these advanced therapies would be beyond the reach of developing countries where the majority of hiv-infected people live it may be that adaptation of hiv to replication in humans may eventually temper the pathogenicity of the virus by lowering its replication capacity however this process will be speeded up by antiviral therapies in many different forms including genetic drugs and vaccines
box 72stealthy does itthe more we study viruses the more examples we find of viruses interacting with the immune system not interacting as in argh im dead but interacting as in i wonder what happens if i twist this knob almost all viruses moderate the immune responses directed against them this makes senseif they couldnt do this they probably wouldnt be able to replicate and some viruses are masters of the art subtly tweaking and muting strands of the immune system to make life easier for them herpesviruses and poxviruses spring to mind in comparison to them viruses which go for an all-out assault on the body or on the immune system seem like amateurs the consequences on their hosts are devastating which is bad for both the virus and the host so lets hear it for the true masters of the craft of sneaking around of getting on with things quietly
virus infections are believed to be a necessary prerequisite for a number of human diseases which are not directly caused by the virus in some instances the link between a particular virus and a pathological condition is well established but it is clear that the pathogenesis of the disease is complex and also involves the immune system of the host in other cases the pathogenic involvement of a particular virus is less certain and in a few instances rather speculativealthough the incidence of measles virus infection has been reduced sharply by vaccination chapter 6 measles still causes thousands of deaths worldwide each year the normal course of measles virus infection is an acute febrile illness during which the virus spreads throughout the body infecting many tissues the vast majority of people spontaneously recover from the disease without any lasting harm in rare cases about 1 in 2000 measles may progress to a severe encephalitis this is still an acute condition that either regresses or kills the patient within a few weeks however there is another much rarer late consequence of measles virus infection that occurs many months or years after initial infection of the host this is the condition known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis sspe evidence of prior measles virus infection antibodies or direct detection of the virus is found in all patients with sspe whether they can recall having a symptomatic case of measles or not in about 1 in 300000 cases of measles the virus is not cleared from the body by the immune system but establishes a persistent infection in the cns in this condition virus replication continues at a low level but defects in the envelope protein genes prevent the production of extracellular infectious virus particles the lack of envelope protein production causes the failure of the immune system to recognize and eliminate infected cells however the virus is able to spread directly from cell to cell bypassing the usual route of infection it is not known to what extent damage to the cells of the brain is caused directly by virus replication or whether there is any contribution by the immune system to the pathogenesis of sspe vaccination against measles virus and the prevention of primary infection should ultimately eliminate this conditionanother well-established case where the immune system is implicated in pathogenesis concerns dengue virus infections dengue virus is a flavivirus that is transmitted from one human host to another via mosquitoes the primary infection may be asymptomatic or may result in dengue fever dengue fever is normally a self-limited illness from which patients recover after 710 days without further complications following primary infections patients carry antibodies to the virus unfortunately there are four serotypes of dengue virus den-1 2 3 and 4 and the presence of antibody directed against one type does not give cross-protection against the other three worse still is the fact that antibodies can enhance the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by fc-receptor-mediated uptake of antibody-coated dengue virus particles see chapter 4 in a few cases the consequences of dengue virus infection are much more severe than the usual fever dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf is a life-threatening disease in the most extreme cases so much internal hemorrhaging occurs that hypovolemic shock dengue shock syndrome or dss occurs dss is frequently fatal the cause of shock in dengue and other hemorrhagic fevers is partly due to the virus but largely due to immune-mediated damage of virus-infected cells figure 73
 dhf and dss following primary dengue virus infections occur in approximately 1 in 14000 and 1 in 500 patients respectively however after secondary dengue virus infections the incidence of dhf is 1 in 90 and dss 1 in 50 as cross-reactive but nonneutralizing antibodies to the virus are now present these figures show the problems of cross-infection with different serotypes of dengue virus and the difficulties that must be faced in developing a safe vaccine against the virus dengue virus is discussed further later in this chapter see new and emergent virusesanother instance where virus vaccines have resulted in increased pathology rather than the prevention of disease is the occurrence of postvaccination reyes syndrome reyes syndrome is a neurological condition involving acute cerebral edema and occurs almost exclusively in children it is well known as a rare postinfection complication of a number of different viruses but most commonly influenza virus and varicellazoster virus chicken pox symptoms include frequent vomiting painful headaches behavioral changes extreme tiredness and disorientation the chances of contracting reyes syndrome are increased if aspirin is administered during the initial illness the basis for the pathogenesis of this condition is completely unknown but some of the most unfortunate cases have followed the administration of experimental influenza virus vaccines
guillainbarr syndrome is another mysterious condition in which demyelination of nerves results in partial paralysis and muscle weakness the onset of guillainbarr syndrome usually follows an acute virus-like infection but no single agent has ever been firmly associated with this condition kawasaki disease is similar to reyes syndrome in that it occurs in children but is distinct in that it results in serious damage to the heart like guillainbarr syndrome kawasaki disease appears to follow acute infections the disease itself is not infectious but does appear to occur in epidemics which suggests an infectious agent as the cause a large number of bacterial and virus pathogens have been suggested to be associated with the induction of kawasaki disease but once again the underlying cause of the pathology is unknown it would appear that acute infection itself rather than a particular pathogen may be responsible for the onset of these diseasesin recent years there has been a search for an agent responsible for a newly diagnosed disease called chronic fatigue syndrome cfs or myalgic encephalomyelitis unlike the other conditions described above cfs is a rather ill-defined disease and is not recognized by all physicians recent research has discounted the earlier idea that ebv might cause cfs but a variety of other possible virus causes including other herpesviruses enteroviruses and retroviruses have also been suggested in october 2009 it was reported that a novel retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus xmrv might be a possible cause unfortunately subsequent research findings about xmrv proved to be contradictory and confusing and there is no strong evidence for the role of xmrv in cfscan bacteriophages viruses that are only capable of infecting prokaryotic cells play a role in human disease surprisingly the answer is yes shiga toxin stx-producing escherichia coli stec are able to cause intestinal foodborne diseases such as diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis stec serotype o157h7 the hamburger bug has received much attention in recent years stec infections can lead to fatal complications such as hemolyticuremic syndrome as well as neurological disorders the major virulence characteristics of these strains of bacteria are the ability to colonize the bowel a natural trait of e coli and the production of secreted shiga toxins which can damage endothelial and tubular cells and may result in acute kidney failure at least 100 different e coli serotypes produce stx toxins and stec bacteria occur frequently in the bowels of cattle and other domestic animals such as sheep goats pigs and horses meat is infected by fecal contamination usually at the time of slaughter ground meat such as hamburger is particularly dangerous as surface bacterial contamination may become buried deep within the meat where it may not be inactivated by cookingwhat has this got to do with bacteriophages various types of stx are known but they fall into two main types stx1 and stx2 the stx1 and stx2 toxin genes are encoded in the genome of lysogenic lambda-like prophages within the bacteria stimuli such as uv light or mitomycin c are known to induce these prophages to release a crop of phage particles which can infect and lysogenize other susceptible bacteria within the gut accounting for the high prevalence of stec bacteria up to 50 of cattle in some herds recent research has shown that the scandalous overuse of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal husbandry and even antibiotic treatment of infected people can stimulate the production of phage particles and contributes to the increased prevalence of stec bacteria and growing human death toll other bacterial virulence determinants are also encoded by lysogenic phages eg diphtheria toxin streptococcus erythrogenic toxins staphylococcus enterotoxins although the selective pressures that maintain these arrangements are not yet understood emerging bacterial genome sequence data strongly indicate that phages have been responsible for spreading virulence determinants across a wide range of pathogens
the other area where bacteriophages may influence human illness is phage therapythe use of bacteriophages as antibiotics this is not a new idea with initial experiments having been performed unsuccessfully shortly after the discovery of bacteriophages almost 100 years ago appendix 3 however with increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics and the emergence of superbugs immune to all effective treatments this idea has experienced a resurgence of interest although attractive in theory this approach suffers from a number of defectsbacteriophages are quite specific in their receptor usage and hence the strains of bacteria they can infect thus they are narrow spectrum antibacterial agentsbacteria exposed to bacteriophages rapidly develop resistance to infection by downregulating or mutating the phage receptorliberation of endotoxin as a consequence of widespread lysis of bacteria within the body can lead to toxic shockrepeated administration of bacteriophages results in an immune response that neutralizes the phage particles before they can act
it may be however that this is a useful therapy for certain bacterial infections that cannot be treated by conventional means recently it has been shown that bioengineered antibodies can be delivered to the brain by bacteriophage vectors and this novel approach is being investigated for the treatment of alzheimers disease and cocaine addiction
transformation is a change in the morphological biochemical or growth parameters of a cell transformation may or may not result in cells able to produce tumors in experimental animals which is properly known as neoplastic transformation therefore transformed cells do not automatically result in the development of cancer carcinogenesis or more properly oncogenesis is a complex multistep process in which cellular transformation may be only the first although essential step along the way transformed cells have an altered phenotype which is displayed as one or more of the following characteristics
loss of anchorage dependence normal ie nontransformed adherent cells such as fibroblasts or epithelial cells require a surface to which they can adhere in the body this requirement is supplied by adjacent cells or structures in vitro it is met by the glass or plastic vessels in which the cells are cultivated some transformed cells lose the ability to adhere to solid surfaces and float free or in clumps in the culture medium without loss of viability

loss of contact inhibition normal adherent cells in culture divide and grow until they have coated all the available surface for attachment at this point when adjacent cells are touching each other cell division stopsthe cells do not continue to grow and pile up on top of one another many transformed cells have lost this characteristic single transformed cell in a culture dish becomes visible as small thickened areas of growth called transformed fociclones of cells all derived from a single original cell
colony formation in semisolid media most normal cells both adherent and nonadherent cells such as lymphocytes will not grow in media that are partially solid due to the addition of substances such as agarose or hydroxymethyl cellulose however many transformed cells will grow under these conditions forming colonies since movement of the cells is restricted by the medium
decreased requirements for growth factors all cells require multiple factors for growth in a broad sense these include compounds such as ions vitamins and hormones that cannot be manufactured by the cell more specifically it includes regulatory peptides such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor that regulate the growth of cells these are potent molecules that have powerful effects on cell growth some transformed cells may have decreased or may even have lost their requirement for particular factors the production by a cell of a growth factor required for its own growth is known as autocrine stimulation and is one route by which cells may be transformed
cell transformation is a single-hit process that is a single virus transforms a single cell cf oncogenesis which is the formation of tumors and a multistep process all or part of the virus genome persists in the transformed cell and is usually but not always integrated into the host-cell chromatin transformation is usually accompanied by continued expression of a limited repertoire of virus genes or rarely by productive infection virus genomes found in transformed cells are frequently replication defective and contain substantial deletionstransformation is mediated by proteins encoded by oncogenes these regulatory genes can be grouped in several waysfor example by their origins biochemical function or subcellular locations table 71
 cell-transforming viruses may have rna or dna genomes but all have at least a dna stage in their replication cycle that is the only rna viruses directly capable of cell transformation are the retroviruses table 72
 certain retroviruses carry homologues of c-oncs derived originally from the cellular genes and known as v-oncs in contrast the oncogenes of cell-transforming dna viruses are unique to the virus genomethere are no homologous sequences present in normal cells genes involved in the formation of tumors can be grouped by their biochemical functions
oncogenes and proto-oncogenes oncogenes are mutated forms of proto-oncogenes cellular genes whose normal function is to promote the normal growth and division of cells
tumor suppressor genes these genes normally function to inhibit the cell cycle and cell division

dna repair genes these genes ensure that each strand of genetic information is accurately copied during cell division of the cell cycle mutations in these genes lead to an increase in the frequency of other mutations eg in conditions such as ataxiatelangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum
the function of oncogene products depends on their cellular location figure 74
 several classes of oncogenes are associated with the process of signal transductionthe transfer of information derived from the binding of extracellular ligands to cellular receptors to the nucleus figure 75
 many of the kinases in these groups have a common type of structure with conserved functional domains representing the hydrophobic transmembrane and hydrophilic intracellular kinase regions figure 76
 these proteins are associated with the cell membranes or are present in the cytoplasm other classes of oncogenes located in the nucleus are normally involved with the control of the cell cycle figure 77
 the products of these genes overcome the restriction between the g1 and s phases of the cell cycle which is the key control point in preventing uncontrolled cell division some virus oncogenes are not sufficient on their own to produce a fully transformed phenotype in
cells however in some instances they may cooperate with another oncogene of complementary function to produce a fully transformed phenotypefor example the adenovirus e1a gene plus either the e1b gene or the c-ras gene transforms nih3t3 cells a mouse fibroblast cell line this further underlines the fact that oncogenesis is a complex multistep processnot all retroviruses are capable of transforming cellsfor example lentiviruses such as hiv do not transform cells although they are cytopathic the retroviruses that can transform cells fall into three groups transducing cis-activating and trans-activating the characteristics of these groups are given in table 72 if oncogenes are present in all cells why does transformation occur as a result of virus infection the reason is that oncogenes may become activated in one of two ways either by subtle changes to the normal structure of the gene or by interruption of the normal control of expression the transforming genes of the acutely transforming retroviruses v-oncs are derived from and are highly homologous to c-oncs and are believed to have been transduced by viruses however most v-oncs possess slight alterations from their c-onc progenitors many contain minor sequence alterations that alter the structure and the function of the oncoprotein produced others contain short deletions of part of the gene most oncoproteins from replication-defective acutely transforming retroviruses are fusion proteins containing additional sequences derived from virus genes most commonly virus gag sequences at the amino-terminus of the protein these additional sequences may alter the function or the cellular localization of the protein and these abnormal attributes result in transformationalternatively viruses may result in abnormal expression of an unaltered oncoprotein this might be either the overexpression of an oncogene under the control of a virus promoter rather than its normal promoter in the cell or it may be the inappropriate temporal expression of an oncoprotein that disrupts the cell cycle chronic transforming retrovirus genomes do not contain oncogenes these viruses activate c-oncs by a mechanism known as insertional activation a provirus that integrates into the host-cell genome close to a c-onc sequence may indirectly activate the expression of the gene in a way analogous to that in which v-oncs have been activated by transduction figure 78
 this can occur if the provirus is integrated upstream of the c-onc gene which might be expressed via a read-through transcript of the virus genome plus downstream sequences however insertional activation can also occur when a provirus integrates downstream of a c-onc sequence or upstream but in an inverted orientation in these cases activation results from enhancer elements in the virus promoter see chapter 5 these can act even if the provirus integrates at a distance of several kilobases from the c-onc gene the best-known examples of this phenomenon occur in chickens where insertion of avian leukosis virus activates the myc gene and in mice where mouse mammary tumor virus mmtv insertion activates the int gene
transformation by the third class of retroviruses operates by quite a different mechanism human t-cell leukemia virus htlv and related animal viruses encode a transcriptional activator protein in the virus tax gene the tax protein acts in trans to stimulate transcription from the virus long terminal repeat it is believed that the protein also activates transcription of many cellular genes by interacting with transcription factors chapter 5 however htlv oncogenesis ie the formation of a leukemic tumor has a latent period of some 2030 years therefore cell transformation which can be mimicked in vitro and tumor formation which cannot are not one and the sameadditional events are required for the development of leukemia it is thought that chromosomal abnormalities that may occur in the population of htlv-transformed cells are also required to produce a malignant tumor although because of the difficulties of studying this lengthy process this is not completely understoodin contrast to the oncogenes of retroviruses the transforming genes of dna tumor viruses have no cellular counterparts several families of dna viruses are capable of transforming cells table 73
 in general terms the functions of their oncoproteins are much less diverse than those encoded by retroviruses they are mostly nuclear proteins involved in the control of dna replication which directly affect the cell cycle they achieve their effects by interacting with cellular proteins which normally appear to have a negative regulatory role in cell proliferation two of the most important cellular proteins involved are known as p53 and rbp53 was originally discovered by virtue of the fact that it forms complexes with sv40 t-antigen it is now known that it also interacts with other dna virus oncoproteins including those of adenoviruses and papillomaviruses the gene encoding p53 is mutated or altered in the majority of tumors implying that loss of the normal gene product is associated with the emergence of malignantly transformed cells tumor cells when injected with the native protein in vitro show a decreased rate of cell division and decreased tumorigenicity in vivo transgenic mice that do not possess an intact p53 gene are developmentally normal but are susceptible to the formation of spontaneous tumors therefore it is clear that p53 plays a central role in controlling the cell cycle it is believed to be a tumor suppressor or antioncogene and has been called the guardian of the genome p53 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of certain cellular genes notably waf1 which encodes a protein that is an inhibitor of g1 cyclin-dependent kinases causing the cell cycle to arrest at the g1 phase figure 77 because these viruses require ongoing cellular dna replication for their own propagation this explains why their transforming proteins target p53rb was discovered when it was noticed that the gene that encodes this protein is always damaged or deleted in a tumor of the optic nerve known as retinoblastoma therefore the normal function of this gene is also thought to be that of a tumor suppressor the rb protein forms complexes with a transcription factor called e2f this factor is required for the transcription of adenovirus genes but e2f is also involved in the transcription of cellular genes which drive quiescent cells into s phase the formation of inactive e2frb complexes thus has the same overall effect as the action of p53arrest of the cell cycle at g1 release of e2f by replacement of e2frb complexes with e1arb t-antigenrb or e7rb complexes therefore stimulates cellular and virus dna replicationthe sv40 t-antigen is one of the known virus proteins that binds p53 chapter 5 describes the role of large t-antigen in the regulation of sv40 transcription infection of cells by sv40 or other polyomaviruses can result in two possible outcomesproductive lytic infectionnonproductive abortive infection
the outcome of infection appears to be determined primarily by the cell type infected for example mouse polyomavirus establishes a lytic infection of mouse cells but an abortive infection of rat or hamster cells while sv40 shows lytic infection of monkey cells but abortive infection of mouse cells however in addition to transcription t-antigen is also involved in genome replication sv40 dna replication is initiated by binding of large t-antigen to the origin region of the genome figure 512 the function of t-antigen is controlled by phosphorylation which decreases the ability of the protein to bind to the sv40 originthe sv40 genome is very small and does not encode all the information necessary for dna replication therefore it is essential for the host cell to enter s phase when cell dna and the virus genome are replicated together proteinprotein interactions between t-antigen and dna polymerase  directly stimulate replication of the virus genome the precise regions of the t-antigen involved in binding to dna dna polymerase  p53 and rb are all known figure 79
 inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins bound to t-antigen causes g1-arrested cells to enter s phase and divide and this is the mechanism that results in transformation however the frequency with which abortively infected cells are transformed is low about 1105 therefore the function of t-antigen is to alter the cellular environment to permit virus dna replication transformation is a rare and accidental consequence of the sequestration of tumor suppressor proteinsthe immediate-early proteins of adenoviruses are analogous in many ways to sv40 t-antigen e1a is a trans
-acting transcriptional regulator of the adenovirus early genes see chapter 5 like t-antigen the e1a protein binds to rb inactivating the regulatory effect of this protein permitting virus dna replication and accidentally stimulating cellular dna replication e1b binds p53 and reinforces the effects of e1a the combined effect of the two proteins can be seen in the phenotype of cells transfected with dna containing these genes table 74
 however the interaction of these transforming proteins with the cell is more complex than simple induction of dna synthesis expression of e1a alone causes cells to undergo apoptosis expression of e1a and e1b together overcomes this response and permits transformed cells to survive and grow
human papillomavirus hpv genital infections are very common occurring in more than 50 of young sexually active adults and are usually asymptomatic certain serotypes of hpv appear to be associated with a low risk of subsequent development of anogenital cancers such as cervical carcinoma after an incubation period of several decades 500000 new cases of cervical neoplasia are diagnosed every year making this one of the three most common causes of cancer death in women globally hpv is a primary cause of cervical cancer 93 of all cervical cancers test positive for one or more high-risk type of hpv of the 60 hpv types currently recognized only four seem to be associated with a high risk of tumor formation hpv-16 18 31 and 45 once again transformation is mediated by the early gene products of the virus however the transforming proteins appear to vary from one type of papillomavirus to another as shown in table 73 in general terms it appears that two or more early proteins often cooperate to give a transformed phenotype although some papillomaviruses can transform cells on their own eg bovine papillomavirus 1 bpv-1 others appear to require the cooperation of an activated cellular oncogene eg hpv-16ras in bovine papillomavirus it is the e5 protein that is responsible for transformation in hpv-16 and hpv-18 the e6 and e7 proteins are involvedmore confusingly in most cases all or part of the papillomavirus genome including the putative transforming genes are maintained in the tumor cells whereas in some cases eg bpv-4 the virus dna may be lost after transformation which may indicate a possible hit-and-run mechanism of transformation different papillomaviruses appear to use slightly different mechanisms to achieve genome replication so cell transformation may proceed via a slightly different route it is imperative that a better understanding of these processes is obtained there is no positive evidence that adenoviruses or polyomaviruses are involved in the formation of human tumors in contrast the evidence that papillomaviruses are commonly involved in the formation of malignant penile and cervical carcinomas is now very strongin recent years evidence has emerged that p53 and rb are major cellular sensors for apoptosis loss of these protein functions triggers apoptosisthe major anticancer mechanism in cells thus viruses that interfere with these proteins must have evolved mechanisms to counteract this effect see discussion in chapter 6there are numerous examples of viruses that cause tumors in experimental animals stimulating a long search for viruses that might be the cause of cancer in humans for many years this search was unsuccessful so much so that a few scientists categorically stated that viruses did not cause human tumors like all rash statements this one was wrong an estimated 20 of all human cancers worldwide may be caused by viruses although it is convenient to consider human tumor viruses as a discrete group of viruses the six viruses which cause human cancers have very different genomes replication cycles and come from five different virus families hhv-4ebv hbv hcv hhv-8 hpvs htlv the path from virus infection to tumor formation is slow and inefficient only a minority of infected individuals progress to cancer usually years or even decades after primary infection virus infection alone is generally not sufficient for cancer and additional events and host factors such as immunosuppression somatic mutations genetic predisposition and exposure to carcinogens must also play a rolethe role of the htlv tax protein in leukemia has already been described see cell transformation by retroviruses the evidence that papillomaviruses may be involved in human tumors is now well established there are almost certainly many more viruses that cause human tumors but the remainder of this chapter describes two examples that have been intensively studied ebv and hepatitis b virus hbvebv was first identified in 1964 in a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from an african patient with burkitts lymphoma in 1962 dennis burkitt described a highly malignant lymphoma the distribution of which in africa paralleled that of malaria burkitt recognized that this tumor was rare in india but occurred in indian children living in africa and therefore looked for an environmental cause initially he thought that the tumor might be caused by a virus spread by mosquitoes which is wrong the association between ebv and burkitts lymphoma is not entirely clear cutebv is widely distributed worldwide but burkitts lymphoma is rareebv is found in many cell types in burkitts lymphoma patients not just in the tumor cellsrare cases of ebv-negative burkitts lymphoma are sometimes seen in countries where malaria is not present suggesting there may be more than one route to this tumor
ebv has a dual cell tropism for human b-lymphocytes generally a nonproductive infection and epithelial cells in which a productive infection occurs the usual outcome of ebv infection is polyclonal b-cell activation and a benign proliferation of these cells which is frequently asymptomatic but sometimes produces a relatively mild disease known as infectious mononucleosis or glandular fever in 1968 it was shown that ebv could efficiently transform ie immortalize human b-lymphocytes in vitro this observation clearly strengthens the case that ebv is involved in the formation of tumors there is now epidemiological andor molecular evidence that ebv infection is associated with at least five human tumorsburkitts lymphomanasopharyngeal carcinoma npc a highly malignant tumor seen most frequently in china there is a strong association between ebv and npc unlike burkitts lymphoma the virus has been found in all the tumors that have been studied environmental factors such as the consumption of nitrosamines in salted fish are also believed to be involved in the formation of npc cf the role of malaria in the formation of burkitts lymphomab-cell lymphomas in immunosuppressed individuals eg aids patientssome clonal forms of hodgkins diseasex-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome xlp a rare condition usually seen in males where infection with ebv results in a hyperimmune response sometimes causing a fatal form of glandular fever and sometimes cancer of the lymph nodes xlp is an inherited defect due to a faulty gene on the x chromosome
cellular transformation by ebv is a complex process involving the cooperative interactions between several viral proteins three possible explanations for the link between ebv and burkitts lymphoma are1ebv immortalizes a large pool of b-lymphocytes concurrently malaria causes t-cell immunosuppression there is thus a large pool of target cells in which a third event eg a chromosomal translocation results in the formation of a malignantly transformed cell most burkitts lymphoma tumors contain translocations involving chromosome 8 resulting in activation of the c-myc gene which supports this hypothesis2malaria results in polyclonal b-cell activation ebv subsequently immortalizes a cell containing a preexisting c-myc translocation this mechanism would be largely indistinguishable from the above3ebv is just a passenger virus burkitts lymphoma also occurs in europe and north america although it is very rare in these regions however 85 of these patients are not infected with ebv which implies that there are other causes for burkitts lymphoma
although it has not been formally proved it seems likely that either 1 andor 2 is the true explanation for the origin of burkitts lymphomaanother case where a virus appears to be associated with the formation of a human tumor is that of hbv and hepatocellular carcinoma hcc hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and as such is not a single disease because of the central role of the liver in metabolism many virus infections may involve the liver however at least seven viruses seem specifically to infect and damage hepatocytes no two of these belong to the same family see chapter 8 hbv is the prototype member of the family hepadnaviridae and causes the disease formerly known as serum hepatitis this disease was distinguished clinically from infectious hepatitis caused by other types of hepatitis virus in the 1930s hbv infection formerly was the result of inoculation with human serum eg blood transfusions organ transplants but is still common among intravenous drug abusers where it is spread by the sharing of needles and syringes however the virus is also transmitted sexually by oral ingestion and from mother to child which accounts for familial clusters of hbv infection all blood organ and tissue donations in developed countries are now tested for hbv and risk of transmission is extremely low the virus does not replicate in tissue culture which has seriously hindered investigations into its pathogenesis hbv infection has three possible outcomes1an acute infection followed by complete recovery and immunity from reinfection 90 of cases2fulminant hepatitis developing quickly and lasting a short time causing liver failure and a mortality rate of approximately 90 1 of cases3chronic infection leading to the establishment of a carrier state with virus persistence about 10 of cases
there are approximately 350 million chronic hbv carriers worldwide the total population of the world is approximately 6 billion therefore about 5 of the world population is persistently infected with hbv all of these chronic carriers of the virus are at 100200 times the risk of noncarriers of developing hcc hcc is a rare tumor in the west where it represents 2 of fatal cancers most cases that do occur in the west are alcohol related and this is an important clue to the pathogenesis of the tumor however in southeast asia and in china hcc is the most common fatal cancer resulting in about half a million deaths every year the virus might cause the formation of the tumor by three different pathways direct activation of a cellular oncogenes trans-activation of a cellular oncogenes or indirectly via tissue regeneration figure 710
 as with ebv and burkitts lymphoma the relationship between hbv and hcc is not clear cutcirrhosis a hardening of the liver which may be the result of infections or various toxins such as alcohol appears to be a prerequisite for the development of hcc it would appear that chronic liver damage induces tissue regeneration and that faulty dna repair mechanisms result eventually in malignant cell transformation unrelated viruses that cause chronic active hepatitis such as the flavivirus hepatitis c virus hcv are also associated with hcc after a long latent perioda number of cofactors such as aflatoxins and nitrosamines can induce hcc-like tumors in experimental animals without virus infection therefore such substances may also be involved in human hcc cf nitrosamines and npc above
for many years it was thought that hbv integration events were random with regard to their sites within the human genome but when the relationship between fragile sites in the host genome and virus integration events are compared hbv dna is found to integrate within or near many of these fragile regions in most cases integration at a particular site has only been reported for a single or small number of tumors but a closer look shows that individual integration sites alters the expression of different components in the same or redundant biochemical or signaling pathways that support hepatocellular growth and survival important for tumor development most but not all hbv integration events retain the open reading frame encoding the hbx antigen hbxag which suggests that this protein contributes to hcc possibly via mirnas it is possible that all the mechanisms shown in figure 710 might operate in vivo the key risk factor is the development of a chronic as opposed to an acute hbv infection this in itself is determined by a number of other factorsagethe frequency of chronic infections declines with increasing age at the time of infection
sexfor chronic infection the malefemale ratio is 151 for cirrhosis the malefemale ratio is 31hccthe malefemale ratio is 61route of infectionoral or sexual infections give rise to fewer cases of chronic infection than serum infection
until there is a much better understanding of the pathogenesis and normal course of hbv infection it is unlikely that the reasons for these differences will be understood there may be a happy ending to this story a safe and effective vaccine that prevents hbv infection is now available and widely used in the areas of the world where hbv infection is endemic as part of the who expanded programme on immunization this will prevent a million deaths annually from hcc and hbv disease in the futurewhat constitutes a new infectious agent are these just viruses that have never been discovered or are they previously known viruses that have changed their behavior this section will describe and attempt to explain current understanding of a number of agents that meet the above criteria in the century massive and unexpected epidemics have been caused by certain viruses for the most part these epidemics have not been caused by completely new ie previously unknown viruses but by viruses that were well known in the geographical areas in which they may currently be causing epidemic outbreaks of disease such viruses are known as emergent viruses table 75
 there are numerous examples of such viruses that appear to have mysteriously altered their behavior with time with significant effects on their pathogenesisone of the better known examples of this phenomenon is poliovirus it is known that poliovirus and poliomyelitis have existed in human populations for at least 4000 years for most of this time the pattern of disease was endemic rather than epidemic ie a low continuous level of infection in particular geographical areas during the first half of the twentieth century the pattern of occurrence of poliomyelitis in europe north america and australia changed to an epidemic one with vast annual outbreaks of infantile paralysis although we do not have samples of polioviruses from earlier centuries the clinical symptoms of the disease give no reason to believe that the virus changed substantially why then did the pattern of disease change so dramatically it is believed that the reason is as follows in rural communities with primitive sanitation facilities poliovirus circulated freely serological surveys in similar contemporary situations reveal that more than 90 of children of 3 years of age have antibodies to at least one of the three serotypes of poliovirus even the most virulent strains of poliovirus cause 100200 subclinical infections for each case of the paralytic poliomyelitis seen in such communities infants experience subclinical immunizing infections while still protected by maternal antibodiesa form of natural vaccination the relatively few cases of paralysis and death that do occur are likely to be overlooked especially in view of high infant mortality rates during the nineteenth century industrialization and urbanization changed the pattern of poliovirus transmission dense urban populations and increased traveling afforded opportunities for rapid transmission of the virus in addition improved sanitation broke the natural pattern of virus transmission children were likely to encounter the virus for the first time at a later age and without the protection of maternal antibodies these children were at far greater risk when they did eventually become infected and it is believed that these social changes account for the altered pattern of disease fortunately the widespread use of poliovirus vaccines has since brought the situation under control in industrialized countries chapter 6 in 1988 the world health organization committed itself to wiping out polio completely eradication by the year 2000 but the disease has proved to be troublingly resilient in a few of the poorest more corrupt and most dangerous countries and is still hanging on polio eradication is no longer a technical challenge rather it is a political and economic onethere are many examples of the epidemic spread of viruses caused by movement of human populations measles and smallpox were not known to the ancient greeks both of these viruses are maintained by direct person-to-person transmission and have no known alternative hosts therefore it has been suggested that it was not until human populations in china and the roman empire reached a critical density that these viruses were able to propagate in an epidemic pattern and cause recognizable outbreaks of disease before this time the few cases that did occur could easily have been overlooked smallpox reached europe from the far east in 710 ad and in the eighteenth century it achieved plague proportionsfive reigning european monarchs died from smallpox however the worst effects occurred when these viruses were transmitted to the new world smallpox was accidentally transferred to the americas by hernando corts in 1520 in the next two years 35 million aztecs died from the disease and the aztec empire was decimated by disease rather than conquest although not as highly pathogenic as smallpox epidemics of measles subsequently finished off the aztec and inca civilizations more recently the first contacts with isolated groups of eskimos and tribes in new guinea and south america have had similarly devastating results although on a smaller scale these historical incidents illustrate the way in which a known virus can suddenly cause illness and death on a catastrophic scale following a change in human behaviormeasles and smallpox viruses are transmitted exclusively from one human host to another for viruses with more complex cycles of transmission eg those with secondary hosts and insect vectors control of infection becomes much more difficult figure 711
 this is particularly true of the families of viruses known collectively as arboviruses arenaviruses bunyaviruses flaviviruses and togaviruses as human territory has expanded this has increasingly brought people into contact with the type of environment where these viruses are foundwarm humid vegetated areas where insect vectors occur in high densities such as swamps and junglesa classic example is the mortality caused by yellow fever virus during the building of the panama canal at the end of the nineteenth century more recently the increasing pace of ecological alteration in tropical areas has resulted in the resurgence of yellow fever in central america particularly an urban form of the disease transmitted directly from one human to another by mosquitoes dengue fever is also primarily an urban disease of the tropics transmitted by aedes aegypti a domestic day-biting mosquito that prefers to feed on humans some outbreaks of dengue fever have involved more than a million cases with attack rates of up to 90 of the population there are believed to be over 40 million cases of dengue virus infection worldwide each year this disease was first described in 1780 by 1906 it was known that the virus was transmitted by mosquitoes and the virus was isolated in 1944 therefore this is not a new virus but the frequency of dengue virus infection has increased dramatically in the last 30 years due to changes in human activityof more than 500 arboviruses known at least 100 are pathogenic for humans and at least 20 would meet the criteria for emergent viruses attempts to control these diseases rely on twin approaches involving both the control of insect vectors responsible for transmission of the virus to humans and the development of vaccines to protect human populations however both of these approaches present considerable difficulties the former in terms of avoiding environmental damage and the latter in terms of understanding virus pathogenesis and developing appropriate vaccines see earlier discussion of dengue virus pathogenesis rift valley fever virus rvfv was first isolated from sheep in 1930 but has caused repeated epidemics in sub-saharan africa during the last few decades with human infection rates in epidemic areas as high as 35 this is an epizootic disease transmitted from sheep to humans by a number of different mosquitoes the construction of dams which increase mosquito populations increasing numbers of sheep and the movement of sheep and human populations are believed to be responsible for the upsurge in this disease rvfv continues to extend its range in africa and the middle east and is a significant health and economic burden in many areas of africa remaining a serious threat to other parts of the worldthe hantavirus genus bunyaviridae is a particular cause for concern hantaviruses cause millions of cases of hemorrhagic fever each year in many parts of the world unlike arboviruses hantaviruses are transmitted directly from rodent hosts to humans eg via feces rather than by an invertebrate host hantaviruses cause two acute diseases hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps hfrs was first recognized in 1951 after an outbreak among us troops stationed in korea in 1993 hps was first recognized in the united states and a new virus sin nombre was identified as the cause it is now known that at least three different hantaviruses cause hfrs and four different viruses cause hps by 1995 hps had been recognized in 102 patients in 21 states of the united states in seven patients in canada and in three in brazil with an overall mortality rate of approximately 40 these statistics illustrate the disease-causing potential of emerging viruseswest nile virus wnv is a member of the japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the family flaviviridae all known members of this complex are transmissible by mosquitoes and many of them can cause febrile sometimes fatal illnesses in humans wnv was first isolated in the west nile district of uganda in 1937 but is in fact the most widespread of the flaviviruses with geographic distribution including africa and eurasia unexpectedly an outbreak of human encephalitis caused by wnv occurred in the united states in new york and surrounding states in 1999 in this case the virus appears to have been transmitted from wild domestic and exotic birds by culex mosquitoes an urban mosquito that flourishes under dry conditionsa classic pattern of arbovirus transmission wnv rna has been detected in overwintering mosquitoes and in birds and the disease is now endemic across the united states causing outbreaks each summer this rapid spread into a new territory shows that spread did not rely on environmental factors such as climate changethe north american environment was already suitable for the virus once it had been introduced probably via air travel from the middle east
chikungunya virus chikv is transmitted by aedes mosquitoes and was first isolated in 1953 in tanzania chikv is a member of the genus alphavirus and the family togaviridae the disease caused by this virus typically consists of an acute illness characterized by fever rash and incapacitating joint pain the word chikungunya means to walk bent over in some east african languages and refers to the effect of the joint pains that characterize this dengue-like infection chikungunya is a specifically tropical disease but was previously geographically restricted and outbreaks were relatively uncommon the virus remained largely unknown until a major outbreak in 2005 and 2006 on islands across the indian ocean plausible explanations for this outbreak and subsequent spread which has continued include increased tourism chikv introduction into a naive population and virus mutation it is the last of those three factors which seems to be most significant in this case with the outbreak strain showing a single amino acid change in the envelope glycoprotein which allows more effective transmission due to more efficient crossing of the mosquito gut membrane barrier there is every possibility that chikv will continue to extend its territoryplant viruses can also be responsible for emergent diseases group iii geminiviruses are transmitted by insect vectors whiteflies and their genomes consist of two circular single-stranded dna molecules chapter 3 these viruses cause a great deal of crop damage in plants such as tomatoes beans squash cassava and cotton and their spread may be directly linked to the inadvertent worldwide dissemination of a particular biotype of the whitefly bemisia tabaci this vector is an indiscriminate feeder encouraging the rapid and efficient spread of viruses from indigenous plant species to neighboring cropsoccasionally there appears an example of an emergent virus that has acquired extra genes and as a result of this new genetic capacity has become capable of infecting new species a possible example of this phenomenon is seen in tomato spotted wilt virus tswv tswv is a bunyavirus with a very wide plant host range infecting over 600 different species from 70 families in recent decades this virus has been a major agricultural pest in asia the americas europe and africa its rapid spread has been the result of dissemination of its insect vector the thrip frankinellia occidentalis and diseased plant material tswv is the type species of the tospovirus genus and has a morphology and genomic organization similar to the other bunyaviruses chapter 3 however tswv undergoes propagative transmission and it has been suggested that it may have acquired an extra gene in the m segment via recombination either from a plant or from another plant virus this new gene encodes a movement protein chapter 6 conferring the capacity to infect plants and cause extensive damage
in addition to viruses whose ability to infect their host species appears to have changed new viruses are being discovered continually after many years of study three new hhv have been discovered comparatively recently
hhv-6 first isolated in 1986 in lymphocytes of patients with lymphoreticular disorders tropism for cd4 lymphocytes hhv-6 is now recognized as being an almost universal human infection discovery of the virus solved a longstanding mystery the primary infection in childhood causes roseola infantum or fourth disease a common childhood rash of previously unknown cause antibody titers are highest in children and decline with age the consequences of childhood infection appear to be mild primary infections of adults are rare but have more severe consequencesmononucleosis or hepatitisand infections may be a severe problem in transplant patients
hhv-7 first isolated from human cd4 cells in 1990 its genome organization is similar to but distinct from that of hhv-6 and there is limited antigenic cross-reactivity between the two viruses currently there is no clear evidence for the direct involvement of hhv-7 in any human disease but might it be a cofactor in hhv-6-related syndromes
hhv-8 in 1995 sequences of a unique herpesvirus were identified in dna samples from aids patients with ks and in some non-ks tissue samples from aids patients there is a strong correlation 95 with ks in both hiv and hiv2 patients hhv-8 can be isolated from lymphocytes and from tumor tissue and appears to have a less ubiquitous world distribution than other hhvs that is it may only be associated with a specific disease state cf hsv ebv however the virus is not present in ks-derived cell lines suggesting that autocrine or paracrine factors may be involved in the formation of ks there is some evidence that hhv-8 may also cause other tumors such as b-cell lymphomas  ebv as a helper
although many different virus infections may involve the liver at least six viruses seem specifically to infect and damage hepatocytes no two of these belong to the same family the identification of these viruses has been a long storyhepatitis b virus hbv hepadnavirus 1963hepatitis a virus hav picornavirus 1973hepatitis delta virus hdv deltavirus see chapter 8 1977hepatitis c virus hcv flavivirus 1989hepatitis e virus hev 1990gbv-chgv 1995transfusion-transmitted virus ttv 1998

reports continue to circulate about the existence of other hepatitis viruses some of the agents are reported to be sensitive to chloroform ie enveloped while others are not this may suggest the existence of multiple viruses as yet undescribed although this is still uncertain although the viral causes of the majority of cases of infectious human hepatitis have now been identified it is possible that further hepatitis viruses will be described in the future new human retroviruses are being discovered regularly some of them of great significancehtlv 1981hiv 1983xmrv 2006
box 73where do viruses come fromin spite of what a few people believe theres no evidence they come from outer space strike one for the alien abduction theory of virology so either they come from preexisting viruses which change in some way or they were there all the time and we just didnt notice them thats not as stupid as it sounds using molecular clock built into virus genomes researchers have been able to show pretty convincingly that viruses such as measles seemed to pop up just at the point when human populations were big enough to support them by continuous person-to-person spread and so a cow virus rinderpest became a human virus measles like smallpox before them both measles and rinderpest are now on the verge of complete eradication but dont get too excited just as monkeypox seems to be evolving into the old niche that smallpox filled in africa therell be another virus along to replace measles pretty soon
many emergent virus diseases are zoonoses ie transmitted from animals to humans this emphasizes the importance of the species barrier in preventing transmission of infectious diseases and several recent examples illustrate the potentially disastrous consequences that can occur when this is breached strictly speaking many of the arboviruses discussed earlier are zoonotic in humans but their transmission involves an insect vector on occasions viruses can spread from animals into the human population and then be transmitted from one person to another without the involvement of a vectorsevere acute respiratory syndrome sars is a type of viral pneumonia with symptoms including fever a dry cough shortness of breath and headaches death may result from progressive respiratory failure due to lung damage the first sars outbreak originated in the guangdong province of china in 2003 where 300 people became ill and at least five died the cause was found to be a novel coronavirus sars-cov the sars virus is believed to be spread by droplets produced by coughing and sneezing but other routes of infection may also be involved such as fecal contamination where did the sars virus come from coronaviruses with 99 sequence similarity to the surface spike protein of human sars isolates have been isolated in guangdong china from apparently healthy masked palm civets a cat-like mammal closely related to the mongoose the unlucky palm civet is regarded as a delicacy in guangdong and it is believed that humans became infected as they raised and slaughtered the animals rather than by consumption of infected meat after 2003 sars went away but in 2012 a related coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov popped up in the middle east like sars mers is a zoonotic infection probably originating in bats but also found in camels it is not clear whether the emergence of mers is the result of a single zoonotic event with subsequent human-to-human transmission or if the multiple geographic sites of infection across the middle east represent multiple zoonotic events from a common source mers-cov is less infectious than sars-cov but has still infected nearly a thousand people and killed 350 to dateebola virus was first identified in 1976 isolates from central africa appear to be highly pathogenic whereas those from the philippines are less pathogenic for humans the molecular basis for these differences is unknown most ebola virus outbreaks appear to be associated with contact with infected primates however extensive ecological surveys in central africa have failed to show any evidence that primates or any of the thousands of animals plants and invertebrate species examined are the natural reservoir for infection no animal reservoir for the virus has been positively identified but fruit and insectivorous bats support replication and circulation of high titers of ebola virus without necessarily becoming ill as with sars consumption of exotic wild meats called bushmeat particularly primates may be a risk factor the most recent outbreak in west africa which began in 2013 and is still continuing is by far the largest to date having killed over 9000 people but fortunately not the most virulent as the death rate is around 60 compared with over 90 in some smaller previous outbreaksother new zoonotic viruses are frequently discovered fortunately rarely with the serious disease potential of sars or ebola virusalong with the threats from emerging viruses the world currently faces the potential use of viruses as terrorist weapons although this issue has received much media attention the reality is that the deliberate releases of such pathogens may have less medical impact than is generally appreciated many governments devoted considerable resources to the development of viruses as weapons of war before deciding that their military usefulness was very limited the us centers for disease control cdc only recognizes two types of virus as potentially dangerous terrorist weapons smallpox and agents causing hemorrhagic fevers such as filoviruses and arenaviruses emerging viruses such as nipah virus and hantaviruses are also recognized as possible future threats however this is in contrast to a much larger number of bacterial species and toxins the reason for this is that bacterial pathogens would be much easier for terrorist groups to prepare and disseminate than viruses the potential threat from bioterrorism is in reality insignificant in relation to the actual number of deaths caused by infections worldwide each year nevertheless this is an issue which governments are sensibly treating with great seriousnessvirus pathogenesis is a complex variable and relatively rare state like the course of a virus infection pathogenesis is determined by the balance between host and virus factors not all of the pathogenic symptoms seen in virus infections are caused directly by the virusthe immune system also plays a part in causing cell and tissue damage viruses can transform cells so that they continue to grow indefinitely in some but not all cases this can lead to the formation of tumors there are some well-established cases where certain viruses provoke human tumors and possibly many others that we do not yet understand the relationship between the virus and the formation of the tumor is not a simple one but the prevention of infection undoubtedly reduces the risk of tumor formation new pathogenic viruses are being discovered all the time and changes in human activities result in the emergence of new or previously unrecognized diseasessevere acute respiratory syndrome sars was the first major emerging infection identified during the twenty-first century parashar and anderson 2004 a close examination of the outbreakits origins the human sickness and death it caused the national and international responses that occurred and the effect these responses had on asian economiesprovides a clear lesson of the importance of emerging infections at the animalhuman interface and underscores the reasons that emerging infections must be rapidly detected assessed and managed but understanding and mitigating the factors that align to cause emergence could move this current paradigm of detection assessment and response further upstream to prevention of emergence at its sourcesevere acute respiratory syndrome sars was first detected as a severe atypical pneumonia in the guangdong province of china heymann and rodier 2004a it soon became a burden in hospitals where many patients required respiratory support and broad-spectrum antibiotics had no effect as is common with emerging infections particularly when they present with symptoms common to other known infections unsuspecting hospital workers became infected they in turn inadvertently infected family members and infection then spread to the communities in which they lived heymann and rodier 2004bone of these health workersa medical doctortravelled to hong kong where he stayed in a hotel on the same floor as both chinese and international guests some of these hotel guests became infected hypotheses of how they were infected ranged from transmission by aerosolsgenerated by the infected doctor by cough sneeze or vomitin the corridors or through the hotel ventilation system to shared closed environment such as sharing the same lift chan-yeung and xu 2003 some of the infected hotel guests travelled while still in the incubation period and as illness developed and became serious they were admitted to hospital in hong kong singapore canada and vietnam hospitalized they too became the source of infection for hospital workers who in turn served as unintentional amplifiers of transmission to their families and communitiesmolecular and epidemiological investigation suggested that the infection of the index casenever identifiedwas an onetime event walker et al 2012 xu et al 2004 as more information became available it was further hypothesized that this initial infection was due to close contact with an infected animal possibly a civet cat in one of the provinces many live wet animal markets woo et al 2006 the animal host was thought to have been a carrier of a coronavirus that mutated while replicating either in the animal or an infected human in such a way as to cause severe human illness wang and eaton 2007the worlds interconnectivity through air transport facilitated the international spread of sars precautionary travel advisories were made by the world health organization who recommending that people avoid unnecessary travel to countries where outbreaks were occurring and by july 2003 just over 7 months after the sars coronavirus was thought to have emerged human to human transmission had been interrupted and the outbreak was declared over heymann 2006sars resulted in 8422 probable infections and 916 11  deaths chan-yeung and xu 2003 the economic impact of the outbreak on gdp was estimated at us30100 billion from decreased commerce travel and tourism keogh-brown and smith 2008 unlike hiv which is thought to have emerged during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century the sars coronavirus did not become endemic and economic recovery was rapidsars and other emerging infections share a common theme infection is often first detected in human populations in which an emergency containment response occurs most times before the source of infection is understood initial recommendations for control are thus based on what evidence is available from the current outbreak or previous outbreaks caused by similar organisms they are of necessity precautionary and often severe and as for sars the burden and response can cause a wide-ranging negative impact to economiesif it were possible to identify infectious agents carried by wild and domestic animals and to predict if when and where they would emerge in humans and if these animals could then be somehow removed from contact with humans or cleared of infection human sickness and death could be prevented and economies protected studies are underway to identify and characterize infectious organisms in wild animals in geographic sites where emerging infections are known to have occurred in the past grace et al 2012 jones et al 2008 uc davis vet medicine 2009 though it is possible through these studies to understand the variety of infectious agents carried by wild animals prediction of which organisms will emerge in human populations using genetic sequence or other information will likely be very challenging and as yet is not possible biek and real 2010moving further upstream investigation of individual emergence events can identify the risk factors or determinants that align to cause the putative breaches in the animalhuman species barrier if these risk factors could in some way be mitigated the risk of future emergence could be decreased the current paradigm of emergency response and the concurrent attempts at prediction and prevention could then be shifted further upstreamin the case of sars there was a flurry of field research activity in the guangdong province during and just after the outbreak but over time funding decreased and research slowed among the research that was completed was a study of workers in some of the provinces wet markets that suggested that up to 22  1255 had antibody evidence of a coronavirus infection related to the sars coronavirus but that none had a history of severe respiratory symptoms such as were occurring in persons with sars parry 2003 further field research might have helped to better understand the risk factors for emergence but it was not conducted and the epidemiology remains unclearrisk factors for emergence in addition to being a market worker as suggested by the completed study might also include being a hunter of wild animals being a restaurant worker who kills and or butchersprepares wild animal meat for consumption or being a member of a household who buys live or recently killed wild game meat from a wet market weiss and mcmichael 2004 wolfe et al 2007even though evidence is available from just one epidemiological study of sars a series of actions outside the human and animal health sectors could be useful in preventing a future outbreak in the guangdong province from another emerging pathogen daszak et al 2012 wood et al 2012 these include education of all those who come into contact with wild game and domestic animals about how to protect themselves against infection regulation with enforcement of wet markets and eating establishments that does not drive these activities underground but rather ensures safe animal handling and regulation and enforcement of trade between hunters and markets and between markets and those who purchase other activities might be research to determine whether wild animals eg civet cats could be raised commercially under conditions that prevent their infection and risk to humansor further downstream more effective education of health workers about infection control this latter activity would ensure that if other actions such as those above fail to prevent emergence amplification of transmission of emergent organisms could be preventedrisk factors for emergence events caused by a more broad range of organisms might occur in sectors such as plant agriculture community planning water and sanitation human migratory dynamics land-use approaches and the influence of climate and manipulation of natural ecosystems can also amplify known risks and create novel emergence pathways patz et al 2008mitigation of the risk factors for emergence thus requires a focussed and collaborative effort across multiple disciplinesa one health approach as defined by the american veterinary medical association 2008 american veterinary medical association 2012 emergence may occur among humans living and working in small rural farming communities carved out of tropical rain forests savannah mountains and desert that are in close proximity to wild animals or to domestic animals they tend that have been in close proximity to wild animals outbreaks of nipah and ebola reston virus infection in pigs raised in unprotected environments in malaysia and the philippines respectively are an example and both outbreaks spilled over into human populations luby et al 2009 miranda and miranda 2011emergence may occur in larger urban communities where human contact with animals is limited to a few farm animals in close proximity to households to domestic pets or to rodents and other animals that have adapted to the urban environment alirol et al 2011 animals come in contact with humans or other animals as they range eg cows and chickens in parts of asia or browse eg urban foxes and rodents bradley and altizer 2007 the continued high rate of contact between humans and poultry in both smaller backyard farms and larger market system farms continues to permit repeated human exposure to the h5n1 influenza a virus that is endemic in poultry stock children and adults are thought to have been infected by contact with living chickens in backyards and adults have been shown to become infected at some point during the process of raising or slaughteringbutchering chickens kerkhove et al 2011risk factors of emergence in these settings are lacking or inadequate community planning lack of understanding by populations about risks associated with animal contact failure to adopt and adhere to safe farming and slaughterfood processing and preparation practices and failure to maintain sanitation and water infrastructure mitigation across all these sectors would require empowering communities to develop a safer living environment through urban planning developing and maintaining robust water and sanitation infrastructure controlling rodent and other animal populations in both peri-urban and urban areas ensuring safe animal husbandry and providing understanding of risks through community-based education fobil et al 2012risk factors for emergence also occur all along the food chain growing demand for animal-based food has led to the ever more complex food chains that involve live animal processing and trade networks schlundt et al 2004 prevention of infectious disease emergence through the food chain and agricultural system requires understanding of the risks at each step along the pathway from the farm to the fork if infectious agents pass through the food chain and enter foods their impact can be minimized at the final intervention point where animal-derived foods can be prepared carefully in the factory restaurant and household either by cooking or other means to remove or mitigate the risk of infection others must be controlled earlierduring the period animals are being raised during slaughter and during transport collins and wall 2004climate change also appears to be a factor in emergence of human infection rainfall associated with enso el niosouthern oscillation in east africa for example has contributed to frequent outbreaks of rift valley fever as a result of flooding that increases breeding sites of the mosquito vector anyamba et al 2009 the frequency of leptospira transmission from rodents to humans has been shown to increase during events in latin america bangladesh and india following heavy rains and flooding lau et al 2010 lassa fever has also emerged after severe drought in sierra leone when rodents carrying the lassa virus were forced to move closer to humans so that they could survive on agricultural products in cultivated fields or storage facilities contaminating human food supplies bonner et al 2007risk factors related to climate change are multiple and in addition to more robust civil engineering projects to prevent flooding and channel water for irrigation better rodent and wild animal control is required as is continued participation in the negotiation of the international climate control treaty tol et al 2007finally overuse of antibiotics in livestock animals is thought to be a risk factor for the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in animals though there is still much debate within the scientific community as to the contribution of antibiotics in farming systems to the rise of antibiotic resistance the implications on emerging antibiotic resistance in human populations is even less well understood barton 2000 but there is general consensus that farming systems are likely to contribute to the flow of antibiotic residues and resistant microbes in the wider ecosystem and in humans by runoff into water used or consumed by humans especially in economically poor settings where farming communities exist alongside densely populated human environments with poor sanitationsewage systems abraham 2011 segura et al 2009 clearly cross-sector action is required to mitigate these risks using the example of the connection between antimicrobial resistance in both animal and human sectors provides a key lesson for ensuring interdisciplinary planning is incorporated when designing zoonotic control strategiesthere is an opportunity to learn from past emergence events and from those that are presently occurring or will occur in the future application of what has been learned can help shift the paradigm from detection assessment and response to prevention at the source but solid evidence must be available or obtained assessed for risk and used there is a great amount of scientific knowledge about the risk factors of emergence and their mitigation already available from previous investigation and risk assessment much more can be obtained from in-depth study of each emergence event as it occurs research must also take into account human behavior and ensure that populations most at risk clearly understand the measures required to reduce or protect behavior that is high risk many emergence events occur in well-defined geographical areas involving the poorest communities so designing interventions and strategies that are cost-effective and sustainable will be imperativemany of the measures required to shift the paradigm will encounter political barriers especially when commercial benefits are at stake and these barriers will need to be broken down by using clear and easy to understand evidence from cost-effectiveness and of a variety of risk mitigation strategies fig 1 by working together at the animalhuman interface using a one health approach emergence events in the future can be decreased and lives and economies saved
the world health organization who states an emerging disease is one that has appeared in a population for the first time or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range11 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc provides the following definition of emerging infections as infectious diseases whose incidence in humans has increased in the past 2 decades or threatens to increase in the near future have been defined as emerging these diseases which respect no national boundaries include 1 new infections resulting from changes or evolution of existing organisms 2 known infections spreading to new geographic areas or populations 3 previously unrecognized infections appearing in areas undergoing ecologic transformation and 4 old infections reemerging as a result of antimicrobial resistance in known agents or breakdowns in public health measures12
the factors leading to the emergence of infectious diseases have been described13 14 15 16 17 importantly all these authors noted that we will continue to see new and emerging infectious diseases for the foreseeable future recent articles have provided recommendations for preparedness at the health care facility local and national levels10

18 19 20
assessing and managing the threat of an emerging infectious disease requires an understanding of the biology of the pathogen its epidemiology the clinical manifestations of infection the methods of diagnosis and therapies if available10 all health care facilities should have a highly communicable disease plan for agents that are transmitted by droplet or aerosols eg severe acute respiratory syndrome sars mers or are transmitted by contact eg ebola lassa10 detailed information is best found especially early in an epidemic on the web pages of local and state health department the cdc and the who for highly communicable diseases there are 2 major areas that place a health care facility and the personnel at substantial risk for disease acquisition and transmission10 first inadequate screening procedures when patients enter a health care facility can potentially allow transmission from an ill patient to health care personnel other patients or visitors second inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment ppe andor training of health care personnel hcp in proper donning and doffing procedures can increase the risk of exposure for hcpa key focus of this article is to review the transmission routes of new and emerging infectious agents preventing disease acquisition via person-to-person transmission or contact with the contaminated environment depends on rapid and appropriate institution of isolation precautions appropriate hand hygiene and appropriate disinfection of medical equipment devices and the surface environment importantly once the nature of the emerging disease is known ie enveloped virus bacteria fungi nonenveloped virus mycobacteria it is possible to determine the proper antiseptics and disinfectants even in the absence of studies of the exact infectious agent21 for example an enveloped virus eg ebola mers-cov or vegetative bacterium eg cre would be inactivated by any agent active against nonenveloped viruses or mycobacteria it is important to remember that alcohol has reduced activity against nonenveloped viruses eg norovirus and no activity against spores eg clostridioides difficilethe first recognized outbreak of ebola occurred in west africa in 1976 in the 40 years since the initial outbreaks in zaire and sudan 20 outbreaks have occurred22 the largest outbreak occurred in west africa guinea sierra leone and liberia from 2014-2016 and resulted in 28600 cases and 11325 deaths23 importantly in the 2014-2016 outbreak 850 hcp developed confirmed or probable ebola virus disease evd24 the percentage of exposed hcp who developed evd has ranged from 125-7624 the mortality of hcp who developed ebola has frequently exceeded 5024 key concerns for hcp include the low inoculating dose required for transmission high frequency of hcp infections especially in resource poor countries and high mortality as of 2019 an evd outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity in the democratic republic of the congooverall 11 people were treated for ebola in the united states during the 2014-2016 epidemic23 two out of 149 hcp who cared for a patient with evd in the united states developed evd both recovered24
the microbiology epidemiology diagnosis clinical features and treatment of ebola have been reviewed22

25 26 27 28 29 30 ebola is caused by a nonsegmented single-stranded negative rna virus of the family filoviridae there are 5 identified ebola virus species 4 of which are known to cause disease in humans zaire sudan tai forest formerly cote divoire and bundibugyo the fifth reston virus has caused disease in nonhuman primates but not in humans the natural reservoir host of ebola virus remains unknown however the detection of antibodies against ebola and ebola virus fragments in fruit- and insectivore bats are highly suggestive that these animals serve as a reservoirevd is characterized by the sudden onset of fever headache myalgias arthralgias of the large joints and back pain typically 2-3 days after the initial symptoms gastrointestinal symptoms occur including abdominal pain nausea vomiting and diarrhea a macular or maculopapular skin rash may appear on days 5-7 of the disease hemorrhage is less common occurring in only 15-20 of patients terminal cases develop disseminated intravascular coagulation septic shock and multiorgan system failure mortality ranges from 40-90 and depends in part on the infecting strainebola is transmitted person-to-person most commonly through direct contact ie nonintact skin or via mucous membrane contact with blood body fluids eg urine saliva sweat feces vomit breast milk and semen of an ill person or indirectly via objects such as needles and syringes that have been contaminated with body fluids from an ill person table 1
31 less common mechanisms include acquisition from infected fruit bats or nonhuman primates sexual transmission has also been described ebola is not transmitted via the air or by water however in africa it has been acquired by handling bush meat the incubation period of ebola is generally 8-10 days range 2-21 days person-to-person transmission has only occurred from persons with signs or symptoms of evd diagnostic testing is achieved with the use of real time rt polymerase chain reaction pcr on blood32 viral rna is usually detectable by pcr between 3 and 10 days after the onset of symptomspatients with evd should be provided appropriate critical care including fluid and electrolyte replacement oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen status medications to support blood pressure reducing vomiting and diarrhea and to manage fever and pain oral or parenteral nutrition and treating coexisting infections eg malaria if present33 34 although there are currently no antiviral drugs approved by the us food and drug administration fda a number of therapies are under investigation including antibody-based therapies eg convalescent blood products monoclonal antibodies and drugs and small molecules eg ebola virus gene expression inhibitors and ebola virus entry and inhibitors33 34 35 a number of preventive vaccines are currently in clinical trials33 34 35
ebola virus has been isolated by cell culture from multiple body fluids of infected or convalescent patients including blood saliva stool vaginal fluid sweat and urine for days or months after illness36 given the high volume of diarrhea and vomiting and the potential for fomite transmission the frequency of environmental contamination and survival of ebola virus is of high concern several studies have assessed the frequency of contamination within the health care environment of a patient with evd by culture37 39 or rt-pcr37 38 39 40 41 42 although the frequency of environmental contamination was variable all studies reported some environmental samples were positive by rt-pcr contamination was most often demonstrated for blood stained items37 42 and toiletlatrine39 40 42 or objects in close proximity to the patient eg mattress bed rails37 42 samples from ppe eg gloves have tested positive by rt-pcr for ebola virus37 42 viable virus was not isolated in either of the 2 studies that cultured environmental samplesthe environmental survival of ebola virus has been studied using culture-based techniques under a variety of environmental conditions eg temperature humidity in various liquids aerosols and surfaces43 44 45 46 47 48 49 these studies may be summarized as follows first viable ebola can survive in liquids eg liquid media tissue culture media water liquid blood plasma for days to weeks second viable ebola virus can also survive dried on a variety of surfaces eg plastic glass stainless steel polypropylene nitrile bank notes for days to weeks third ebola survives in liquids and on surfaces for a longer duration of time at lower temperatures eg 4c vs 21c fourth although aerosol transmission has not been observed ebola virus has been demonstrated to survive in an aerosol for 3 hours fifth survival of ebola on porous surfaces such as cotton is substantially less than on steel and plastic surfacesusing macaques viable ebola virus was demonstrated to survive in corpses for at least 3 days and rna could be detected for tissues for the entire 10-week study period50 ebola virus was detected by rt-pcr in a deceased patients house 14 days after a patient was buried41 consistent use of appropriate ppe with strict adherence to donning and doffing protocols is crucial to preventing acquisition of evd during patient care28 51 52 a key component of reducing hcp risk is proper training in ppe donning and doffing with ongoing training to maintain competencyebola virus is not inactivated by detergents53 using rt-pcr cook et al54 demonstrated that ebola virus outbreak variants dried with an organic soil load on a stainless steel carrier were inert after 5 minutes exposure to sodium hypochlorite 05 and after 25 minutes exposure to 70 ethanol smither et al55 confirmed the activity of sodium hypochlorite 104 ebola viruses as measured by pcr were inactivated by 075 sodium hypochlorite with 10 minutes contact time in a later study smither et al56 reported that multiple disinfectants ie 05 hypochlorite 10 hypochlorite 5 peracetic acid 70 ethanol were effective against dried cell culture medium containing ebola virus however only 5 peracetic acid consistently reduced ebola virus titers in dried blood to undetectable levels based on the hierarchy of microbial susceptibility to germicides and studies of germicide efficacy the cdc states that any us environmental protection agency- epa registered hospital disinfectant with a label claim for a nonenveloped virus eg norovirus rotavirus adenovirus can be used to disinfect environmental surfaces in rooms of patients with known or suspected evd57
in a systematic review kampf58 reported that 80 ethanol was highly effective against all 21 tested enveloped viruses within 30 seconds a 4-log10 reduction of an ebola strain was achieved in 15 seconds using the following povidone-iodine solutions 4 75 10 and 32 iodine with 78 alcohol59 therefore data suggests that hand antisepsis for skin contamination with ebola virus can be obtained with either povidone-iodine or 70-80 alcohol although proper ppe should always be wornan ultraviolet-light uv-c booth was demonstrated to inactivate 3-log10 bacteriophage ms2 a nonenveloped virus and could be useful for disinfection of contaminated ppe60
the history of mers has been reviewed61 62 63 mers a new viral respiratory disease of humans was first described in 2012 and later discovered to be caused by a novel coronavirus mers-cov lineage 2c  cov the who has reported that between 2012 and december 2018 there were 2279 laboratory-confirmed cases of mers including 806 associated deaths case-fatality rate  353 reported globally64 although cases have been reported from 27 countries the majority of cases ie 1901 have been reported from saudi arabia64 two cases of mers have been reported in the united states both of whom were health care providers who acquired infection in saudi arabia65 no transmission has been reported in the united statesthe microbiology epidemiology and clinical manifestations of mers have been reviewed66 67 68 69 70 71 72 mers-cov a betacoronavirus is a single-stranded positive-sense enveloped rna virus that can cause an acute respiratory illness in humans mers-cov is a zoonotic disease that is transmitted from animals-to-humans dromedary camels hosts for mers-cov have been implicated in direct and indirect transmission to humans although the exact mode of transmission is unknown63 67 71 bats are likely the main mammalian reservoir71
the clinical spectrum of mers infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death typical symptoms of mers include fever cough and shortness of breath pneumonia is common but not always present gastrointestinal symptoms vomiting diarrhea frequently occur risk factors for more severe disease include older age comorbidities eg chronic lung diseases diabetes and immunosuppression the diagnosis is confirmed by a positive rt-pcr assay targeting at least 2 different genomic regions currently there are no specific therapies or vaccines availablemers may be transmitted from person-to-person via direct contact likely due to droplet transmission table 2
 this occurs most commonly when there is close contact such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient thus far no sustained community transmission has been documented studies of family clusters and hcp contacts of patients have reported low frequencies of transmission ie 1-3 however increased transmission has occurred in health care settings with limited infection control procedures importantly mers may be transmitted from an asymptomatic source73 however super spreaders have also been reported74
the epidemiology and prevention of mers in health care settings has been reviewed10

75 76 77 infection prevention strategies have been informed by the multiple reports of outbreaks of mers involving health care facilities78 79 80 81 and by the large outbreak in south korea82 importantly during these outbreaks 20 of cases may have occurred in health care providers factors contributing to intrahospital transmission include 1 the initial symptoms of mers are nonspecific leading to a failure to isolate the patient 2 inadequate compliance with infection control practices 3 inadequate health care facilities eg overcrowding close proximity of patients to cases 4 use of aerosol generating procedures and 5 prolonged viral shedding83
extensive environmental contamination has been documented by both culture and rt-pcr in clinical areas housing mers patients84 85 positive sites have included patient room surfaces eg bed sheets bedrails intravenous fluid hangers anteroom surfaces medical devices eg portable x-ray machines thermometers and air-ventilating equipment touchable surfaces have been found to be contaminated through respiratory secretions from clinically fully recovered patients84 mers-cov has also been detected in air samples in the vicinity of patients85 however 1 large outbreak evaluation failed to demonstrate any transmission via the potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case86
mers-cov has been shown to be recoverable after 48 hours on steel or plastic washers 20c and 40 relative humidity87 further no decrease in stability was observed during aerosolization experiments multiple studies on covs other than mers-cov have demonstrated that these viruses can remain viable for days to weeks on environmental surfaces88 89 survival is enhanced at low temperatures ie 4c vs 20c89
as mers-cov is an enveloped virus it is likely susceptible to epa-registered hospital disinfectants and fda-approved antiseptics studies on inactivation of surrogates for sars-cov mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus demonstrated the following inactivation after 1-minute contact time 1 for transmissible gastroenteritis virus there was a log10 reduction factor of 32 for 70 ethanol 20 for phenolic 23 for ortho-phthalaldehyde 035 for 1100 hypochlorite 40 for 62 ethanol and 35 for 71 ethanol and 2 for mouse hepatitis virus log10 reduction factors were 39 for 70 ethanol 13 for phenolic 17 for ortho-phthalaldehyde 062 for 1100 hypochlorite 27 for 62 ethanol and 20 for 71 ethanol90
guidance from the cdc for managing patients with mers states hcp should perform hand hygiene before and after all patient contact contact with potentially infectious material and before putting on and upon removal of ppe including gloves hand hygiene in healthcare settings can be performed by washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rubs if hands are visibly soiled use soap and water not alcohol-based handrubs91 the cdc further states standard cleaning and disinfection procedures eg using cleaners and water to pre-clean surfaces prior to applying an epa-registered disinfectant to frequently touched surfaces or objects for appropriate contact times as indicated on the products label are appropriate for mers-cov in healthcare settings including those patient-care areas in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed if there are no available epa-registered products that have a label claim for mers-cov products with label claims against human coronaviruses should be used according to label instructions91
the cdc defines cre for surveillance purposes as enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to imipenem meropenem doripenem or ertapenem or documentation that the isolate possess a carbapenemase92 the cdc further elaborates that cre is a phenotypic definition ie based on the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the organism and it includes bacteria that are not susceptible to carbapenems via more than one type of mechanism the cdc specifies that carbapenem resistance mechanisms include the following 1 the production of carbapenemases called carbapenemase-producing-cre enzymes that break down carbapenems and related antimicrobials making them ineffective this includes enzymes like klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and 2 the combination of mechanisms other than carbapenemase production called non-carbapenemase-producing-cre most commonly the production of -lactamases eg ampc in combination with alterations in the bacterias cell membrane eg porin mutations the cdc has reported the following types of cre in the united states ndm oxa48 vim imp and klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase93
the biology epidemiology and management of cre have been reviewed94 95 96 97 recent articles have reviewed newer antibiotic therapies for cre98 99 follow-up of hospitalized cre colonized patients demonstrated that the mean duration of colonic carriage was 1 year100 however hcp are rarely if ever colonized a study of fecal carriage among hcp in a hospital endemic for cre revealed none of 177 evaluated health care providers were colonized with cre101
the main reservoir leading to human cre infections is the human gut person-to-person transmission via direct and indirect contact are the most common mechanisms of transmission table 3
 multiple hospital outbreaks have resulted from contaminated endoscopes especially duodenoscopes102 103 104 these outbreaks have occurred despite all steps in cleaning and high-level disinfection of endoscopes compliant with current guidelines strategies to provide pathogen-free endoscopes have been reviewed104 water sources in the hospital eg faucets wash basins showers toilets especially sinks have been demonstrated to be a reservoir of cre105 107 strategies and success rates of interventions to eliminate cre from water reservoirs have been reviewed105 106 companion animals have been demonstrated to occasionally be colonized with cre108 this is of relevance to health care facilities considering that us health care facilities must permit persons with service animals in the facility and many hospitals permit animal-assisted therapystrategies to manage cre colonizedinfected patients and to control outbreaks in health care facilities have been reviewed109 110 111 both the who112 and the cdc113 provide detailed guidance on methods to control cre the use of bundles to control horizontal transmission of cre in health care facilities have been reviewed114
cre has been isolated from the environment in the vicinity of hospitalized colonizedinfected patients including pillows infusion pumps bedside tables and toilet areas115 116 117 the frequency of recovery has varied among studies but objects closer to the patient are more likely contaminated with 5-15 of samples from bedrails and over bed tables yielding cre115 116 fecal continence is an independent predictor of being a nonspreader of cre117 cre has also been isolated in the environment of long-term care facilities118
havill et al119 reported survival of cre on stainless steel discs for 10 days however weber et al120 reported that 3 species of cre klebsiella enterobacter and escherichia coli survived poorly 85 die-off in 24 hours likely this difference was owing to the fact that havill et al119 used a high inoculum ie 5-7-log10 whereas weber used a low inoculum ie 2-log10 which is similar to the actual amount of cre found on surfaces in the vicinity of patients colonizedinfected with crewith rare possible exceptions antibiotic-resistant bacteria including multidrug-resistant organisms do not have reduced susceptibility to epa-registered germicides121 even when reduced susceptibility to a germicide eg quaternary ammonium compounds by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa has been demonstrated the pathogen has not demonstrated resistance to the use concentration of the germicide121 kanamori et al122 assessed the efficacy of 21 germicides against multiple cre enterobacteriaceae strains at 1-minute contact time and in the presence of 5 fetal calf serum four high-level disinfectants achieved 4-log10 kill for all tested strains but 055 ortho-phthalaldehyde achieved a 24-48-log10 kill depending on the cre strain tested eight disinfectants all achieved a 4-log10 kill among the 9 antiseptics tested 70 ethanol 10 povidone-iodine 2 and 4 chlorhexidine gluconate 70 isopropyl alcohol and 1 chloroxylenol achieved 29-log10 kill against all test cre strains based on this study epa-registered disinfectants and fda-approved antiseptics can be used with assurance for equipmentinstrument high-level disinfection surface disinfection and hand antisepsis a uv-c device for room disinfection has been shown to inactivate 5-log10 cre reduction in direct line of sight and 4-log10 cre reduction in indirect line of sight when used at the recommended cycle time ie 5-10 minutes123 the effectiveness of uv-c for room disinfection was confirmed in another study124

c auris is a novel candida species that was first reported following its isolation from the ear canal of a patient in japan in 2009125 since then c auris has been reported from multiple countries throughout the world126 127 128 the cdc reported that as of january 22 2019 551 cases of c auris had been reported from 12 states with some states ie new york illinois new jersey reporting 100 cases129
c auris is an emerging pathogen that presents a serious global health threat for the following reasons 1 it causes serious infections with a high mortality 2 it is often difficult to identify with standard laboratory methods and can be misidentified in laboratories unless specialized technology is used 3 it is often multidrug resistant intrinsic or rapidly inducible antifungal resistance 4 it is becoming more widespread geographically 5 increasing prevalence 6 biofilm formation 7 persistence in the environment and 8 it has caused multiple outbreaks in health care facilities128 130 131
the microbiology clinical syndromes diagnosis and treatment of c auris have been reviewed127

132 133 134 135 136 genetic analyses have shown that c auris is most closely related to c lusitaniae and c haemulonii although it has a striking divergence from some other candida species127
c auris is often misidentified in conventional diagnostic laboratories using biochemical typing127
c auris most commonly has been misidentified as c haemulonii but also as c famata c sake rhodotorula glutinis r mucilaginosa and saccharomyces boulardii127 137 138 currently accurate identification of c auris can be accomplished by the use of maldi-tof or pcr assays specific for c auris multiple virulence factors have been described133
the most common clinical syndromes reported have been bloodstream infections candidemia wound infections and ear infections129 other clinical syndromes reported have included infections of the respiratory tract central nervous system urogenital system intra-abdominal skin and soft tissues and bone127 patients with c auris infection have almost always presented with underlying illnesses or comorbidities such as diabetes chronic or acute renal failure pulmonary disease immunosuppressive conditions tumor or malignancies liver disease or solid organ transplants137 risk factors for infection have usually included care in an intensive care unit the presence of indwelling central venous catheters arterial lines foley catheters invasive surgical procedures mechanical ventilation and prior or continued exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents132 133 136 mortality rates 30 have been reported for patients with invasive infections127 132 133
at the present time there are no clinical breakpoints for c auris high minimum inhibitory concentrations have been reported to fluconazole and other triazole antifungals such as voriconazole itraconazole and isavaconazole127 132 variability in susceptibility of isolates has also been reported to amphotericin127

c auris has been associated with multiple nosocomial outbreaks especially in the intensive care setting139 140 141 142 143 144 an evaluation of c auris in new york city health care facilities demonstrated epidemiologic links between cases in multiple hospitals and long-term care facilities138 importantly colonization with c auris has been detected at multiple body sites including nares groin axilla and rectum127 prolonged colonization has been reported with c auris detected 3 months after initial isolation and despite multiple negative screens and antifungal therapy136 138
multiple mechanisms for transmission of c auris are likely based on outbreak investigations table 4
 risk factors for colonization or infection have been reported to include contact with patients known to harbor c auris138 145 sharing an environment with a c auris patient or sequential bed occupancy that was previously occupied by a patient with c auris has also been described as a risk145 importantly patients occupying a room that previously housed a patient with c auris have acquired c auris even though the room had been decontaminated prior to occupancy145 an outbreak evaluation found that use of reusable probes for temperature monitoring was associated with a significantly increased risk of c auris colonization with an odds ratio of 680142 transmission of c auris via transplantation of lung from a patient with respiratory tract colonization or infection to the lung transplant recipient has been reported146

c auris has occasionally been isolated from health care providers biswal et al144 reported that c auris was detected on the hands of 4 health care providers 28 although this was likely due to inadequate hand hygiene rather than long-term colonization schelenz et al139 while conducting an outbreak investigation in the united kingdom screened nose axilla groin and throat 250 health care providers for colonization and found only a single person nurse transiently colonized with c auriswidespread contamination of the surface environment has been reported by multiple investigators138 importantly contaminated sites have included sites in the patients room such as surfaces toilets ventilatorrespiratory equipment and sites outside of the patients room such as computer workstations thermometers glucometers housekeeping carts dialysis equipment ultrasound equipment and vital sign machines138 the environmental survival of c auris has been studied144 147 148 in laboratory tests c auris and other candida spp were demonstrated to persist for 7 days on moist or dry steel disks surfaces147 survival on dry linen for up to 7 days has been demonstrated148
c auris cells have been demonstrated to remain viable on plastic surfaces for at least 4 weeks or 2 weeks after they were no longer culturable148
several reviews have included a discussion of the susceptibility of c auris to germicides149 the susceptibility of c auris to germicides ie antiseptics and disinfectants has been studied by several investigators139 144

150 151 152 153 rutala et al153 assessed the germicidal activity of high-level disinfectants andor chemical sterilants and reported that all agents ie 020 peracetic acid 24 glutaraldehyde 065 hydrogen peroxide plus 014 peroxyacetic acid 2 accelerated hydrogen peroxide achieved a 41-log10 reduction of c auris with the exception of 055 ortho- phthalaldehyde that achieved only a 23-log10 inactivation for e coli importantly these in vitro experiments were done under challenging conditions ie 5 fetal calf serum and 1-minute exposure time it is likely that all high-level disinfectants that are currently approved by the fda when used appropriately ie after appropriate cleaning and the manufacturers recommended concentration and duration are effective against c auristhe activity of low-level disinfectants has been evaluated by several investigations152 153 direct comparison between the studies is impeded by the use of different test conditions including test method duration of exposure and presence or absence of proteins such as fetal calf serum the activity of low-level disinfectants has been most comprehensively investigated using the disc-based quantitative carrier test and is summarized in table 5
152 153 importantly both investigators added 5 fetal calf serum to assess germicidal efficacy under more stringent conditions ie presence of proteins importantly quaternary ammonium disinfectants alone were significantly less effective against c auris than other products152 153 some investigators reported that concentrations of sodium hypochlorite 1000 ppm were effective in killing 4-log10
c auris in 3-5 minutes150 151 whereas others153 reported sodium hypochlorite 1200 ppm at an exposure time of 1 minute resulted in only a 16-log10 reduction in c auris it is unclear whether the longer exposure times and lack of protein load led to the high reduction rates reported by abdolrasouli et al150 and moore et al151 however all investigators have reported that a 110 dilution of 525 sodium hypochlorite is effective in killing 4-log10
c auris even with short exposure times ie 1 minute and in the presence of protein152 153 based on current studies the cdc states quaternary ammonium compounds qacs that are routinely used for disinfection may not be effective against c aurisuntil further information is available for c auris cdc recommends use of an environmental protection agency epa-registered hospital-grade disinfectant effective against clostridium difficile spores list k154 cdc further states that when the use of products on list k is not feasible published research has found that the following products led to a substantial reduction 4-log10 of c auris in laboratory testing oxivir tb diversey inc charlotte nc clorox healthcare hydrogen peroxide cleaner disinfectant clorox oakland ca prime sani-cloth wipe pdi inc woodcliff nj and super sani-cloth wipe pdi inc woodcliff nj154
room disinfection with a uv-c device has been investigated for its ability to inactivate candida spp mrsa and clos difficile155
c auris demonstrated substantially less susceptibility to uv-c than mrsa and less susceptibility than c albicans or c glabrata at 10 minutes exposure time155 reductions in c auris and clos difficile were similar at 10 minutes155 with regard to room disinfection devices the cdc states that data on hands-free disinfection methods like germicidal uv irradiation are limited and these methods may require cycle times similar to those used to inactivate bacterial spores eg clostridium difficile when used for c auris154 we recommend that daily and terminal room cleaningdisinfection be done with an agent demonstrated to be effective against c auris the use of a uv-c device for terminal disinfection should be considered as a supplemental methodthe activity of antiseptics against c auris has been studied by several investigators table 6
 there is good agreement that 70 alcohol both isopropyl and ethyl is effective against c auris at 1 minute importantly the activity of alcohol has not been studied at the times used by most health care providers when performing hand hygiene ie 10-15 seconds unfortunately studies on the activity of other important antiseptics such as chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone-iodine have produced variable results table 6 this variability is likely explained by differences in the test conditions including in vitro versus human challenge duration of exposure and presence of a protein load eg fetal calf serum it appears that 10 povidone-iodine would provide adequate skin antisepsis if applied for 1 minute using a panel of c auris clinical isolates kean et al156 screened them for their planktonic and sessile susceptibilities to skin disinfection challenge using povidone-iodine chlorhexidine gluconate and hydrogen peroxide c auris biofilms displayed increased tolerance to antisepsis compared with planktonic cells analysis using a complex biofilm model demonstrated reduced susceptibility against clinically relevant concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate 005 and hydrogen peroxide 3 with eradication achieved only with povidone-iodine 10 as noted by forsberg et al136 whether topical antiseptics might reduce the burden of c auris on the skin and therefore provide a potentially valuable tool for infection prevention remains unclear the cdc states that when caring for patients with c auris healthcare personnel should follow standard hand hygiene practices which include alcohol-based hand sanitizer use or if hands are visibly soiled washing with soap and water wearing gloves is not a substitute for hand hygiene154
what do we know about this virus what do physicians and other clinicians need to do where can one obtain the most reliable advicehuman coronaviruses constitute a large family of viruses that usually cause mild to moderate upper respiratory illnesses in people such as the common cold1 initial characterization of the coronavirus occurred in the 1960s when tyrell and bynoe described passage of a virus named b814 at the time as a group of viruses causing a large proportion of respiratory tract infections in humans2 coronavirus infections have since been described in multiple animal species as well including bats camels cattle cats chicken dogs pigs rabbits rats and turkeys bats account for the largest group of animal reservoirs3
there are many perhaps even hundreds of coronaviruses circulating in animals with what is occasional spread to humans and termed  spill over events that then cause more serious illness in humans with worsened outcomes yielding significant morbidity and high mortality rates4 coronaviruses are medium sized positive stranded rna viruses that are named for the crown-like characteristic structures seen in electron micrographs the characteristic spikes are formed by heavily glycosolated s protein viral replication develops in the cytoplasm of infected cells budding into cytoplasmic vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in cellular destruction and death5
while many different coronaviruses exist seven types are known to cause disease in humans6 four of these viruses 229e oc43 nl63 and khu have been associated with mild disease symptoms three of the viruses have been associated with causation of more severe illnesses and worse outcomes in humans the first of these to appear was named severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and was first reported in asia in february 2003 although retrospectively it was present in 20027 it subsequently disappeared in 2004 this was followed by middle east respiratory syndrome mers which was first noted in saudi arabia in 2012 and is currently still found in camels8 the third being covid-19 and is caused by the sars-cov-2 that was first described in wuhan china in december 20199
among older adults coronaviruses have been associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute asthma events in both adults and children as well as community acquired pneumonia coronaviruses have also been associated with other diseases including enteric manifestations causing abdominal pain diarrhea nausea and vomiting as well as other symptoms such as chills fever headache and myalgia other rare conditions including acute and chronic neurologic disease have been reported10
as there is currently no available specific pharmacologic therapeutic or vaccine supportive care is the mainstay of treatment preventive strategies are focused on infection control procedures such as washing hands careful disposal of material containing nasal and oral secretions and the use of disinfectants to clean frequently used surfaces strategies to prevent infection with the new coronavirus from world health organization who and the center for disease control cdc recommend following these precautions for avoiding covid-19avoid large events and mass gatheringsavoid close contact about 6 feet with anyone who is sick or has symptomskeep distance between yourself and others if covid-19 is spreading in your community especially if you have a higher risk of serious illnesswash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 alcoholcover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze throw away the used tissueavoid touching your eyes nose and mouth if your hands arent cleanavoid sharing dishes glasses bedding and other household items if youre sickclean and disinfect surfaces you often touch on a daily basisstay home from work school and public areas if youre sick unless youre going to get medical care avoid taking public transportation if youre sick

compiled an extensive list of publications that may also be useful to physicians and other clinicians and can be found at elseviers novel coronavirus information centercommunicable diseases are the greatest disease threat facing humankind diseases previously considered eradicated are re-emerging and new viruses are emerging due to increased human population and accelerated global travel local outbreaks become instant global threats despite technological advances in medicine devastating communicable diseases such as ebola severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or avian influenza continue to surface and ravage humankind the 1918 influenza outbreak killed at least 20 million people in about 24 weeks but hivaids has killed more than 25 million since 1981 and continues its march around the globe researchers are concerned that an avian influenza outbreak could kill many more people when it emerges because of the absence of immunity and human travel interaction patternsdiseases are not distributed uniformly in space throughout the world certain locations have diseases that are not present in others even when a disease occurs in different locations the rate of occurrence frequently varies between places some areas have high rates of a particular disease than others or may not have that disease at all generally tropical regions with warm humid climates tend to facilitate the proliferation of disease causing organisms or insects and animals that carry such disease similarly physical environmental characteristics such as soil type and the mineral content of soils and rock which vary from one location to another may also inhibit or encourage disease swampy vegetation in low-lying areas of the tropics is ideal for the proliferation of mosquitoes and thus endemic malaria finally cultural practices including diet behavior and occupation also contribute to geographic variations in health and diseasecommunicable diseases diseases that are easily transmitted from one person to another also vary spatially geographic differences such as levels of crowding sanitation and health practices such as defecation or even sexual behavior contribute to these differences medical geographers study the spatial differences in disease occurrence how diseases spread across geographic space and also the spatial distribution of health care resources they seek to answer the question of who is getting what diseaseshealth care where and why this article examines the geographic distribution of leading communicable or infectious causes of disease and death we begin with one basic conceptual framework commonly used to account for spatial variations in diseasethe disease ecology model attributes spatial variations in disease to three major variables  environment genetics and behavior environment is a broad context and includes not just the physical environment of livelihood environmental pollution eg including indoor pollution such as radon and water quality but also the socioeconomic environment including relative deprivation healthcare quality and access land mines and the political economic context for example unlike canada where universal access to care based on need is provided for all citizens in the united states access to care depends on ability to pay thus immunization is more easily available in canada than in the us and this influences the infant mortality rate and life expectancy in the two countries genetic predisposition is important particularly for degenerative diseases people with light skin pigmentation are more prone to skin cancer than others with a darker pigmentation similarly recent research suggests that ashkenazi jewish women have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to other women the human genome project is not only identifying genes responsible for several serious diseases such as parkinson but also developing exciting new and effective therapies for them human behavior is the final component in the disease ecology model put simply behavior facilitates or inhibits disease unhealthy behavior traits such as excessive alcohol consumption overeating and failure to exercise unsafe sexual practices and smoking are associated with various diseases in contrast regular exercise and other positive health behaviors including proper diet enhance health and prevent disease thus spatial variations in africas environment including widespread poverty that promotes extra-marital and transactional sex poor healthcare environment with limited access to antiretrovirals cultural practices such as circumcision widow inheritance and preference for unsafe sexual practices combine with other factors to make hivaids rates the highest in the world similarly variations exist between and within countries besides vertical transmission from mother to child genetics is not as important in hiv transmission  all humans are genetically susceptiblethe disease ecology framework has been criticized for its positivist philosophy dearth of social theory neglect of social divisions such as race gender disability and sexuality and the trivialization of the role of place and locality for example kearns called on medical geographers to incorporate social theory but mayer and meade and paul chastised the supposed call for discarding disease ecology in favor of narrow health geography current work includes much broader frameworks such as vulnerability theory and political ecologyeasily the worlds worst communicable disease hivaids has affected every country but sub-saharan africa has experienced the worst devastation the caribbean and parts of eastern europe and asia also have high rates even in the united states where rates are much lower increasing numbers of people are living with hivaids and prevalence is particularly high among subpopulations such as blacks men who have sex with men and intravenous drug usersat the end of 2006 an estimated two-thirds of the worlds 40 million cases were in sub-saharan africa a region with 11 of the worlds population and 91 of the worlds children living with the disease hiv prevalence rates vary widely between african countries ranging from a low of less than 1 of the adult population in senegal and somalia to 1520 in south africa and zambia a few countries have even higher prevalence rates  swaziland with 334 is the highest botswana has 241 while lesotho and zimbabwe have 232 and 201 respectively at the end of 2006 generally west africa has much lower rates than southern africa besides cote divoire which has an adult rate of 71 most west african countries have lower than 5 in east africa prevalence exceeds 6 in uganda kenya and tanzaniadue to cost antiretroviral medications reach only a small fraction of africans who need them rwanda and namibia serve about 70 kenya malawi and zambia range between 25 and 45 but ghana nigeria and mozambique serve fewer than 20 as a result life expectancy has fallen across the region and averaged 47 years in 2005women are more vulnerable and thus more severely affected than men and at much younger ages the major driving forces of hivaids include poverty and economic inequality which necessitate transactional sex cultural practices such as widow inheritance misguided national policies and neglect such as in south africa where the government disputing the link between hiv and aids refused to provide antiretrovirals to prevent vertical transmission of the disease global efforts to control the disease through improved testing and supply of inexpensive medications and other programs will help those who need care most in african countriestuberculosis tb is an airborne respiratory disease caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis tb bacilli are propelled into the air when people who are sick with pulmonary tb cough sneeze talk or during normal breathing inhaling even a small number of these airborne bacilli is enough to cause infection most exposed persons never become ill but develop latent tuberculosis an important minority 510 progress from latent to active tuberculosis due for example to immunosuppression from co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus hivdespite treatment advances tuberculosis remains an uncontrolled communicable disease worldwide worldwide about nine million persons are diagnosed and two million die yearly from tuberculosis particularly in developing countries currently more than 90 of the global tuberculosis burden occurs within developing countries due to among other things widespread hivaids infection malnutrition crowding medication shortages and poor healthcare programs in developed countries newly diagnosed tb occurs most frequently among foreign-born immigrants and native-born homeless who typically live in extremely crowded and unsanitary conditions for example in germany and france immigrants are 3 times and 6 times respectively more likely to be diagnosed with tb than are native-born personsin canada while comprising only 18 of the canadian population the foreign born accounted for 65 of all reported tb cases in 2000 in the us 543 of tb cases were found in foreign-born persons immigrants entering the us and canada from countries with high tuberculosis incidence have a higher risk of latent or active tuberculosis when they arrive thus states or provinces with high immigrant populations have high rates for example british columbia ontario and quebec canadas leading immigrant destinations accounted for 87 of foreign-born tuberculosis cases moreover a disproportionate number of the cases were reported from large cities with significant ethnic and minority concentrations such as toronto montreal and vancouver in the us five states  california new york florida texas and illinois  account for 66 of the total foreign-born tuberculosis cases reported similar to the canadian pattern major us cities including new york city los angeles san francisco san diego miami atlanta and houston all report disproportionately high numbers of cases from immigrant neighborhoodsmoreover the origin of foreign-born tuberculosis cases reported from each of these states was largely homogenous revealing established migration in 2003 new york reported approximately 64 of the us total of tuberculosis cases born in the dominican republic florida reported 60 of cases born in cuba texas and california reported 60 of cases born in mexico and minnesota reported 55 of somali born casespolio is a viral disease that is usually spread through fecal contaminated water and food or oral human to human contact early symptoms of infection include fatigue fever vomiting headache and pain in the neck and extremities the virus invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis in hours the incubation takes between 3 and 30 days but a person begins to shed the virus in their stool 710 days before and 36 weeks after the onset of symptoms a small minority of cases 051 of cases result in paralysis and while polio can affect people at any age at least 50 of cases occur in children 35 years old most people infected with the polio virus have no symptoms at all but continue to spread the highly contagious virus for weeks thus once introduced polio spreads very quickly and usually infects many people before an outbreak is detectedonce considered almost eradicated worldwide polio has resurged not only in the six countries with endemic polio nigeria india pakistan niger afghanistan and egypt but transmission has been reestablished in an additional six countries burkina faso central african republic chad cte divoire mali and sudan despite massive efforts total eradication continues to be an elusive goal the global campaign to eradicate polio by 2005 suffered a severe setback when parts of northern nigeria rejected the polio vaccine because muslim clerics claimed that the vaccine causes infertility and spreads hivaids and cancer from those few states polio spread through large parts of the country neighboring countries and eventually to saudi arabia through nigerian muslims on pilgrimage to mecca indonesian muslims who were exposed during their pilgrimage in mecca carried the disease with them to indonesia where it became reestablished polio reminds us that global cooperation is critical for controlling communicable diseasessexual behavior of travelers is contributing to spatial mixing of different strains of sexually transmitted pathogens worldwide consequently sexually active travelers risk being infected with new strains of known sexually transmitted infections an often cited example is the current endemicity of quinolone-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae qrng in california and hawaii this pathogen was originally common only in asia according to the cdc persons who engaged in sexual activity abroad first introduced these strains of qrng in the us but now incidence is no longer related to travel whereas less than 1 qrng isolates were identified between 1999 and 2001 94 were reported in 2005 and in people with no history of travel in short travel whether in the form of short-term recreational travel or permanent migration facilitates the spatial spread of disease consequently the spatial distribution of immigrant neighborhoods and ethnic islands may provide an important key to understanding the geography of disease diffusionsevere acute respiratory syndrome sars illustrates how migration facilitates the spatial spread of disease from its source guandong province in south china sars spread initially to hong kong from where it diffused worldwide when it was over a total of 8439 probable cases and 812 deaths had been identified from 30 countries the devastation of sars was not uniformly distributed however but followed a path of spatially linked places and peoples facilitated by international travelcanadians returning from asia imported sars into canada the first cases involved a canadian family of hong kong descent who live in toronto a 78-year-old woman and her husband traveled to hong kong and stayed at a hotel where a cluster of 13 persons with suspected or probable sars are known to have stayed two days after returning home the woman developed what is now known as sars and died several family members who had close contact with the index case then developed sars symptoms and one was later admitted to a hospital that subsequently became the epicenter for the toronto outbreak sars killed 44 canadians caused illness in hundreds more paralyzed a major segment of ontarios healthcare system for weeks and put more than 25 000 residents of the greater toronto area in quarantinesome communicable diseases originate in animals and occasionally mutate to infect humans an excellent example is avian influenza it occurs naturally among wild birds they shed it in their saliva nasal secretions and feces but usually do not get sick from it domesticated birds including chickens ducks and turkeys become infected through contact with contaminated surfaces birds or their secretions human contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces produces infection but human to human spread of avian influenza viruses is rare typically limited and unsustained symptoms of avian influenza in humans include fever cough sore throat muscle aches eye infections severe respiratory diseases and other life-threatening complications human influenza virus refers to those subtypes currently h1n1 h1n2 and h3n2 that spread widely among humans in the united states human flu kills 36 000 people and hospitalizes more than 200 000 people every yearthe current communicable disease of global concern is caused by influenza a h5n1 virus endemic in birds h5n1 virus is contagious and often deadly while it usually does not infect people human infections have occurred usually in people with direct close contact with infected poultry or contaminated surfaces about 60 of the human cases have died mostly as healthy children and young adults because humans have little pre-existing natural immunity to h5n1 infection it is feared that a pandemic will results if these h5n1 viruses gain the ability for efficient and sustained transmission among humans while there has been some human-to-human spread of h5n1 it remains limited the h5n1 virus responsible for recent human illness and death in asia is resistant to two common antiviral flu medications and currently no commercially available vaccine to protect humans existsresearch continues into new vaccines to counter a possible h5n1 pandemic but unfortunately current vaccine production methods require an outbreak before an effective vaccine can be developed and even then it takes between 5 and 7 months to avoid a global pandemic of h5n1 or other virus new vaccine technologies are required to respond quickly and effectively to new challenges of communicable disease outbreaksever since the seminal work of dr john snow mapping has been a key tool in fighting communicable diseases thanks to recent technological advances particularly in gis the role of mapping in disease tracking surveillance and control has burgeoned recent examples include west nile virus and tuberculosis control cromley and mclafferty provide an excellent overview of gis applications in public health generallyone particularly fascinating recent development is mapping genotypes of communicable disease each disease causing organism has a specific phenotype and the species members have a more unique genotype tools exist for separating and categorizing disease organisms with these more unique genotypes into groups based on their genetic structure isolates two people with identical or matching isolates indicate recent transmission from a common source unique isolates indicate remote transmission from a different source analyzing and mapping these genotypes allows researchers to distinguish between not just disease species phenotype but also locate areas with high incidence and different strains of the disease including recent versus remote transmission of disease areas with high rates of clustered genotypes indicate ongoing transmission ie an outbreak whereas multiple unique isolates indicate infections that were acquired elsewhere are importedmoonan et al based a recently successful tb intervention on geographically targeted screening of clustered tuberculosis isolates because it assumed that persons with clustered strains of disease from geographically related areas represent ongoing community transmission that can be identified and interrupted through treatment the study focused resources on zip codes with high incidence and clustered isolates during the 28-month intervention the number of cases of tuberculosis decreased from 285 cases per 1000 screenings to 24 cases per 1000 the rate of developing latent tuberculosis infection fell from 143 to 22 per 100 person-years of exposure the intervention was successful because it distinguished between high incidence areas with high and low levels of clustered strains and deployed resources not just on the basis of incidence but on the basis of genotype since unique isolates represent remote transmission location-based screening in areas with high rates of unique isolates would be less likely to identify either persons with active tuberculosis or recent acquired latent tuberculosis infection and thus not as cost-effectivecommunicable diseases remain a major threat to humankind effective surveillance and response remain our best protection against these deadly threats unfortunately surveillance remains poor and rudimentary in the most vulnerable countries where outbreaks are most likely strengthening the health and surveillance systems of poor developing countries is critically needed in a globalized world because communicable diseases do not respect political boundaries

sleeping sickness trypanosomiasiscommon in sub-saharan africa trypanosomiasis is a parasitic disease transmitted by two vectors tsetse flies for the african trypanosomiasis and triatomes kissing bugs for the american trypanosomiasis chagas disease the parasite is responsible for the african sleeping sickness two species of the parasite are responsible for african sleeping sickness t which causes acute infection and t which causes chronic disease
hivthe current hiv pandemic has resulted in approximately 15 million deaths in 2013 with approximately 35 million people infected globally sub-saharan africa carries the huge burden of the disease spread through body fluids including sexual transmission hiv has spread worldwide about 32 million children were living with hiv in 2013 mother to child transmission has resulted in children being infected with the virus at birth or during breast feeding with no vaccine andor cure at present abstinence andor practicing safe sex through the use of condoms are the ways of preventing infection being faithful to one partner is another way of preventing the spread of the disease if both partners are hiv negative to suppress the hiv virus andor stop the progression of the disease anti-retro viral treatment is available for pregnant women children born from hiv positive mothers and for people living with the virus  whouse of antiretrovirals for treatment and prevention of hiv infection nd
severe acute respiratory syndrome  sarsan emerging viral disease that was first reported in asia in 2003 sars is caused by  spread through droplets the disease can rapidly spread within a country and across borders people of all ages are at risk of the disease there has been no other diagnosis of the disease since 2004 the disease is believed to have been of zoonotic origin sars is a good example of how infectious diseases can spread rapidly board 2013 whosevere acute respiratory syndrome sars nd
haemorrhagic fevera viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus  the disease is endemic in the tropics and both children and adults are at high risk of contracting the disease there is no treatment for the disease currently and the only way to prevent the spread of the disease is by controlling the mosquito vector a vaccine against all four dengue serotypes has currently passed phase 3 trials villar et al 2015 dengue is one of the neglected tropical diseases in the world causing over 390 million dengue infections every year with 128 countries at risk of the disease dengue fever is present in the americas south-east asia and the pacific with recent outbreaks occurring in europe france and croatia in 2010 portugal in 2012 and the united states florida in 2013 the threat of the disease is increasing and it is a global threat with the climate change that is being experienced globally vectors are now able to reach and survive in areas that they have never been reported before aubry et al 2012 brady et al 2012 whodengue nd
the success of the pathogens in causing diseases is attributed to among others the ability of the pathogens to evade the host immune system in order to survive the human immune system the pathogens have developed strategies that have allowed for their survival and perpetuation these include virulence genetic modifications that allow the pathogen to evade the host immune system and adaptation of pathogens to new environments
research on infectious disease has a resulted in new vaccines and new diagnostic tools that have enabled understanding the pathogenicity and epidemiology of these disease and human developmentinfectious disease outbreaks have led to new research understanding of the disease causing pathogens and the ability of the human body to fight and survive diseasetoday there are vaccines to some infectious diseases and yet there are still others where vaccines andor treatments are not yet available despite this fact the human population has been able to find ways of controlling and preventing the spread of these diseasesfor easy understanding infectious diseases can be classified according to their modes of transmissiondiseases that are transmitted through contaminated food and water are known as food-borne and waterborne diseases respectively these diseases can be caused by bacteria viruses protozoans metazoans worms and parasites that have contaminated food andor water the food and water can be contaminated through faeces or urine that has found its way into a water source if the food or water is consumed without proper treatment
the affected individuals could get sickwashing fruit and vegetables with contaminated water can result in disease causing agents from the water attaching themselves to these items and consumption of such may result in infection this mode of transmission is also known as the faecaloral transmission another common mode of transmission is the oral transmission this is where a person consumes food andor water contaminated by disease causing agentsa person may also be infected through what is known as the hand to mouth  this is where an individual contaminates food or water that is being consumed through hands that are contaminated by disease causing agents for example if an individual has diarrhoea caused by bacteria or viruses and does not wash hands properly after using the toilet the individual can contaminate the food with the bacteria andor virus by touch thereby spreading the disease also if a person is taking care of someone who has diarrhoea and does not wash hands properly after handling contaminated clothes or cleaning up faecal material that person can contaminate the food andor water by touch resulting in spread of the disease this also applies to touching vomit that is contaminated by disease causing agentsin rural areas of most developing countries where sanitation is poor diarrhoeal infections are a common occurrence in sub-saharan africa and most parts of south-east asia lack of toilets has led to people defecating in water andor in the bush when the rain comes these excreta are washed away and end up in unprotected wells and other water sources such as rivers domestic use of contaminated water may result in infectionin parts of the world where the diet includes eating raw or undercooked food there is a high risk of infection by pathogens consumption of raw or undercooked pork can result in infections of tapeworm  tapeworm infections can result in a serious disease known as cysticercosis cysticercosis mainly affects the health and livelihoods of subsistence farming communities in developing countries of africa asia and latin america cysticercosis infections can lead to epilepsy and death in humans it also reduces the market value of pigs and cattle and makes pork and beef unsafe to eat this disease causes loss of human labour through sickness or death which directly affects the livelihoods of communities in affected regions reduction of market value of infected livestock affects the households income which in turn could affect their livelihoodsin areas close to water bodies where livelihoods include fishing and other vocations that involve spending time in slow moving water populations are at risk of parasitic infections these include diseases such as bilharzia where standing and swimming in water infested with disease causing parasites could result in an infectionthe beautiful tropical paradises around the globe are a source of great beauty and relaxation at the same time the tropics are a habitat of diseases that are commonly called tropical diseases most of these tropical diseases are contagious that is they can spread from one individual to another directly through contact or indirectly through vectors a vector is any agent human animal or microbe that carries and spreads an infectious disease pathogen from one individual to another the most common vectors are insects these include mosquitoes flies ticks lice fleas mites and sandflies most of these vectors feed on blood and transmit the pathogen through their saliva and mouthparts as they feed the disease pathogen is therefore introduced directly into the bloodstream other vectors such as triatomes introduce pathogens through their excreta the triatomes defecate during feeding and if their excreta gets into an open wound or cut that may result from the host scratching in response to a bite from the triatome bug the pathogen is then introduced into the host human lice have been known to transmit deadly diseases including typhus fournier et al 2002 mokrani et al 2004 the lice introduce the pathogens during feeding on human blood ticks have also been known to transmit pathogens responsible for rickettsia infections in sub-saharan africa raoult et al 2001these insect vectors transmit diseases by biting a person infected with the disease and thereafter biting another person during their next meal this cycle is very critical as it is challenging to control the spread of the disease without human intervention this intervention includes humans protecting themselves from insect bites controlling vector breeding sites and personal hygiene
infectious diseases transmitted by contact include ebola hiv cholera and skin infections such as scabies and yaws disease these diseases can be spread through person-to-person contact parasitic skin diseases contact with contaminated material such as clothes fluids from an infected person cholera ebola andor a corpse ebola as well as sexual transmission as in the case of hiv
infectious diseases spread through droplets include measles tb influenza common colds and sars these diseases easily spread in closed environments and overcrowded areas

incubation stage this is the time between the exposure to the pathogen and the appearance of the first signs and symptoms in an individual during the incubation period the pathogen establishes itself within the human host during this period the host does not show any signs or symptoms of illness
prodormal period though not all infectious diseases have this period this is the time that general signs and symptoms start to appear in the infected host these symptoms are general hence cannot be directly linked to a specific disease
illness period during this time the specific signs and symptoms for a disease start to show the infected individual is clinically ill and may manifest mild andor severe symptoms of disease
decline period due to the host immune system andor treatment the signs and symptoms of disease start to decline at this stage the infected individual is now progressing into recovery
convalescence stage this is the recovery period the signs and symptoms of disease have disappeared and infected individual is showing signs of recovery
it was a tradition that was passed on from generations in rural villages of sub-saharan africa to boil water before drinking in order to kill microorganisms most people would boil drinking water because that is what they saw their mother do as they were growing up while others knew that they were boiling the water in order to kill microorganisms that could have contaminated the water with time those who did not understand why they had to boil their drinking water would relax and stop especially if there was not enough firewood to perform the task those who knew that they had to boil their water to kill microbes worked hard to do so even when there was little firewoodboiling water is one of the easy ways of making water safe to drink it is a method that can be easily adopted by rural population who face the problem of lack of safe drinking waterthis is one of the methods taught by health workers from village to village in developing countries these health workers explain the dangers of drinking water from the water sources be it a river lake well or borehole without boiling and the importance of filtering the water before consumption the filtration method removes tiny soil particles that are mixed with the water especially in the rainy season during the rainy season water from rivers and collects soil particles and debris filtering the water through a cottonmuslin cloth helps remove these particles in order to kill microorganisms the water needs to be boiled and again re-filtered using another clean cloth rendering it ready for consumptionthere are also other water filtration methods that are carried out in many parts of developing countries depending on the available materials in the respective communities it is interesting to see that these methods are used as survival methods in the bush in developed countries while in most parts of developing countries this is a way of life people have to do this everyday to have safe drinking water the challenges are enormous from time to time people drink water from unsafe sources without any treatment and sometimes they do get sick if the water is contaminated in the worst case scenario cholera outbreaks are common in the rainy season due to surface run-off which collects faecal matter which is then deposited in unprotected water sources that people use on a daily basis and if the water is not properly treated an outbreak is eminentin recent years in some developing countries doses of chlorine are commercially available the bottles come with directions on how to treat the water this method is safe and fast but there is need for training on how to use it since this is a commercial product only those who can afford use it making it a luxury for rural populations living on less than a dollar per daygovernments in most developing countries are working hard together with ngos to provide safe drinking water to the rural populations at large the efforts are commendable but the burden is enormousin sub-saharan africa cholera outbreaks are a common occurrence these outbreaks have often been controlled and the sick people treated in the affected nations due to the frequency of cholera and the campaigns that are carried out to bring awareness of the disease many people are able to seek medical attention but there are still fatalities in most cases the major challenge is transportation because some villages are quite isolated the sick have to travel several kilometres to find the nearest health facilitydrilling of boreholes has helped to bring safe water to most rural communities in developing countries efforts are being made by ngos and well-wishers all over the world who come and drill these boreholes the only problem is that when the pumps break down the community members have no expertise and knowledge on how to repair the pumps the rural populations lack the knowledge equipment and materials that could help isolate and fix the problem hence return to their old water sources which may not be as safeavailability of sanitary facilities such as latrines toilets and proper garbage disposal sites are important in curbing infectious diseases that are spread due to poor sanitation poorly disposed garbage attracts flies that carry disease causing microorganisms and spread them as they land on food thereby contaminating the food with the microorganisms lack of latrinestoilets results in open defecation that also attract flies which will also contaminate anything they come into contact with including food
the squatting toilet pit
 due to poor sanitation campaigns have been launched encouraging people to dig latrines instead of using open defecation in a typical rural setting in most sub-saharan countries there is a grass thatched or tin roofed residential house an outside bathroom which is usually a square or rectangular space demarcated by grass and wooden polesbamboo for privacy and a pit latrine which could have a similar demarcation as the bathroom or could be enclosed in a tiny mud hut with a grass thatched roof even though latrines toilets are constructed differently in different rural communities in developing countries around the world they serve the same purposedue to lack of running water in most of the poor rural areas of the world latrines toilets are dug in the ground and a slab is placed on top of the pit the slab has a hole located at the centre where people can pass out urine and faecal matter if a pit latrine is deep enough it can be used for 25 years or more before it fills up this also depends on the number of people using the latrine if a pit latrine is used properly cleaned regularly and is properly covered it reduces the incidence of infectious diseases especially those spread by vectors such as flies if the hole of the pit latrine is left open flies come out and they land on fruits and food contaminating them with microbes which can cause diseases to those who consume the food proper hygiene is needed in order to safely use and manage pit latrines in rural schools of sub-saharan africa these are the toilets that are available and students from different villages who attend the school use these facilities if these facilities are poorly maintained there is a high risk of infectious disease outbreaks since most of the children in these schools come from poor families most of them do not have shoes if the toilets are dirty the children would opt to go and use the surrounding bushes instead of the toilets this also encourages the spread of diseases as the flies will be feeding on these faecal matter and will carry these to the food in their homes making them sick in returnit is therefore necessary to understand this vicious cycle of poverty sanitation and infectious diseases how infectious diseases have resulted in increasing poverty among the poor populations of the world which has further resulted in poor living conditions including sanitation poor sanitation presents a high risk for infectious diseases hence the cycle is maintained fig 33
poor sanitation has allowed for disease vector breeding grounds some of the most deadly and dangerous infectious diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes these include malaria dengue and filariasis  elephantiasis which are prevalent in sub-saharan africa and the tropics mosquitoes breed in stagnant water which may collect in water pools around the homes and in unused utensils around the home that are hollow and can collect water mosquitoes lay their eggs that hatch and develop to the adult stages in these water pools since the water is not moving there is plenty of food for the developing mosquito stages here are some of the possible places where water collects holespools on the ground old utensils that are lying around in the open eg pots plates cups cans water fountains bases of flower pots on big leaves and hollow stems in tree trunks old tyres and anything that is hollow and can collect waterit is therefore very important to drain andor turn upside down all things that can collect water fill all water poolsfor the past decade campaigns to bring awareness on association of mosquito bites and the transmission of malaria dengue and filariasis have been ongoing in the affected regions these campaigns aimed at equipping populations in rural communities with vital information on how to protect themselves from mosquito bites thereby preventing disease have proved to be a great success for example since the introduction of insecticide treated bed nets itns there has been a drop in malaria incidence in those areas where people are using them effectively whoworld malaria report 2013 shows major progress in fight against malaria calls for sustained financing ndpeople in rural areas cannot afford insect repellent as this is costly in a typical rural setting people work during the day in their farms and around the home but gather together in the evening to socialize it is during this time that these people are at risk of being bitten by mosquitoes that transmit malaria because people are usually moving around during this time they may be bitten by mosquitoes but not compared to how much they can be bitten when they are asleep that is why sleeping under itns is one of the strategies that have helped reduce the incidence of the disease in some countries prices of itns have been subsidized so that most people can afford them some are handed out free especially to expectant mothers and to mothers with children under 5 years of ageother infectious diseases associated with poor sanitation include epidemic typhus outbreaks of epidemic typhus have been associated with poor hygiene in some developing countriesfournier et al 2002 mokrani et al 2004 poor body hygiene results in incidence of body lice which can be passed on within the household and the community through contaminated clothing and contact the lice transmit the pathogens responsible for epidemic typhus during feeding and as the lice are passed on from one individual to another they pass on the disease proper body hygiene can reduce the incidence of body liceclean surroundings and proper garbage disposal will reduce the incidence of houseflies that can transmit microorganisms associated with diarrhoeal diseasesgood sanitation goes a long way in reducing the risk of spread of infectious diseasesother factors that have contributed to poverty and poor living conditions include environmental factors such as natural disasters population growth political factors including civil wars and tribal conflicts and social factors the world bank indicators on improved sanitation facilities in rural areas estimated that in the year 2012 465  of the world rural population had access to improved sanitation facilities with 332  in low income countries 339  in low medium income countries 615  in upper middle income countries and 928  in high income countries having access to improved sanitation according to the world bank improved sanitation facilities include flushpour flush to piped sewer system septic tank pit latrine ventilated improved pit vip latrine pit latrine with slab and composting toilet httpdataworldbankorgindicatorshstaacsnrucountries1w-xm-xn-xtdisplaymapthe democratic republic of congo and madagascar have the highest percent of population living under 125 per day at 877  poverty head count ratio national poverty lines calculated from weighted household surveys show the actual population within a country that is poor the national poverty lines vary between countries fig 33
infectious diseases that coincide with the rainy season have a great impact on agricultural production families will spend time taking care of their sick instead of working on the farm the disease lowers the capacity of the farmer to work on the farm this in turn affects the crop productivity and yield guinea-worm disease for example is known as   this is because an individual suffering from the disease is non-functional for months and since the disease coincides with the farming season those infected are not able to take care of their fields hence low crop production whoabout guinea-worm disease nddue to illness in the family redistribution of labour and responsibility occurs if the head of the household andor a family member falls ill the family has to shift the responsibilities including taking care of the sick and finding extra work to earn the needed income this results in older children missing out school andor dropping out of school in search of piece work to support their families while the parents take care of the sick if the disease is chronic this may result in long-term hospitalization thereby changing the equilibrium of the household completely death of a parent or both parents due to infectious diseases results in orphans making the situation worse in the householdloss of labour due to death andor sickness directly affects livelihoods when an individual is chronically ill they are not able to carry out their normal day-to-day work resulting in a gap in the workforce this loss of labour impacts the productivity and output of the household and the community at the household level complete loss of labour due to death affects the income of the household due to expenditures to meet costs of taking care of the sick and funeral costs this further plunges the household into financial stress and povertyin order to meet the extra financial needs created by disease in a household the family may be forced to sell off their assets in order to pay for transportation of the sick member to the hospital to pay for hospital bills andor to settle funeral costs this further plunges the family into poverty and may result in loss of their livelihood to lack of capital hence poverty for the householddeath in a household especially of the head of the family andor breadwinner results in orphans these orphans will require support from other family members to survive this puts stress on the remaining family members if the surviving family members are not able to take up the extra dependants the orphans will drop out of school to find ways and means to support themselves usually the oldest of the orphaned children will take on the responsibility of taking care of the family
infectious diseases can cause malnutrition this lowers the productivity of the individual and my affect output apart from malnutrition infectious diseases are associated with displacement of populations as people try to move away from areas where disease is rampant this in turn results in loss of property poor housing and lack of other resources necessary for their survival such as safe drinking water and proper sanitationinfectious diseases have resulted in weakening of the immune system of the affected individuals making them vulnerable to other infectious diseases these opportunistic infections further weaken their bodies and affect their productivityeven if an individual recovers from an infectious disease some of these diseases cause crippling and debilitating effects which result in disability these disabilities could lead to partial or complete loss of a livelihood since the rural poor are the most affected by infectious diseases these ailments further plunge these populations into poverty
infectious diseases are an important aspect in human development and livelihoods the impact of infectious diseases on the human population has been felt for centuries and has led to discoveries that have preserved and allowed for survival of the human population due to exposure to these diseases humans have developed immunity to infectious diseases the impact of infectious diseases also led to biomedical research which has resulted in development of vaccines and understanding mechanisms of disease despite these discoveries there are still millions of people affected by infectious diseases worldwide most of them living in poor rural regions of developing countries rural populations suffer the huge impact of infectious diseases these rural communities are vulnerable to infectious diseases and their livelihoods are greatly affected by the impact of these diseaseswith varying modes of transmission infectious disease pathogens have been able to survive in different hosts and environments sanitation plays an important role in the success of infectious diseases poor sanitation provides a breeding ground for infectious disease pathogens these diseases affect livelihoods including health and economic growth
