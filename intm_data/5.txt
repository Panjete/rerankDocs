approaches for patients with very high meld scores florent artru didier samuel   since the first experiment by thomas e starzl in the 1960s1 liver transplants lts have revolutionized the treatment of patients with severe liver disease dramatically improving outcomes illustrating the success of the procedure around 23000 transplants were performed around the world in 20172 however access to lt is limited a stagnant pool of donor organs contrasts with an increasing number of candidates in france for instance the overall number of newly listed patients increased by 24 between 2011 and 2017 with an average 24 transplant candidates per available graft3 regulation regarding the allocation system has led to grafts being offered to the patients with the highest risk of short-term mortality as a consequence severely ill patients with end-stage liver disease esld prioritized for lt have been increasingly admitted to the intensive care unit icu4 outcomes of patients with esld in the icu used to concern intensivists due to their outcomes compared to the general population5 6 however improved practices have led to an outstanding 30 point short-term survival gain between 2000 and 2010 in a liver-specific icu7 the reasons for such improvements are fourfold better identification of candidates for icu admission based on specific prognosis scores8 9 better understanding of the pathophysiology of complications in chronic liver diseases general improvement in icu care10 11 and development of specific management for patients with advanced liver disease indeed in the last decades there have been numerous medical improvements in the management of precipitating events and complications of esld for instance improvement in administration of antimicrobial therapy and bundle of care in sepsis resulted in better outcomes in both sepsis and septic shock12 13 14 among others the use of vasopressors antibiotic prophylaxis and endoscopic management resulted in significant improvements in prognosis for patients admitted in the context of acute variceal bleeding15 16 17 18 in the setting of hepatorenal syndrome hrs the combination of using albumin infusions and vasopressors alongside clearer disease definitions has led to significant improvements in terms of outcome19 20 21 22 despite these improvements lt remains the only life-saving procedure in patients that fail to recover adequate liver function in order to illustrate the importance of urgent lt in this situation the share 35 policy has recently been implemented in the us to improve equity in access to lt based on the comparable outcomes observed in patients with very high meld scores without lt as in patients with fulminant hepatic failure fhf23 24 25 with share 35 patients with esld are now given the same geographic access to organs as patients with fhf while the latter group is still granted higher allocation status in a given region24 several unmet medical and ethical issues have to be faced by clinicians in order to optimize management of patients with very high meld scores from the perspective of lt such as how should these patients be categorized in the era of the dual concepts of acute-on-chronic liver failure aclf and mere acute decompensation which prognosis assessment should be used in the context of permanent scarcity of resource how should the priority access to lt be managed in the most severely ill patients given the potential increased risk of post-lt mortality can upper limits of sickness be identified beyond which a patient should not be listed for an lt how should we deal with patients already listed with less severe disease who are exposed to brutal deterioration of liver function and death due to restricted access to lt finally how to identify and manage patients that are not candidates for lt and who do not recover adequate liver function we hereby offer to discuss all these important questions and review the literature in order to shed light on the management of patients with very high meld scores patients with very high meld scores are often admitted in the context of acute decompensation ie ascites gastrointestinal bleeding hepatic encephalopathy andor acute bacterial infections distinctions have been made between mere acute decompensation and aclf regarding their respective outcomes mere acute decompensation is associated with an acceptable 28-day and 3-month mortality 5 and 14 respectively26 and is defined by either the absence of organ failures ofs or the presence of cerebral failure with a serum creatinine level  15 mgdl or the presence of 1 non-kidney of with serum creatinine level  15 mgdl and no encephalopathy table 1 the median meld of patients hospitalized in this setting is 1627 patients with very high meld scores are more likely to be admitted in the context of aclf the world gastroenterology organization defined aclf as a syndrome in patients with chronic liver disease with or without previously diagnosed cirrhosis which is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation resulting in liver failure jaundice and prolongation of the international normalized ratio and 1 or more extrahepatic ofs that is associated with increased mortality within a period of 28 days and up to 3 months from onset28 by definition 28-day and 3-month mortality in this setting is high respectively around 35 and 5026 29 three types of aclf were defined according to absence type a or presence type b of cirrhosis and history of previous hepatic decompensation type c the latter 2 are the most prevalent in western countries28 despite agreement on the definition exact implications of concepts such as acute and failure remain debated among the different learned societies26 30 31 32 in cases of aclf standard liver disease prognostic scores underestimate short-term mortality which is more closely associated with the number of ofs than with liver failure per se33 34 35 it is well established that in such patients often hospitalized in the icu icu scores simplified acute physiology score ii sequential organ failure assessment sofa acute physiology and chronic health evaluation score apache evaluating extrahepatic ofs are better predictors of mortality than the meld and other scores33 35 36 37 the chronic liver failure consortium clif-c of the european association for the study of the liver disease easl has led a european prospective multicentre 29 centres study involving 1343 patients hospitalized for acute deterioration of hepatocellular function in order to establish diagnostic criteria for aclf and assess the natural history of the syndrome canonic cohort in this cohort of was defined by clif-sofa26 adapted from the sofa38 and then by the clif-c of score39 the authors proposed arbitrarily 6 thresholds identical in the 2 scores to define ofs according to the 6 organ systems included liver coagulation kidney brain respiration circulation and a subsequent grading ranging from 0 absence of aclf to 3 depending on the number of ofs table 1 table 2 this classification identifies 3 populations with different prognoses at 28-days illustrated by mortality rates of 22 32 and 767 in patients with aclf grade 1 2 and 3 respectively26 aclf is a dynamic process in which the rapid evolution after the first days of medical care is associated with clinical outcome fig 1 identification of an early non-severe course resolution of aclf or aclf grade 1 after day 3 to 7 is associated with low to moderate 28-day transplant-free mortality ranging from 618 on the contrary early severe course aclf grade 2 or 3 at day 3 to 7 is associated with a high 28-day transplant-free mortality ranging from 429229 therefore sequential evaluation during the first days of care is required in order to optimize prediction of outcome and subsequent medical management in this population a score derived from clif-c of named clif-c aclf which additionally included age and log-transformed white-blood cell count was initially reported to have the best performance in predicting short-term mortality in this population these results were not confirmed in a recent study of more than 800 patients with aclf in this work clif-c aclf failed to show better perfomance in prediction of 90 days mortality compared to meld auroc 068 vs 067 p0339 40 moreover its daily use seems less convenient than the evaluation of of number by the clif-c of lactate levels were independently associated with short-term mortality in critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis and were shown to significantly improve performance of clif-c aclf the modified called clif-c aclfslact score remains to be evaluated in an external cohort41 together with the numerous biomarkers that have recently been associated with outcomes in this population42 43 44 45 46 47 combining available scores with biomarkers could optimize prediction of events in this population with a high short-term mortality according to the north american consortium for the study of liver disease nacseld aclf syndrome is defined by 2 or more extrahepatic ofs among the following circulatory failure defined by a shock brain failure by grade iiiiv hepatic encephalopathy renal failure by requiring renal replacement therapy and respiratory failure by requiring mechanical ventilation32 48 the main difference between this definition and easl-clif consortium is the stringent definition of renal failure restricted to requirements of renal replacement therapy and the absence of liver-related variables ie bilirubin and international normalized ratio while 226 3031343 of patients fulfilled the aclf definition of the easl-clif consortium at enrolment in the princeps european study26 only 10 2642675 fulfilled the nacselds definition in a large study published recently48 in the latter including a large multinational cohort of infected and non-infected cirrhotic patients nacseld-aclf was an independent prognostic factor of 30-day survival and the number of ofs 1 2 3 or 4 was also associated with 30-day survival respectively around 85 73 53 and 12 a substantial proportion of patients with very high meld scores were excluded from the nacseld-aclf definition due to the stringent definition of renal failure moreover excluding liver-related variables could include patients without very high meld scores we shall therefore hereafter focus on the patients with very high meld scores hospitalized in a context of aclf according to the easl-clif consortium classification as recommended in the 2018 published guidelines the diagnosis and the grading of aclf should be based on the assessment of organ function as defined by the clif-c of score49 according to these data in daily practice the prognosis of patients with very high meld scores hospitalized in the context of aclf can be assessed by the grade of aclf on admission sequential evaluation at day 3 to day 7 appears critical in order to characterize the course of aclf severe vs non-severe and optimize medical management kidney failure 558 of patients was the most common failure reported in the canonic cohort followed by liver failure 436 of patients coagulation 277 of patients brain 241 of patients circulation 168 of patients and the lungs 92 of patients the impact of the type of failure on short-term outcome remains debated requirements for vasopressors and mechanical ventilation were identified as the failures associated with the worst outcomes in some studies32 48 50 whereas this was not reported in a large recent international study40 liver failure as defined by a total bilirubin  12 mgdl in the canonic study was an independent predictor of a severe life-threatening course of aclf suggesting a central role as a trigger or perpetuating factor of multi-organ failure29 in the princeps study on aclf precipitating events were sepsis 33 alcohol consumption 25 gastrointestinal bleeding 13 or others 8 transjugular portosystemic intrahepatic shunt insertion surgery viral hepatitis26 multiple precipitating events were reported in 13 of the population whereas no precipitating events were identified in around 44 of patients26 the absence of a precipitating event was not associated with a different clinical course26 51 an absence of precipitating events was thought to be linked with either the lack of sensitivity of diagnostic tests for bacterial infections spontaneous resolution of events or bacterial translocation episodes52 53 54 55 the type and distribution of precipitating events varies according to the regions of the world for instance if viral hepatitis represented a minority of identified precipitating events in the canonic cohort it represented more than 40 of events in a large chinese study56 the type of precipitating events was not related to 28-day mortality but could be related to 3-month mortality when divided into hepatic or extrahepatic events26 56 fig 2 in a subset of the canonic database bacterial infection as the trigger of aclf was associated with poorer outcome than aclf not triggered by sepsis with a 3-month transplant-free mortality of 507 vs 384 p  005 in the same study infections with multidrug resistant bacteria that triggered aclf andor severe sepsisseptic shock at diagnosis were associated with worse prognosis57 therefore according to the recent recommendations from easl potential precipitating factors either hepatic ie heavy alcohol intake viral hepatitis drug-induced liver injury autoimmune hepatitis andor extrahepatic ie infections haemodynamic changes following haemorrhage surgery should be investigated early identification and treatment particularly bacterial infections are recommended49 in the population of patients with very high meld scores no specific treatment is available aside from antiviral therapy in patients with aclf due to reactivation of hbv infection49 55 57 the management is mainly based on organ support together with the prevention and the treatment of associated complications such medical care requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes intensivists specialists in infectious diseases and a transplant team made up of hepatologists surgeons and anaesthesiologists59 because of the severe prognosis particularly observed in aclf grade 2 or 3 corresponding to patients with very high meld scores patients should preferably be managed in the icu of an lt centre as recommended by easl guidelines early referral of patients with aclf to lt centres for immediate evaluation is recommended49 57 major improvements in prognosis of critically ill cirrhotic patients have been observed over the past decades7 in parallel outcomes of patients with aclf have been shown to be similar to those of patients without liver disease who are admitted to the icu with sepsis or with other critical conditions60 therefore in our opinion access to the icu for this population should not be denied without strong evidence of futility of care assessed by a multidisciplinary evaluation among the specific bundle of care in this population a particular effort should be made to time initial resuscitation in order to control the extension of multi-organ failure for instance each hour delay in appropriate antimicrobial therapy is associated with significantly increased hospital mortality61 62 moreover prophylactic strategies should be used to prevent bacterial infection considering its deleterious influence on prognosis in the setting of aclf triggered by non-infectious factors57 general management of such patients should be made in accordance with recent guidelines and expert reviews on critically ill cirrhotic patients55 59 63 64 65 this review will then focus only on the few different alternative strategies available in this population in the absence of effective alternative strategies lt remains the unique curative treatment available in this population who has been granted priority access indeed the meld score was first proposed to predict the 3-month mortality in cirrhotic patients after transjugular portosystemic intrahepatic shunt insertion66 later on this score was widely implemented in graft allocation scores to prioritize patients disclosing the highest risk of waiting list mortality thus leading to the sickest first policy67 68 69 70 the survival benefit conferred to recipients of lts increases progressively with meld score when compared to candidates on the lt waiting list the lower threshold of meld identifying patients who will benefit from lt is not well established around 15 and could vary according to the aetiology of underlying liver disease71 72 nevertheless the maximum benefit of lt is constantly observed in the sickest patients with the highest meld scores ie  4071 72 73 the meld is currently capped at 40 while waiting list mortality continues to increase over this score penalizing transplant candidates with a capped score74 despite the obvious theoretical benefit of this procedure performing lt in patients with very high meld scores hospitalized in the context of aclf remains controversial indeed some studies reported an increased mortality and morbidity after lt in recipients with very high meld scores compared to populations with lower meld scores75 76 77 whereas others did not78 79 in the context of a global organ shortage in lt the concept of utility has therefore been opposed to the one of equity80 this raises several unsolved issues linked to the question of results of lt in patients with very high meld scores identification of too sick to transplant patients and the associated upper limits of the sickest first policy in recent years the notion of futility of lt has been used if post-transplant mortality was higher than waiting list mortality81 82 or in case of 3-month or in-hospital mortality after lt76 83 however authors of a recent review preferred to correct futile lt to potentially inappropriate lt thus reducing the value judgment inherent to the term futile80 this semantic change follows the adoption of these new terms by a multisociety statement that provided guidance for clinicians to prevent and manage disputes regarding patients with advanced critical illnesses84 this change introduces an element of uncertainty in this area ie potentially when considering the fact that medicine is always evolving and upper limits always repelled85 the terms of potentially inappropriate lt should therefore be preferred to futile lt identification of variables associated with post-lt outcomes in the setting of patients with very high meld should help identify clinical situations where lt is potentially inappropriate meld alone does not show good enough performance in identifying patients with high rates of short-term post-lt mortality even in the most severe patients using uncapped meld with scores  4074 86 therefore many authors have searched for recipient factors associated with 3-month mortality or in-hospital mortality thirteen variables were identified in a retrospective study from 21673 patients in the united network for organ sharing unos database81 leading to the development of the p-soft for preallocation survival outcomes following liver transplantation and soft scores after inclusion of graft related variables which show good performances in prediction of 3-month post-lt mortality with a c-statistic at 069 and 070 respectively the bar balance of risk score was developed based on the 37255 patients from the unos database after identification of 4 simple recipient variables age meld life support pretransplantation and retransplantation and 2 donor-related variables associated with 3-month post-lt mortality76 this score showed similar performance in predicting 3-month post-lt mortality c-statistic of 07 the aclf-score identified 5 recipient characteristics age gender esld or hepatocellular carcinoma recent infection and presence of aclf and 1 donor characteristic gender as independently associated with mortality 3 months after lt87 this score also showed comparable predictive performance with a c-statistic test at 071 apart from age none of these scores contain variables evaluating comorbidities through various diseases comorbidities have been associated with outcome88 89 90 91 92 screening of significant extrahepatic comorbid conditions is the cornerstone of the health assessment required before placement on a waiting list the ucla score was developed with the aim of identifying variables associated with 3-month or in-hospital mortality after lt in patients with very high meld scores  40 among the evaluated variables authors chose the charlson-comorbidity index cci93 that had already been proven in a recalibrated form to be efficient in determining outcome in an lt population94 another score named the cardiac risk score was defined by the presence of at least 1 of the following variables severe valvular disease coronary artery disease with more than 70 stenosis or previous revascularization history of myocardial infarction history of ventricular andor atrial arrhythmias elevated pre-orthotopic lt troponin i  02 ngml andor new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography indeed cardiovascular disease was shown to be associated with short-term outcome particularly in the first month following lt mortality or cardiovascular events95 96 meld score pretransplant septic shock but also age-adjusted cci and cardiac risk score were associated with outcomes using a multivariate analysis in the final score named ucla futility risk score ucla-frs an important weight was given to comorbidity including the cardiac risk index and the cci ucla-frs  05  meld score  5  1  cci  6 0  cci  6  4  1  cardiac risk 0  no cardiac risk  3  1  septic shock 0  no septic shock97 in a recent study reporting results of lt in patients with ofs this score seemed to be helpful in selecting candidates for lt when considering predicted and observed post-lt survival rates98 another study aimed to compare available scores in 2 independent cohorts of transplanted patients with high meld scores swiss and unos cohort most prediction scores showed low positive predictive values for post-transplant mortality despite good specificity among these scores the bar score was the only score linearly associated with complications99 the usefulness of this score which was designed for the more critically ill patients seems restricted to this population based on its performance in other cohorts100 table 3 an emerging concept in hepatology is frailty frailty corresponds to a validated geriatric construct of increased vulnerability to physiologic stressors frailty represents the conditions in a given patient that are unlikely to reverse after liver function returns or will take so long to reverse that the patient will be highly vulnerable to postoperative complications101 102 many tools assessing frailty have been proposed and evaluated in esld particularly in patients awaiting lt fried frailty index short physical performance battery102 103 6 minute walk test104 activity of daily living105 106 a karnofsky performance status-based score has recently been proposed for the prediction of death after hospital discharge in cirrhosis107 the subgroup of patients with low meld scores and high frailty may derive the greatest benefit from implementation of these measures102 however functional tests evaluating frailty could be not enough discriminant in the homogeneous population of very high meld patients moreover it may not be possible to perform such tests because of patients clinical condition an interesting approach will be the use of alternative tests to evaluate frailty which are better adapted for an icu population and do not require functional assessment108 109 evaluation of surrogate markers of frailty such as sarcopenia which can be assessed by imaging represent an alternative option when associated with meld ct-scan assessed sarcopenia has been demonstrated to be useful in the identification of patients with the highest risk of mortality on waiting lists110 moreover sarcopenia was associated with post-lt mortality independently of the meld score111 these results were confirmed recently with different thresholds for women and men112 fat-free muscle mass assessed by mri in decompensated patients was associated with mortality and also with the development of aclf 113 however data are lacking regarding the impact of sarcopenia on post-transplant outcome in patients with very high meld scores in the context of aclf sarcopenia is an evolving process and evaluation should be readily performed in this view assessment of sarcopenia by ultrasonography seems to be an easy and reliable option but it is yet to be evaluated in cirrhotic patients114 at the present time identification of potentially inappropriate lt candidates should not be based solely on available scores considering their statistical performance however a combination of scores as well as evaluation of frailty could improve the clinical management of patients with very high meld scores who are candidates for lt data on outcomes in patients with aclf treated with liver lt are less scarce post-lt 3-month survival of recipients is about 8090 and much higher than that anticipated if patients were not transplanted29 50 87 98 115 116 117 indeed in the canonic study patients transplanted with an aclf grade 2 and 3 between day 3 and day 7 n  21 had a better 6-month survival than the non-transplanted patients 809 vs 10 p  000129 similarly in our reported experience the 73 patients transplanted with aclf grade 3 at the time of lt had better 1-year survival than matched controls 839 vs 79 p  0000198 in a very large cohort study from the unos performed in more than 11000 patients transplanted with 1 or more ofs a good 1-year survival ranging from 88 1 of to 80 56 ofs was reported moreover recipients long-term survival 5-year was acceptable ranging from 65 to 74 with similar results for liver graft survival116 regarding the impact of the type of ofs on post-lt outcomes there was a lower post-lt survival among intubated patients or patients with circulatory failure than for other types of of 1-year patient survival 7981 vs 8487116 levesque et al recently reported a worse outcome following lt for patients with aclf grade 3 compared to our cohort 433 survival at 1 year87 the main difference in patient characteristics between this study and our collaborative work was the incidence of respiratory failure between the 2 groups of patients with alcf grade 3 767 vs 15898 together these data suggest that severe and uncontrolled respiratory failure may be viewed as a contraindication for lt this is in line with a recent report that identified severe acute respiratory distress syndrome as an independent factor associated with post-transplant mortality118 improvement or stabilization in ofs in the immediate pretransplant period has been associated with favourable post-lt outcomes in patients with aclf suggesting that the evolution of ofs should at least be controlled if not improved before considering an lt98 115 another important point to consider is the timeframe of lt in most studies reporting favourable post-lt outcomes in these severely ill patients an early lt has been performed time between placement on the waiting list and lt ranging from 39 days98 116 119 this very short timeframe is required because of the natural history of these patients indeed around 50 of them will die in the first 10 days116 a significant proportion of patients are not placed on the waiting list before acute deterioration of their condition as an example in our study 4573 patients transplanted with aclf grade 3 were placed on waiting lists during the immediate pre-lt hospitalization median time to lt 8 days98 therefore pretransplant evaluation must be performed in a timely fashion precluding a number of clinical tests usually required in lt programmes to our knowledge the potential impact on post-lt outcomes of this truncated evaluation has yet to be studied extensively in patients with very high meld scores50 such a truncated evaluation involving the performance of only a few necessary screening tests could lead to potential contraindications for lt active neoplasia severe alcohol dependence or still significant coronary artery disease being overlooked in addition to the potential impact on outcomes this raises some degree of unfairness with regard to less severe patients undergoing the recommended exhaustive evaluation routinely responsible for not listing patients after the discovery of a contraindication117 there is an urgent need to evaluate the various international lt centre practices in this setting a prospective study validating a standardized assessment for patients with very high meld scores who have not yet been listed should be put forward in order to optimize selection of candidates and decrease inequity while lt seems to confer favourable survival outcomes in these very sick patients it is associated with longer total stay in both the icu and the hospital this also leads to a high rate of complications observed in this population who therefore require attentive screening for complications particularly of an infectious nature87 98 115 117 the current knowledge suggests that transplant outcomes in selected patients with aclf could be favourable even in patients with multi-organ failure at the time of lt however in order to optimize post-lt outcomes lt should be performed in a timely manner after admission within a window of improvement or at least stabilization of ofs in order to identify the transplantation window 2 classes of contraindications have to be separated first the definitive contraindications responsible for an immediate and irreversible arrest in the lt process at the local level some contraindications are widely accepted and might be illustrated by metastatic solid neoplasia severe cardiac or pulmonary insufficiency not related to liver disease or even pre-hospitalization bedridden states however these definitive contraindications are definitive at a specific time in a specific transplant centre as their appreciation varies between lt centres depending on local expertise and the potential change over time within each centre117 second the dynamic contraindications are responsible for a short temporary inability to perform liver transplantation these dynamic contraindications are represented by numbers of diseases or failures that could evolve positively after appropriate therapeutic management uncontrolled bacterial infection active fungal infection active gastrointestinal bleeding severe acute respiratory distress syndrome severe haemodynamic instability severe coagulopathy the dynamic contraindications are often represented by precipitating events of aclf syndrome26 56 occurrence and resolution or control of dynamic contraindications in the context of stabilization or improvement of ofs define the transplantation window98 fig 3 as discussed earlier the optimal transplantation window should be identified as soon as possible after the admission of patients with very high meld scores considering their poor expected outcome and the risk of them developing adverse events other dynamic contraindications in a short timeframe29 120 due to the lack of data in this field the exact timeframes within which lt is contraindicated by dynamic contraindications are often transplant centre and local expertise dependant the concept of a transplantation window for lt in a patient without a definitive contraindication is based on the absence of dynamic contraindications that allow for lts to be performed in a context of stabilization or improvement of ofs the transplantation window should be rapidly identified following admission in order to optimize post-lt outcomes studies reporting outcomes in cirrhotic patients after icu discharge are scarce however after recovery from critical illness cirrhotic patients are at higher risk of 1-year mortality between 275 to 68 compared to the general population121 122 123 124 predictors associated with 1-year mortality after icu discharge are not clearly reported but could be related to the number and type of ofs that patients experienced in the icu as well as the severity of liver disease at admission to and discharge from the icu123 there are currently no reliable tools that identify populations with a very low risk of mortality after initial effective icu care and discharge from the icu therefore such patients should be referred to liver transplant centres during the same hospitalization or closely thereafter in order to be evaluated for lt even in cases of recovery of liver function patients with very high meld scores admitted in the context of aclf should be referred to lt centres as soon as possible considering the risk of events at 1-year in this population modalities that can serve as a bridge to lt or that can confer sufficient clinical improvement to enable patients to be discharged from the icuhospital can positively impact outcomes in patients with very high meld scores these modalities aim to replace the functions of the failing liver allowing hepatic recovery or stabilizing clinical state to enable transplantation55 59 the key concepts of such therapies are to remove harmful toxins support the liver for spontaneous regeneration and to reduce the ongoing inflammatory injury59 based on albumin dialysis the molecular adsorbent recirculating system mars and plasma separation and absorption system prometheus are the most studied devices mars therapy has been reported to improve bilirubin levels hepatic encephalopathy haemodynamic parameters and kidney function in patients with decompensated cirrhosis125 126 without improving survival in the relief trial including patients with aclf no improvement in transplant-free survival at 28 and 90 days was observed127 in the helios study despite a well-tolerated treatment prometheus therapy was not reported to improve short-term survival in patients with aclf128 of note these results have to be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneous population of patients with decompensated cirrhosis associated with different degrees of ofs and different definitions of aclf58 results of a large prospective multicentre study evaluating a bioartificial device extracorporeal cellular therapy in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis showed that it conferred no overall survival benefit compared to standard of care however among other limitations patients were not stratified according to response to medical treatment and definitive conclusions on the efficacy of this device cannot as of this date be drawn129 a second study in younger patients with lower meld scores is therefore ongoing nct02612428 currently 2 trials involving extracorporeal liver support are recruiting in the setting of alcf the first is evaluating the efficacy of high-volume plasma exchange and g-csf vs g-csf alone in patients with aclf clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct03162419 the second is a multicentre randomized controlled study evaluating the safety and performance of a new liver support device called dialive in 24 patients with aclf vs standard of care nct03065699 based on the results of available rcts easl guidelines state that extracorporeal liver support systems do not improve survival of patients with aclf and should therefore not be recommended for this indication49 among the medical treatments offered in this setting g-csf seems to be the most promising treatment with accumulating evidence of its potential efficacy albeit with only a small number of patients treated to date g-csf promotes mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and induces proliferation of hepatic progenitor cells in animal models of liver failure but also in human alcoholic hepatitis130 131 a few small-randomized clinical trials have demonstrated not only improvement in liver function with g-csf but also significant survival benefit compared with standard medical therapy for aclf132 133 134 135 nonetheless at this time there is insufficient evidence for such therapies to be recommended in patients with very high meld scores this decision is essentially performed according to local expertise and beliefs on this specific point easl guidelines state that despite promising results the administration of g-csf cannot be recommended at present49 the survival probability of patients with very high meld scores is efficiently calculated by the available scores of aclf aclf grade or clif-c aclf29 in the absence of alternative treatments for lt due to the severe course observed in this population without lt withdrawal of care could be a reasonable option in some patients presenting with a definitive contraindication in the canonic cohort sequential calculation of the scores was reported to identify a group of patients with the most severe outcome with a 100 transplant-free mortality29 these patients were identified as those with  4 ofs andor clif-c aclf  64 between day 3 and day 7 based on these results an algorithmic approach has proposed withdrawal of care to these patients29 a retrospective analysis performed in the kings college cohort7 using these thresholds reported that 10 of the patients survived at 90 days136 this highlights that prediction scores perform differently in different cohorts and that medical management related to algorithm-based scores cannot be adopted widely without caution it is important to recognize that any decision regarding withdrawal is irrevocable and small survival probabilities can be perceived differently by caregivers and patients families balancing these aspects while maintaining patient life dignity and wishes is fraught with statistical and ethical difficulties and a single score is an unlikely final referee136 regarding the decision to withdraw care data from the literature as well as data from local experience should be considered alongside the potential for improvement in ofs and qualitative factors frailty and patients wishes136 137 138 139 finally in our opinion these scores are useful in identifying situations in which it could be reasonable to initiate discussion around withdrawal of care the easl guidelines state that withdrawal of ongoing intensive care support can be suggested in patients who are not candidates for lt and who have 4 or more ofs after 1 week of adequate intensive treatment49 accurate identification of variables associated with mortality in patients with cirrhosis and the permanent scarcity of liver grafts has led to lt being recommended to an increasing number of severely ill patients as a consequence physicians in lt centres routinely face medical surgical and ethical challenges nonetheless data are accumulating on the pretransplant management of such patients and refined disease assessments based on variables such as clinical course and the determination of risk factors for poor outcome after lt may be made and help define a too sick for transplant upper-limit however while awaiting devices or treatment that will delay or avoid lt there is an urgent need based on robust data to offer a consensual definition of definitive contraindications and the transplantation

2001g57030 rightly remarked this is in conflict with the wellknown theorem of d a kazhdan and g a margulis 1968 and with the work of thurston describing the geometric convergence of orbifolds under large dehn fillings in this paper we refresh our previous publication correctly we obtained cone manifolds for k  2 as a d mednykh and v s petrov 2006 kindly pointed out we complete our discussion and derive  mathematics subject classification 2010 57m50 57n10 key words and phrases hyperbolic manifold by fundamental polyhedron gieseking manifold dehn-surgeries volume by lobachevsky function e molnr -i prok -j szirmai the above cone manifold series gies1 and gies2 in two geometrically equivalent form by the half turn symmetry of any ideal simplex moreover we obtain a second orbifold series gies3 and 4 tending to the regular ideal simplex as the original gieseking manifold the famous non-orientable gieseking manifold 1912 is the regular simplex with face angles 3 in the bolyai-lobachevskian hyperbolic space h 3 with ideal vertices forming a so-called cusp at the absolute equipped by face pairing isometries z 1  z 2 as horospherical glide reflections fig 1  these induce one equivalence class of the 6 edges and so a ball-like neighbourhood for any point of an edge and so for any point of the identified simplexs if we vary the face angles  1   2   3 at the opposite edges ofs then it will be no more a manifold but for special angles there exists a natural parameter 1  k  n such thatsk seems to represent a compact hyperbolic orbifold with a closed singularity geodesics of rotation order k we shall use the poincar half space model of h 3  with the complex projective line c  for the absolute and with w  z 1  ww  z 2      for an interior point of h 3  ower w  c  and third coordinate  on the half circle z 1 z 2 see fig 1 b and fig 5-6  moreover we compute the volume vk of sk as well by means of the lobachevski function x in 212 it maybe surprising that vk  0 if k   in the conflict mentioned in the abstract our result implies similar consequence for the double orientable cover of the gieseking manifold ie for the figure-eight-knot manifold examined also by thurston 13  this paper is refreshing 9 as byproduct of 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  a d mednykh and v s petrov 5 cited our 9 10 and noticed our deeper mistake as it will be improved here see also 1 with n v abrosimov showing some new phenomena and interpretations as well after some preliminaries in section 2 we derive our general surgery equation 29 and our previous series in 9 by equation 211 an orbifold for k  2 uniformly for our series fig 3 b and cone manifolds for k  2  fig   in equivalent form in conformity with the fact that the dihedral angles of a regular ideal simplex are 3 6  3  2 will guarantee ball-like neighbourhood of any point at simplex edges however the relation 23 with 22 -by careful computations -leads to equation with more general ideal simplex not necessarily the regular one now we turn to the ideal vertex class forming a cusp  fig 2-3  this will be represented by gluing corresponding to images of the 4 vertex domains to that of  the side face pairing ofs induces the pairing of the sides of a 2-dimensional polygon denoted bys in fig 2-3  say on a horosphere centred in  this is represented in our half-space model by a euclidean plane parallel to the absolute and it can also be described on the absolute by c   topologically the polygons is a klein-bottle with fundamental group pg this group as the stabilizer g  of  is determined by the starting group gz 1  z 2  in formulae 22 fig 3 exactly for k  3 and k  2 respectively shows the figure 2  the gieseking regular ideal simplex tiling in the touching plane at  as c  more general situation that g  is generated by pairing of s again it is conjugated to z 2  we see that p is a translation it is z 2conjugated to z 1 z 1 2  this group g  is 4 pg itself on the euclidean plane represented by fig 2 shows the exact situation we have obtained the gieseking manifold with one cusp other z as a complex parameter makes the stabilizer g  to a conformal group with fixed points this line v will not be covered by the g  -images of the simplexs in h 3  in the model half-space the translations of g  in 25 by 22 will be similarities of c  with fixed points v  eg z 1 in 22 and z 2 in 25   now we turn to the critical so-called surgery transform z 1 z  2  by the tricky use of 24 as fixing  and v of course we see by 24 that z 1 z  2 describes a rotation of the model half-space about the line v with angle ie   2   1  4   3 mod 2 if we require the stabilizer g  to act discontinuously on the model halfspace then this angle necessarily will be 2k mod 2 ie can be assumed then k is the periodicity of the rotation z 1 z  2 and we get 4 root series for the fundamental simplices called gies1-gies4 the first one is chosen all data can be computed from 210 especially the face angles ofs equal at the opposite edges  fig 1a -3 b 211 however the computer gives more guarantees in table 2 1 we have computed by maple the volume ofs as well for some values of k we know 14 15 that the lobachevski function provides the volume of the ideal simplex with the above angles the formal monodromy group gz 1  z 2  k above has a unified presentation for k  2 3    we sketchily indicate by fig 1 b -6 how to construct a  domain to a compact one we introduce an edge e on the line v and its then we choose a point z 1 in the simplexs  01z and consider the segments  then the corresponding curved bent surfaces q 1  and its z 1 will be constructed transversally to the edges ofs see fig 2  3 5 6 and also 6  finally in fig 6 we get a compact fundamental domainf  with piecewise linear bent faces equipped by a pairing iz 1  z  2  p q and defining relations to the corresponding edge classes 214 in fig 7 we have only pictured the very economic presentation with its combinatorial fundamental domain of course 215 equivalent with 213 and with 214 if remark 21 observe that our compactification procedure works also for k  1 as fig 4 indicates the cusp of our ideal simplexs as a klein-bottle can be glued by a solid klein-bottle k then the splitting effect occurs the cusp ofs will be cut along a klein-bottle surface to get a boundary then we glue to this boundary the boundary of k considered as s 2 r-manifold with boundary as follows k  s 2 r g  g  p r  p m  r  1 2  p r  s 2 r 217 the generator g is a product of a reflection m say in the equator of s 2  combined by a 12-translation in r the boundary klein-bottle can be obtained by cutting out one half-sphere say at longitudes 0 and  of s 2 with complete r-fibers  the requirements in 29 provide the second root series and the cone manifold series gies2 for k  2 our fig 8 and table 3 1 show these surprisingly a little bit this will be geometrically equivalent to gies1 by the half-turn symmetry of ideal simplex 0   1  z  the requirements in 29 provide the third root series and the orbifold series gies3 our fig 9 show the case k  3 and 9 table  4 1 gives computer results the fourth root series will be and the orbifold series gies4 both last series tend to the gieseking regular ideal simplex manifold as j r weeks predicted for us in our discussions we do not give here illustration to gies4 series equivalent to the previous one by half-turn symmetry again as we see in table 4 1 our orbifold volumes more important the half of them are large enough t h marshall and g j martin 4 determined the exact lower bound  00390 the next is  00408 for orientable orbifolds in dimension three compare that the half of the coxeter orthoscheme 5 3 5  00467 and 3 5 3  001953 two-times less than the optimal one but this orthoscheme has also reflection as the authors noticed as well in higher dimensions the problem is open in general now we summarize our results theorem 51 the surgery procedure of gieseking manifold leads essentially to two different series for rotation parameter k  2 we get an orbifold for k  2 the surgery yields compact nonorientable hyperbolic cone manifolds in the first case gies1-2 with underlying gieseking manifold before where a closed geodesic line exists with cone angle 2k  1k this can be realized by a deformed ideal simplex sk by 21-2 with complex parameter zk by 211 that uniquely determines all metric data in our figures and tables the volume of sk tends to 0 if k   theorem 52 the second series in cases gies3-4 leads to orbifolds also for k  2 tending to the original gieseking manifold if k goes to infinity the orientable double cover of gieseking manifold known as thurston manifold or the complement of the figure-eight-knot has a manifold surgery of volume 09813688289     which is known as second minimal one but the above construction leads to cone manifold surgeries whose volumes tend to zero to the first series and tend to the original manifold to the second series the minimal volume orientable manifold of fomenko-matveev-weeks with volume 094270736     can also be obtained by surgery the occasionally possible  orbifold surgery is not examined yet  we found in 10 the third non-orientable double-ideal-regular-simplexmanifold by computer this has similar surgery phenomena that will be published again because of its actuality we plan to discuss the general surgery situations by refreshing 10 as well  nurses transforming systems of care cheryl reinking   on october 12 1854 the london times printed a shocking article on the
atrocious care of the sick and wounded british soldiers who were fighting in the crimean
war the journalist wrote not only are there no wound dressers and nurses  but
what will be said when it is known that there is not even linen to make bandages for the
wounded1 florence nightingale living in
london at the time read this article with horror and the story prompted her to begin
making plans to visit the war zone in crimea to set up a proper hospital1 nightingale applied her influence and political connections to support her goal secretary
of war sidney herbert commissioned her to gather a group of 40 nurses to improve conditions
for soldiers at the barrack hospital at scutari now the skdar district of
istanbul herbert wrote there is but one person in england who i know of who
would be capable of organizing and superintending such a scheme as florence
nightingale1 herberts confidence in
nightingale is evident in his statements deploying nurses to british military hospitals had
never been done before and nightingale had only days to find the 40 nurses to accompany her
to scutari her previous experience studying nursing and organizational skills in germany
france and england in mostly catholic facilities had prepared her to discern the type of
women required for not only the journey to the war zone but also for the work ahead up to this point nurses were thought of as women of questionable character at best
exposure of women to the harsh brutalities of war plague and death in victorian england
was viewed by the general public as undignified nightingale aimed to change this negative
stigma the advertisement for nurses went out and letters of interest began pouring into a
makeshift headquarters in london nightingale hired 38 women some of whom were anglican
nursing sisters and catholic nuns1 to nightingale it
was essential to include catholic nuns because one-third of the british forces were irish
catholic in the end she gathered the best and most prepared nurses she could find to make
the journey and care for the wounded british soldiers1 upon their arrival the nurses faced many barriers and outright resistance the career
military medical officer dr john hall made up his mind that they wouldnt be of any
help1 dr hall was known to oppose patient care
changes even if beneficial he was confident that these nurses were going to be ignorant and
of questionable character this less-than-warm reception didnt deter the women from
organizing cleaning and preparing the hospital for the wounded1 on october 25 1854 the british and their allies fought the russians in the battle of
balaclava and 11 days later another battle ensued1
the vast number of wounded soldiers coming to scutari after these battles quickly changed
the way the medical staff viewed nightingale and her nurses the nurses had minimal
supplies but instituted new practices and procedures based on observations and data they
collected related to nightingales teaching1
they observed under which conditions the soldiers had survived and attempted to replicate
and spread best practices throughout the hospital for example the nurses found that the soldiers with clean bandages proper hydration and
exposure to clean air had better outcomes than those who didnt they began sewing
proper bandages and only using bandages once before washing and reusing they stitched sacks
together and stuffed them with straw to make mattresses for men lying on the floor they
cooked hot kettles of broth for the soldiers and relentlessly mopped and swept opening
windows that had been boarded up to let in fresh air1 following the war nightingales data collection and reports were submitted to a
royal commission her statistical findings indicated that most deaths were due to
overcrowding poor sanitation and improper ventilation2 the accomplishments of nightingale and her nurses in scutari were
transformational strongly impacting the value of evidence-informed nursing practices and
redefining the image of modern nursing well into the 20th century data demonstrated the
merits of quality nursing care survival rates increased from 50 to nearly
80 under the care of nightingale and her nurses1 attention to rigorous infection prevention hygiene and cleanliness nutrition
and hydration and compassionate care were integral interventions that revolutionized
nursing care practices and improved clinical outcomes fast-forward 166 years and todays nurses continue to face myriad healthcare
challenges and systems issues perhaps less severe in some ways contemporary practice
settings and work environments remain fraught with problems although infectious diseases
may appear less prevalent than in the late 19th century a burgeoning list of complex
chronic conditions demand evidence-informed knowledge innovative interventions and new
skills to meet the postmodern imperatives of efficiency quality affordability and care
experience in gratitude to florence nightingale a path was charted for modern nurses to become
trusted and valued members of the healthcare team who employ data and evidence daily to plan
care however our systems of healthcare delivery are characterized by chaos and complexity
despite a long list of health system inefficiencies that make delivering care challenging
and stressful nurses must maintain balance and ensure safe efficient and high-quality
patient care stevens and colleagues described nurses encounters with operational failures ofs
in the healthcare system that hinder timeliness of care and erode quality and patient
safety3 the multisite study collected data from 774
nurses working in 23 hospitals ofs were found in several categories including
equipmentsupplies informationcommunication medication staffingtraining and physical
unit layout on average nurses reported a rate of 607 sd  710 ofs per shift most
related to equipment and supplies these findings illustrated that nurses commonly encounter
ofs in delivering patient care the frontline nurses intimate knowledge of ofs can
inform operational improvements that not only lead to better quality care but also help
reduce wasted nursing time over a century and a half has passed since nightingale
identified the need for nurses to observe assess understand collect data and plan
nursing care time spent on ofs wastes a nurses precious time creates moral
distress and detracts from core care responsibilities although nurses are effective at identifying ofs theyre often ill-equipped to
complete more in-depth system-level problem solving instead due to the nature of the work
environment nurses are forced to create workarounds unfortunately clinical nurses have
little time to learn and employ second-order problem-solving techniques in which they
investigate and seek to change a problems underlying cause tucker and
colleagues qualitative study examined the daily problem-solving skills of
nurses4 the researchers collected data related to
actual situations and responses to develop theoretical concepts about the phenomenon of
problem-solving behavior using observations of 22 nurses on all three shifts the outcome
demonstrated that nurses do whatever it takes in the moment to take care of their patients
use trial and error to find a solution and only involve others who are closest work friends
in problem solving rather than reporting to the resource that could solve the problem finding solutions to the current perplexing problems in healthcare requires nurses to
develop maintain and refine their critical-thinking skills5 but how do we lead nurses who have deep clinical knowledge and experience
toward developing solutions to systems problems within our organizations and beyond our
walls in the broader healthcare landscape nurse leaders should consider implementing proven
solution-seeking frameworks and problem-solving techniques such as lean methodology and
offering opportunities such as nursing fellowship programs to exercise nurses
critical-thinking skills there are numerous examples of nurses achieving significant
improvements in quality safety and patient outcomes with guidance and frameworks for
improvement lessons from florence nightingale are just as relevant today as they were more
than 150 years ago nurse leaders must embrace the importance of nurturing highly motivated
nurses who are critical thinkers a contemporary form of healthcare performance improvement and problem solving is the use of
lean management techniques lean concepts seek to create a continuous improvement culture in
organizations by developing a management system that focuses on improving quality safety
cost and healthcare delivery processes6 when an
organization commits to developing a lean transformation its essential to assess
the state of nurses improvement thinking and attitudes for example roszell and
lynn sought to measure the success of lean management implementation in their organization
from the nurses perspective by developing the frontline improvement thinking fit
tool7 the nurses were asked to provide their
perceptions of leans impact on the organization the unit and the individual data
from the fit tool can be used to prioritize and focus lean management training and
improvement efforts and identify lean mentors coaches and change agents nurses who
elevate to the level of coach should be afforded opportunities for more in-depth exposure to
lean management and performance improvement techniques through extensive training
programs when equipped with tools and techniques for improvement nurses are a valuable resource to
identify and solve clinical and organizational problems and improve patient outcomes sharpe
described a grant-funded project of 37 hospitals spanning 12 years that empowered frontline
nurses as leaders implementing evidence-based practices to improve quality and safety8 the nurses involved received extensive training in
improvement concepts like nightingale and the scutari nurses frontline nurses were taught
to make improvements and then measure the outcomes the quality improvements measured
included falls with injury sepsis mortality central line-associated bloodstream infections
clabsi hospital-acquired pressure injuries ventilator-acquired pneumonia vap
medication administration errors and acute myocardial infarction mortality forty-three
percent of the hospitals reduced falls with injury 771 improved sepsis mortality
829 improved clabsi rates 697 improved vap rates 100 reduced
medication administration errors and 100 reduced acute myocardial infarction
mortality8 the results achieved by these nurse-led
quality improvement projects are powerful and impactful bramley and colleagues described the chief nurse excellence in care junior fellowship
initiative that provided a small cohort of nurses with an opportunity to advance their
skills in leadership innovation improvement science and change management9 early evaluations from the qualitative study suggested
that providing such a program for frontline nurses enhances professional development and
influences positive patient outcomes case studies of the projects completed by the nurse
fellows were conducted based on the case findings and the fellowship self-evaluation the
study concluded that a fellowship program is a sustainable clinically driven opportunity to
enhance nurses professional development patrician and colleagues highlighted a program put in place at the us veterans affairs va
health administration called the veterans affairs quality scholars fellowship program10 the program was a partnership between the va and the
robert wood johnson foundations quality and safety education for nurses project
with the aim of expanding the fellowship to include nurses in 2009 including nurses in the
program promoted interprofessional education and team development to improve healthcare
quality and safety across the va system as an early indication of effectiveness the first
three nurse fellowship graduates published successful performance improvement work the fellowship approaches described in these examples provided nurses with enriched
opportunities to make a difference in care quality for the populations they serve
reflecting back thats exactly what florence nightingale did for the scutari nurses
she empowered them to observe assess gather data conduct analysis and intervene to solve
problems that got in the way of their patient care and interventions the world health organization has designated 2020 as the international year of the nurse
and midwife celebrating 200 years since florence nightingales birth as nurse
leaders this celebratory year is an opportunity to reflect on the past while looking to the
future of the nursing profession aligning nurses to our professional purpose and delivering
on our promise as caregivers requires special attention to strengthen all nurses
opportunities to engage in solving difficult challenges and critically examining innovative
solutions to todays healthcare problems nurses are in the unique position to thread their knowledge and wisdom of human caring into
creating sustainable solutions as nurse leaders its essential to continually
develop nurses as future change agents development should be extensive with a true
commitment and investment in advancing nurses knowledge and skills in improvement
science a fellowship model that allows for a deeper understanding of performance
improvement tools is paramount the same qualities of courage tenacity and skills nightingale searched for all those
years ago are still foundational for addressing the myriad problems nurses face today and
those yet to emerge a formidable army of highly competent nurses skilled in quality
improvement and inspired to serve as change agents at the frontline can transform our
systems just as nightingale realized over a century and a half ago  assessing the value of pcr assays in oral fluid samples for detecting african swine fever classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease in us swine oriana beemer marta remmenga lori gustafson kamina johnson david hsi maria antognoli celia grzegorz woniakowski   oral fluid of samples are an aggregate sample composed of saliva and mucosal transudate which may contain pathogens antibodies to pathogens or both circulating in the herd collecting of samples offers a convenient and unobtrusive mechanism for evaluating the health status of swine especially those nearing slaughter and movement to slaughternamely growing grower and market hog finisher herds of collection takes advantage of natural swine behavior samples are collected by hanging cotton ropes in one or more pens in a barn for pigs to chew for 2030 minutes causing minimal disruption of animal activities or farm operations 14 the ease of of sample collection and the ability to obtain disease status information from an entire group with a single sample combined with its widespread industry usage for endemic diseases positions of sampling as a strong methodology for on-farm surveillance of swine pathogens producers currently collect and submit of samples to monitor disease status of barns or premises with minimal training and without added cost constraints and biosecurity concerns associated with veterinary or animal health technician farm visits diagnostic testing is currently performed on 30000 of samples per year at three high-volume laboratories representing more than 250 premises for domestic pathogens including swine enteric coronavirus diseases secd porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs influenza a virus in swine iav-s and others 5 6 testing methodologies have been applied to of samples collected from swine including real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr solid-phase competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa virus isolation sequencing and double-antibody sandwich elisa 7 much research has focused on the use of rrt-pcr both single-plex and multi-plex single-plex is the method considered for calculations in this evaluation diagnostic tests for other sample types have been developed for other diseases including the foreign animal diseases considered in this evaluation african swine fever asf classical swine fever csf and foot-and-mouth disease fmd the sensitivity of an rrt-pcr testing protocol applied to of samples is dependent on the matrix in which the target virus is found host factors affecting the concentration or composition of the target virus and non-host factors such as sample quality which includes sample deterioration due to poor handling or excessive environmental contamination 8 the matrix with the target virus may contain inhibitors that could prevent the assay from working the abundance or concentration of the target virus in an of sample is a host factor that depends on the organism concentration in an individual animals oral fluid transudate the number of animals chewing on the rope at collection time and shedding the virus in saliva and the timeliness of the rope sampling relative to the virus shedding window in a field setting diseased animals may represent only a portion of the population in a particular pen of animals 9 10 available information from a study on pigs experimentally infected with asf csf or fmd show that infected animals were observed chewing on ropes until severe clinical signs developed concurrent with or after virus was detectable in of samples 11 regarding the timeliness of rope sampling relative to shedding of virus it is important to note that for all three diseases considered in this evaluation the incubation and infectious periods vary depending on the strain of virus and its virulence 12 from laboratory studies asf and fmd are detectable in of samples before presentation of clinical signs and often concurrent to pyrexia 7 11 13 14 detectable levels of csf virus appear in of samples at the same time or after presentation of clinical signs 11 15 16 mostly described for csf persistently infected animals may result from vertical transmission in-utero or infection shortly after birth in such cases distinct clinical signs may not be present but animals will continue to shed virus without a detectable antibody response 17 18 some strains of asf and csf may present with mild clinical signs indistinguishable from endemic diseases complicating detection by clinical signs alone 18 19 since the use of rrt-pcr diagnostics has not been validated officially for of samples in the united states for the detection of asf csf or fmd this paper use a series of logical arguments informed assumptions and a range of test accuracy parameter values to explore four select hypothetical applications of of sampling and rrt-pcr testing these hypothetical applications are used to inform how this sampling modality might be applied for surveillance in an outbreak and for early detection in a disease-free setting as a screening test all applications require additional refining before fully considering implementation in a regulatory framework a range of other scenarios and direct comparisons to current surveillance systems were outside the scope of the current study and should be explored through other projects outbreak surveillance assuming prevalence detection thresholds of 20 infected pensbarn 33 infected barnspremises and 2 premises per zone prevalence we evaluated two potential surveillance schemes in response to an asf csf or fmd outbreak in both cases the sampling method could be applied to the zones designated around each infected premises but would vary based on the location of infected premises and overlap between multiple zones surveillance in these two zones was evaluated separately as scenario 1outbreak surveillance to support classification of premises status in a control area minimum 10km area located directly around an infected premises and scenario 2 outbreak surveillance within the surveillance zone minimum 10km area that forms a ring around the control area to show no evidence of infection because of differences in specific surveillance objectives required in these zones objective evidence that a premises is not infected vs monitoring for disease spread outside the control area animal movement testing was not evaluated due to information limitations the complexity of different movement scenarios and the high number of movement scenarios early disease detection prior to clinical signs in a disease-free setting two additional scenarios assessed were early disease detection to estimate the sample size needed to meet 095 probability of detection assuming prevalence detection thresholds of 20 pen 33 barn and 2 premises levels we calculated the probability of detecting disease prior to clinical signs using two different testing frequencies of a representative number of of samples from the us swine population scenario 3 was evaluated with a sampling frequency of every 3 days for detection of at least one infected barn per premises scenario 4 was evaluated with sampling on a weekly basis aligning with current industry practices used to monitor endemic diseases 2 5 throughout this document a sample is defined as of collected from one rope from a single pen of 25 animals a sampling event is the compilation of samples collected from a specified unit a pen a barn or a geographic region such as state or country during a predetermined period of time early detection is defined as the ability to detect disease with testing prior to detection by clinical signs further validation refers to the oie definition from chapter 116 of the manual of diagnostic tests and vaccines for terrestrial animals validation is a process that determines the fitness of an assay which has been properly developed optimised and standardised for an intended purpose and as outlined in the validation pathways 8 unless otherwise stated for the remainder of this assessment testing of of samples refers to the three foreign animal diseases listed above the value of the information provided by of sampling was measured by effectiveness which is defined in this document as reaching an ideal surveillance target 095 probability of detecting a disease given a specified prevalence detection threshold in a specified time period at the premises level the surveillance target described the probability of detection that must be met for each scenario considered in the cost-effectiveness evaluation for scenarios 1 and 2 we evaluated cost-effectiveness to determine the best applications for of sampling and testing in field settings compared to the currently outlined individual animal testing plans the cost-effectiveness analysis is readily transferrable to additional pathogens or revised parameter estimates we conducted a cost analysis for all four scenarios to estimate the total cost for each application of of sampling and testing we examined the sample size required to meet differing surveillance objectives scenarios 1 2 and 3 for scenario 4 we calculated the detectable prevalence based on industrys routine of sampling efforts for detection of endemic diseases such as prrs or secd surveillance sampling requirements are influenced by several features of test performance including diagnostic test sensitivity presuming a perfect sample known herd status optimum timing of sample collection relative to the disease detection window and optimized test processing external factors such as pig behavior and environmental impacts on sample quality and the sampling protocol initial and follow-up testing to determine confirmed-positive results the requirements for an effective testing regime are also impacted by temporal accuracy temporal accuracy depends on 1 the length of time the pathogen is shed in ofs at detectable levels in the sample and 2 whether sampling placement frequency and timeliness successfully target high-risk populations and periods finally the sampling requirements are a function of the number of premises and the number of animals on those premises in the population under surveillance and the population of interest which in this evaluation depends on the scenario in addition to information gaps related to test diagnostic sensitivity and field factors the optimal sampling and testing frequency with of samples for asf csf or fmd has not been fully determined test validation is needed particularly a positive cohort study to determine test diagnostic sensitivity while data can be extrapolated from laboratory studies on asf csf and fmd along with field applications of testing for other endemic diseases validated test performance in field settings would help to more accurately calculate sample size false-positive rate and costs the testing frequency is dependent on the incubation period of the given asf csf or fmd strain and the window of detection for the virus in of samples as additional data become available regarding diagnostic test parameters disease distribution movement patterns and similar information sampling design may need to be further refined based on literature summarized in table 1 asf may be detected in of samples 24 days prior to clinical signs csf may be detected in of concurrent to clinical signs and fmd may be detected in of samples 13 days prior to clinical signs note that the specimen types listed are not exhaustive the list includes those samples that would currently be used in an asf csf or fmd investigation or are being compared ie oral fluids there is currently no evidence on how persistently infected animals would relate to asf or csf detection in of samples presumably asf or csf persistently infected animals would be detected by of sampling due to viral shedding without clinical signs this assumption was used in the evaluation for the scenarios evaluated 3 days was assumed to be the number of days the testing could detect disease prior to clinical signs this value falls within the range of both asf and fmd this assumption was also used to estimate how frequently samples would need to be collected to detect disease prior to presentation of clinical signs diagnostic sensitivity and specificity ranges for rrt-pcr on of are shown in table 2 7 11 23 to simplify calculations a follow-up testing protocol was assumed to occur with initial non-negative results to rule out laboratory or test inconsistencies wherein a non-negative result detected at a national animal health laboratory network laboratory would be sent to a usda reference laboratory for follow-up testing 4 the usda reference laboratory was assumed to run the same type of rrt-pcr test on the referred of sample with the same diagnostic specificity initiation of a full fad investigation to run confirmatory testing would occur should the follow-up test also give a non-negative result oral fluid diagnostic test sensitivity used to determine sample size was conservatively assumed to range from 62 to 95 based on previously published values table 2 input from usda national veterinary services laboratories nvsl and near optimal conditions for sample collection and submission based on the range of values from the literature and input from usda nvsl experts the diagnostic test specificity used for these scenarios was estimated to be as low as 99 and as high as 9999 after analyzing data from the national animal health monitoring system and the national agricultural statistics service and consulting with industry experts we selected two example counties in iowa to model the large mock swine populations used in this assessment one example had the highest total swine population eg sioux county with 1177164 swine and one had the highest density of swine per premises eg wright county with an average 13075 swineoperation 24 the number of hogs in the example counties was divided by a typical barn size of 1250 to 1750 animals 5070 pens in a barn and 25 swine per pen to arrive at these estimates 2 5 average number of barns per premises pigs per pen and number of premises in a control area or surveillance zone were calculated based on these characteristics for evaluation using the informed assumptions for the population information we estimated that 25 to 50 premises would fall within a hypothetical control area and 75150 premises would fall within the boundaries of a hypothetical surveillance zone based on a 2 prevalence detection threshold and 1250 animals per barn individual animal sampling would require at least 157 animals to be sampled per premises 20 21 the number of ropes per pen was held constant at one rope per pen 5 for this assessment the pen size was assumed to be 25 swine per pen 5070 pens per barn 12501750 swine per barn 2550 premises per control area and 75150 premises per surveillance zone these characteristics are summarized in table 3 sampling frequencies for scenarios 1 and 2 were taken directly from the current usda fad preparedness and response plan documents for csf and fmd or modeled after these documents in the case of asf 20 21 in both documents testing for acute highly pathogenic strains in the control area should occur on each premises every 5th day for the duration of the area quarantine or a minimum of 28 days in the surveillance zone a subset of premises is randomly selected from the entire population of premises within the zone for sampling to achieve a 5 prevalence detection threshold at the zone level samples from selected premises should occur once during the first 3-week period of the area quarantine then once during each additional 3-week period of the area quarantine for a minimum of two sample collections per surveillance zone the 20132014 usda documents do not outline the specific frequency or use of aggregate samples for testing such as of based on previous modeling work performed by delgado et al 25 to evaluate laboratory response capacity one model suggested that a large-scale fmd outbreak could last 97 days this value was used to calculate the number of sampling events required in an asf csf or fmd outbreak scenario for one control area and surveillance zone sampling frequency for a national-level early detection system was estimated at every 3 days the ideal frequency to detect disease prior to clinical signs for this assessment we applied susceptible exposed infected and recovered seir modeling 2628 with characteristics of a high virulence fmd strain 29 30 these models indicated that testing of samples every 3 days plus monitoring for clinical signs detected disease prior to detection by clinical signs alone more than 95 of the time while weekly testing of of samples plus monitoring for clinical signs found disease prior to detection by clinical signs alone 41 of the time modeling with characteristics for a moderately virulent paderborn strain of csf 31 indicated that weekly testing of of samples for csf plus monitoring for clinical signs would provide a detection advantage compared to relying on clinical signs alone for disease detection it is likely moderate virulence asf or fmd would follow a similar pattern since sampling every 3 days is an ideal but highly intensive sampling frequency scenario 4 was included to evaluate what level of detection could be achieved if sampling frequency reflected monitoring practices industry currently uses for endemic disease typically industry production systems submit weekly samples for monitoring 5 we calculated sample sizes in microsoft excel using the cannon formula to account for imperfect diagnostic test sensitivity 32 for scenario 4 the sample size was calculated based on weekly sampling and the premisesbarn size characteristics specified above to determine the probability of disease detection prior to recognition of clinical signs we evaluated the sampling unit as the barn sampling could potentially be reduced through alternative designs eg addressing spatial autocorrelation however we focused on conventional approaches for this study the probability of detection given disease is present was set at 095 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 with the goal of establishing a disease detection system this equates to 95 certainty the surveillance system would have found the disease if present where presence is defined by the detection threshold or design prevalence while a wide range of pen-level premises-level and population-level prevalence could be used to design a surveillance system this project used examples of 20 infected pens per barn 33 infected barns per premises and 2 premises per zoneregioncountry sampled the 2 premises prevalence with 095 probability of detection has been outlined in the fad preparation and response plan materials 20 21 and has also been used in fmd outbreaks in the united kingdom for designing surveillance zone sampling strategies 33 for scenario 4 the same detection threshold was used to evaluate what probability of detection could be achieved by this scenario the cost of testing the target number of samples is the per-sample cost multiplied by the sample size calculated for the determined objective the cost per of sample was estimated as 556 per collection kit 34 15 shipping and handling assumption and laboratory pcr testing fees of 32 to 35 per sample including possible accession fees 3539 the total estimated cost per of sample tested ranges from 5556 to 6256 for simplicity this evaluation used an estimated 50 per of sample tested to cover the initial test expenses related to collection shipping and laboratory fees based on the assumption that a higher volume of testing could result in a lower per-sample cost this is summarized in table 3 samples with non-negative test results are shipped to nvsl for a follow-up test which is assumed to have the same 50 cost the per-sample cost is 71 for csf confirmatory testing following the current testing protocol ab elisa immunoperoxidase and immunoperoxidase virus neutralization 21 40 the total estimated cost per sample collected and tested for asf or fmd is approximately 140 following the current confirmatory testing protocol using rt-pcr and virus isolation testing costs 20 40 41 for the scenarios in this paper if an oral fluids sample has a non-negative result after follow-up testing at nvsl an fad investigation will be initiated and confirmatory testing will be performed at the nvsl foreign animal disease diagnostic laboratory the estimated value of 8 hours of vs employee time is 400 to complete an fad investigation and ship samples to laboratories for each premises as a result the total cost of a false positive would be a minimum of 471 csf to 540 asf or fmd assuming that samples are collected from one animal during an epidemiologic investigation these costs exclude any domestic business or trade impacts these characteristics are summarized in table 3 several dimensions contribute to the calculations for the overall cost range these include differences in number of oral fluid samples collected because of test sensitivity and specificity ranges in number of sampling events in testing cost of individual samples and in number of epidemiologic investigations and samples collected for confirmatory testing essentially the combination of the lowest values for all applicable dimensions is presented as the lowest bound of the overall cost range while the combination of the highest values for all applicable dimensions is presented as the highest bound of the overall cost range to calculate the total cost to acquire the same disease status information for scenarios 1 and 2 the following information is needed 1 the number of oral fluid samples required 2 the number of samples required to use the current testing protocol and 3 their respective costs cost-effectiveness is calculated by dividing the cost of a surveillance option by its associated cost a lower cost-effectiveness ratio is preferred as it is considered more cost-effective cost savings is the difference between the costs of the two different testing protocols for initial testing not follow-up or confirmatory testing in scenarios 1 and 2 for outbreak surveillance we assumed prevalence detection thresholds of 20 infected pensbarn 33 infected barnspremises and 2 premises per zone prevalence in a control area or surveillance zone table 4 the usda fad preparedness and response plan documents for fmd and csf both indicate that a premises designation within the control area requires objective information on disease status before a premises may be considered for a different designation ie to move from at-risk to monitored because of samples provide aggregate information for the premises as a whole within either a control area or surveillance zone the number of samples required every 5 days for the duration of the outbreak would be much lower for of sampling 3663 samples per premises than for individual animal sampling 157 samples per premises to achieve 095 detection probability at the 20 prevalence detection threshold this difference translates to requiring of sample levels of 23 to 40 of the individual animal sampling levels to acquire the same disease status information oral fluid sampling costs per premises with three barns per control area scenario 1 range from 36000 to 63000 with a cost savings of 194940 to 384600 which is approximately 84 to 86 lower in cost these estimates only include the cost of initial of testing compared to using the current testing protocol plus the cost of an epidemiologic investigation as a proxy for the cost to collect individual samples these do not include any follow-up testing or fad investigations started because of a non-negative test result oral fluid sampling costs per premises with 3 barns per surveillance zone scenario 2 range from 3600 to 15750 with a cost savings from 19494 to 96150 which is also approximately 84 to 86 lower in cost when applied to testing multiple premises within a control area or surveillance zone additional costs may be incurred to evaluate non-negative test results depending on the strategy for handling false positives during an outbreak to achieve a goal of early detection through of sampling and testing at a 095 probability of detection premises level sampling would have to be performed approximately every 3 days for diseases such as asf or fmd given the short window of detection in of samples prior to presentation of clinical signs depending on the test sensitivity the number of samples required could range from 685152 to 1844640 at a cost of between 34257600 and 92232000 with a test specificity ranging from 99 to 9999 the number of false positives to undergo follow-up testing would be expected to range from 69 to 18447 with 0 to 185 additional tests for fad investigations resulting in a combined cost of 3450 to 1022250 for follow-up and confirmatory testing currently collection of of samples for domestic disease testing is generally performed weekly with an average of 1016 samples per premises 5 the average number of samples currently submitted to two large swine veterinary diagnostic laboratories per year is approximately 181000 which we estimate costs 9050000 with a test specificity ranging from 99 to 9999 the number of false positives needing follow-up tests would be expected to range from 19 to 1810 with 0 to 19 additional tests for fad investigations resulting in a combined cost of 950 to 100760 scenario 4 requires 11 to 12 of the of samples required for scenario 3 but can only detect 4 to 8 prevalence instead of the target of 2 premises-level prevalence every 3 days the cost savings following scenario 4 range from 193600 to 342700 which is approximately 88 to 89 lower than scenario 33 with the lower number of samples per barn the ability to detect an infected premises is decreased compared to scenario 3 if the diagnostic test sensitivity is at the low end of the assumed range 062 a sample size of 10 ropes only provides a probability of 051 of detecting at least one infected premises when 2 of the premises are infected with 20 of the pens infected per premises if the test sensitivity is at the high end of the assumed range 095 a sample size of 16 ropes provides a probability of 076 of detecting at least one infected premises when 2 of the premises are infected with 20 of the pens infected per premises outbreak surveillance assuming prevalence detection thresholds of 20 infected pensbarn 33 infected barnspremises and 2 of premises per zone prevalence in a control area or surveillance zone during an outbreak response of sample testing offers many advantages compared to individual animal sampling including minimal disruption of animal and farm activities and a reduction in the number of samples required thus reducing testing costs in both scenarios 1 and 2 the cost-effectiveness ratio of aggregate of samples is lower than individual animal sampling additionally of sample testing could decrease resource utilization given basic training producers can collect and submit of samples to emergency response officials at the premises line of separation emergency response officials would not need to enter the farm this approach could decrease resource costs associated with personal protective equipment waste disposal and personnel downtime between farms minimizing potential contamination between premises by eliminating animal contact depending on the disease of sample testing may detect viral presence prior to or concurrent with clinical signs this information could assist policymakers and incident commanders with more timely cost-effective information upon which to base decisions because poor sample handling technique can decrease test sensitivity a certificationtraining program on proper sample collection and packaging should be implemented for farm personnel accredited veterinarians veterinary paraprofessionals and response officials such a program outlined in the secure pork supply plan for active observational surveillance 44 would assist with outbreak preparedness and should lead to higher quality samples beyond the logistical considerations of using of testing during an asf csf or fmd outbreak sampling is also naturally targeted both spatially and temporally and the duration of sampling is limited by a known period of exposure and a foreseeable end-date the end of the quarantine oral fluid sampling may be highly efficacious in this scenario if the benefit of preventing disease spread is greater than the cost of a short but intensive sampling scheme presuming use during an outbreak to assist in prioritization of incident response activities eg to prioritize order of formal surveillance or inspection visits the consequences of a false negative or positive are similarly constrained laboratory capacity could limit the application of any novel testing strategy if the number of samples generated by an outbreak exceeds laboratory capabilities regardless of the scale of an actual outbreak of collection is expected to generate fewer samples compared with individual animal sampling thus decreasing testing costs and making more effective use of laboratory capacity once test validation information is known further exploration of potential animal movement and continuity of business scenarios would also be informative the early detection scenario was designed with a 095 probability of detecting at least one infected premises prior to clinical signs when infection is at 20 of a pen 33 of a barn and 2 among all premises the scenario assumed sample collection occurred approximately every 3 days to detect disease prior to clinical signs based on the window of detection in of samples for asf and fmd this scenario could be modified to lower levels of sampling for different goals which would still be useful in potentially detecting disease earlier than with passive surveillance alone while lowering overall cost which was partially explored in scenario 4 the windows of detection for asf csf and fmd were extrapolated from laboratory experiments using high virulence strains leading to rapid clinical progression of disease the detection window with of samples and progression of clinical signs are not as thoroughly documented when less virulent strains of asf csf or fmd are studied given the currently available data on highly virulent csf detection in of samples it is unlikely this sampling and testing scenario fits a csf rapid detection purpose because clinical signs if seen at all present at the same time as detectable virus in of samples if viral shedding in ofs occurs before detectable clinical signs for asf csf or fmd are observed the frequency of sampling could be decreased for moderate or low virulence diseases that present with non-specific signs ie csf or fmd of sampling and testing may prove more valuable the seir modelling performed for this assessment with characteristics for a moderately virulent strain of csf paderborn strain indicated there may be an advantage to weekly of sampling and testing for csf it is likely asf and fmd would follow a similar pattern if a low virulence strain or chronic form of the disease were introduced however given the results of this evaluation the potential application of of sampling for active surveillance as a large-scale early detection system would be costly this early detection scenario does not achieve a 095 probability of detecting at least one infected premises prior to clinical signs for the range of test sensitivities evaluated using common industry sample submission practices a higher number of samples submitted per barn or sampling a greater number of premises could achieve 095 probability of detection the scenario presented assumed that each premises collected samples weekly and that the submissions were distributed throughout a given week to temporally space submissions this scenario represents a lower level of sampling than scenario 3 and may still detect disease earlier than passive surveillance alone with a lower overall cost the greatest advantage would likely be realized for diseases with moderate or mild clinical signs which can be difficult to detect or differentiate from other diseases with clinical signs alone ie csf or fmd the cost-effectiveness for scenarios 3 and 4 could be compared to each other however the decreased costs associated with scenario 4 relative to 3 must be carefully balanced with the decreased level of detection capability demonstrated in these two scenarios oral fluids represent a potentially valuable sample source for many different scenarios related to current individual animal asf csf and fmd testing a benefit common to the scenarios is that of sample testing for surveillance could contribute to emergency preparedness and response efforts directed toward asf csf or fmd in swine of the scenarios evaluated of sample testing may be most valuable in an outbreak setting where the use of aggregate screening samples would minimize the disruption of animal and farm activities reduce sample sizes and decrease resource requirements compared to individual animal sampling regimens immediate broad implementation is not possible due to several limitations and information gaps these include 1 usda validation of of sample diagnostics for asf csf and fmd in swine is still underway 2 information on test performance in a field setting is lacking and 3 confirmatory testing of suspected false-positive of sample findings may demand time-intensive or costly follow-up testing protocols eg repeat on-farm sampling andor next generation sequencing this evaluation was based on the current understanding of of sample testing without a usda-validated test test validation efforts through positive and negative cohort studies would improve the broader understanding of of sample testing by rrt-pcr for asf csf or fmd in swine furthermore understanding test characteristics in a field setting could be used to refine sample size requirements these steps would provide reliable test characteristics for more fully evaluating use of this sample and testing method for asf csf or fmd testing and response plans for swine this evaluation should be revised if additional studies provide new or updated information about asf csf or fmd pathogenesis or test characteristics if industry practices change or if fad preparedness and response plan materials are updated  streptococcus suis infection youjun feng huimin zhang zuowei wu shihua wang min cao dan hu changjun wang   streptococcosis is regarded as a leading infectious disease in the swine industry that clinically features with meningitis septicemia or arthritis and annually results in significant economic loss worldwide1
streptococcus suis s suis that was initially reported in 19542 has been demonstrated as an etiological agent for this kind of frequently-occurring bacterial infection13 indeed s suis a complex population consisting of heterogeneous strains4 can be classified into 35 serotypes 134 12 based on the differentiation of capsule antigens13 based on the varied virulence of these bacteria they may be categorized into highly-pathogenic weakly-pathogenic hypo-virulent and nonpathogenic avirulent strains1 generally serotype 2 of s suis ss2 is considered to be the most virulent and is frequently isolated from clinically-diseased piglets1 in fact serotype 9 of s suis is also one of the most important serotypes in several countries of particular note ss2 seems to be a previously neglected but recently emerging human pathogen5 whose infection has become increasingly potent especially in the southeast asian countries like thailand6 vietnam7 and china89 as the primary agent of meningitis septicemia arthritis and as an opportunistic pathogen in the case of pneumonia15
s suis have been reported to have spread over 30 countries andor regions fig 1 and has claimed no less than 1600 human cases some of which were fatal2 also similar clinical symptoms including bacterial meningitis septicemia and arthritis are frequently observed in human ss2 infections23 occasionally serotypes other than ss2 including ss110 ss410 ss51112 ss141314 ss161516 and ss2411 can also be found to function as the causative agents responsible for sporadic cases of human s suis infection3 of note two big outbreaks of human ss2 endemics which occurred in china in 1998 and 2005 respectively91718 have raised serious concerns in public health and have challenged the conventional opinion that human ss2 infections are only present in sporadic cases2819 unfortunately no specificeffective human therapeutics or vaccine against ss2 infections is available thus far considering the severity high mortality and modality of ss2 infection in humans58 it is important to develop a method for convenient and quick diagnosis which can be applied toward local ss2 detection418 over the past four decades significant progress has been made toward better understanding the highly infectious clones of s suis at the time of formulating this review 1104 articles were available in pubmed regarding s suis httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedtermstreptococcussuistotally over 20 bacterial virulence-associated factors have been identified that include capsular polysaccharides cps20 muramidase-released protein mrp21 and suilysin sly22 to date genomic sequences of a collection of s suis strains are available fig 2 the majority of which are derived from ss2 species2324 except two newly-released genomes which correspond to ss325 and ss1426 respectively genomic mining combined with bacterial genetics have elucidated that chinese epidemic strains of highly pathogenic s suis 2 carry a specific 89k pai pathogenicity island2327 further studies suggested that 89k pai with a transposon-like essence can undergo gi-type t4ss-mediated horizontal transfer in epidemic ss2 species28 the systematic elucidation of the of s suis pathogenesis in the omics era was illustrated by functional definition of a collection of other new genes or putative orthologs such as zur a zinc uptake regulator29 covr an orphan response regulator30 and rgg-like transcription factor31 following the release of the genome sequence of ss2 eg 05zyh3323 although we have gained a partial glimpse of the molecular mechanism underlying the high pathogenicity of ss2 itself we are still lacking further insights into the interface between the ss2 pathogen and the host it infects38 in this review we aim to describe an updated but partial picture of ss2 as an emerging infectious agent which centers on five aspects global epidemiologydistribution clinical diagnosticstyping pathogenesis protective antigencandidate vaccine and zoonotic potential s suis is a group of heterogeneous gram-positive bacteria that were earlier classified into lancefield groups r s and t fig 31 these bacteria are facultative anaerobes with a sphericalovoid shape which exist in pairs andor short chains fig 3b and c generally these microorganisms show either -hemolysis when growing on selective plates of horse blood agar1 fig 3a given the variation in their cps antigens 35 serotypes have been proposed for s suis population1 very few studies of pathogenicity have been done for serotypes other than serotypes 2 1 and 71 among them ss2 is recognized as the most virulent species that is frequently associated with diseased pigs and often causes an opportunistic infection of adults having occupational contact with pig carcass or pork-related products25 s suis an important animal pathogen naturally inhabits in the upper respiratory particularly the tonsils and nasal cavities genital and alimentary tracts of piglets132 in addition to the natural host swine fig 3d this pathogen has been suggested to be isolated from a wide range of other animals such as horses dogs and cats133 of note some variants of s suis probably have evolved into highly infectious zoonotic agents that can cause meningitis septicemia arthritis and even streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome which can cause rapid death in humans9171834 soon after the big outbreak of human ss2 infections in china in 2005 serious concerns from both the public health and scientific community have been raised18 toward better understanding and preventioncontrol of ss2 infections multiple lines of new bacterial virulence determinants such as salksalr two component system27 feob transporter35 and rgg regulator31 have been identified and fast assays using pcr-based molecular detection18 as well as elisa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-guided diagnostics were established36 table 1 most recently epidemiological investigations conducted in vietnam proposed that 1 pig population in slaughterhouses is a major reservoir of ss2 with a capacity to cause human infections37 and 2 the most important risk factors of human s suis infections are consecutively eating high risk pork-derived dishes occupational exposure to pigs and pork-related products and preparation of pork in the presence of skin lesions38 the availability of the epidemiological knowledge on human ss2 infections is critical to improve the current situation of public awareness of ss2 infections and to effectively prevent the potential occupational infections caused by ss2 genomicsproteomics approaches to probe s suis have yielded unprecedented comprehensive informationknowledge about this pathogen839 at the time of writing this review no less than 14 genomes of s suis strains have been available in pubmed httpwwwncbinlmnihgovsitesentrezdbgenomecmddetailssearchtermstreptococcussuissavesearchfalse most of which were completed by the research groups in china fig 2 genomic sequence analyses of s suis showed that 1 all the sequenced genomes feature with the nearly same average gc content 41 indicating slight evolutionary conservation 2 genome size varies markedly from 1 640 446 nt 05has68 nzaard00000000 to 2 146 229 nt bm407 nc012926 reflecting the genomic flexibility present in these species fig 2b 3 the number of putative protein-encoding genes is dramatically different 1559 for 05has68 and 1932 for bm407 suggesting that nearly 1516 of total genes are not essential redundant for bacterial viability and might confer some newunknown functions to adapt to varied environmental niches functionalcomparative genomics of s suis has defined a series of new infectionvirulence-related determinants such as argr regulator40 sspa a subtilisin-like protease41 ciarh two-component regulatory system42 and so on on the other hand proteomics analyses of chinese epidemic ss2 strain 05zyh33 identified 373 proteins in total from 834 processed spots43 using an immune-proteomic approach lus group revealed 11 membrane-related proteins from chinese vaccine strain ss2-ha980144 and 9 extracellular antigenic proteins from the virulent chinese ss2 strain zy0571945 respectively using a similar strategy wu and coauthors from the same group addressed two strains of ss9 another prevalent serotype of s suis gz0565 and sh040197 and observed 13 candidate proteins five of which are virulence-associated factors46 additionally eight immunogenic proteins localized on bacterial surface were determined in strain gz0565 including extracellular solute-binding protein47 these findings might provide a solidreasonable basis for development of subunit vaccine candidates39 as a swine pathogen s suis was first reported by a vegetarian in 19542 while its zoonotic role could be traced to a human ss2 meningitis case in denmark in 19681 in light of the available literature with human s suis infection recorded thus far we expect that s suis infections have been involved in no less than 30 countries andor regions fig 1 and resulted in around 1600 cases of severe human infections2848 in north america united states4950 and canada5152 and the south american countries argentina5354 chile55 and french guiana56 only a very few cases of human ss2 infections were reported human ss2 infections are featuring with sporadic cases in europe ireland3 the united kingdom uk3 france3 spain57 netherlands58 belgium3 poland61 sweden3 denmark1 germany62 hungary3 austria63 croatia64 italy65-67 greece68 and portugal1 some asian countries laos1 singapore3369 india2370 korea71-73 japan74 hong kong75-80 taiwan338182 and philippine23 australia8384 and new zealand8586 so far endemics of human ss2 infections was only observed in two asian counties vietnam27163738 and thailand6111487 of particular note coexistence of sporadic cases and epidemics of human ss2 infections were present in china48917-193348 it seemed true that the majority of human ss2 infection cases occurred in southeast asia especially vietnam thailand and china indicating an obvious geographic tropism fig 1 although we are not quite sure what mechanism can explain such kind of tropism we anticipate that the following factors are probably correlated with frequent occurrence of human ss2 infections in above countries which include 1 similar local climates andor environments 2 backyard cultivation of pigs and 3 popular consumption of raw pork sold in the wet market during the past 40 years around 100 cases of human s suis infections were estimated in european countries among them the top three countries in the history of human ss2 infections recorded are netherlands 41 cases united kingdom 15 cases and denmark 12 cases2 the rest of the european countries such as france and germany had less than ten sporadic cases of human infection2 moreover the prevalent type of clinical disease caused by s suis infections in these countries is bacterial meningitis although human s suis infections are considered sporadic cases in most countries258 it is unbelievable that its zoonotic infectious events are rarely reported in north america canada and usa two huge countries with numerous large and frequent swine operations35 to the best of our knowledge only three human ss2 meningitis cases were confirmed in usa495089 and three cases were diagnosed in canada one case was due to ss14 and the other 2 cases were caused by ss25152 gottschalk and coworkers3 believe that this small number of reported cases from these two huge countries with a big industry for pig cultivation might be attributed to the following two major reasons 1 clinical under-diagnosis andor misdiagnosis of s suis infection rather than true absence of this infectious disease 2 s suis isolates in north america are less virulent relative to those from europe and asia a pilot study conducted by smith et al90 recently indicated that human infection with s suis is more common in the united states than what it is generally thought the reason might lie in underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis rather than a real lacking of disease39192 on this issue we doubt the current situation of s suis infections as well though we agree that good hygiene conditions and prevention strategies during the whole process of pork operation eg wearing gloves might secure the major route of bacterial entry into blood by small cuts in the skins and greatly decrease the incidents of s suis infections in north america therefore we believe that it is necessary to employ combined specific approaches like multiplex pcr plus elisa for the re-evaluation of the epidemiological aspects of human s suis infections in north america interestingly schmid et al93 recently demonstrated that american ss2 isolates do not carry 89k pai a dna fragment present in chinese epidemic strain which might be helpful for development of an american ss2 strain-specific pcr detection assay accumulated epidemiological data suggests that over 85 of total cases have occurred in asian countries2 the cases of human ss2 infections in the mainland of china and vietnam are comparable2816 relative to the above 2 countries the human cases clinically infected by s suis are second61487 of being noteworthy ss2 has been recognized as a pathogen with the mostly-relevance to human bacterial meningitis in southern vietnam16 in hongkong the specialized administrative region of china the first human case of s suis infection was recorded in 19837880 and the accumulated number of s suis infections were estimated to be about 60 cases7578 in particular two big outbreaks of human ss2 infections in china 1998 and 2005 seriously challenged public health918 in the 1998 epidemic 14 out of 25 ss2-infected persons died along with an estimated 80 000 pigs18 in the 2005 epidemic totally 215 patients had ss2 infections 38 of which are dead a similar scenario was also observed when more than 600 pigs were demonstrated to be infected by ss2918 the causative agents of the both epidemics were subsequently determined to be highly invasive clones of strong virulent ss2 strain that seemed to have acquired a new pathogenicity island 89k82394 additionally sporadic human meningitis cases caused by ss2 infections were observed in three other cities of china shenzhen city chongqing city and nanjing city in 2007495 implying that the situation of ss2 infection in china is complicated this could be due to variants of s suis 2 identified in subsequent investigations it might be of much interest to unveil the possible evolutionary relationship of the chinese epidemic strain with those of the neighboring country like vietnam through comparative genomics fasteffective detection and analyses of s suis is critical for the prevention andor diagnosis of endemic s suis 2 infection in the swine industry as well as for s suis infected patients three types of experimental approaches are available thus far that consist of 1 selective media-based microbiological cultivation 2 molecular tests and 3 immunological assays table 1 given its advantage in sensitivity and fastness the second method has been experimentally developed into two subgroups pcr-based detection plus typing-oriented analyses like pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pfge and restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp and might be potential in clinical re-confirmation andor re-valiadtion generally pcr assays can be classified into six kinds among which multiplex-pcr using sets of specific primers including epf mrp and gdh is appreciably-valid approach to assay ss2 and applied in some countries table 1 the major four kinds of typing methods include pfge rflp multi-locus sequence typing mlst and random amplified polymorphic dna rapd some of which have derivatives such as isr-rflp table 1 in general the three experimental methods pfge rflp and rapd can return clues about genomic differences between different strainsserotypes given direct sequencing of multiple loci cpn60 dpr reca aroa thra gki and muts mlst can directly capture the nucleotide sequence deviation used for typing purpose among the immunological approaches elisa could be the most popular way to address s suis infection in some experimental tests table 1 in fact different versions of elisa have been developed that are based on various capture antigens identified to be specifically against s suis 2 we have also established two kinds elisa assays one is based on sao protein436 the other on enolase surface antigen96 both of which work well in our trials during field screening and clinical detections recently two more new derivative methods were reported which are immunochromatographic strip9798 and electrochemiluminescence immunosensor99 respectively table 1 the clinical consequence of s suis infection is determined by the complicated interplay between this zoonotic pathogen and its host a series of bacterial components as well as a collection of host cell factors contribute to this pathogenesis-related process so far almost 60 bacterial components have been identified to be involved in the infection andor pathogenicity of s suis table 2 of particular note wilson and coworkers100 developed a powerful signature-tagged mutagenesis stm system for s suis and identified nearly 20 potential virulence associate elements through screening the library consisting of approximately 2600 mutants table 2 however exact roles of these genes needed further verification according to their general roles in the context of bacterial life cycles these bacterial virulence-associated factors were temporarily classified into the following three sub-groups of note some genes probably can be attributed to two different classifications due to their dual characteristics 1 surfacesecreted elements 2 enzymesproteases 3 transcription factorsregulatory systems and 4 others transporterssecretion systems table 2 for subgroup 1 a total of 17 genesgene clusters have been determined thus far to contribute to bacterial pathogenicity table 2 in addition to six previously identified elements capsular polysaccharides cps20101 extracellular protein factor ef102 fibronectin binding factor fbp103 muramidase-released protein mrp102 a protein of 38 kda localized on bacterial surface abbreviated 38 kda104 and thio-activated hemolysin with known crystal structure suilysin sly105106 plus implication into bacterial meningitis107 11 more members have been supplemented into this group that include sspa the surface-associated subtilisin-like serine protease41108109 htps a novel immunogenic cell surface-exposed protein110 and sat surface protein111112table 2 like fbp103 the gene ssu051311 with unknown function was determined to be one more surface anchored fibronectin-binding protein more importantly this surface protein functions in vivo in crossing the mucosal epithelia to disseminate suggesting it is a novel virulence factor113 two independent research groups one from canada41 and another from china114 identified the subtilisin-like protease sspa-encoding gene sspa ssu0757 from the s suis organism by screening the mutant library and genomic expression library respectively sspa proteinase possesses a typical cell wall anchoring signal lpxtg at its c-terminus implying it is a cell surface-displayed protein108 infection assays have demonstrated that sspa protein plays critical roles in ss2 pathogenicity108109114 a subsequent study further revealed that s suis sspa protease might modulate cytokine secretion by macrophages and thus trigger central nervous system inflammation associated with bacterial meningitis frequently observed in ss2-infected patients as well as piglets41 hp0197 is a new a surface protective antigen that was originally identified by jins group in 2009 this immunogenic antigen can elicit obvious humoral antibody response and confer efficient protection against ss2 challenge in the infection models of both mice and pigs115 subsequently hp0197 protein was found to interact with host cell surface glycosaminoglycans gags and the binding sites were further proved by solving the x-ray structure of n-terminal gag-binding domain combined with site-directed mutagenesis plus indirect immunofluorescence assay116 very recently the same research group reported that hp0197 is involved in bacterial virulence by evaluating the performance of the isogenic mutant hp0197 in both mice and pigs117 a reasonable interpretation would be that virulence attenuation is due to easier clearance of the hp0197 mutant by host immunological system during the stage of infection and the fast clearance is attributed to the reduced cps thickness and decreased resistance to phagocytosis117 further comparative transcriptomics-based analyses elucidated that expression of cps synthetic operon is downregulated in the hp0197 mutant relative to the wild-type strain117 also the introduction of plasmid-borne hp0197 gene into the hp0197 mutant can restore the decreased expression level of cps operon to those seen with the wild type strain117 this observation is consistent with the fact that ccpa a global carbon catabolite regulator contributes to bacterial infectivitypathogenicity118119 preliminary evidence pointed out that hp0197 might determine the ser-46 phosphorylation level of phospho carrier protein hpr-46 a partner protein of ccpa in binding the catabolite-responsive elements cre of the target operons together it suggested that integration of the posttranslational modification of hpr-46 and ccpa-mediated transcriptional regulation is linked to regulatory network of bacterial virulence the serum opacity factor of s suis ofs is a putative member belonging to the family of mscramm microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules120 n-terminal region of ofs exhibits similarity to the serum opacity factor of streptococcus pyogenes and fibronectin-binding protein a fnba of streptococcus dysgalactiae and its c-terminus harbors repetitive sequence elements crude extract of s suis and the recombinant ofs protein both possessed serum opacification activity experimental infections demonstrated that the deletion of the ofs gene severely impairs s suis virulence120 sao is a surface antigen first identified by li et al121 which can react with convalescent-phase sera from pigs clinically infected by s suis type 2 subsequently recombinant sao formulated with quil a was found to induce potent opsonizing antibody responses and confer cross-protection of mice against challenges of virulent heterogeneous s suis122 we also discovered that three allelic variants of the sao gene namely sao-s sao-m and sao-l are present in s suis population and we have developed an efficient elisa method in which sao-m protein serves as the capture antigen36 recent further genetic study suggested that sao protein is only a minor virulence factor123 sat hp272 is another newly-identified surface protein from the s suis serotype 2111112 and two different research groups have shown evidence that recombinant sat protein can confer effective immuno-protection of mice against ss2 infections implying that it is a vaccine molecule candidate111112 in addition htps a putative member of histidine triad protein family was determined to be cell surface-associated protein that was expressed during the infection of chinese ss2 strain 05zyh33110 moreover recombinant htps protein was demonstrated to function as a protective antigen against ss2 infections110 similarly zhang et al124 recently defined another new infection-associated antigen protein trag using in vivo-induced antigen technology iviat an inactivation of the trag gene was observed to attenuate full virulence of chinese ss2 strain in the experimental model of zebrafish124 as a surface protein papi-2 was found to constitute an ancillary pilus subunit and exhibit ability to confer protection of mice against serious challenge of s suis125 although we have never reported evidence that zur a zinc uptake regulator is essential for s suis virulence29 aranda et al very recently reported that the zinc-binding lipoprotein 103 the structural component of zinc uptake system is associated with the infectivity of streptococcus suis implying that zinc uptake system might be involved into bacterial pathogenesis126 this discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that the deletion of zur only partially affect expression of zinc uptake system genes whereas inactivation of 103 completely impairs zinc uptake system that is why the latter could more seriously disrupt the normal zinc metabolism and in turn lead to virulence attenuation in this sick bacterium accumulated data has suggested that no less than 20 bacterial enzymes might be implicated in the manifestation of s suis virulence table 2 among them eight enzymes are proposed to be virulence factors by wilson et al100 using the system of signature-tagged mutagenesis table 2 four of them are generally regarded as enzymes of central metabolism which separately correspond to 1 glna glutamine synthetase127 2 gdh glutamate dehydrogenase128 3 enolase catalyzing dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphor-enolpyruvate96129130 and 4 impdh inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase131 five of these enzymes are directly or indirectly related to synthesis andor modification of bacterial surface structure including dlta an enzyme catalyzing lipoteichoic d-alanylation132 pgda peptidoglycan n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase133 apua a bifunctional amylopullulanase134 dpp iv di-peptidyl peptidase iv135 and sortase a a transpeptidase136137 one of the remaining two enzymes is iga1 protease which has highly immune-reactive activity to convalescent sera138 and the other is s-ribosylhomocycteinase luxs catalyzing synthesis of auto-inducer 2 ai-2 utilized in interspecies quorum sensing139140 as follows we will discuss the roles of these enzymes in s suis pathogenesis with the exceptions of neub and neuc the remaining six among the eight enzymes proposed by wilson including endo--n-acetylglucosaminidase endo d sucrose phosphorylase gtfa adenylosuccinate synthetase pura phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase purd sucrose-6phosphate hydrolase scrb cytidine deaminase cdd are poorly addressed and require further experimental validation100 neub is a sialic acid synthase that catalyzes the last committed step of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of sialic acid a major element of bacterial surface structure recently we systematically addressed its molecular and immunological role in bacterial virulence and claimed that an altered architecture of s suis surface attenuates its virulence100141 similarly neuc that encodes udp n-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase with an involvement in sialic acid biosynthesis is also found to be essential for capsule production and required for virulence in a mouse infection model142 gdh the glutamine dehydrogenase-encoding gene was originally known as a virulence factor it has been widely applied to develop effective methods for differentiate and detect virulent streptococcus suis species128 si et al127 demonstrated that glutamine synthetase the glna-encoding product is associated with s suis virulence using a mouse model we and two other research groups96129143 have reported that s suis enolase acts as an octamer144 and can exported to the bacterial surface with capability of binding to host fibronectin indicating its possible role in crosstalk between pathogen and host however the protective efficiency of recombinant enolase with different bacterial origins does not seem consistent96129130 similarly the gene encoding inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase a nucleotide metabolism-related enzyme was initially cloned by lus research group and was subsequently suggested to be involved in full virulence of ss2-h a chinese strain in the infection model of piglets131 modification of the bacterial surface is critical for successful invasion and entry of pathogens into host cells gottschalks group systemically evaluated contributions of two kinds of modification systems to s suis pathogenicity lipoteichoic acid lta-d-alanylation and peptidoglycan pg n-deacetylation respectively132133 the dlta mutant with defection in lta d-alanylation was found to be attenuated in its virulence which can be correlated with its diminished adherenceinvasion of porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells and decreased capacity to escape immune clearance or killing by porcine neutrophils132 fittipaldi et al133 observed that the expression level of the pgda gene can be induced upon interaction of ss2 with neutrophils in vitro and infected mice in vivo implying that pg n-deacetylation is tightly involved in ss2 infections this hypothesis was further validated by virulence attenuation of the pgda mutant of ss2 not only does apua behave like a bacterial surface protein with a lpktge cell-wall-anchoring motif at c-terminus but it also functions as a bi-functional amylopullulanase134 further genetic study showed that the multifunctional -glucan-degrading enzyme apua can promote adhesion to porcine epithelium and mucus which might link bacterial carbohydrate utilization to its capability of colonization and invasiveness into hosts we and the other research group demonstrated that sortase a srta originally referred to as a transpeptidase in staphylococcus aureus is essential for full virulence of ss2136137 however other sortase paralogs srtbcd are not associated with bacterial virulence145 in addition we reported the functional definition of di-peptidyl peptidase iv dpp iv in s suis 2 and also confirmed that it does contribute greatly to bacterial virulence135 quorum sensing is a method of bacterial cell density-dependent communication using secreted chemical molecules like the auto-inducer as a form of language the luxs gene product is the synthetase of autoinducer 2 ai-2 that is required for interspecies communication recently we and lus group both defined a functional luxs member present in chinese isolates of s suis 2 and demonstrated its relevance to bacterial virulence139140 zhang et al identified that iga1 protease an immune-dominant antigen is necessary for full virulence of s suis 2138 additionally gruening et al146 proved that the arginine deiminase system ads encoded by arcabc operon is necessary for s suis survival in acidic stress indicating its possibility of correlating with bacterial successful infection very recently it was discovered that the adenosine synthase functions as an effector in evasion of pmns-mediated innate immunity147 it might suggest possibility that cyclic amp camp-dependent signaling is linked to streptococcal infectivity given the fact that cadd enzyme camp deaminase from leptospira148 can quench camp-dependent signaling it would be of interest to test the hypothesis that in vivo expression of cadd protein in s suis modulate bacterial pathogenesis or not no less than 16 pleiotropic regulators have been suggested to be involved in modulation of s suis virulence which consist of nine transcription factors five well-studied ones adcr149

feoba encoding an iron transporter system might represent the first example of the fact that the machinery of a transporter can be involved in s suis pathogenicity35 after li et al28 defined transposal characteristics of 89k pai in epidemic strain of chinese virulent ss2 hus group recently obtained further insights into 89k pai in addition to virulence-determining element salk-salr tcs system 89k pai also carried a second virulence factor vird4-virb4 a type iv-like secretion system unexpectedly this t4ss-like system is responsible for stimulating host immune reaction observed in mice infected with chinese streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome stsls-causing strain of s suis 2 160 raising a possible relationship of 89k to molecularimmunological machinery by which this non-group a streptococcus gas ss2 to cause stsls in infected patients fig 4 finally wilson et al also suggested that 05ssu0660 an uncharacterized protein homologous to s pneumonia spr1018 might be a virulence factor100 pathogens have evolved capacity to recruithijack host cell factors for their successful infectionsinvasions so far the majority of host cell factors identified to be involved in s suis pathogenesis are immunologicalapoptoticinflammatory factors nearly ten years ago gottschalk et al161 had observed that cell wall components of s suis can induce releases of interleukin-1 il-1 il-8 monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mcp-1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells bmec which might increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier using the experimental model of cd1 mice the same group observed that 1 20 animals with sudden death exhibit high levels of systemic tnf- il-6 il-12 ifn- ccl2 cxcl1 and ccl5 24 h after infection 2 infected mice that survived the early sepsis later developed clinical signs of meningitis present in the transcriptional activation of tlr2 tlr3 cd14 nfb il-1 ccl2 and tnf- mainly in myeloid cells located in affected cerebral structures162 apparently the inflammatory response plays important roles in s suis infection of cd1 mice similar observation was also reported by scherk et al163 that s suis infections are correlated with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines eg il6 and il8 gottschalk et al found that the toll-like receptor 2 tlr-2-deficient exhibit significantly reduced production of astrocytes164 and proposed that bacterial polysaccharides probably modulates tlr2-dependent recognition of s suis entryinvasiveness into cd1 mice165 using a transcriptomic approach de greeff et al166 identified macrophage-specific genes il-1- mip-2- and tnf- with significantly different expression upon s suis infection suggesting that map-kinase signaling pathway and nfb signaling are implicated into response of porcine alveolar macrophages to s suis infections additionally wu et al167 verified that a novel murine ribonuclease angiogenin inhibitor 1 ai1 can bind to s suis hyaluronidase hyl and hypothesized that this interaction between host ai1 partner and bacterial hyl protein might contribute to s suis meningitis development of a safe and efficient vaccine is a useful strategy to combat against s suis infection in contrast to conventional killedlive whole-bacteria vaccines168-170 engineering of subunit vaccine exhibits significant advantage in its safety and its large-scale producibility171 identification of protective antigens is a prerequisite for identifying candidate vaccine molecules totally there are no less than 15 protective antigens identified thus far table 3 among them four molecules of protective antigen are well-known virulence associated factors and are mrp ef 38 kda and sly table 3 of note most of the remaining 10 protein antigens were elucidated by research groups in china in 2009 in addition to identification of the known protective antigen sly lius report verified three more new protective antigens that are rtx family exoprotein a rfea epidermal surface antigen esa and immunoglobulin g igg-binding protein ibp172 two different research groups from china confirmed that enolase an enzyme of central metabolism acts as a protective antigen displayed on bacterial surface96129 however esgleas and coworker130 reported an opposite result regarding the protective efficiency of enolase in mice this discrepancy could be due to different versions of recombinant protein different strains plus deviations in animal vaccination protocols in particular note all the three newly-identified immunogenic antigens 6pgd hp0197 and hp245 are elucidated by the same chens research group in china table 3 interestingly proteomics also facilitated to discover three new immunogenic proteins sspepo173 sat hp0272112174 and the pilus subunit papi-2b125 table 3 in disagreement with their former observation121 li and coworkers122 demonstrated that sao surface antigen can confer efficient protection in both mice and piglets against virulent ss2 infection table 3 meningitis is medically defined as an inflammation of the lining that covers the brain and spinal cord the meninges101660 this kind of inflammation usually initiates with a brief influenza-like prodroma and results in hearing impairment or loss77175 generally meningitis can be grouped into two types bacterial and non-bacterial eg viral or fungal meningitis77 for the former no less than 10 kinds of bacterial pathogens such as mycobacteria tuberculosis streptococcus pneumonia and staphylococcus aureus have been determined as the causatives of development of human meningitis3377 although ss2 is a swine pathogen we have come to know that ss2 can also be a severe agent for human bacterial meningitis6088 the first case of human ss2 infection worldwide was recorded in denmark in 19681 hui et al declared that ss2 would be another leading cause of the so-called community-acquired meningitis which is only inferior to m tuberculosis and s pneumonia77 a systematic survey of bacterial meningitis in vietnamese adults recently suggested that 1 ss2 with multiple virulence factors eg epf sly mrp is the most common pathogen and 2 its mortality is relatively low 26 but hearing loss occurs at high percentage 66416 moreover hoa et al176 addressed the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of s suis strains from meningitis patients an important question using comprehensive approaches to analyze bacterial isolates in vietnam from 1997 to 2008 as result they found that 1 multidrug resistance in s suis 2 causing meningitis in southern vietnam has increased over the 11-y period studied 2 the tetl carried in these bacteria is functionally expressed and multiple other genes are probably co-expressed176 these findings alerted us again that it is important to minimize abuse of antibiotics in treatment of bacterial infectious diseases and that the development of new therapeutics against ss2 infections are in great demand fortunately ho et al177 reported the largest prospective epidemiological survey of human ss2 meningitis in vietnam and pointed out that three important risk factors associated with human ss2 meningitis included 1 eating high risk dishes popular in southeast asia 2 occupational exposure to pigs andor pork-related products and 3 preparation of pork in the presence of skin lesions further investigations from the same research group demonstrated that slaughterhouse pigs are a major reservoir of ss2 that led to human infections of ss2 meningitis in southern vietnam178 it highlighted 1 the importance of an improved hygiene at pork processing facilities and 2 the necessity for education programs concerning food safety and proper handling of pork178 similar findings were also noted in the netherlands59 and new zealand86179 in the netherlands researchers have clearly indicated that the risk of developing ss2 meningitis among abattoir workers butchers and pig breeders are above 1000 times higher than that among persons without close contact with pigs or their unprocessed pork products59 to our surprise a study performed in new zealand revealed that a high ratio of farmers and meat inspectors in markets were sero-positive to ss2 suggesting the presence of human sub-clinical ss2 infections to a small extent86179 septicemia is a serious and life-threatening infection in which a large amount of bacteria are present in the blood it is commonly referred to as blood poisoning or bacteremia with sepsis1 this disease often causes multi-organ failure by reducing the amount of blood reaching vital organs such as the liver and kidneys14875 in addition to the known bacterial pathogens such as staphylococcus with capability of leading to septicemia with about 25 lethal rate1180 ss2 is also a causative agent of this disease1 in general ss2-caused septicemia arises as a result of the localized infection in the body especially cut skin1 in patients with septicemia some of the following symptoms can be observed fever and chills rising heartrespiratory rate cold and clammy feeling fallen blood pressure paled and petechial skin and ultimately even unconsciousness ss2 most likely releases some toxins into the blood that break down the walls of blood vessels which allows blood to leak out under the skin it is this leaking that causes the rash or petechiae33 in some cases ss2 infects the bloodstream and the meninges at the same time causing both septicemia and meningitis33181 due to the rapidly progressive condition of septicemia it can evolve into an irreversible toxic shock and even acute death if sufferers do not receive urgent treatment33181182 certainly an antibiotic remedy could be altered quickly to treat the target bacteria agents when medical tests have identified which bacteria cause the septicemia and which antibiotics are best effective33182 of note some medical treatments themselves are the inducers of septicemia eg dental treatment long-term use of intravenous needles a colostomy and so on33175 collectively septicemia is so serious and complex that it deserves a lot of attention worldwide in addition to the above two major forms of ss2-caused diseases there are some other clinical types that occur less frequently in the cases of human ss2 infections including arthritis endocarditis streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome stsls etc since stsls is a newly-described disease form of ss2 infections fig 4 here we have discussed it in detail toxic-shock syndrome refers to a highly invasive infection of deep tissues and can be correlated with production of bacterial super-antigens eg staphylococcal and streptococcal exotoxins183184 before tang et al18 formally proposed that ss2 is another bacterial non-gas agent responsible for stsls we had been aware that staphylococcus185186 and streptococcus pyogenes a group a streptococcus gas183184 are both leading pathogens with a capability of causing stsls the clinical criteria for diagnosis of stsls disease can be described as follows 1 clear erythematous blanching rash fig 4 2 sudden onset of high fever 3 hypotension diarrhea 4 blood spots and petechiae and 5 dysfunction of multiple organs eg disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute renal failure8918 according to above clinical criteria two independent research groups in china reported two big outbreaks of human ss2-caused stsls which occurred in jiangsu province 1998 and sichuan province 2005 respectively917-1934 two models have been proposed to explain the molecular mechanism by which ss2 triggers stsls in its infected patients one of which is a two-stage hypothesis94 the other is a specific 89k pai23160 although we came to know that similar findings were also recorded in thailand187 france188 and australia84 we did not gain any information on difference of these ss2 strains abroad in comparison with chinese stsls-causing isolates given that the above two models are based on evidence from studying the chinese ss2 strains we cant conclude presently that they represent common or strain-specific mechanisms two kinds of non-ss2 serotypes have been determined in sporadic cases of human s suis infections one of these is ss1413 and the other is ss1616 poggenborg and coworker189 reported a pig-farm worker with ss14 meningitis and septicaemia complicated with thoracal and lumbar spine spondylodiscitis similarly ahmed et al13 also documented a meningitis case caused by ss14 infections in a female patient with occupational exposure to piglets each day of particular note totally 12 cases of human ss14 infections were identified in thailand during 20062008 and their clinical presentations included meningitis septic arthritis and sepsis14 further analyses demonstrated that 11 of the 12 ss14 isolates from these patients belonged to the multilocus sequence types st 105 suggesting clonal dissemination of st105 strains in thailand in another neighboring asian country vietnam a fatal case of human ss16 infection was revealed by schultszs research group16 indicating multiple serotypes of s suis are developing into human pathogens circulating in this country together non-ss2 serotypes of s suis have also exhibited its zoonotic potential highlighting a great demand for monitoring their epidemiology and development of relevant approaches applied toward prevention and therapeutics as a zoonotic agent s suis is gathering increasing accumulated attention from public health officials as well as the relevant academic community238 with respect to s suis epidemiology we believe that current situation of human ss2 infections should be re-evaluated using comprehensive approaches to minimize the occupational infections by s suis it is suggested that advances be made to improve public awareness of s suis infection by science education and popularization although progress has been obtained toward understanding s suis pathogenicity especially identifying a group of bacterial virulence factors it still sounds fragmentary and lacks an insightful dissection of integrated regulatory networks of bacterial virulence in the future an important direction would be to link posttranscriptional regulation eg ncrna and riboswitch and modification such as acetylation and de-acetylation to the bacterial virulence of streptococcus suis190 moreover structural information on these virulence factors is very limited table 2 we therefore believe it is necessary to strengthen the study of pathogenesis-related structural biology which could establish a solid basis for design of small molecule drugs targeting bacterial virulence factors it is of interest to search for other virulence-related or immunological regulatory elements different from 89k pai because of recent exciting findings on this issue160 safe and effective vaccines that can be used for patients is still not available which is due to lack of comprehensive knowledge of s suis infections description of a full picture of s suis surface antigen proteins might be helpful to screen andor design vaccine molecules candidate the fact that non-ss2 serotypes of s suis can affect humans and even lead to fatal infections has put the situation of s suis infection in a much more complicated and serious status in public health this might be an alternate way to decode the genome sequences of all 35 kinds of different serotypes providing new insights into evolution and diversity of heterogeneous species as well as distinct clues for preventing and controlling severe infections by these pathogens191192 systematic proteomic approaches are also encouraged to further address this question which can complement genomics-based explorations138 in summary our understanding and response to the situation of s suis infections occurring especially in southeast asia is not satisfactory it would be helpful to integrate representative virulentavirulent strains from different countriesregions for collaborative investigations therefore there is a long way to go toward the complete conquest of s suis an emerging human pathogen  infections in cirrhosis sirina ekpanyapong k reddy rajender   infections predominantly bacterial in nature are not uncommon in patients with cirrhosis and these are associated with high morbidity and mortality 1 in these patients infections are a consequence of multiple pathophysiological mechanisms such

infections followed by healthcare acquired in approximately 30 and nosocomial infections in 3540 5 6 recent epidemiological data has shown that the incidence of multidrug-resistant mdr bacteria is increasing especially in healthcare-associated settings 6 7 mdr bacteriaassociated infections have the worst prognosis and are associated with higher rates of treatment failure septic shock and high mortality 46 preventive measures early diagnosis and adequate treatment of infections are potentially decreasing morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis infections account for 2535 of all admissions and this is 45-fold higher rate of infections than in those without cirrhosis 6 8 bacteria remain the most common pathogens with a prevalence of about 2546 in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated cirrhosis 911 which then increases the probability of death by approximately 4-fold reaching 30 at 1 month and 63 at 1 year 12 13 enterobacteriaceae and non-enterococcal streptococci are the major causes of spontaneous infection in cirrhosis 4 5 mdr organisms mdros are pathogens which are resistant to at least one agent in  3 of the main antibiotic families including -lactams examples of mdros are extended-spectrum -lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae esbl non-fermentable gram-negative bacilli such as pseudomonas aeruginosa stenotrophomonas maltophilia or acinetobacter baumannii methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci vre 4 nowadays mdr infections are increasing not only in the hospitals but also in the communities 14 the prevalence of mdros differs among various geographic regions and with higher rates in nosocomial 2339 and healthcare-associated settings 1441 rather than in community-acquired infections 016 4 6 7 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae are more predominant isolates in south europe and asia while vre infections are frequently encountered in the usa and latin

15 intestinal bacterial overgrowth ibo common in patients with cirrhosis could be a consequence of slow intestinal transit due to decreased bowel motility low secretion of gastric acid and bile acids

in bacterial translocation bt and liver inflammation 4 bt is defined as the migration of microorganisms or bacterial endotoxins from the intestinal lumen to the mesenteric lymph nodes or systemic circulation the most common bacteria involved in bt are derived from the family of enterobacteriaceae e coli klebsiella spp etc enterococci and streptococci spp these multiple mechanisms can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations including hemodynamic instability high proinflammatory cytokine levels development of severe or recurrent infections aclf hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome hrs and these associated with poor prognosis 18 data from 181 patients in the north american consortium for study of end-stage liver disease nacseld cohort showed that dysbiosis of the

risk of extra-hepatic organ failure aclf and death 23 in cirrhosis with portal hypertension the microcirculation in the intestinal mucosa is disturbed with loosening of tight junctions tj between epithelial cells resulting in impairment of mucosal integrity which can facilitate bt 21 24 secreted mediators that limit the direct contact of intestinal bacteria with the epithelial surface and are shown to be deficient in cirrhosis include immunoglobulin a 25 biliary lipids 26 and antimicrobial peptides 4 27 this also results in impaired mucus secretion which then facilitates bacterial penetration 18 cirrhosis is associated with an immunodeficiency state and the designated cirrhosis-associated immunodeficiency dysfunction caid concept includes two entities 1 immunodeficiency which affects both innate and adaptive immune systems and 2 a state of persistent but inadequate activation of immune system leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines and systemic inflammation pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps from enteric bacterial organisms and damage-associated molecular patterns damps originating from the host tissue upon injury bring into pattern recognition and activation of immune cells causing systemic inflammation 16 further genetic polymorphisms of immunity pathways may lead to variation in immune responses and infection susceptibilities genetic variations coding for pattern recognition receptors prr especially nod2 and tlr2 variants causing impairment of innate host defense mechanisms have been associated with sbp susceptibility and markers of impaired intestinal permeability with higher systemic inflammation in patients with cirrhosis 4 28 in those with cirrhosis aclf a unique condition can evolve following bacterial infections and the presentation is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multi-organ failure a large multicenter prospective study of 1343 patients hospitalized from acute decompensation of cirrhosis canonic study in the context of easl-clif consortium established a definition and categorized grading which defines short-term mortality aclf grades 13 mortality 22 to 77 29 30 in this study bacterial infection was the most common identifiable precipitating factor for aclf 33 followed by active alcoholism 25 among bacterial infections sbp and pneumonia were the most frequent sites of infection associated with aclf severity of infection such as sepsis or septic shock also correlated with aclf the presence or types of precipitating events were not related to mortality but prognosis depended more on the numbers of organ failures ofs in this context the presence of ofs assessed by the clif-sofa or the clif-c of scores was associated with 28-day and 90-day mortality and it has been suggested that aclf grading be determined to assess mortality in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and aclf during hospitalization the majority of patients have been noted to achieve grade 3 aclf within the first week therefore the next assessment since admission of aclf grade at days 37 with a new scoring system clif-c aclf score is suggested as it has a significantly higher predictive accuracy than meld meld-na and child-pugh-turcotte score at all main time points after aclf diagnosis it has a significantly higher area under the receiver operating curve auroc for prediction of 28-day and 90-day mortality 30 while again noting a spectrum of infections a prospective multicenter study in 507 patients with cirrhosis hospitalized with an infection across the usa and canada nacseld consortium database 31 32 has noted some differences when compared with the easl-clif consortium the most frequently encountered infections were uti 285 and sbp 225 while other infections included spontaneous bacteremia 132 skinsoft tissue 122 respiratory 99 miscellaneous 96 and c difficile 41 nosocomial infections often due to drug-resistant organisms were found as first infections in 158 and were frequently related to in-hospital procedures and the use of medications antibiotics proton pump inhibitor or sbp prophylaxis most commonly the infections were due to gram-positive organisms 329 followed by gram-negative 268 and fungi 176 no organisms were isolated in 227 32 thus the current epidemiological pattern is of the majority being non-sbp infections domination by gram-positive organisms and large proportion of nosocomial infections in addition second infections developed during hospitalization were encountered in 216 of the patients uti 32 respiratory infections 25 and sbp 125 and were also associated with poor survival some of the hospitalized patients with bacterial infection developed ofs 1-of 37 2-ofs 10 and 3-ofs 10 poor predictors found to be associated with development of aclf were nosocomial infections high baseline meld low mean arterial pressure map and non-sbp infections independent predictors of poor 30-day survival were i-aclf a simple bedside tool defined as  2 ofs shock grade iiiiv he ventilation renal replacement therapy second infections high admission meld high white blood cell count and low albumin 32 similar to the canonic study the numbers of ofs were found to be an important predictor of overall survival in those with aclf in liver transplantlisted patients in the nacseld experience there was a 42 risk of delistingdeath within a 6-month period following an episode of infection due to multiple organ failures making it likely the main reason for delistingdeath among liver transplantlisted patients 33 the prevalence of sbp in outpatients is 1535 and ranges from 10 to 30 in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis 34 fifty percent of cases have evidence of sbp at the time of hospital admission while the rest are acquired during hospitalization 35 symptoms include abdominal pain vomiting and diarrhea and patients may also have signs of peritonitis or signs of systemic inflammation fever leukocytosis tachycardia or shock sbp can be asymptomatic in about a third of the patients 36 therefore diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in all patients with cirrhosis and ascites without delay at hospital admission andor in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding shock signs of systemic inflammation worsening of liver or renal function and hepatic encephalopathy 37 hospital mortality after a first episode of sbp has ranged from 10 to 50 and 1-year mortality from 31 to 93 38 the diagnosis of sbp is defined by ascitic neutrophil count of  250 cellsmm3 with a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture without the evidence of intra-abdominal surgically treatable source of infection 39 the methods for estimating neutrophil count include manual count by microscopy automated count by flow cytometry or leukocyte esterase reagent strips lers although the last one is not recommended for rapid screening test due to low sensitivity 45 37 40 while a positive ascitic fluid culture is not essential for the diagnosis of sbp ascitic and blood culture should still be performed before starting antibiotics as organisms can be isolated in 4060 of cases 5 8 levels of ascitic fluid lactoferrin aflac have been noted to be elevated in sbp in a prospective study conducted at tertiary centers 218 ascites samples148 patients using a cut-off level of 242 ngml the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of sbp were 955 and 97 respectively 41 another prospective study from south korea 182 patients noted a sensitivity of 958 and specificity of 744 at a cut-off level of 514 ngml 42 however further validation studies are still needed for it to be recommended in clinical practice another newly established in situ hybridization method for detecting the phagocytized bacterial dna in ascites from sbp patients n  51 demonstrated a sensitivity of 91 and specificity of 100 the results were provided in a day 43 secondary peritonitis is another differential diagnosis of peritonitis that should be considered when multi-organisms are encountered on ascites culture and also when there is growth of anaerobes fungi very high ascites neutrophil counts or in those with inadequate response to therapy runyons criteria are as follows  2 ascitic parameters ascitic glucose  50 mgdl protein  10 gl ldh  normal serum levels are helpful in considering this entity and with a sensitivity of 67 and specificity of 90 prompt abdominal ct and early surgical consideration should be pursued 35 39 empirical antibiotic must be started immediately after the diagnosis of sbp and nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided choice of empirical antibiotics depends on the type of infection individual risk factors and the bacterial epidemiology in a particular global region for community-acquired sbp the recommended first-line antibiotic treatment is a third-generation cephalosporins given intravenously for a duration of 57 days 37 for healthcare-associated and nosocomial sbp piperacillintazobactams are recommended in areas with low prevalence of mdros carbapenem is the antibiotic of choice in regions where there is a high prevalence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and it should be used in combination with glycopeptides or daptomycin or linezolid in areas with high prevalence of gram-positive mdr bacteria table 1 extensive drug resistance xdr bacteria defined by a non-susceptibility to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories and pan-drug resistance pdr bacteria defined by a non-susceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categories 46 may require combination of antibiotics including highly nephrotoxic agents such as vancomycin or aminoglycosides where if used plasma levels need to be monitored prompt de-escalation based on bacterial susceptibility is highly recommended in order to minimize evolution of a resistant strain 37 failure of treatment should be suspected if clinical symptoms worsen or there is inadequate reduction of leukocyte response less than 25 of ascitic neutrophil count in 48 h intravenous 20 albumin 15 gkg at diagnosis of sbp followed by 1 gkg on day 3 in combination with antibiotics significantly reduced renal impairment from 33 to 10 and reduced mortality from 29 to 10 albumin infusion is especially effective in patients with total bilirubin of  4 mgdl blood urea nitrogen  30 mgdl or serum creatinine  1 mgdl 44 47 forty-five to 66 of patients with cirrhosis and with an upper gastrointestinal bleeding developed bacterial infection within 7 days of the bleeding episode 4 51 52 antibiotics administration can decrease the incidence of infection to 1020 51 53 and has also been associated with a reduction in rebleeding rate and improved survival 52 oral norfloxacin 400 mg12 h for 7 days is the gold standard prophylaxis however patients with advanced cirrhosis  2 of the following ascites severe malnutrition encephalopathy or jaundice should receive intravenous ceftriaxone 1 gday for 7 days a randomized controlled trial rct comparing oral norfloxacin and intravenous ceftriaxone in advanced cirrhosis with gastrointestinal hemorrhage showed that the probability of developing possible infections 33 vs 11 p  0003 proven infections 26 vs 11 p  003 and spontaneous bacteremiasbp 12 vs 2 p  003 is significantly higher in patients receiving oral norfloxacin 53 primary prophylaxis with norfloxacin 400 mgday is recommended in patients with advanced cirrhosis child-pugh score  9 and serum bilirubin  3 mgdl and low ascitic protein  15 gdl with either impaired renal function serum creatinine  12 mgdl or blood urea nitrogen  25 mgdl or hyponatremia serum sodium  130 meql an rct evaluated norfloxacin prophylaxis versus no intervention in high-risk patients of developing sbp and hrs and noted that norfloxacin demonstrated improvement in the 3-month 94 vs 62 p  0003 and 1-year survival 60 vs 48 p  005 and significantly reduced the 1-year probability of developing sbp 7 vs 61 p  0001 and hrs 28 vs 41 p  002 54 in addition ciprofloxacin 500 mgday for 12 months has also been shown to improve 1-year survival 86 vs 66 p  004 55 secondary prophylaxis with norfloxacin 400 mgday is advised in patients who had experienced an episode of sbp in an rct study performed in patients who had a previous episode of sbp the long-term use of norfloxacin 400 mgday reduced the 1-year probability of sbp recurrence from 68 to 20 35 56 however there is no clear recommendation on the duration of the prophylactic antibiotics but ideally they should continue until liver transplantation lt or death for those who are on rifaximin as a preventive intervention for recurrent hepatic encephalopathy there is no recommendation on either primary or secondary prophylaxis of sbp prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the benefits and adverse effects of combined norfloxacin and rifaximin therapy 37 a downside of the long-term use of antibiotic prophylaxis is the emergence of resistant bacteria as noted in a prospective study which reported a higher prevalence of quinolone-resistant organisms in patients with cirrhosis receiving long-term norfloxacin prophylaxis 85 vs 47 receiving placebo p  00001 6 as of now non-antibiotic prophylaxis eg preprobiotics fecal microbiota transplantation are undergoing investigation 14 uti is a common bacterial infection and is the second most frequent infection after sbp and it accounts for 1229 of infectious complications in decompensated cirrhosis 57 most of the isolated organisms 7080 are gram-negative bacteria such as e coli and k pneumonia uti can be asymptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria can also be encountered at high frequency this could possibly be related to the frequently found residual urinary volume and vesical dysfunction in those with cirrhosis 58 59 empirical antibiotics for community-acquired uti in those with cirrhosis include intravenous third-generation cephalosporins or piperacillintazobactam if there is associated sepsis and oral quinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in uncomplicated uti quinolones are not recommended as first-line treatment in those already on long-term norfloxacin prophylaxis 5 table 1 several studies have found that nosocomial-acquired utis are associated with the presence of a urinary catheter around 6375 60 61 other risks such as performance of urological procedure during admission are also associated with catheter-associated urinary tract infections cautis or 117 95ci 111122 p  0001 62 common microorganisms isolated from cautis are enterococcus spp e coli and p aeruginosa which can be multidrug-resistant strains 6365 additionally in patients with cirrhosis urinary catheterization during an admission was found associated more with mdr bacterial infections than non-mdr 32 vs 10 p  00001 6 this brings to the concern of catheter withdrawal as soon as possible for patients with cirrhosis in order to prevent cautis in the hospitalized patients with cirrhosis pneumonia carries the highest risk of mortality than other infections hr  295 205425 66 development of pneumonia is associated with a more severe form of community-acquired pneumonia cap and may be associated with bacteremia multi-lobar involvement impaired consciousness renal failure and septic shock overall mortality 74 vs 144 p  0024 67 the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia hap is increased in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy and tracheal intubations the most common pathogen for cap pneumonia in those with cirrhosis is still streptococcus pneumoniae and similar to patients without cirrhosis the predominant pathogens for hap pneumonia are gram-negative bacilli and staphylococci and which is also associated with high mortality 66 68 empirical antibiotic use in cirrhosis with hap pneumonia consists of an intravenous anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin or carbapenem plus fluoroquinolone andor glycopeptide in high-risk patients for mrsa organisms table 1 the most common causative organisms for cellulitis are gram-positive bacteria group a streptococci and staphylococcus aureus but gram-negative organisms include e coli klebsiella spp p aeruginosa aeromonas spp vibrio spp are also frequently reported in those with cirrhosis 69 necrotizing fasciitis caused by gram-negative bacteria tends to have concurrent bacteremia and initially present with septic shock 70 high awareness for this manifestation is necessary for early surgical intervention in order to decrease morbidity and mortality empirical treatment is highly effective in community-acquired skin and soft tissue infection ssti and in only one third with nosocomial ssti 71 broad-spectrum antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins in combination with oxacillin or piperacillin-tazobactam should be promptly initiated table 1 fungal infections can be another cause of treatment failure in patients with cirrhosis especially in patients who are hospitalized in intensive care units 72 or with alcoholic hepatitis 73 a study in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and with a culture-positive infection during 20082014 n  185 noted an approximate 10 rate of fungal infections 8 43 combined bacterial and fungal infection and 11 6 fungal infection only in the fungal infection group spontaneous fungal peritonitis sfp with positive ascitic fluid culture was in 58n  1119 and fungemia positive blood culture without sfp was in 42 n  819 most fungal infections were due to candida spp with c albicans and nearly all candida species were sensitive to amphotericin b fluconazole and voriconazole nine 474 of the fungal infections were nosocomial infections and seven 368 were healthcare-associated 74 mortality rates at 1 month and 6 months were 579 and 895 respectively which were significantly higher than those with bacterial infections fungal infections may occur with or without bacterial infections but often are in those with impaired renal function creatinine 16 vs 11 mgdl p  0034 and in healthcare-associatednosocomial settings 100 vs 283 p  0007 ascitic fluid characteristics cannot distinguish sfp from sbp therefore hemoculture ascitic fluid culture for fungi and empiric use of anti-fungal agents may be considered in those patients with cirrhosis and with nosocomial infections who are not responding to empirical antibiotics therapy 74 in the nacseld cohort n  2743 134 patients 127 of infected patients had evidence of fungal infections all of which were nosocomial the rate of fungal infections did not correlate with the etiology of cirrhosis a multi-variable analysis noted that diabetes acute kidney injury icu admission and admission bacterial infection were associated with fungal infections auc  082 further fungal infections were associated with aclf and poor 30-day survival 75 in patients with alcoholic hepatitis the stopah trial demonstrated a higher rate of infections in prednisolone-treated patients than in the non-prednisolone group 13 vs 7 p  0002 76 a recent meta-analysis of 1062 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis 528 steroids treated found no difference in infection rates between those treated and untreated with corticosteroids however fungal infections were higher among those who received corticosteroids 8528 vs 1534 p  002 77 invasive aspergillosis is another frequent complication seen in those with severe alcoholic hepatitis and carries high mortality thus systemic and periodic screening for opportunistic pathogens in such patients is recommended 78 immunization against influenza pneumococcus and hepatitis a and b is recommended in patients with chronic liver disease inactivated or killed-type vaccinations are more preferable than live attenuated vaccinations in patients with cirrhosis 79 yearly inactivated influenza vaccination should be provided to every chronic liver disease patient due to its safety and effectiveness in protection pneumonia accounts for 1520 of infections in cirrhosis which also carries the highest 30- and 90-day mortality rate among other sources of infections 66 the higher incidence and greater severity of pneumonia from streptococcus pneumoniae in those with cirrhosis argues for the administration of pneumococcal vaccine to all adult  18 years old patients with cirrhosis and with booster dose after 65 years old table 2 superimposed infection with hepatitis a or b in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality 80 81 as immunogenicity to vaccinations has correlated inversely with the degree of hepatic decompensation 82 early immunization against hepatitis a and b prior to the stage of hepatic decompensation is the optimal strategy hepatitis a vaccination in patients with decompensated cirrhosis had low seroconversion rates of about 4966 79 83 84 and thus this group of patients may benefit from post-vaccination serologic testing to evaluate response similarly hepatitis b vaccination has been noted to be safe and with high seroconversion rates in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease but has reduced efficacy in advanced chronic liver disease and in those who underwent liver transplantation 8587 weight and age of the patients are also factors associated with the response rate thus patients with chronic liver disease should be vaccinated before the onset of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis if possible by conventional hepatitis b vaccination series although patients with cirrhosis may benefit from a high-dose or double-dose 40 g strategy 68 response rate 88 than standard doses 1620 response rate 8991 it remains controversial as such a double-dose vaccination is only recommended in other immunocompromised status eg hiv hemodialysis on chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant 50 however from our perspective patients with cirrhosis who do not achieve seroconversion anti-hbs  10 miuml following a vaccination course may benefit from a second double-dose 40 g regimen table 2 disappointingly vaccination rates in patients with cirrhosis remain suboptimal a retrospective study of the trends in vaccination between 2004 and 2013 n  17990 found only 198 77 and 110 of patients receiving a pneumococcal hepatitis a and hepatitis b vaccine respectively in the same or the following year of cirrhosis diagnosis 92 adherence by patients and physicians to vaccination guidelines are of paramount importance in order to reduce morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases in patients with cirrhosis  effect of chemical clarification of oral fluids on the detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus igg routine collection and testing of oral fluid of samples facilitates porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv surveillance in commercial swine herds in a cost-effective welfare-friendly fashion however ofs often contain environmental contaminants that may affect liquid handling and test performance traditional processing methods eg filtration or centrifugation are not compatible with high-throughput testing because of the burden of additional processing costs and time of clarification using chemical flocculants is an alternative approach not widely explored therefore we evaluated the effect of chitosan-based clarification treatment on a commercial prrsv of elisa serum and individual ofs were collected from vaccinated pigs  n  17 at -7 to 42 d post-vaccination and subdivided into 4 aliquots each aliquot was clarified treatment a b c with the 4th aliquot serving as untreated control all samples were tested by prrsv of elisa immediately after treatment and then were held at 4c to be re-tested at 2 4 6 and 14 d post-treatment quantitative and qualitative treatment effects were evaluated a kruskal-wallis test found no significant difference in elisa sp responses among treatments by days post-treatment no difference was detected in the proportion of positive prrsv antibody samples among treatments cochran q p  005 treatment of swine ofs using chitosan-based formulations did not affect the performance of a commercial prrsv of elisa chitosan or other flocculants could improve of characteristics and could be adapted for use in the field or in high-throughput laboratories henao-daz

 renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are routinely used for common cardiovascular conditions1921 the benefits in reducing cardiovascular events are well established mainly in long-term analyses of patients with chronic use of these therapies2829 however in some acute clinical conditions these drugs are temporarily discontinued due to an imminent risk higher than the potential short-term benefit of these therapies30 there is currently an intense debate about the suspension or maintenance of chronic aceiarb therapy in patients with covid-191213273132
 the brace corona trial was designed to test the impact of discontinuation compared with maintenance of chronic aceiarb therapy in patients with covid-19 this is one of several questions facing physicians in the setting of covid-19 and data are needed from randomized clinical trials like brace corona because renin-angiotensin system inhibitors increase levels of ace2 a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of covid-1915 the presence of ace2 in alveolar epithelial cells makes the lungs a preferred site of entry for the virus which explains the respiratory manifestations in patients with covid-19 this hypothesis of worse outcomes associated with the use of acei or arb in patients with covid-19 was recently shown in observational studies2526 however a cause-effect relation between the use of acei or arb and adverse events in covid-19 cannot be established since many confounding factors could explain a worse or better prognosis for these patients in observational analyses in a recent retrospective study of hospitalized covid-19 patients all-cause mortality was lower among patients on aceiarb therapy when compared with those not using aceiarbs33 an observational analysis from a single-center study showed that aceiarb use was not associated with severity of covid-19 infection or worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with hypertension34 nonetheless the effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibition on ace2 is uncertain and the potential harm related to this mechanism is not well defined3132 in addition the use of acei or arbs could be beneficial not only due to the well-known cardiovascular protection32 but also because of the potential respiratory system protection in patients affected by severe respiratory disease1527 considering that these high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease and covid-19 are commonly hospitalized the decision regarding the best approach for the management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors is critical in a scenario of apparent equipoise without high quality scientific evidence the medical decisions in clinical practice have been heterogeneous thus a randomized clinical trial is necessary to guide practice a multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted during a pandemic should follow the same steps commonly adopted in pivotal phase iii trials however the critical and urgent nature of a pandemic encourages opportunities to create more efficient research processes which can be adopted for use in clinical research conducted during non-pandemic times in a new and threatening situation like the covid-19 pandemic there is no specific evidence to guide medical therapy yet there is an urgent need to quickly answer the clinical questions that arise in order to guide treatment of the hundreds of thousands of people infected with a potentially lethal disease collaborative pragmatic studies are one of the best solutions in this scenario5 brace corona took less than 3 weeks from protocol development to first patient randomized including national ethics board review and approval which is unprecedented in brazil figure 4
 the covid-19 registry is already collecting the key clinical variables and outcomes that will be used for the randomized trial adding randomization to this structure allows for an efficient process which can provide the scientific community with a streamlined approach to answer a relevant clinical question with less bureaucracy and at lower cost in addition clinicians on the frontline who are already very interested in answering this medical question will be highly engaged with the trial source documents from potential events will be adjudicated by a clinical events classification committee since many different complications could occur due to the interaction between covid-19 baseline cardiovascular condition and therapies used by these patients the primary study outcome chosen for brace corona daoh at 30 days was also very pragmatic and encompasses the potential effect of any relevant medical complication therefore regardless of the type of in-hospital complication it will be captured in the study and daoh will ultimately represent a meaningful outcome of the net benefit from the patients perspective this efficient model of a registry-based randomized trial which is the first of its kind in brazil has already been applied successfully in other countries3536 and represents a unique opportunity during the global crisis of covid-19 that could serve as an important legacy to the medical community brace corona is a multicenter randomized trial in patients hospitalized with covid-19 on renin-angiotensin system blockers that aims to determine whether discontinuation compared with maintenance of these drugs increases days alive and out of the hospital the results of this study will help guide medical decision making regarding the best management of a high-risk population of patients infected with sars-cov-2 most of all brace corona reinforces the importance of pragmatic randomized clinical trials which are effective models to provide rapid answers to inform clinical practice especially in situations that require appropriate rapid and high-quality evidence to guide medical practice rdl research support from bristol-myers squibb glaxosmithkline medtronic pfizer consulting fees from bayer boehringer ingelheim bristol-myers squibb daiichi-sankyo glaxosmithkline medtronic merck pfizer portola avsm consulting fees from pfizer bayer novartis daiichi-sankyo zodiac and roche pgmbs fees and research support from pfizer rjm-b no conflicts of interests af consulting fees pfizer bayer daiichi-sankyo boehringer servier gasa consulting fees from pfizer and servier ass no conflict of interest dca research support from boehringer ingelheim consulting fees pfizer bayer daiichi-sankyo boehringer servier lm no conflict of interest mfs no conflict of interest nzs no conflict of interest cmg no conflict of interest cbg research grants astrazeneca fda nih gsk medtronic novartis apple boehringer ingelheim bms pfizer janssen consulting astrazeneca espero gsk medtronic novartis boehringer ingelheim boston scientific bms pfizer daiichi sankyo merck roche eli lilly janssen jha research support from boehringer ingelheim bristol-myers squibb cryolife csl behring glaxosmithkline us food and drug administration us national institutes of health xatek consulting fees or honoraria from abbvie bayer bristol-myers squibb cryolife csl behring novo nordisk pfizer portola quantum genomics us veterans administration xatek zafgen conflicts of interest disclosures available at httpwwwdcridukeeduresearchcoi ofs research support from boehringer ingelheim consulting fees pfizer bayer daiichi-sankyo boehringer ingelheim

  annotation immune mechanisms and the gut m brueton j   the lymphoid tissue of the gastrointestinal tract is a central component of the bodys immune system it is the major site of exposure to foreign antigenic materials such as those present in micro-organisms or food and the patterns of lymphocyte sensitisation which result have widespread implications for both health and disease the capacity to develop protective immunity carries with it the potential for coincidental tissue damage to occur the onset of such hypersensitivity reactions in some patients implies the presence of various predisposing factors these include the mode of presentation of the antigen the competence of the immune system encountered and the genetic constitution of the individual concerned the importance of these factors can only be appreciated in the context of the normal physiology of the immune system in the gut the object of this paper is to discuss this and its clinical relevance to paediatric practice particularly in relation to gastrointestinal infections and food allergy the immune response requires a afferent limb to present antigen to lymphocytes capable of recognition and proliferation and an efferent limb to disseminate immuno-competent daughter cells able to produce specific antibody or lymphokine at the site of antigen exposure it is now clear that the gut is uniquely structured to promote antigen-lymphocyte interaction a large proportion of the bodys lymphocytes reside in the gastrointestinal tract they are scattered throughout its length in the lamina propria and epithelium with aggregations occurring in the peyers patches appendix and tonsils the cells present include two distinct populations of lymphocytes one which has passed through the thymus during maturation and participates in cell-mediated reactions t cells and one which was first described in the bone marrow and is able to produce antibodies b cells there are no afferent lymphatics early concepts of antigen access to the mucosa assumed that molecules could pass between or through the epithelial cells at all points it is now apparent that the peyers patches are covered by a specialised epithelium which preferentially allows antigen entry 31  beneath this epithelium lies the dome area which contains a large proportion of t lymphocytes this overlies an area of ceil traffic 0340-61998001330201 0100 containing post-capillary venules macrophages and b lymphocytes 32  sensitised cells pass in efferent lymphatics to the mesenteric lymph nodes and thence to the thoracic duct and the circulation t and b cell proliferation occurs outside the patches themselves characteristically taking place in the draining lymph nodes and spleen 34  the efferent limb of the immune response is mediated by lymphocytes which return to populate the mucosa several complicated patterns of recirculation have been identified in animals 13  clearly a system which allows widespread distribution of antigen-reactive cells throughout the mucosa in this way is both elegant and efficient the immunologically mediated changes in the gut which have been recognised for many years include luminal antibody production cellular infiltration of the mucosa and the development of immunoglobulin producing cells in the lamina propria other changes which reflect gut immune responses include the presence of circulating antibodies to food proteins anaphylactic reactions evidence of complement activation following oral challenge and the development of mucosal enteropathies related to ingested antigen and infections the correlation of these observations with the classical types i-iv immune reactions described by gell and coombs 5 has proved difficult the ability of the gut to produce protective antibodies against bacillary dysentry regardless of serum antibody levels was shown by besredka 3 and by davies 9 in the early 1920s it was some 40 years later that iga was recognised as the predominant immunoglobulin in external secretions 42 and in the lamina propria 6  it is synthesised as a dimer in the mucosa and becomes associated with secretory component produced in the epithelial cells the capacity of the newborn to produce iga is impaired 43 and the establishment of a normal population of immunoglobulin-bearing cells in the mucosa appears to be closely related to the intestinal contents 7  iga antibodies are active against bacteria viruses and toxins they also prevent bacterial adherence to the mucosa 45  and in rats have been shown to prevent albumin absorption following intra-gastric immunisation 17  such modulation of antigen access has profound implications cells producing other immunoglobulin classes are also found in lower numbers in the mucosa and igg igm and ige can be demonstrated in intestinal secretions igm may be associated with secretory compo-nent igg and ige are not and are thought to be derived from plasma in the context of the distribution of ige producing lymphocytes in the body it is noteable that they are particularly found in the mucosae 41  to date it has been difficult to study cellular immune reactions in the gut the essential histological features of human small bowel enteropathies have been mimiced by allograft rejection studies in mice 25 and in graft-versus-host disease 33  a common factor in both situations is a local cell-mediated immune reaction direct evidence of functional t lymphocytes in the small intestine has come from studies of lymphokine production ferguson et al 12 showed that migration inhibition factor was released from jejunal biopsy specimens from patients with coeliac disease when they were incubated with alpha-gliadin an important model for the study of cell-mediated immunity in the gut is parasitic worm infection in rodents inbred rats subjected to neonatal thymectomy had significantly greater infection than did control animals 22 30  in this system it is unlikely that the mechanism concerned is confined to the classical cellmediated reaction the parasite n brasiliensis is known to stimulate remarkable ige production a response which is particularly dependent on t-b cell interaction the partial villous atrophy which occurs in this nematode infection does not develop in thymus-deprived rats 11  cellular infiltration of the columnar epithelium and the lamina propria is well documented in jejunal enteropathies 21 28  the function of intra-epithelial lymphocytes remains obscure it is currently thought that they are effector t cells 10  their sentinel position at the mucosal surface suggests an important role the infrastructure of cellular cooperation which underlies all immune reactions has yet to be identified in the gut sub-populations of suppressor and helper t lymphocytes will eventually be recognised and in vivo evidence of cell-mediated immunity and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity will doubtless emerge specific immunological unresponsiveness is known as tolerance the induction of tolerance to parenteral antigen by previous oral immunisation was originally shown by chase in 1946 4  the mechanisms are still not understood it has been suggested that iga binding of antigen molecules either reduces their uptake or renders them tolerogenic it has been shown that feeding ovalbumin to mice reduces its subsequent absorption while simultaneously inducing a state of systemic tolerance 40  introduction of minute amounts of hapten into the portal system similarly produces tolerance 2  the mechanism of antigen handling may thus be crucial to the development or non-development of immunity what then is the evidence that hypersensitivity reactions 5 occur in the gut in man and what is their relevance to disease states type i immediate hypersensitivity reactions involve ige antibodies which on combination with antigen release histamine and other vaso-active substances their role in gastrointestinal disorders in man is uncertain although symptoms such as diarrhoea vomiting urticaria and asthma may follow the ingestion of specific proteins there is rarely an obvious correlation with circulating ige antibodies 8  further studies on ige antibody activity in the mucosa are required in animals with worm infestations type i reactions appear to be more concerned with expulsion of the parasite than associated with specific antinematode ige antibodies type ii cytotoxic hypersensitivity reactions involve complement fixing antibodies and antigens which form an integral part of or become attached to the surface of an individuals own cells these reactions have usually been described as affecting red cells white cells or platelets in the circulation the demonstration ofautoantibodies is not conclusive evidence that they are of primary or secondary significance there is no confirmation that type ii mechanisms operate in gastrointestinal disease however locally secreted antibodies which only reacted with epithelial cell-membrane constituents would be very difficult to demonstrate unequivocally type iii arthus type hypersensitivity reactions develop when antigen-antibody-complement complexes occur tissue damage then results from the generation of chemotactic factors and local changes in capillary permeability the aniibody classes capable of complement activation are igm and igg iga is unable to fix complement by the classical pathway although aggregated secretory iga can activate complement by the alternate pathway as evidenced by bacteriolysis 18  very low concentrations of complement are found in intestinal secretions and complement components are readily inactivated by proteolytic enzymes nevertheless complement activation has been documented in the serum following cows milk protein challenge in sensitive individuals 27 and following gluten challenge in coeliac disease 26  it is most likely that these changes reflect a type iii reaction in the lamina propria antigen having gained access across a damaged epithelium type iv delayed hypersensitivity reactions occur between antigen and antigen-sensitive lymphocytes exemplified by the mantoux test although it seems likely as discussed above that cellular immune reactions occur in the mucosa in vivo evidence is inconclusive peripheral lymphocyte stimulation in the presence of a sub-fraction of gluten has been reported in patients with coeliac disease 16  however the interpretation of this is as controversial as the significance of circulating antibodies to dietary antigens in individual patients the normal bacterial flora of the gut is determined by interactions between the host and the micro-organisms non-immune factors are important they include lactoferrin lysozymes proteolytic enzymes and the integrity of the glycocalyx the contribution of immunological mechanisms can be examined in immunodeficiency disorders the commonest of these is selective iga deficiency interestingly most of these patients are symptom-free and do not have an increased susceptibility to gastrointestinal infection although giardia lamblia infestation and enteropathies are well recognised to occur in some of them 37  giardiasis is more common in hypogammaglobulinaemia 36  however it is the children with cellular immune defects such as the digeorge syndrome or severe combined immunodeficiency who suffer the greatest incidence of bacterial fungal or viral infections 14 19  the pathogenicity of strains ofe coli is determined by their ability to adhere to the mucosa and their capacity to produce enterotoxin in animals adherence has been linked to the presence of genetically determined mucosal receptors 38  the mucosa is capable of producing specific iga antibodies against e coli 24 but their protective role is not clear it has been shown that in neonatal animals fed on colostrum passively transferred immunoglobulins can be protective 23  in man gastroenteritis and necrotising enterocolitis are less common in breast-fed infants 35 1  the development of a vaccine is complicated by the changing serotypes of the organisms immunisation against the enterotoxin might be more practical cholera-toxin binding to microvilli can be blocked by antibody 44  but in vivo application is awaited the recognition of rotavirus coronavirus and similar particles in faeces has done much to explain the high proportion of diarrhoeal diseases in man and animals in which no bacteriological cause had been found studies in piglets have shown that maternal colostrum can be protective 38 and that the preparation of specific vaccine is a practical proposition 29  aspects of the mucosal immunology of the poliovirus have been well studied in the development of the sabin vaccine the findings indicated that an oral live attenuated vaccine-provoked protective immunity is principally localised in secretory iga despite this finding other mechanisms are implicated by the work of mebus et al 29 who showed that immunity to calf gastroenteritis virus preceded the appearance of specific antibody activity the association between malnutrition and increased susceptibility to infection 15 is an important cause of mortality malnutrition may compromise mucosal immunity while nutritional status is further impaired by the consequences of infection such as anorexia dehydration and malabsorption it is clear from the above discussion that abnormalities in antigen presentation or lymphocyte responsiveness could predispose to the development of hypersensitivity reactions in the bowel mucosa currently there is no diagnostic investigation which unequivocally establishes that this has occurred the many screening tests suggested reflect changes remote from the gut itself the interpretation of positive skin tests or circulating antibodies to food proteins is notoriously unreliable the clinician must still rely on meticulous observation and will find that many childrens symptoms may not be reproducible and that in some patients non-immunological mechanisms may be involved--such as in lactose malabsorption nevertheless food allergy does exist and is most commonly found in association with cows milk or egg protein in those children who present with gastrointestinal symptoms some patients react immediately in others the symptoms are delayed and it is evident both clinically and experimentally that several different types of reactions are occurring until we have a clearer understanding of the fundamental basis of these differences the distinction between primary and secondary phenomena is blurred current views suggest that there is a group of infants who become sensitised to cows milk protein during an episode of gastroenteritis 20  such hypersensitivity is relatively short-lived and even in this group the presence of a jejunal enteropathy is not always associated with continuing disturbances it has been suggested that infants who are symptomatic on exposure to cows milk after breast feeding may have been sensitised in the neonatal period at a time when their mucosal iga production was immature 39  it will be interesting to see if the current upsurge in breast feeding and in the use of hypoallergenic milks will have any discernible effect on gastrointestinal disorders in infancy or later life the balance required in the gastrointestinal tract between the selective absorption of nutrients and mucosal defence has thus resulted in the development of a complex immune system the inaccessibility of the epithelium and its vascular drainage to both examination and experimentation has heightened its obscurity application of the modern techniques of endoscopy tissue culture cell separation and lymphocyte identification offer exciting prospects for the future only then will the relevance of aberrations of the gut immune system to disease become truly apparent  estimating hidden asymptomatics herd immunity threshold and lockdown effects using a covid-19 specific model shaurya kaushal abhineet rajput singh soumyadeep bhattacharya m vidyasagar aloke kumar meher prakash k santosh ansumali  a quantitative covid-19 model that incorporates hidden asymptomatic patients is developed and an analytic solution in parametric form is given the model incorporates the impact of lockdown and resulting spatial migration of population due to announcement of lockdown a method is presented for estimating the model parameters from real-world data it is shown that increase of infections slows down and herd immunity is achieved when symptomatic patients are 4-6 of the population for the european countries we studied when the total infected fraction is between 50-56  finally a method for estimating the number of asymptomatic patients who have been the key hidden link in the spread of the infections is presented  covid-19 infections have breached the five million mark yet there is neither a vaccine nor a scalable treatment in sight 1 2  furthermore a distinctive feature of the covid-19 in contrast to other infectious diseases such as influenza or sars is the presence of a large fraction of asymptomatic patients who dont have any obvious symptoms but are still capable of infecting susceptible individuals through contacts however identifying individuals spreading infections via the asymptomatic pathway is not easy unless extensive contact tracing and testing are performed a major challenge is the uncertainty in the estimation of asymptomatic fraction with estimates ranging from 41 to 86 of infected 3 4  and along the symptomatic pathway 44 of the infections are spread before the onset of symptoms rendering the quarantining people with symptoms less efficient compared to other infectious diseases 5 these challenges have driven governments to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions npis such as social distancing and partial or full lockdowns 6  an unsaid a posteriori rationale for these lockdowns is that they provide efficient isolation mechanism for asymptomatic however a dearth of quantitative understanding of the effects of the lockdown has triggered debate around the effectiveness duration and mode partial vs full of lockdown thus it is even suggested that societies should just move in an unhindered manner towards the attainment of the herd-immunity threshold 7  this threshold is achieved when a sufficiently large proportion of a population becomes immune and as a result the disease spread slows down for covid-19 estimating the onset of herd immunity remains elusive and indeed ascertaining whether herd immunity exists at all moreover high case fatality rate of 3  10 vs 005 for seasonal influenza limits the practicality of herd immunity as an effective policy tool thus models that can provide quantitative estimates of the disease spread and the impact of policy measures are expeditiously required similar to other epidemicspandemic three different kinds of models are used for covid-19 1 statistical extrapolation models which fit the observed patterns of infections to make short-term prediction 8 9  2 agent based models for a qualitative illustration of microscopic dynamics of spreading infections 10  and 3 compartment models which divide the population into groups based on the current different disease state of the individual and model the interaction among them 2 11 12 13  since 1927 plague in mumbai compartmental models have been a standard guiding tool for policy decisions 14  the spread of flu-like diseases influenza sars covid-19 etc is often modelled using three or four compartments susceptible-infected-recovered sir or susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered seir some variants also consider theoretically a simple containment option of quarantining infected persons with symptoms however all these models assume that only contact between the s and the i compartments leads to new infections with the implicit assumption that contact between the s and e compartments does not lead to any infection in contrast an asymptomatic patient with covid-19 can and does infect susceptible individuals through contact thus epidemiological models must consider the distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic moreover models should distinguish between lockdown and quarantine as these are two qualitatively different policy tools the former operating at the level of a society and the latter the level of a few individuals in this letter we aim to model all these novel aspects of covid-19 and to accomplish three goals corporating above mentioned unique aspects of covid-19 disease spread and associated policies the observed epidemiological data and sheds light on the underlying parameters and universalities that govern the dynamics in the different phases of the pandemic spread and containment 3 use the model to address pertinent questions beyond what is readily measurable -estimates of the hidden asymptomatics or at what fraction of symptomatic infections herd immunity would be achieved we accomplish these objectives by introducing the sair model which treats infections by an asymptomatic a or an infected symptomatic person i as being equally likely the dynamical behavior of this model is quite different from that of the seir model the model takes into account lockdown in an explicit fashion by using discontinuous in time reproduction rate the effective rate at which susceptible population get converted into infected we give an implicit closed-form solution for this sair model which sheds light on the dynamics of the sair model and also leads to methods for estimating the parameters therein in order to make this parametric form readily computable we also introduce an approximate explicit representation then we provide a method for estimating the parameters in the model based on the evolution of the disease and extract the underlying country-specific parameters from the infection data further we show that there exists an intermediate regime immediately after the lockdown that is country-specific and that the country specific metrics of the success of lockdown can be extracted and analyzed then we show that the herd immunity for covid-19 is achieved when the total symptomatic infections are only around 510 of the population which is lower than estimated we begin by emphasizing the difference between seir and sair models 11  a typical seir model assumes a framework of serial directed transitions across the intermediate health states of the individuals fig1  in this framework the infections are caused when a susceptible person comes in contact with a person deemed to be infected person on the basis of the symptoms i however after this contact with a certain likelihood the person remains in a pre-symptomatic intermediate state or the exposed individual e that is not contagious before transitioning to a contagious and symptomic state i while this framework is acceptable for influenza or sars the epidemiology of covid-19 is such that there is an alternative pathway between the susceptible s and the recovered states r which passes through asymptomatic individuals estimated to be around 86 3 who never show any symptoms but carry enough viral load to infect others thus a model for covid-19 should consider two parallel pathways of infection  figure 1b  we consider a generalized version of sair model as representation of a homogenously mixed population segment where covid-19 is spreading the system will obey the following sair dynamic where for any variable x time derivative is denoted a x  dxdt we assume that t denotes the probability with which when a susceptible person meets an infected or asymptomatic person they become a part of the asymptomatics which for simplicity includes the pre-symptomatics and the asymptomatics in our formulation of the model we claim that the lockdown can be modeled by considering a sudden change in the infection rate constant using a heavyside function as t   0 ht lock  t here we note in passing that one can model social distancing as reduction in value of  or an imperfect lockdown in a minimal model one may assume that asymptomatic patients either get converted into symptomatic one with an effective rate  or recovers with a rate  this term typically absent in standard models denotes the fact that in an idealized lock-down no susceptible person meets an infected person and thus first order reaction changes to a zero-order reaction before we proceed to analyse the model we wish to point out that one may add further complication to this model by introducing more parameters and compartments for example recovery rate  and infection rate  need not be same for asymptomatic and symptomatic fraction 11  however as there is no biological evidence to the contrary we assume that both rates are equal which leads to an analytically tractable and simplified framework however in reality for a large country it is unrealistic to consider it as a homogenously mixed population further during this crisis we learnt that once a lockdown is announced people migrate across different segments of a country even for a qualitatively correct modeling of disease spread dynamics it is important to account for this migration of people this migration can indeed happen in many waves however for simplicity we assume that it happens once and only during a short duration after lockdown furthermore one would expect that among infected population only asymptomatic people are able to travel here it needs to be reminded that we are only interested in the influx of the infected population in a given population segment and not the details of where they came from in order to model such a scenario we take typical thermodynamic route of dividing the system into two parts system and universe finally the cou- and is the short period of time post lock-down in which population migration is allowedpossible this migration is a characteristic of the system country or region under consideration and parameters  and need to be extracted from the data the rest of the world can also be assumed for this purpose to be following a similar sair dynamic eq1 and 2 complete our development of covid-19 specific model in the present work we solved a phenomenological model of a well-mixed society with everyone interacting with everyone else however the interactions may be structured by age local movement of the population and many of these can be modelled in the framework of agent based models the formulation of the disease specific interactions we developed can also be integrated into other models which study the interactions at agent level detail or in tandem with economic consequences 15  both of which are beyond the scope of the present work with an emphasis mainly on the spread of infections at the societal level we show that the set of equations we model are sufficient to capture most of the available epidemiological data on covid-19 this system of equations can be solved for prelockdown situation in terms of the reproduction rate r 0   0  by defining m  i  a and observing that before lockdown we have which can be solved in terms ofs  ss 0 as where m  s  r  1 at any instant s 0 denotes the susceptible population at t  0 and the recovered population at t  0 is taken to be 0 on the other hand after an idealized lock-down no susceptible person meets an infected person and thus the first order reaction changes to a zero order reaction the intermediate time t lock  t  t lock   solution simplifies to once there is no more flux of asymptomatic individuals the equations for m yield an exponential decay given by 6 substituting the expression from eq4 in the evolution equation for s gives us the parametric solution in implicit form as assuming that the equation can be converted to an explicit form fors as a function of t it is possible to substitute this into eq4 to obtain an expression for m as a function of t finally the expression for m t can be disambiguated into separate expressions for it and at by using eq1 specifically in the equation for we can substitute a  m  i which give if we define a new constant  1     then the solution of the above equation is therefore the key is to turn eq 7 into an explicit expression to the extent possible for this purpose we use hermite-hadamard inequality for the logarithm 16 z which suggests that we use approximate form of the logarithm as log z  z  1w 1 z  w 2  with the constraint that w 1  w 2  1 upon approximating the logarithm we get a solution in explicit form as where a  s 0 r 0  w 2 r 0  b  r 0  w 1  w 2  r 0  d  w 1 r 0  where h 2  2 a  b  h2 a  b  h and h is a constant such that and h   b 2  4ad once the evolution equation for s is known in a closed from we find the evolution for the remaining variables using eq 4 table 1 the evolution of infections pre-lockdown and in early time limit is given by where k  r 0  1 and g  s 0 r 0  1 the solution post lock-down is given by where eqs 11  eq 6 be managed at most with contact tracing and quarantine and hence addressing a solution for the lockdown did not arise covid-19 thus presented itself with the unique infection scenarios and the challenges of the lockdown for its mitigation and our model and its closed form-solution address these uniquene aspects the reported infection data from different countries had three regimes -rising intermediate and decreasing if they implemented a lockdown it can be easily assumed that the reported infections are the symptomatic infections since most countries have been short of testing resources as a result patients were tested for a confirmation only after the onset of symptoms the equations derived above for i could be fit will all these three different regimes in the process we could extract the governing parameters the parameter  0   and  1 are estimated by fitting eq 11 eq6 and eq12 respectively to the publicly available data pertaining to the pre and post lock-down period for various countries see supplemental material 17  the parameters  0 representing the rise is similar for many countries reiterating a universal pattern in the initial pre-lockdown regime this can be understood as an intrinsic characteristic dynamics of covid-19 which exhibits strong similarities across countries see table 1 in supplemental material 17  but a much stronger country-specific disease dynamics was the intermediate regime described using the parameter  1  the formal solution in eq 12 is fit to the infection rate right after lock-down to estimate the parameter  1 and  see supplementary figs34  this is to be expected as migration during lockdown can be expected to be a country-specific event dictated by the prevalent social-political conditions  the blue and the red lines indicate the maxima considering only the symptomatic or the total infections respectively the infection rate slows down significantly and a herd-immunity is achieved after the combined infections reach a peak when the symptomatic infections have crossed  57 of the total population the peak of the symptomatic infections is achieved at around 16 just before the final saturation value of around 20 with these validations for the levels of infections i that were observed in the different countries and the parameters that were extracted we could estimate how the number of individuals in the individual compartments s a i and r changed with time with or without a lockdown fig3  because it had been impossible to test the entire population or even a significant fraction of it the asymptomatics have remained a missing link in the epidemiology although certain estimates suggest a 110 ratio between the sympomatic and asymptomatic individuals using our model we could estimate the ratio of the asymptomatic to symptomatic individuals supplementary fig 5  which varies from 1 to 40 depending on the phase of the pandemic dynamics our results show that the herd-immunity defined as the fraction of population at which symptomatic infections reach a peak and beyond which begin decreasing could be achieved at 4-6 of the population as illustrated in fig3 ta-ble 2 in supplementary informationthese estimates for herd-immunity which are in single digit percentages only seem contradictory to estimates of 50-60 18 until one realises the large fraction of the infections are asymptomatic accounting for a total infection of 50-56 of the population supplementary table 2  thus our model allowed us to make estimates both for the hiddenasymptomatics and the herd-immunity and the fraction of the symptomatics who will burden the health care system in conclusion as a part of our analysis we are able to provide a method for estimating the asymptomatic fraction of the population finally by fitting our model to data from countries where the pandemic appears to have peaked we are also able to estimate the level of herd-immunity we are able to show that herd-immunity is achieved at levels of just 5 to 10 far lower than the levels suggested in the literature we find that the sair model can be readily adapted to incorporate the effects of lockdown and the solution to the system of equations bears striking resemblance to the real-world data the formal solution allows one to evaluate the effect of lockdown as a policy tool and can also be integrated into other frameworks which study the economic consequences of the lockdowns which can be simply written in the form the solution upon integrating is where the integration variable is s as b 2  4ad the equation can be rewritten as using the identity i arctanix  arctanhx using the identity arctanhx  1 2 log x1 thus using approximation 2 gives us an analytically tractable solution for the susceptible population in this section we discuss the estimation procedure for the parameters  0    the analytical solutions for the infectedactive and recovered populations is known for both prediscussed in section i and post lock-down scenarios these analytical solutions are then fit onto the real time data for several countries to give us an estimate of the parameters relevant to covid19 we begin with the post lock-down scenarios as the solutions are rather straight forward after a   number of days post lockdown the recovery rate is given b 14 and the infection is given by using eq 14  where k  r 0  1 and g  s 0 r 0  1 the solution post lock-down is given by l exp 1   1 1  ht  t 18 where   guillain-barr syndrome the first

patients with pre-existing autoimmunity there is no evidence that patients with autoimmune neurological diseases stable on common immunotherapies are facing increased risks of infection dalakas marinos c understanding the molecular epidemiology of foot-and-mouth-disease virus joern klein   the combination of molecular biology epidemiology and population genetics in the science of molecular epidemiology is a powerful tool to develop control strategies for infectious disease this is especially significant for viral diseases due to the rapid changes in the viral genome regardless of it consists of dna or rna which allows the drawing of conclusions about the origin of the virus lineage andor the influence of immunologic and environmental pressures like the introduction of vaccination campaigns or climate changes the latter implicate in the authors opinion that each researcher working with the molecular epidemiology of infectious disease should have knowledge about the actual situation in the field which will certainly help to avoid the proposal of wrong hypotheses it is equally important to be aware that most of the techniques used eg phylogenetic analysis or selection pressure analysis are by themselves based on hypotheses and models with their intrinsic assumptions biases and fuzziness furthermore there should be a general awareness about the illusion that we particularly with the derived nucleotide sequence information have knowledge about the viral genetics beside the quasispecies structure of the rna virus populations there are manifold possibilities of virushost interactions we still do not understand this review gives the minimum background information needed for the understanding of the molecular epidemiology of foot-and-mouth disease virus and presents the current developments within this field the first indication of foot-and-mouth disease fmd in the literature can be found in a book from the italian physician hieronymi fracastorii wright 1930 where he describes a cattle disease similar to the signs of fmd since then several indications of fmd can be found in the literature thalmann and nockler 2001 from the second half of the 19th century on the account of the increase of animal trade due to the development of new transport routes orourke and williamson 2002 the disease became more important and started to cause severe economic losses in germany in 1897 a commission had been set up by the prussian ministry of culture following a request from the partei der landwirte of the reichstag to set up measures of fmd control rott and siddell 1998 one year later friedrich loeffler and paul frosch wrote in their report that the causative agent of fmd was neither a known bacterium nor a toxin but an ultravisible ultrafilterable substance loeffler and frosch 1897 and described thereby the first animal virus foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv in 1910 the first fmd research institute was built on the island of riems in germany followed by other research institutes in europe eg in pirbright united kingdom in 1925 and on lindholm island denmark in 1926 the major milestones in these early years of fmd research were the introduction of guinea pigs as research animals waldmann and pape 1920 and the first steps towards the development of an fmd vaccine in 1937 waldmann et al 1937 after the second world war fmd vaccines became available in all european countries and the disease was controlled by systematic vaccination until the end of 1991 when the european union adopted a non-vaccination policy directive 85511cee du

the g-h loop binds to certain cellular integrin receptors which are expressed in the epithelial cells targeted during the acute phase of infection alexandersen et al 2003b monaghan et al 2005 in the process of cell culture adaptation fmdv acquire the ability to use other receptors like glycosaminoglycans gags which do not require the rgd motif the host specificity to natural fmdv infection is thought to depend on fmdv binding to specific integrins although there are some other yet undiscovered mechanisms which determine fmdv susceptibility animals that can be affected include cattle swine sheep goats buffaloes and wild ruminants alexandersen and mowat 2005 fmd in bovinae is characterized by fever often above 40 c excessive salivation lameness depression and decreased milk production the mucosa of the lips dorsum of the tongue and the dental plate are most severely involved the mortality rate is low and mostly young animals are affected due to myocardial necrosis alexandersen et al 2003b gulbahar et al 2007 kitching 2002 fmd in pigs primarily affects the feet it is dominated by rather painful formation of vesicles in the epidermis of the feet coronary band interdigital clefts bulbs associated with severe lameness complications are seen such as detachment of the hoof and secondary infection of disrupted aphthae fluid-filled blisters which may cause purulent arthritis of the pedal joint kitching and alexandersen 2002 clinical signs of fmd in sheep and goats are less severe often only lameness through aphthae and inflammation at the cloves alexandersen and mowat 2005 the mechanism of spread of fmdv is primarily in the form of either aerosolized droplets saliva or through indirect contact by personnel or contaminated surfaces and then subsequently back to the respiratory tract alexandersen and mowat 2005 however infection can also occur through lesion of the skin or mucous membranes but this is a very inefficient entering route unless abrasions or cuts are present alexandersen et al 2003a donaldson et al 1987 the site of penetration is influenced by droplet size since only the smallest inhaled droplets reaching the alveoli of the lungs initial infection occurs predominantly at the epithelial surface of the soft palate and adjacent nasopharynx with subsequent spread of virus through regional lymph nodes alexandersen et al 2003a donaldson et al 1987 the virus can be detected in the oral cavity by real time rt-pcr 1-3 days before the onset of the viraemia alexandersen et al 2003b inapparent infections of fmdv can be divided into two types first those animals that become infected and spread the virus without showing clinical signs and second those animals in which the virus persists after recovering from fmd with clinical signs sutmoller and casas 2002 fmdv persistently infected animals are defined as those being virus positive for a minimum of 28 days sutmoller et al 1968 and usually are referred to as carriers persistently infected animals show only low-level excretion of fmdv from the pharynx of ruminants for periods that are species and virus lineage associated salt 1993 the maximum duration of the persistent infection ranges from 4 months in goats to 5 years in african buffaloes syncerus caffer alexandersen et al 2002b fmdv persistence in pigs could not be demonstrated and there is no information about persistence in asian buffaloes bubalus bubalis alexandersen et al 2002b transmission of fmdv from carrier animals to susceptible hosts under field conditions has so far only been shown for african buffaloes to cattle and impala aepyceros melampus bastos et al 2000 dawe et al 1994 however under experimental conditions saliva obtained from carrier animals injected into cattle and pigs has caused infection although there is no information as to whether this also can happen under field conditions alexandersen et al 2002b or with closely related species as the asian buffaloes unlike persistently infected animals subclinically infected animals ie those animals not developing obvious clinical signs may be highly contagious gibbens et al 2001 holzhauer et al 2001 beside the immune status of the host also the involved fmdv lineage plays a role in the subclinical course of the disease bouma and dekker 2002 if an outbreak is caused by vaccine strains which shows reduced virulence sa-carvalho et al 1997 subclinical infections can also be found for example during the fmd outbreak in 2007 in the united kingdom which was caused by a vaccine strain enserink 2007 only few of the fmdv infected animals showed clinical signs subclinical infection can also be produced within vaccinated ruminant herds with a high fmdv challenge in those animals with high immunity or a low challenge in animals with low vaccine titer hutber et al 1999 yadin et al 2007 the possibility of those animals becoming carriers has to the authors knowledge not been examined nevertheless it is likely that such animals may play an important role in the maintenance of fmd in endemic countries kitching 2005 large amounts of the virus are found in all body secretions and excretions over a relatively long time and can be carried in contaminated feed donaldson 1997 wijnker et al 2007 on the tires of vehicles and on the shoes and clothes of people alexandersen et al 2003a grubman and baxt 2004 the transmission via aerosols can also occur depending on weather conditions and the characteristics of virus survival and dissemination alexandersen et al 2002a alexandersen and donaldson 2002 donaldson 1972 donaldson et al 1987 sellers and gloster 2008 the host plays a major role for this transmission route cattle sheep and goats may exhale up to 52 log10 tcid50 of virus per day but pigs which produce up to 86 log10 tcid50 per day represent a significantly greater source of airborne fmdv infections than infected ruminants alexandersen et al 2002a alexandersen et al 2002c alexandersen and donaldson 2002 however the most common route of introduction of fmd into a country free of fmd has been the illegal use of contaminated swill feed hartnett et al 2007 the reduction in ph of meat at post mortem due to accumulation of lactic acid is usually sufficient to kill fmdv but there is no change of ph in the glands and bone marrow and the virus will persist between 20 c and 4 c kitching 2005 the pandemic strain of fmdv serotype o is a major threat to europe it is the most prevalent serotype worldwide although there is no precise genetically explanation for this higher prevalence mason et al 2003 some lineages of the type o are restricted in their host range to suidea cheng et al 2006 whereas others like the panasia strain are not restricted to a specific host knowles et al 2005 there is a great antigenic diversity between the members of this serotype and there is also often no cross-protection between them bronsvoort et al 2004 islam et al 2001 klein et al 2006 konig et al 2007 mattion et al 2004 muthuchelvan et al 2001 tosh et al 2002a there is also evidence that recombination in serotype a occurs much more than in the other serotypes carrillo et al 2005 jackson et al 2007 simmonds 2006 however it is still unclear why so many new lineages of serotype a regularly appear and disappear kitching 2005 the members of this serotype seem to be the less virulent and are usually restricted to asia biswas et al 2006 chang et al 2007 mohapatra et al 2002 mohapatra et al 2004 sanyal et al 2003 sanyal et al 2004a sanyal et al 2004b however in recent years an increase of asia 1 caused outbreaks in asia has been reported as well as further spread of viruses of this type to turkey and greece in 2000 valarcher et al 2005 the sat southern african territories serotypes are usually found in africa but there have also been sporadic outbreaks in saudi arabia and kuwait in 2000 aidaros 2002 there is a higher sequence variation within each of the three sat types than in serotype o bastos et al 2001 bastos et al 2003a during the last 20 years there have been no major outbreaks reported of this serotype only sporadically in south america east africa and pakistan between 2000 and 2006 oie 2008 and there is no explanation for the apparent disappearance however vaccines containing serotype c are still in use in some countries comprising a risk of vaccine induced serotype c outbreaks kitching 2005 generally field epidemiology is the practice of epidemiology in response to problems of a magnitude significant enough to require a rapid or immediate action goodman and buehler 2002 ie it is required to consider when the obtained data are sufficient to make practical recommendations rather than to ask what additional more academic questions might be answered by the data rapid field epidemiological action in case of fmd outbreaks is required to trace potential sources of infection to limit the spread of the disease for example during the 2001 outbreak of fmd in the united kingdom gibbens et al 2001 gibbens and wilesmith 2002 all animal vehicle and personnel movements through animal markets were traced and investigations of infected farms performed in order to identify potential contact farms and to subsequently apply the appropriate control measures disease surveillance on the other hand can be considered as immediate field epidemiological action according to the office international des pizooties oi surveillance means the investigation of a given population or subpopulation to detect the presence of a pathogenic agent or disease the frequency and type of surveillance will be determined by the epidemiology of the pathogenic agent or disease and the desired outputs thiermann 2008 fmd surveillance usually has the following objectives a confirmation of absence of disease defra 2008 b development andor evaluation of fmd control programs in endemic countries chung et al 2002 or c to detect the occurrence of new fmdv lineages del rio vilas et al 2006 sources of data for fmd surveillance can be either purely laboratory results of biological samples collected or participatory information obtained from the farmers or a combination of both key

 though it should be a strived aim to obtain all information it has to be accepted that this is sometimes due to various reasons not possible this is especially true for rural areas and less developed countries fmdv shares its antigenic variability with many other picornaviruses however the extent of this variation is not equal in all picornaviruses eg there are three polio serotypes and more than hundred rhinovirus serotypes domingo et al 1996 duarte et al 1994 there are three major forces driving the molecular evolution of all rna viruses1spontaneous mutation rna virus encoded rna-dependent-rna-polymerase lacks the 35 exonuclease activity proof-reading activity leading to a very high mutation rate approx one mutation per genome per replication drake 1993 these viruses have adapted their genome size to the so called error threshold maximum mutation rate tolerable for a genome size to avoid fitness loss biebricher and eigen 2005 biebricher and eigen 2006 bull et al 2005 escarmis et al 2006 gonzalez-lopez et al 2005 sole et al 20062the phenomenon of spontaneous mutation leads to a statistical effect called genetic drift for an extremely large highly diverse population the ratio of highly fit to less fit genotypes may be very small during a transmission event only a few particles might be transmitted those genotypes do not represent the full genetic or fitness distribution of the original population and therefore often do not include the highly fit genotypes because of their comparatively small numbers the outcome is a new population established in a similar environment but with members of a small less fit on average class of viruses knipe et al 2006 fmdv is thought to evolve mainly through genetic drift due to the high error-prone nature of its rna polymerase domingo et al 2005a domingo et al 2005c the fmdv rna transcription error frequencies are estimated to vary between 103 and 105 nucleotide misincorporations per site per replication cycle haydon et al 20043recombination recombination describes a process in which the fragments of nucleic acid sequences from two genotypically different parental viruses are exchanged so that the progeny contain sequences derived from both parental viruses inter alia picornaviruses coronaviruses and togaviruses display efficient recombination which probably occurs during replication via copy choice enami et al 1989 jarvis and kirkegaard 1992 kirkegaard and baltimore 1986 kuge et al 1989 meier et al 1984 recombination seems to play an important role in fmdv evolution and occurs mainly in the gene regions coding for the non-structural proteins carrillo et al 2005 domingo et al 2003 jackson et al 2007 klein et al 2007 lee et al 2009 but also sometimes in the gene regions coding for the structural proteins haydon et al 2004 haydon and woolhouse 1998 tosh et al 2002b changes in the non-structural proteins may potentially modify the virulence of the virus klein et al 2007 the evolution of the structural proteins especially vp1 which plays a major role in virus entry seems to be mainly shaped by genetic drift domingo et al 2005b domingo et al 2005c domingo 20064migration a population acquires new genetic information primarily through the immigration of individuals from surrounding populations gene flow or genetically effective migration this also applies within a single infected host where different virus variants sometimes can be isolated from different tissues reflecting the adaptation of quasispecies domingo et al 2005a domingo et al 2005b domingo et al 2005c domingo et al 2003 this means that single host populations will compete with new different virus genotypes for the limited number of susceptible host cells which may lead to an increase in virulence the virus strain with the higher basic reproductive rate will overtake the less-virulent but finally end in a stage of equilibrium alexopoulou and dourakis 2005 mao et al 2001 miralles et al 1999 sitia et al 2001 evolution experiments in vitro domingo et al 2002 domingo et al 2005a domingo et al 2005b domingo et al 2005c martinez et al 1992 martinez et al 1991 martinez et al 1997 villaverde et al 1991 demonstrate fmdvs capability of survival despite accumulation of mutations upon repeated bottleneck events where population size is greatly reduced by a catastrophe therefore a range of mutation rate must have evolved to ensure a continuous heterogeneity to find population subsets that can invade cells after bottleneck events and staying below the error-threshold this can be exemplified by the rgdlxxl motif in the highly variable gh loop of vp1 this motif is responsible for receptor recognition v6 and is invariant in most field isolates even after bottleneck events like the introduction of vaccination monaghan et al 2005
 a consequence of the high evolutionary rate of fmdv is that strains of virus with a common origin quickly diverge in sequence as they replicate and spread into new areas therefore the greater the number of differences the greater the distance between the strains in space and time conversely strains with homologous sequences must have had a common more recent origin bastos et al 2003b bronsvoort et al 2004 cottam et al 2006 klein et al 2006 knowles and samuel 2003 konig et al 2007 malirat et al 2007 martin et al 2006 sahle et al 2004 sangare et al 2004 this usage of molecular biological methods for the study of the distribution and determinants of infectious disease is the subject of molecular epidemiology thompson 2000 it is however important to recognize that for the study of the molecular epidemiology of a certain virus like fmdv the knowledge of the molecular evolution is equally important thus knowing the genetic factors which have shaped the evolution of the pathogens will improve the development of vaccines as well as control strategies chareonsirisuthigul et al 2007 de freitas et al 2007 holmes 2007 holmes and drummond 2007 unlike taxonomy which describes how closely related organisms are based on evolutionary grouping by ancestral traits molecular epidemiology correlates phylogenetic information with biological variables and classical epidemiological information furthermore it develops hypotheses about evolutionary changes considering different selection pressures inter alia caused by the hosts immune system and new environmental challenges despite its potential it is important to stress the limits of molecular epidemiology-phylogenies are based on simplified models-the available sequences are most likely biased and very often do not represent a complete spatial and temporal random sample-the majority of sequence analysis for rna viruses is biased because they are despite the quasispecies structure of rna viruses based on a single consensus sequence and thus not mirroring all intrahost viral populations
 in addition two types of probability error must be considered in molecular epidemiology thompson 2000type 1 probability error a subtyping assignment claims epidemiologic relationship of strains when there is nonetype 2 probability error a subtyping assignment concludes that there is no epidemiological relationship when in actuality there is
 generally phylogenetic analysis is a statistical inference of relationship using a probability model of nucleotide and amino-acid substitution evolutionary model assuming the wrong evolutionary model can affect the outcome of a phylogenetic analysis eg by incorrectly estimating tree topology bruno and halpern 1999 penny et al 1994 influencing branch length estimation posada 2001 posada and crandall 2001 and biasing statistical support values buckley and cunningham 2002 the correct evolutionary model becomes a powerful tool when despite its simplified assumptions it can fit the data and make accurate predictions minimizing probability error 1 and 2 the correct model can help to understand the linkage among the spatial temporal and genetic processes taking place during virus transmission in a changed environment thus evolutionary events occur early during the initial expansion and advantageous changes become fixed in the genetic population structure by using hierarchical likelihood ratio tests goldman 1993 posada and crandall 2001 rzhetsky and nei 1995 or akaike information criterion aic tests saffron et al 2006 seghouane and amari 2007 it is possible to identify the most appropriate model for the sequence analysis through a hierarchical set of evolutionary models arndt 2007 buckley and cunningham 2002 fan et al 2007 lemey et al 2005a lemey et al 2005b lemey and vandamme 2005 lunter and hein 2004 salemi et al 1999 van brussel et al 1999 vandamme et al 2000 vandamme et al 1998 vercauteren and vandamme 2006 yang 2002 fmd endemic areas in the world are high-risk zones for introducing fmd to countries free of the disease and for the origin of new fmdv lineages therefore a continuing surveillance of fmdv is needed for the early recognition and understanding of emerging risks or changes in the global fmd situation the detection and characterization of new fmdv lineages and control of possible conformation changes of circulating immuno-relevant epitopes is of special interest as it may indicate that a change in the current used vaccine strains is needed one recent example of a newly occurred fmdv lineage is airn2005 during 2005 a new fmdv a subtype airn2005 spread throughout iran and moved westwards into saudi arabia turkey and in 2007 reached jordan promed 2007 in 2006 this subtype was also detected in pakistan klein et al 2007 this particular fmdv subtype has proven to be highly virulent and has caused severe disease in all ages of cattle eufmd 2007 serum neutralization assays demonstrated a closer relationship to a22 than to other serotype a subtypes paton 2006 and the world reference laboratory as well as the fao european commission for the control of fmd recommend in the absence of an homologous vaccine strain the use of the widely available a22 iraq strain as vaccine paton et al 2006 it has been hypothesized that the airn2005 sublineage has undergone two different paths of evolution for the structural and non-structural genome regions klein et al 2007 the structural genome regions may have had their evolutionary starting point in the a22 sublineage it can be assumed that due to the quasispecies structure of fmdv populations and the error-prone replication process advantageous mutations in a changed environment have been fixed and have lead to the occurrence of the new airn2005 sublineage together with this mechanism recombination within the non-structural genome regions potentially modifying the virulence of the virus may be involved in the success of this new sublineage the possible origin of this recombinant virus may be a co-infection with asia1 and a serotype a precursor of the airn2005 sublineage within asian buffaloes another example of a new fmdv lineage is the currently described panasia ii lineage described so far in bhutan nepal malaysia and pakistan which seems to evolve away from the old panasia lineage klein et al 2008 leading possible to a decrease in the used o1manisa vaccine efficiency a special situation is the office international des epizooties oie status of fmd-free countries where vaccination is practiced in these countries fmdv is not eradicated and still circulates in the susceptible population this leads to a permanent bottleneck situation for the virus and the emergence of vaccine escape mutants is likely as seen for the serotype a outbreaks in south america during the last years konig et al 2007 mattion et al 2004 perez et al 2008 however molecular epidemiology may also be helpful to detect low vaccine coverage klein et al 2006 malirat et al 2007 in an ongoing outbreak situation molecular epidemiology is a useful tool to track virus and to consequently stop the transmission but also the post-outbreak investigation is important with regard to the claim for damages the best examples for this particular field are given by work done on the united kingdom outbreaks in 2001 and 2007 in 2001 great britain experienced an epidemic of fmdv caused by the pan asia o strain of the virus alexandersen et al 2003a cottam et al 2006 the disease spread rapidly and widely throughout the country and further to the republic of ireland france and the netherlands due to the size of the outbreak it was not possible to track the transmission route and many cases were simply attributed to local spread however many tissue samples have been collected during the seven-month lasting outbreak and it was possible to study the microevolution of the virus and thereby recover particular transmission pathways of the acting fmdv lineage cottam et al 2006 on august 3 2007 a new outbreak of fmd was confirmed in surrey united kingdom the causing fmdv lineage was identified as ofs 1860uk67 a virus isolated not in circulation in animals since 1967 however this lineage was used at the nearby pirbright laboratory site which houses separate units of the institute for animal health and merial animal health ltd and it was soon clear that this was the origin of the virus thus the question arose from which unit the virus escaped full length genome sequencing of the virus isolates obtained from infected animals have shown typical amino acid adaptations for fmdv propagated for several passages in cell culture systems as used in vaccine production and merial animal health ltd was identified as the source of the outbreak cottam et al 2008 molecular epidemiology of fmd is a powerful tool if applied correctly with regard to the statistical methods and when supplied with classical epidemiological information it is important to stress that taxonomical relationship deduction alone is not enough to understand the dynamics of fmdv furthermore it should be a strived aim to develop bioinformatics tools which are able to handle the complex virushost interactions during infection as for example seen in the action of micrornas during viral infection although active surveillance of fmd has decreased dramatically the incidence of the disease in europe the fear of new outbreaks still exists and as the example of last outbreak in uk in 2007 demonstrates it is not unreasonable cottam et al 2008 moreover fmd remains endemic in developing countries of asia south america and africa where new fmdv strains are most likely to evolve and where the only solution for the effective eradicationreduction is the application of measures based on the molecular and genetic characterization of the virus bronsvoort et al 2004 klein et al 2007 klein et al 2006 klein et al 2008 introduction of new fast methods such as real time rt-pcr into fmd diagnostics together with viral sequence analysis allows the study of viral biodiversity and evolution and thereby to track transmission events and sources as well as to assure vaccine coverage of corresponding field fmdv lineages     the potential of these vector vaccines lies in the hope that such a vaccine would be cheaper safer andor more effective than existing vaccines to some pathogen vaccinia virus as a vector has attracted most attention to date because a several immunogenes can be inserted into its genome without destroying its infectivity b the immunogens appear to be produced normally c vaccinia virus has been used highly successfully to eradicate smallpox and d it has a wide host-range and thus might find veterinary as well as human medical application experimental vaccines successfully tested in animals have been prepared using immunogenes from influenza virus hepatitis b virus and herpes simplex viru apathogenic enteric bacteria have some potential as vectors most probably against enteric pathogens although the potential of viral vectors is likely to be realized firsl parasitic worms and protozoa devastate millions of people when the immunogens of these organisms have been identified there will be added impetus to investigate the potential of vector vaccines against these pathogen keywords vectors bacterial vectors viral vectors vaccinia virus immunogens immunogenes for many years the term vector the latin word for a carrier or bearer has meant for the biologist an agent transferring a parasite to a host invertebrate vectors come most readily to mind for example mosquitoes and tsetse flies transmitting the protozoans which cause malaria and sleeping-sickness respectively more recently the term has been applied to plasmids which have been manipulated by biologists to transfer selected genes for expression of bacteria and yeast cells the papovavirus simian virus 40 sv40 and bovine papilloma virus have been used as vectors in conjunction with eukaryotic cells these vectors were used to transfer genes from other biological entities foreign genes to cells in vitro either for fundamental research purposes or for the production of proteins which would subsequently be purified for prototype vaccines eg hepatitis b virus surface antigen hbsag from yeast 1-3 and foot and mouth disease virus vpi protein from escherichia coli 45 it was a logical step to produce vectors which could be used to immunize animals directly so that the foreign gene protein product the immunogen was produced in vivo the potential advantages of this approach are discussed later in this paper for convenience i shall use the word qmmunogene to denote a gene which specifies the production of a protein which in the course of natural infection with a pathogen induces a protective immune response the focus of attention at the moment is the vector potential of vaccinia virus the vaccine virus which has eradicated smallpox by viral standards the vaccinia virus dna genome is enormous comprising 180 000 base pairs some of the vaccinia virus genes are not essential for its replication this fact raised the possibility that also demonstrated marker rescue using another deletion mutant of vaccinia virus panicali and paolettp then showed that the tk gene from the unrelated herpes simplex virus hsv could be inserted into the genome of infectious vaccinia virus and that a functional tk enzyme was produced very soon afterwards mackett et al 9 presented similar findings again exploiting the tk genes of vaccinia virus and hsv thus it had been shown that vaccinia virus was a very useful selectable cloning and expression vector the potential of this vector for vaccine purposes was not lost on either group in the subsequent two years several papers have been published which further illustrate this potential a recombinant vaccinia virus has been formed containing the hbsag gene not only was this gene expressed in vitro but rabbits vaccinated intradermally with the live recombinant produced antibody against hbsag  the haemagglutinin ha immunogene of influenza virus has been inserted in the vaccinia virus genome tissue culture cells infected by the recombinant produced glycosylated ha and transported it to the cell surface 12s both rabbits and hamsters which had been inoculated with the recombinant produced serum antibody that neutralized influenza virus moreover hamsters which had been inoculated intradermally with the recombinant were protected against respiratory infection by live influenza virus applied intranasally s mice which had been inoculated intraperitoneally with a vaccinia virus recombinant containing the gene for glycoprotein d of hsv resisted a lethal dose of live hsval most recently vaccinia virus recombinants containing the gene coding for the circumsporozoite antigen of the malaria parasite plasmodium knowlesi have been made 4 rabbits inoculated intradermally with these recombinants produced antibody which reacted with extracts of p knowlesi sporozoites the authors have suggested that it should be possible to express several antigens from different life cycle stages of the parasite to make a more potent vaccine is vaccinia virus the only virus that can be used for vector vaccines several other eukaryotic viruses have established or potential use as vectors eg sv40 adenovirus bovine papilloma virus herpes virus and retroviruses however it has been pointed out that these viruses can be oncogenic while vaccinia virus is not s another advantage of vaccinia virus is that it has been used highly effectively in its own right as a vaccine to eradicate smallpox its large genome permits the inclusion of large amounts of dna the construction of stable and infectious recombinants containing more than 20 000 bases of foreign dna have been claimed by both american groups thus there is the potential for constructing polyvalent vaccines vaccinia virus has a large host range which may make it suitable for the production of vaccines for some animals alternatively other pox viruses may be used the poultry industry would seem to be a suitable one in which to use vectors chickens are kept at very high stocking densities and this is conducive to the spread of infectious diseases vaccines and drugs are essential for intensive poultry keeping however the uk poultry industry spends only about 01 of its turnover on vaccines profit margins are very slim indeed for much of 1983 the uk broiler growers sold at a loss thus vaccines must be cheap to buy they should also be cheap to apply handling birds for individual vaccination is costly but for some vaccines this is currently unavoidable some live vaccines can be applied inexpensively in drinking water or by spray they generally induce good immunity but can cause problems thus vaccine strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv a coronavirus can cause damage to the oviduct and kidneys of chickens ibv can also predispose young chickens to secondary infection by some strains ofe coli causing colisepticaemia on multiage sites the vaccine virus may spread to very young chickens with deleterious effects inactivated virus vaccines are not associated with these problems ie they are safer but they are costly to buy and apply in the case of ibv the inactivated virus alone does not induce good protection for coccidiosis of chickens caused by several species of the protozoan eimeria no effective vaccines exist inactivated vaccines have been prepared but they did not induce protection the vector approach may be the solution to these problems with some pathogens in many parts of the world fowl pox is a problem and a live pox virus vaccine is used for its control a pox virus recombinant carrying the immunogene of say ibv would not be associated with the problems of current live ibv vaccines ie it would be safer and would still be inexpensive the successful protection of hamsters against another respiratory virus influenza virus by a vaccinia virus recombinant carrying the influenza virus ha gene holds the promise that a similarly constructed avian pox vaccine would protect chickens against ibv bacteria have been suggested as potential vectors of immunogenes in connection with vaccines for poultry 1-17 and human rotaviruses  the bacterium chosen probably an e coli strain would have to be non-pathogenic but capable of colonizing the gastrointestinal tract for a time sufficient to permit a protective immune response to be mounted against the immunogen expression of the immunogen at the bacterial cell surface would probably induce a better immune response than if the immunogen was exposed only alter the death of the bacterium the requirements lot the transport of proteins to the surface of bacteria is under study 9 ii would be expected that the use of an enteric bacterial vector would be most effective against pathogens of the gastrointestinal tract protection at other mucosal surfaces might arise if the common mucosal immune system was effective 2 apart from the isolation of suitable bacteria selection of plasmids for transfer of the immunogen and obtaining expression at the bacterial surface other potential problems to be overcome include a the tendency of some foreign proteins synthesized in bacteria to be hydrolysed rapidly or to be toxic for the bacterium b the lack ot glycosylation which may be structurally important and c the possible failure of the polypeptides of normally oligomeric proteins to be assembled which may result in decreased antigenicity however proteins of several viruses have been produced in t coli in the case of fmdv when the resultant protein was inoculated into cattle and swine they were protected against challenge with fmdv 5 murray et al s have reported that preparations of hepatitis b core antigen produced in t coli were protective or reduced the severity of infection of chimpanzees with hepatitis b virus bacteria as vectors have potential advantages which warrant continued consideration innocuous il coli strains occur naturally in many animals technology for the large-scale production of bacteria is well developed the bacteria would be expected to be more stable than many live virus vaccines stability being an important attribute for any vaccine administration would be very simple and inexpensive for animals the bacterium could be added to lkod and water when might a vector be chosen as the basis for a vaccine first it must be asked whether when a vaccine against a pathogen exists a new type of vaccine is warranted recently broomby 2 has listed a number of advantages that a product of new biological techniques might have simplified production increased safety greater stability improved potency reduced allergenicity patentability a new product probably developed at high cost will have to have strong advantages in order to compete with an established product and recover its costs vaccines which are totally new may be commercially more attractive eg against coccidiosis in poultry endoand ecto-parasites herpes simplex virus a vector-based vaccine may be more cheaply produced or safer than current vaccines against for example hepatitis b virus and ibv respectively other new approaches to vaccine production are currently being investigated synthesis of proteins or peptides in bacteria yeast or eukaryotic cells chemical synthesis of peptides rational manipulation of virus genomes and development of more suitable adjuvants although it is most unlikely that the vector approach will be suitable for all diseases it does have several major potential advantages some of which stem from experimental observations immunogenes have been transferred to vaccinia virus the genes were expressed the immunogen had properties very similar to the immunogen derived from the parent virus inoculated animals did respond with protective immune responses especially exciting was the protection of the lower respiratory tract of hamsters against infection by influenza virus following intradermal inoculation of a vaccinia virus recombinant carrying the influenza virus ha gene production ofimmunogens in infected cells following the use of the live poxvirus vector might stimulate a much more comprehensive array of immune responses than would arise tbllowing the parenteral administration of an inactivated virus or subunit vaccine the transport of immunogens to the surface of a cell may in some cases be necessary for the induction of an efficient protective immune response other advantages ofvaccinia virus are that it has been used as a vaccine for many years experience of it in the medical community is worldwide little expertise is required for its administration and its success in eliminating smallpox is beyond dispute however some misgivings have been expressed because a number of people who had been vaccinated with vaccinia virus had serious complications some of which led to death surveys undertaken during the 1960s in the usa indicated that the risk of death from all vaccination complications was for primary vaccinees a one per million vaccinees of all ages b five per million vaccinees under 12 months of age and c 05 per million vaccinees 1-19 years old 22 in addition the combined rate of postvaccinial encephalitis and vaccinia necrosum was 65 per million for infants and three per million for those aged 1-19 years 22 figures such as these must be taken into account when consideration is given to the use of vaccinia virus as a vector however pathogens afflict mankind on a much greater scale parasitic worms helminths infect some 3000 million people 23 on the african continent alone some 160-200 million people are affected by malaria causing about one million deaths per year 24 an estimated 200 million people are affected by hepatitis b virus 2s these terrible figures demand that vaccines be developed apart from being safe and efficacious they must be cheap to produce and to administer a vector vaccine based on vaccinia virus would seem to be a very suitable approach to this challenge especially for developing countries vectors of immunogenes d cavanagh where the disease problems are greatest and the ability to pay is least it is not being suggested that the vector approach in general or the use of pox viruses in particular will be a panacea for our outstanding vaccine problems nevertheless this approach has great potential and warrants investigation with immunogens of many pathogens f just one human and one veterinary vaccine were to be successfully based on vectors the gain to mankind could be enormous  combining visible light and infrared imaging for efficient detection of respiratory infections such as covid-19 on portable device zheng jiang menghan hu lei fan yaling pan wei tang guangtao zhai yong lu z jiang m hu  coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 2 sars-cov-2 has become a serious global epidemic in the past few months and caused huge loss to human society worldwide for such a large-scale epidemic early detection and isolation of potential virus carriers is essential to curb the spread of the epidemic recent studies have shown that one important feature of covid-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by viral infections during the epidemic many people tend to wear masks to reduce the risk of getting sick therefore in this paper we propose a portable non-contact method to screen the health condition of people wearing masks through analysis of the respiratory characteristics the device mainly consists of a flir one thermal camera and an android phone this may help identify those potential patients of covid-19 under practical scenarios such as pre-inspection in schools and hospitals in this work we perform the health screening through the combination of the rgb and thermal videos obtained from the dual-mode camera and deep learning architecture we first accomplish a respiratory data capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition then a bidirectional gru neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the respiratory data to obtain the health screening result the results of validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status on respiratory with the accuracy of 837 on the real-world dataset the abnormal respiratory data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from ruijin hospital affiliated to the shanghai jiao tong university medical school other normal respiratory data are obtained from healthy people around our researchers  during the outbreak of covid-19 epidemic early control is essential among all the control measures efficient and safe identification of potential patients is the most important part existing researches show that human physiological state can be perceived through breathing 1  which means respiratory signals are vital signs that can reflect human health condition to a certain extent 2  many clinical literature suggests that abnormal respiratory symptoms may be important factors for diagnosis of some specific diseases 3  recent studies have found that covid-19 patients will have obvious respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath fever tiredness and dry cough 4 5  among those symptoms atypical or irregular breathing is considered as one of the early signs for many people early mild respiratory symptoms are difficult to be recognized therefore through the measurement of respiration condition potential covid-19 patients can be screened to some extent this may play an auxiliary diagnostic role thus helping to find potential patients as early as possible traditional respiration measurement requires attachments of sensors to the patients body 6  the monitor of respiration is measured through the movement of the chest or abdomen contact measurement equipment is bulky expensive and time-consuming the most important thing is that the contact during measurement may increase the risk of spreading infectious diseases such as covid-19 therefore the non-contact measurement is more suitable for the current situation in recent years many non-contact respiration measurement methods have been developed based on imaging sensors doppler radar 7  depth camera 8 and thermal cam-era 9  considering factors such as safety stability and price the measurement technology of thermal imaging is the most suitable for extensive promotion so far thermal imaging has been used as a monitoring technology in a wide range of medical fields such as estimations of heart rate 10 and breathing rate 11 12 13  another important thing is that many existing respiration measurement devices are large and immovable given the worldwide epdemic the partable and intelligent screening equipment is required to meet the needs of largescale screening and other application scenarios in a real-time manner for thermal imaging based respiration measurement nostril regions and mouth regions are the only focused regions since only these two parts have periodic heat exchange between the body and the outside environment however until now researchers seldom considered measuring thermal respiration data for people wearing masks during the epidemic of infectious diseases masks may effectively suppress the spread of the virus according to recent studies 14 15  therefore developing the respiration measurement method for people wearing masks becomes quite practical in this study we develop a portable and intelligent health screening device that uses thermal imaging to extract respiration data from masked people which is then used to do the health screening classification via deep learning architecture in classification tasks deep learning has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in most research areas compared with traditional classifiers classifiers based on deep learning can automatically identify the corresponding features and their correlations rather than extracting features manually for breathing tasks algorithms based deep learning can also better extract the corresponding features such as breathing rate and breath-to-exhale ratio and make more accurate predictions 16 17 18 19  recently many researchers made use of deep learning to analyze the respiratory process cho et al used a convolutional neural network cnn to analyze human breathing parameters to determine the degree of nervousness through thermal imaging 20  romero et al applied a language model to detect acoustic events in sleepdisordered breathing through related sounds 21  wang et al utilized deep learning and depth camera to classify abnormal respiratory patterns in real time and achieved excellent results 8  the disadvantage of this research may be that the equipment is not portable in this paper we propose a remote potable and intelligent health screening system based on respiratory data for pre-screening and auxiliary diagnosis of respiratory diseases like covid-19 in order to be more practical in a situation where people often choose to wear masks the breathing data capture method for people wearing masks is introduced after extracting breathing data from the video obtained from the thermal camera a deep learning neural network is performed to work on the classification between healthy and abnormal respiration conditions to verify the robustness of our algorithm and the effectiveness of the proposed equipment we an-alyze the influence of mask type measurement distance and measurement angle on breathing data the main contributions of this paper are threefold first we combine the face recognition technology with dual-mode imaging to accomplish a respiratory data extraction method for people wearing masks which is quite essential for current situation based on our dual-camera algorithm the respiration data is successfully obtained from masked facial thermal videos subsequently we propose a classification method to judge abnormal respiratory state with deep learning framework finally based on the two contributions mentioned above we have implemented a non-contact and efficient health screening system for respiratory infections using the actual measured data from hospital which may contribute to finding the possible cases of covid-19 and keeping the control of the secondary spread of sarscov-2 a brief introduction to the proposed respiration condition screening method is shown below we first use the portable and intelligent screening device to get the thermal and the corresponding rgb videos during the data collection we also perform a simple real-time screening result after getting the thermal videos the first step is to extract respiration data from faces in thermal videos during the extraction process we use the face detection method to capture peoples masked areas then a region of interest roi selection algorithm is proposed to get the region from the mask that stands for the characteristic of breath most finally we use a bidirectional gru neural network with attention mechanism bigru-at model to work on the classification task with the input respiration data our data collection is achieved by the system shown in fig  1  the whole screening system includes a flir one thermal camera an android smartphone and the corresponding application we have written which is used for data acquisition and simple instant analysis our screening equipment whose main advantage is portable can be easily applied to measure abnormal breathing in many occasions of instant detection as shown in fig 1  the flir one thermal camera consists of two canmeras an rgb camera and a thermal camera we collect the face videos from both cameras and use face recogition method to get the nostril area and forehead area the temperatures of the two regions are calculated in time series and is shown in the screening result page in fig 1b  the red line stands for the body temprature and the blue line stands for breathing data from the breathing data we can predict the respiratory pattern of the testcase then a simple real-time screening result is given directly in the application fig 1  overview of portable and intelligent health screening system for respiratory infections a device appearance b analysis result of the application notice that the system can simultaneously collect body temperature signals in the current work this body temperature signal is not considered in the model and is only used as a reference for the users  according to the extracted features shown in fig 1  we use the the raw face videos collected from both rgb camera and thermal camera as the data for further study to ensure accuracy and higher performance when continuous breathing activities performs there is a fact that periodic temperature fluctuations occur around the nostril due to the inspiration and expiration cycles therefore respiration data can be obtained by analyzing the temperature data around the nostril based on thermal image sequence however when people wear masks many facial features are blocked because of this merely recognizing the face through thermal image will lose a lot of geometric and textural facial details resulting in recognition errors of the face and mask parts in order to solve this problem we adopt the method based on two parallel located rgb and infrared cameras for face and mask region recognition the masked region of face is first captured in the rgb camera then such region is mapped to the thermal image with a related mapping function the algorithm for masked face detection is based on pyramidbox model created by tang et al 22  the main idea is to apply tricks like gaussian pyramidbox in deep learning to get the context correlations as further characteristics the face image is first used to extract features of different scales using gaussian pyramid algorithm for those high-level contextual features a feature pyramid network is proposed to further excavate high-level contextual features then the output together with those low-level features are combined in lowlevel feature pyramid layers finally the result is obtained after another two layers of deep neural network for faces that a lot of features are lost due to the cover of mask such a context-sensitive structure can obtain more feature correlations and thus improve the accuracy of face detection in our experiment we use the open source model from paddlehub to detect the face area on rgb videos the next step is to extract the masked area and map the area from rgb video to thermal video since the position of the mask on the human face is fixed after obtaining the position coordinates of the human face we obtain the mask area of the face by scaling down in equal proportions for a detected face with width w and height h the loaction of left-up corner is defined as 0 0 the loaction of right-bottom corner is then w h the corresponding coordinate of the two corners of mask region is decalred as w4 h2 and 3w4 4h5 considering that the background to the boundary of the mask will produce a large contrast with the movement which is easy to cause errors we choose the center area of the mask through this division then the selected area is mapped from the rgb image to thermal image to obtain the masked region in thermal videos after getting the masked region in thermal videos we need to get the region of interest roi that represents breathing features recent studies often characterize breathing data through temperature changes around the nostril 10 23  however when people wear masks there exists another problem that the nostrils are also blocked by the masks and when people wearing different masks the roi may be different therefore we perform a roi tracking method based on maximizing the variance of thermal image sequence to extract a certain area on the masked region of the thermal video which stands for the breath signals most due to the lack of texture features in masked regions compared to human faces we judge the roi by the temperature change of thermal image sequence the main idea is to traverse the masked region in the thermal images and find a small block with the largest temperature change as the selected roi the position of a certain block is fixed in the masked region among all the frames since the nostril area is fixed on the face region we do not need to consider the movement of the block since our face recognition algorithm can detect the mask position in each frames thermal image for a certain block with height m and width n we define the average pixel intensity at frame t as for thermal imagesst represents the temperature value at frame t for every block we obtained we calculate their st on time line then for each block n the total variance of the list of average pixel intensity with t frames  2 s n is calculated as shown in eq 2 where  stands for the mean value ofst since respiration is a periodic data spread out from the nostril area we can consider that the block with the largest variance is the position where the heat changes most in both frequency and value within the mask which stands for the breath data most in the masked region we adjust the corresponding block size according to the size of the masked region for a masked region with n blocks the final roi is selected by for each thermal video we traverse all possible blocks in the mask regions of each frame and find the rois for each frame by the method above the respiration data is then defined asst0  t  t  which is the pixel intensities of rois in all the frames we apply a bigru-at neural network to do the classification task on judging whether the respiration condition is healthy or not as shown in fig 3  the input of the network is the respiration data obtained by our extraction method since the respiratory data is time series it can be regarded as a time series classification problem therefore we choose the gate recurrent unit gru network with bidirection and attention layer to work on the sequence prediction task among all the deep learning structures recurrent neural network rnn is a type of neural network which is specially used to process time series data samples 24  for a time step t the rnn model can be represented by where x t  h t and o t stands for the current input state hidden state and output at time step t respectively v w u are parameters obtained by training procedure b is the bias and  and  are activation functions the final prediction is y t  long-short term memory network is developed on the basis of rnn 25  compared to rnn which can only memorize and analyze short-term information it can process relatively long-term information and is suitable for problems with short-term delays or long time intervals based on lstm many related structures are proposed in recent years 26  gru is a simplified lstm which merges three doors of lstm forget input and output into two doors update and reset 27  for tasks with a few data gru may achieve a better result than lstm since it includes less parameters in our task since the input of the neural network is only the respiration data in time sequence the gru network may perform a better result than lstm network the structure of gru can be expressed by the following equations where r t is the reset gate that controls the amount of information being passed to the new state from the previous states z t stands for the update gate which determines the amount of information being forgotten and added w r  w z and w h are trained parameters that vary in the training procedureh t is the candidate hidden layer which can be regarded as a summary of the above information h t1 and the input information x t at time step t h t is the output layer at time step t which will be sent to the next unit the bidirectional rnn has been widely used in natural language processing 28  the advantage of such network structure is that it can strengthen the correlation between context of the sequence as the respiratory data is a periodic sequence we use bidirectional gru to obtain more information from the periodic sequence the difference between bidirectional gru and normal gru is that backfoward sequence of data is spliced to the original forward sequence of data in this way the hidden layer of the original ht is changed to where   h t is the original hidden layer and   h t is the backfoward sequence of   h t  during the analysis of respiratory data the entire waveform in time sequence should be taken into consideration for some specic breathing pattern such as sphyxia several paticular features such as sudden acceleration may occur only at a certain point in the entire process however if we only use the bigru network these features may be weakened as the time sequence data is input step by step which may cause a larger error in prediction therefore we add an attention layer to the network which can ensure that certain key point features in the breathing process can be maximized attention mechanism is a choice to focus only on those important points among the total data 29  it is often combined with neural networks like rnn before the rnn model summarizes the hidden states for the output an attention layer can make an estimation of all outputs and find the most important ones this mechanism has been widely used in many research areas the structure of attention layer is where h t represents the bigru layer output at time step t which is bidirectional w u and b w are also parameters that vary in the training process a t performs a softmax fucntion on u t to get the weight of each step t finally the output of the attention layer s is a combination of all the steps from bigru with different weights by applying another softmax function to the output s we get the final prediction of the classification task the structure of the whole network is shown in fig 3  our goal is to distinguish whether there is an epidemic infectious disease such as covid-19 according to the abnormal breathing in the respiratory system our dataset is not collected from patients with covid-19 these data were obtained from the inpatients of the respiratory disease department and cardiology department in ruijin hospital most of the patients we collected data from only caught with basic or chronic respiratory disease they did not have fever which is the typical respiratory symptoms of infectious diseases therefore the body temperature is not taken into consideration in our current screening system in ruijin hospital wards we use a flir one thermal camera connected to an android phone to work on the data collection we collected data from 73 people for each person we collect two 20-second infrared and rgb camera data with a sampling frequency of 10 hz through data cutting and oversampling we finally obtained 1925 healthy breathing data and 2292 abnormal breathing data a total of 4217 data each piece of data consists of 100 frames of infrared and rgb videos in 10 seconds in the bigru-at network the hidden cells in bigru layer and attention layers are 32 and 8 respectively the breathing data is normalized before input into the neural network and we use cross-entropy as the loss function during the training process we separate the dataset into two parts the training set includes 1427 healthy breathing data and 1780 abnormal breathing data and the test set contains 498 healthy breathing data and 512 abnormal breathing data once this paper is accepted we will release the dataset used in the current work for non-commercial users among the whole dataset we choose 4 typical respiratory data examples as shown in fig 4 fig 4a and fig 4 b stand for the abnormal respiratory patterns extracted from patients fig 4 c and fig 4d represent the normal respiratory pattern called eupnea from healthy participants by comparison we can find that the respiratory of normal people is in strong periodic and evenly distributed while abnormal respiratory data tend to be more irregular generally speaking most abnormal breathing data from respiratory infections have faster frequency and irregular amplitude the experimental results are shown in table 1 we consider four evaluation metrics viz accuracy precision recall and f1 to measure the performance of our model we compare the result of our model with three other models which are gru-at bilstm-at and lstm respectively the result shows that our method performs better than any other networks in all evaluation metrics despite the precision value of gru-at by comparison the experimental result demonstrates that attention mechanism is well-performed in keeping important node features in the time series of breathing data since the networks with attention layer all perform a better result than lstm another point is that gru based networks achieve better result than lstm based networks this may beacuse our data set is relatively small which cant fill the demand of the lstm based networks gru based networks require less data than lstm and perform better result in our respiration condition classification task to figure out the detailed information about the classification of respiratory state we plotted the confusion matrixs of the four models as demonstrated in fig 5  as can be seen from the results the performance improvement of bigru-at compared to lstm is mainly in the accuracy rate of the negative class this is because many scatter-like abnormalities in the time series of abnormal breathing are better recognized by the attention mechanism besides the misclassification rate of the four networks are relatively high to some extent which may because many positive samples do not have typical respiratory infections characteristics since part of the patients caught other lung-related diseases in the analysis section we give 3 comparasions from different aspects to prove the robustness of our algorithm and device in order to measure the robustness of our breathing data acquisition algorithm and the effectiveness of the proposed portable device we analyze the breathing data of the same person wearing different masks we design 3 mask wearing scenarios that cover most situations wearing one surgical mask blue line wearing one kn95 n95 mask red line and wearing two surgical masks green line the results are shown in fig 6  it can be seen from the experimental results that no matter what kind of mask is worn or even two masks the respiratory data can be well recognized this proves the stability of our algorithm and device however since different masks have different thermal insulation capabilities the average breathing temperature may vary as the mask changes to minimize this error respiratory data are normalized before input into the neural network  in order to verify the robustness of our algorithm and device in different scenarios we design experiments to collect respiratory data at different distances considering the limitations of handheld devices we test the collection of facial respiration data from a distance of 0 to 2 meters the result is demonstrated in fig 7  the signal tends to be periodic from the position of 10 centimeters and it does not start to lose regularity until about 18 meters at a distance of about 10 centimeters the complete face begins to appear in the camera video when the distance comes to 18 meters our face detection algorithm begins to fail gradually due to the distance and pixel limitation this experiment verifies that our algorithm and device can guarantee relatively accurate measurement results in the distance range of 01 meters to 18 meters considering that breath detection will be applied in different scenarios we design this experiment to show the actual situation under different shooting angles we define the camera directly towards the face to be 0 degree and design an experiment in which the shooting angle gradually changed from 45 degrees to 0 degree we consider the transformation of two angles horizontal and vertical which respectively represent left and right turning and nodding the results in the two cases are quite different as shown in fig 8  our algorithm and device maintain good results in horizontal rotation but it is difficult to obtain precise respiratory data in vertical rotation this means participants can trun left or turn right during the measurement but cant nod or head up since this may impact the measurement result in this paper we propose a abnormal breathing detection method based on a portable dual-mode camera which can reocrd both rgb and thermal videos in our detection method we first accomplished an accurate and robust respiratory data detecion algorithm which can precisely extract breathing data from people wearing masks then a bigru-at network is applied to work on the screening of respiratory infections in validation experiments the obtained bigru-at network achieves a realtively good result with the accuracy of 837 on the real-world dataset it is foreseeable that in patients with covid-19 who have more clinical respiratory symptoms this classification method may yield better results during the current outbreak of covid-19 our research can work as prescan method for abnomral breathing in many scenarios such as community campus and hospital which may contribute to distuigishing the possible cases  and then keep the control of the virus spread in future research on the basis of ensuring portability we plan to use a more stable algorithm to minimize the effect of different masks on measurement of breathing condition besides temperature may be taken into consideration to achieve a higher detection accuracy on respiratory infections  bioinformatical study on the proteomics and evolution of sars-cov shuqun l1u guo tao j xinglai i sun zhirong  a novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars for all the sars-cov associated proteins derivated from the sars-cov genome the physiochemical properties such as the molecular weight isoelectric point and extinction coefficient of each protein were calculated the transmembrane segments and subcellular localization sublocation prediction and conserved protein motifs search against database were employed to analyze the function of sars-cov proteins also the homology protein sequence alignment and evolutionary distance matrix calculation between sars-cov associated proteins and the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses were employed to identity the classification and phylogenetic relationship between sars-cov and other coronaviruses the results showed that sars-cov is a novel coronavirus which is different from any of the three previously known groups of coronviruses but it is closer to bo-coy and mhv than to other coronaviruses this study is in aid of experimental determination of sars-cov proteomics and the development of antiviral vaccine  the first case of atypical pneumonia referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was identified in guangdong province in china in november 2002 then it has spread to several countries and regions such as hong kong vietnam singapore canada and taiwan cumulative number of reported cases of sars has been 8221 and the number of deaths has been 735 in the world up to may 28 2003 among them there are 5332 reported cases of sars and 321 deaths in china and the mortality rate has increased to 15 from the early 4 estimated by the world health organization who who stated that under the efforts of 13 laboratories in china germany canada etc a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the sars on april 16 2003  and this virus was named sars coronavirus sars-cov 1 2 3  the first completed genome and gene special topics map of sars-cov were released by scientists in canada 3 on april 12 subsequently scientists in china hong kong usa and singapore released in succession the completed sars-cov genomes determined by themselves 4 5 6 7  there were 27 items of sars-cov associated nucleotide sequences deposited in genbank database httpwwwncbinlmnihgovl and 14 of them were completed sars-cov genomes up to may 30 2003 the classification status of coronavirus is order nidovirales family coronaviridae gnenus coronavirus it replicates in the cytoplasm of human and animal host cells and causes respiratory and enteric diseases in host coronaviruses contain a positive-stranded rna with approximately 30000 nucleotides and feature the largest viral rna genome known to date the coronaviruses known to date are divided into three groups groups 1 2 and 3 according to their serotype groups 1 and 2 contain mammalian viruses while group 3 contains only avian viruses within each group coronaviruses are classified into distinct species by host ranges antigenic relationships and genomic organization each species of coronavirus typically infects only one host species and is fastidious in cell culture the viruses can cause severe disease in many animals including avian infectious bronchitis feline infectious peritonitis porcine gastroenteritis etc and often cause significant lose in stock raising 8  the two known human coronavirus hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 belong to respectively group 1 and group 2 and are responsible for about 30 of influenza and mild upper respiratory tract illness 9  upon coronavirus entry into an appropriate host cell the 5 i most open reading frame orflab of virus genome is translated into a large polyprotein that is cleaved by viral-encoded proteases to release several protein products 5  including a 3c-like proteinase 3cu ro  an rna-dependent rna polymerase rep an atpase helicase hel etc out of them rep and hel are responsible for replicating the viral genome and generating nested transcripts that are used in the synthesis of the viral proteins by host cell ribosome there are four primary structural proteins including the nucleocapsid protein n spike protein s membrane protein m and small envelope protein e all of them are glycoproteins the full-length replicated rna plus strand first assembles with the n protein this rna-protein complex then associates with m and n proteins embedded in the membranes of the er and new virus particles are formed as the nucleocapsid complexes which bud into the er the virus then migrates through the golgi and eventually exits the cell likely by exocyto-sis io  it is worth pointing out that the s membrane glycoprotein is functionally important for defining host range and tissue tropism because the virus entry into cell requires the interaction between s protein and its special i cumulative number of reported cases of sars is published at httpwwwwhointcsrsars article cellular receptor 8  the sequence lengths of the 14 completed genomes of sars-cov deposited in ncbi genbank range from 29712 to 29751 and the nucleotide difference between these genomes is about 01  the gc content is about 41  the genomic organization is typical of coronaviruses with the characteristic gene order of 5 i rep s e m and n genes 5 6  of which the sars-cov rep gene comprises approximately two-thirds of the genome it includes two open reading frames orfla and orflb which are predicted to encode two polyproteins undergoing co-translational proteolytic processing and generate many protein products it also predicted that the regions located between sand e and between m and n encode a number of non-structural proteins that vary widely among different coronaviruses with unknown function 4 5 6  in this study all the sars-cov associated proteins were subject to bioinformatical analysis the physiochemical properties of each protein such as molecular weight isoelectric point and extinction coefficient were calculated the transmembrane segments and subcellular localization prediction and conserved protein motifs search against databases were employed to analyze and predict the function of each sars-cov protein furthermore the evolution distance between sars-cov proteins and their corresponding homology proteins of other coronaviruses were calculated and analyzed the sars-cov associated protein sequences were searched in swiss-prot database httpwwwebiacuk swissprot with the keyword sars the protein sequences deposited in swiss-prot refer to almost all the corresponding nucleotide sequences in genbank so the protein sequences obtained from swiss-prot is more typical than those from genbank ll  there are 10 sars-cov associated protein sequences in swiss-prot up to  may 28 2003 including structural proteins s e m and  n and function unknown proteins xl x2 x3 and x4  through comparing each of these proteins with the corresponding orf of the completed sars-cov genome ay274119 in genbank we found that the proteins encoded by orf9-11 and orf14 have not been deposited into swiss-prot all the sars-cov associated proteins including the proteins from swiss-prot and the putative proteins from orf are listed in table 1  the studies on other coronaviruses have revealed that the orflab occupies about two-thirds of virus genome and it can be divided into two orfs orfla and orflb 12  for sars-coy the polyprotein is synthesized by a -1 ribosomal frameshift at the predicted slippery site 13392 -13398 5 i -uuuaaac-3  where the orfla and orflb are overlapped during the translational process of orfla and orflb the translated polyprotein is autocatalytically precessed to initially yield mature viral proteases plppro papain-like proteinase and 3cu ro chymotrypsin-like proteinase then generated rep rnadependent rna polymerase hel atpase-helicase and other protein products whose functions have not been well characterized through analysis of the cleavage sites of orflab we got 14 putative protein products table 2  and because these proteins may exist in the actual life cycle of sars-coy these 14 proteins but not the polyprotein corresponding to orflab are subject to bioinformatical calculation and analysis first the amino acid composition charge distribution and the possible repetitive sequence motif of each sars-cov protein were analyzed by program saps 13 statistical analysis of protein sequence then the isoelectric point pi and extinction coefficient at 280 urn a hypothetical protein 5 bp596xx is swiss-prot id ay274119 is genbank id c extcoef denotes molecular extinction coefficient at 280 nm d pi denotes isoelectric point e the putative function of proteins in this study for details see the text f protein functions are not available of each protein were calculated by pi and extcoef 14 program respectively tmap15 and tmhmm 20 16 were employed to predict the transmembrane segments or transmembrane helical regions of the proteins from which the subcellular localizations of these proteins were predicted the hmmpfam 17 and blimps 18 were used to compare each of sars-cov protein sequence against the hmm and blocks databases to search for possible matching conserved protein motifs finally the psib-last program 19 at bioinformatics platform of workbench 14 was used to search for homology protein sequences of each sars-cov protein through comparing against databases at non-redundant protein database sdsc the matrix is blosum80 and the maximum number of rounds is 6 the clustalw program 20 was used to performs multiple sequence alignments of the homology sequences then the unrooted phylogenetic trees were drawn by drawtree and drawgram program 21  and the evolutionary distance matrixes based on the above protein alignments were computed by prot-dist program 2  like the proteins of other coronaviruses the sars-cov associated proteins are divided into structural protein and non-structural protein the former includes proteins s e m and n that are responsible for making up of protein envelope of the virus the latter includes 3cu ro  rep hel etc that are responsible for the proteolytic processing of polyproteins 3cu ro  and replication and translation of viral rna rep and hel however there are many putative proteins derivated from orfs of sars-cov genome for example proteins xl x2 x3 x4 and x5 and the functions of these proteins are unknown all the sars-cov associated proteins were subject to analysis and calculation by bioinformatics tools the sequence length molecular weight isoelectric point and extinction coefficient of each protein are listed in tables 1 and 2  i analysis of the protein products encoded by orflab the polyprotein encoded by orflab generates about 14 protein products  table 2  through cotranslational proteolytic processing among them the leader protein is an acidic protein with molecular weight of 196 kd the positive-charged amino acids kr content is 101 and the negative-charged amino acids ed content 145 both tmap and tmhmm predict that there is no

indicate that the sequence identities between sars-cov hel and the corresponding helicases of other coronaviruses are about 60 the best-conserved motif is a glycine-rich region located at 282-288 which typically forms a flexible loop between a-strand and an a-helix this loop interacts with one of the phosphate groups of the nucleotide this sequence motif is generally referred to as the ploop

seven-transmembrane a-helices with the n-terminus residues 1-11 oriented inside virus particle and the c-terminus residues 236-290 located outside the virus particle in which the segment 209-219 cimlvycflgyccccyfglfc is a sequence containing abundant cys psiblast analysis reveals that hd2insp3 of sars-cov shares about 30 sequence identities with the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses hmmpfam search reveals that the segment 43 -140 of hd2insp3 matches to the conserved protein motif pf00420 nadh-ubiquinoneplastoquinone oxidore in hmm database blimps search reveals that

database for nsp12 no matching conserved sequence motif is found in hmm and blocks databases the sequence identities of nsp11 nsp12 and nsp13 between various coronaviruses are about 50 40 and 60 the results above indicate that the protein products encoded by sars-cov orflab are very conservative among various coronaviruses the matching conserved sequence families searched by blimps hmmpfam and psiblast are mainly from protease which implies that these proteins encoded by orflab play various catalytic function roles during the virus life cycle  ii analysis of structural proteins of sars-cov the s protein of coronaviruses is a large membrane glycoprotein the mature s protein is inserted in the viral envelope with the majority of the protein exposed on the surface of viral particles and forms the primary viral sur-  face projection it is believed that the s trimer makes this virus family look like a corona structure under an electron microscope the s proteins of majority of coronaviruses are cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits after synthesis the s1 subunit is responsible for recognizing and binding of cellular receptors while the integral membrane s2 subunit is required to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membrane for these reasons the virulence and host cellular specificity of coronavirus are defined by s protein 8  the s protein of sars-cov comprises 1255 amino acids and it is a strong acidic protein with molecular weight of 1391 kd pi 54 and there is a repetitive segment fnglt at positions 529-533 and 837-841 tmhmm analysis of s protein predicts a transmembrane helical region near the c-terminus at residues 1196-1218 with the n-terminus segment 1-1195 oriented on the surface of viral particle and c-terminus hydrophilic region 1219-1255 oriented inside the viral particle in which the segment 1217-1236 ccmtsccsclkgacscgscc is rich in cys hmmpfam search reveals that the region 75 -609 of sars-cov s protein matches to the conserved coronavirus sl domain pf01600 in hmm database and the region 641-1247 matches to conserved coronavirus s2 domain pf016001 in hmm database the feature of the cleavage site of coronavirus s protein usually is a basic amino acid sequence rrxrr or rxrr however the s protein of sars-cov lacks such basic cleavage site implying that it is probably not cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits and just forms sl and s2 domains through searching for the homology sequences of coronavirus s proteins with psiblast and aligning them with clustalw we found that the s2 domain of sars-cov is more conservative than the sl domain because the former shares 18-21 sequence identities with the sl subunits of other coronaviruses and the latter shares 34 -35 sequence identities with s2 subunits of other coronaviruses this result can interpret well the functions of s protein s1 domains are responsible for identification and binding of special receptors various coronaviruses use different receptors and infect different host cells which can explain the non-conserved property of sl domains while s2 domains are responsible for mediating fusion of viral and cellular membrane such unique function explains the conserved property of s2 domains the current mechanism of protein-mediated membrane fusion proposes the collapse model first the interaction of sl subunit with the special cellular membrane receptor induces conformational change of s1 which in succession induces the structural changes of s2--some of the amphipathic a-helices in the carboxyl half of s2 collapse into coiled-coils thus bringing a fusion peptide toward the transmembrane domain resulting in cellular and viral membrane fusion 8  we predicted the secondary structure of sars-cov s protein using eight different secondary structure prediction methods provided by the bioinfomatics platform of workbench the prediction results reveal nine successive a-helices at residue positions 750-10 10 fig 1  furthermore the relative hydrophobic and hydrophilic character of amino acids in s protein is calculated by grease program23 j  the hydropathicity profile in 885-950 and 973-990 regions shows a distinct property that hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids present alternately suggesting that such regions may be the amphipathic a-helices whose conformation could collapse into coiled-coils it has recently been shown that for rcov-229e virons residues 417-546 are required for sa binding to the cellular receptor aminopeptidase n 24  through sequence alignment between s proteins of sars-cov and hcov-229e we found that the residues 492-----651 of sars-cov s protein correspond to residues 417-547 of hcov-229e s protein however further experiments are required for identifying if residues 492-651 of sars-cov s protein are necessary for receptor binding e protein of sars-cov is a small acidic protein comprising 76 amino acids with molecular weight of 83 kd both tmap and tmhmm predict a hydrophobic transmembrane helix at residues 12-34 with residues 1-11 oriented inside viral particle and hydrophilic segment 35-76 on the surface of viral particle hmmpfam search reveals that the complete sequence of e protein matches to the conserved sequence motif pf02723 ns3small envelope protein e in hmm database blimps search also reveals that the segment 36-----67 ofe protein matches to ipb003873 conserved coronavirus small envelope protein e in blocks however psib-last search reveals that there are only two coronaviruses whose e proteins are similar to that of sars-cov in sequence the murine hepatitis virus mhv and rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus rscov the sequence identities between e protein of sars-cov and those of the two coronaviruses are 23 and 24 respectively suggesting that e protein is not conservative in evolution furthermore studies have revealed that the e protein in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus is essential for virus replication 25  while in mhv it has been shown that although deletion of gene e reduces virus replication by more than ten thousand fold the virus still can replicate 26  further studies are required for ascertaining if e protein of sars-cov plays a functional role in virus replication in addition to attaching itself to the virus envelope m protein is a basic protein comprising 221 amino acids with molecular weight of 251 kd the residues 44 -97 near the n-terminus make up of a strongly hydrophobic region and a repetitive segment lvig presents at positions 21-24 and 137-140 psiblast and alignment results reveal a strongly conserved sequence wsfnpe of sars-cov m protein at positions 109-114 while the sequence identities between m proteins of various coronaviruses are about 30 tmhmm predicts three transmembrane a-helical segments located at residues 15-37 50-72 and 77-99 with n-terminus residues 1 -14 on the surface of virus particle and c-terminus hydrophilic domain 100-221 on the inside of the virus particle the segment inside the virus particle is rich in positive charged amino acids and is believed to interact with the nucleocapsid or virus rna hmmpfam and blimps searches reveal that the complete sequence of e protein of sars-cov matches to conserved protein protein n is a strongly basic protein comprising 422 amino acids with molecular weight of 460 kd a repetitive segment srgns is found at positions 191-195 and 203-207 both tmap and tmhmm predict no transmembrane region psiblast and alignment analysis reveal a strongly conserved segment prwyfyylgtgp located at position 107-118 and the function of this segment is unknown furthermore there is a segment kkkktdea-qplpqrqkkq at position 373-390 in sars-cov n protein that is rich in lys which matches to the bipartite nuclear targeting signal qdoc50079 in pfam database and is responsible for nuclear location and interaction a hydrophilic segment srggsqassrsssrsrgnsrns-tpgssrgns that is rich in ser is located at position 177 -207 it is not clear if such segment interacts with nuclear blimps search indicates that the complete sequence of sars-cov n protein matches to ipbool218 coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in addition some partial sequences of n protein match to ipb002565 orbivirus ns3 ipb000096 serum amyloid a protein ipbooi677 transferrin binding protein and ipb000689 ubih coq6 monooxygenase family in blocks database the sequence identities between the n proteins of sars-cov and other coronaviruses are about 30  iii analysis of function unknown proteins of sars-cov the putative protein xl from sars-cov genome is an acidic protein comprising 274 amino acids with molecular weight of 309 kd the analysis of xl sequence reveals a strongly hydrophobic region ficnll-llfvtiyshlllvaagmeaqflylyaliyfl located at 79-115 both tmap and tmhmm predict three transmembrane helical regions located at residues 34-56 77 -99 and 103-125 with n-terminus residues 1-33 on the surface of virus particle and c-terminus residues 126 -274 on the inside of the virus particle psiblast search yields no corresponding homology sequence of other coronaviruses and hmmpfam analysis fails to identify any matching conserved sequence family

conserved protein motif pr00699 c elegans integral membrane protein srb signature implying that xl of sars-cov may be a structural protein inserted in the viral envelope x2 is a strong basic protein

localization signal ps50079inlsbp in pfam database both tmap and tmhmm predict no transmembrane region the results above suggest that x2 may function like n protein for details see discussion for n protein which is oriented inside virus particle interacts with virus rna and should be essential for virus assembly x3 is a small acidic protein comprising 63 amino acids with molecular weight of 75 kd psiblast search fails to identify any matching homology sequence and both hmmpfam and blimps searches yield no matching conserved sequence family although tmhmm fails to predict transmembrane a-helix tmap analysis predicts a transmembrane segment located at position 9-37 with n-terminal residues 1-8 on the outside of virus particle we cannot predict the function of x3 of sars-cov based on the analytical results above x4 is a basic protein comprising 122 amino acids with molecular weight of 139 kd and there is a strongly hydrophobic segment lflivaalvflilcf located at residues 101-115 in x4 both tmap and tmhmm predict a transmembrane a-helical region at position 95-117 with n-terminal residues 1-94 on the outside of virus particle and c-terminal residues 118-122 on the inside of virus particle we also note three uninterrupted basic amino acids krk at c-terminal tail 118-l20 that may interact with virus rna blimps search reveals the segment 101-119 of x4 matches to tetracycline resistance protein tete signature pr01036 in blocks database while psi-blast search fails to yield any homology sequence matching to x4 these analyses suggest that x4 may be a structural protein that is inserted in virus envelope and plays a function role in virus assembly x5 is a basic protein comprising 84 amino acids with molecular weight 95 kd psiblast search fails to identify any corresponding homology sequence of other coronaviruses matching to x5 tmap and tmhmm predict no transmembrane segment blimps search reveals that the segment 52-68 1284 of x5 matches to conserved sequence family ipbooooo 1 kringle in blocks database these analyses suggest that x5 may be oriented inside virus particle the strongly positive-charged regions located at n-and c-terminuses may interact with virus rna and facilitate virus assembly hp5 hypothetical protein 5 is a strongly acidic protein comprising 98 amino acids with molecular weight of 108 kd both tmap and tmhmm predict no transmembrane segment hmmpfam and blimps searches yield no matching conserved protein motif psiblast search fails to identify any matching homology sequence we cannot predict the function of hp5 from these analyses above orf9 encodes a predicted small acidic protein comprising 44 amino acids with molecular weight of 53 kd and the negative-charged amino acids are all located at nand c-terminuses of this protein psiblast yields no matching homology protein both tmap and tmhmm predict a transmembrane a-helical region at residues 9-31 with n-terminal residues 1-8 on the inside of virus and c-terminal residues 32-44 on the surface of virus particle blimps search reveals that the sequence 11-32 of orf9 matches to conserved sequence family pr00697 c elegans sra family integral membrane protein signature in blocks database segment 8-32 matches to ipb001898 sodiumsulfate symporter family and some other partial sequences match to ipb003804 l-iactate permease pr01434 nadh-ubiquinone

and pr00701 60 kd inner membrane protein signature respectively we speculate from these results that the protein encoded by orf9 may be a structural protein oriented in virus envelope whose function role is involved in ion transferring the protein encoded by orflo is a small basic protein comprising 39 amino acids with molecular weight of 43 kd psiblast search fails to get any homology sequence matching to this protein although tmhmm predicts no transmembrane helical region tmap predicts a transmembrane segment located at residues 3 -31 blimps search reveals that the segment 4-29 matches to ipboololo thionin in blocks database and segments 2-25 and 6-15 match to pr01520 zeta-tubulin signature and ipb003606 n-terminal to some set domains respectively the protein encoded by orf14 is an acidic protein comprising 70 amino acids with molecular weight of 78 kd psiblast search fails to identify any matching homology sequence tmhmm predicts no transmembrane helical region while tmap predicts a transmembrane segment at position 34 -61 both hmmpfam and blimps searches yield no any matching conserved protein motif we cannot predict the func-tions ofofrlo and orf14 from the results above iv phylogenetic analysis of the proteins of sars-cov we searched the non-redundant protein database sdsc for the homology sequences of each protein of sars-cov using psiblast program then the homology sequences of these proteins were subject to evolutionary distance matrix calculations table 3  and the unrooted phylogenetic trees were drawn data not shown to ascertain the classification status and evolutional relationship between sars-cov and other coronavimses the topologies of the resulting phylograms are remarkably similar the species formed monophyletic clusters consistent with the established three taxonomic groups for each protein of sars-cov that possesses of the homology sequences the sars-cov sequence segregated into a fourth well-resolved branch which indicates that sars-cov is not related to any of the three previously characterized groups of coronavimses and forms a distinct group within the genus coronavirus this result is consistent with that of refs 5 6  the evolutionary distance matrix analyses reveal that most of sars-cov proteins except plp and n are approximately equidistant from the corresponding proteins of previously characterized coronavimses for example the evolutional distance of sars-3cu ro against the corresponding proteins of other coronavimses ranges from 261 to 352 the average value is 309 and the standard deviation is 036 rep ranges from 140 to 184 the average value is 166 and the standard deviation is 021 hel ranges from 126 to 178 the average value is 152 and the standard deviation is 022 etc see table 3  these results support the conclusion that sars-cov does not belong to any of the three previously characterized groups and should be within the fourth group reported by refs 5 6  however the evolutional distance analytical results indicate that the hel and rep related more closely to the corresponding proteins of other coronavimses the average distances between them are less than 17  table 3  the proteins hel and rep are responsible for vims rna replication and transcription and undergo a huge evolutional pressure because of their conserved functions so the sequences and structures of them are more conservative than those of other sars-cov proteins furthermore it is interesting that most of proteins of bocov and mhv are more close to the corresponding proteins of sars-cov in evolutional distance for example there are seven proteins plp nsp4 rep hel nspll nsp12 and s in bo-cov possessing of the closest evolutional distances against the corresponding proteins of sars-cov and six proteins 3cu ro  hd2 gflp rep m and n in mhv possessing of the closest evolutional distances against the corresponding proteins of sars-cov however there is no evidence to prove that the proteins of sars-cov come from the recombination of bocov and mhv or other coronavimses the phylogenetic and evolutional distance analyses  of sars-cov associated proteins indicate that it is a previously unknown coronavirus and neither come from the recombination of the previously characterized coronaviruses nor arise as a mutant of known human or animal coronaviruses we conjecture that there are two possible sources for sars-cov one possibility is that it arises as a mutant of an unknown animal coronavirus or as a recombinant of two unknown coronaviruses and acquired new virulence factors and the ability to infect humans the other one is that it arises as a mutant of unknown human coronavirus that acquired new virulence factors however antibodies to the sars-cov werefound in serum samples obtained from patients with sars during convalescence but not in human serum samples from people without sars3 j  which indicates no existence of such mild unknown human coronavirus the large-scale serologic tests of wild and domestic animals and birds in the region where the sars outbreak first appeared may identify the usual host or sources of sars-cov when this manuscript will be completed a research team from the university of hong kong stated that a coronavirus resembling the sars virus had been isolated from six masked palm civets paguma larvata in a wild-animal market in shenzhen china and five out of the ten civet handlers at the market had antibodies against the sars virus in their blood27 j  however how does the coronavirus in palm civet acquire the ability to infect human mutant or recombinant does the sars-cov arisen from palm civets coronavirus still possess the ability to infect palm civets does it cause the lower respiratory tract infection is there any other animal hosts for sars-cov the resolvents of these questions are essential for annihilation of sars completely the predictions of the molecular weight pi and extinction coefficient for all the proteins of sars-cov are helpful for their separation extraction and purification and the transmembrane region predictions the conserved sequence family searches and homology sequence alignments provide significant information for predicting protein function the analytical results indicate that the protein products encoded by orflab mainly playa function role in polyprotein cleavage virus rna replication and rna transcription xl protein is possessed of transmembrane segments and an integral membrane protein srb signature sequence suggesting that xl may be a structural protein that is oriented in the virus envelope x2 protein is a strongly basic protein it possesses no transmembrane segment and has a bipartite nuclear localization signal suggesting that it may interact with and bind to virus rna and facilitate virus assembly the secondary structure features and hydrophobic and hydrophilic character of s 1286 protein support well the collapse model of coronavirus membrane fusion mechanism the bioinformatical analysis of s protein provides useful information in search of antigenic determinant aimed at s protein this study establishes the foundations for construction of the structures of sars-cov associated proteins with molecular modeling and for determination of sars-cov proteomics with experiments and in the long run it provides significant information for design of anti-sars drugs and for development of antiviral vaccine  guillain-barr syndrome the first documented covid-19triggered autoimmune neurologic disease marinos dalakas c   these early gbs cases despite incomplete immunologic workup considering the enormous difficulties in highly stressed in-hospital settings provide early clues on what to expect in the months ahead regarding the common acute autoimmune neurologic conditions such as gbs polyneuritis cranialis encephalitis encephalomyelitis or myositis which for years we have been casually referring to as postviral if seen after febrile illnesses first and foremost the practicing neurologists in this pandemic should now be aware that a patient who presents with an acute paralytic diseaselike gbs encephalomyelitis or myositiseven without fever dyspnea or any systemic symptoms may represent the first manifestation of covid-19 this is compelling considering that only 43 of covid-19positive patients on admission have fever46 and many of the present patients with gbs did not have any covid-19 symptoms at presentation these early gbs cases also highlight that 2 clinical and laboratory signs anosmiaageusia and lymphocytopeniathrombocytopenia are red flags in suspecting covid-19 in otherwise asymptomatic patients with acute neurologic events they further confirm what we had feared from other viral pandemics that covid-19 can trigger neurologic autoimmunity in contrast to the other postviral neurologic diseases however covid-19 requires high degree of suspicion as a potential hidden trigger to prevent inadvertent viral transmission to health care personnel and patient relatives as in the wuhan case7 the series also highlights that gbs peaks 510 days after the first covid-19 symptoms which in intensive care unit icu settings helps to distinguish gbs from critical illness neuropathy that usually appears later in the course of very sick icu patients the early manifestation of anosmia and ageusia not only in the present gbs series that often occurred in conjunction with other cranial neuropathies but also in large worldwide cohorts reporting sudden loss of smell and taste early in the infection in up to 60 of covid-19 carriers5612 is highly informative about covid-19 neurovirulence or even possible viral entry into the brain in contrast to commonly reversible anosmia when the non-neural olfactory epithelial cells are virally infected the often persistent anosmiaageusia after covid-19 suggests neurotropism targeting olfactory neurons sars-cov and mers-cov the 2 coronaviruses similar to covid-19 are neurovirulent and can enter the brain via olfactory nerves13 in mice after oronasal infection with sars-cov the virus not only infects epithelial cells of the respiratory tract but also the olfactory receptor neurons in the neuroepithelium gaining access to the olfactory bulb and brainstem13 these viruses can also enter the cns via retrograde axonal transport through other cranial nerves such as trigeminal which possesses nociceptive neuronal receptors in the nasal cavity the sensory fibers of the glossopharyngeal and via peripheral nerves13 the present gbs series where oculomotor trigeminal and mri-enhanced facial and nerves roots were concurrently affected strengthens but not prove this notion accordingly it will not be unexpected in the weeks and months ahead to see other covid-19infected patients with neurologic signs related to multiple cranial nerves brainstem and peripheral nerves with mri enhancement in nerves and meninges in 711 tested patients with covid-19gbs the virus was not detected in the csf implying no direct root infection or intrathecal viral replication the improvement of several patients with ivig and the presence of gd1b antibodies in 1 tested patient suggest a postviral-triggered immune response similar to other postviral-induced gbs cases13 or other postviral autoimmune neurologic disorders14 the reported gd1b ganglioside antibodies however although in contrast to gq1b antibodies typically seen in mfs are of very special interest the sars-cov 3a protein contains oligosaccharides with direct evidence that sialic acids play a critical role in human coronavirus infection15 it has been just shown that the attachment of coronaviruses to the surface of respiratory cells is mediated by the spike s viral protein which binds not only to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 receptor for entry16 but also to sialic acidcontaining glycoproteins and gangliosides on cell surfaces15 such a dual receptorattachment is proposed to be a reason for the increased transmissibility of covid-19 compared with sars-cov that binds only to ace-2 receptor1516 of relevance to gbs is that various gangliosides most commonly those containing either a disialosyl moiety such as gd1b gq1b and gt1b or 2 gangliosides that share epitopes with gm2 or a combination of gm2 and gm1 gm1 and gd1b can serve as antigens in patients with neuropathies17 when igm recognizes the gal pl-3 galnac moiety of gm1 which is found on the surface of motor neurons there is clinically a motor neuropathy but if recognizes epitopes containing disialosyl groups of gdlb which is present on the dorsal root ganglionic neurons there is sensory ataxic neuropathy17 immunization of rabbits with gdlb also causes sensory ataxic neuropathy mimicking the human disease18 of interest the first described patient with sensory ataxic neuropathy and gdlb antibodies had also ophthalmoplegia19 as seen in mfs and the present series10 as covid-19 spike interacts with the galnac residue of gm1 and ganglioside dimers for anchoring to cell surface gangliosides15 cross-reactivity between epitopes within the covid-19 spike-bearing gangliosides and signature sugar residues of surface peripheral nerve glycolipids is a very likely possibility such typical molecular mimicry has been shown between peripheral nerve glycolipids and campylobacter jejuni or zika virus that also trigger gbs13 accordingly all gbs subtypes aidp aman and mfs can be expected with covid-19 necessitating screening for ganglioside antibodies to assess autoimmunity an interesting therapeutic component in this association is the emerging data that chloroquine an antimalarial drug under investigation for treating covid-19 binds with high-affinity sialic acids and gm1 gangliosides and in the presence of chloroquine the sars-cov viral spike cannot bind gangliosides to infect the targeted cells15 if benefit is confirmed and safety is established chloroquine may be of added therapeutic value in future patients with covid-19triggered gbs in conjunction with ivig among the other potential covid-19associated autoimmune diseases the first alarming concern is inflammatory myopathy especially necrotizing autoimmune myositis nam because very high ck levels 10000 with myalgia and weakness are now reported in more than 10 of covid-19infected patients6 although covid-19associated myopathy has not yet been studied but only characterized as skeletal muscle injury or rhabdomyolysis6 2 just published cases suggest an autoimmune covid-19triggered nam one an 88-year-old man from new york presented with acute bilateral thigh weakness and inability to get up from the toilet without fever or other systemic symptoms and very high ck level 13581 ul20 he was found covid-19 positive and given hydroxychloroquine and a week later his painful weakness improved with ck reduction the other a 60-year-old man from wuhan had a 6-day history of fever cough and covid-19positive pneumonia with normal strength and ck 7 days later although systemically had improved his crp doubled and developed painful muscle weakness with very high ck 11842 ul21 he was given ivig and his strength improved while became covid-19 negative myopathic symptoms in a severe systemic viral disease are multifactorial but an acute onset of severe muscle weakness with increased inflammatory markers and very high ck levels in the thousands as described above is consistent with autoimmune inflammatory myopathy within the spectrum of nam similar to what was first reported with hiv early in that epidemic2223 the most common causes of nam are not chronic statin use as overstated but autoimmune paraneoplastic or postviral2225 considering that very high ck level and painful muscle weakness were seen in 10 of covid-19positive patients6 a potentially treatable autoimmune myopathy has been likely overlooked studies with muscle biopsy and antibody screening are urgently needed in such patients because therapy with ivig can improve strength reduce morbidity and facilitate recovery as reported in the first 2 cases2021 covid-19associated myositis is also highly interesting because ace-2 the sars-cov receptor is reportedly expressed in skeletal muscle26 if this is confirmed covid-19 may represent the first virus directly capable of infecting muscle fibers none of the viruses implicated in viral-triggered myositis has so far been shown to infect muscle2728 instead viruses induce an immune t cell with clonal expansion of viral-specific t cells or macrophage-mediated muscle fiber autoinvasion with abundant proinflammatory cytokines222930 acute disseminated encephalomyelitis as described for the other coronaviruses or postinfectious brainstem encephalitis myelitis and radiculoneuropathies will not be unexpected an atypical case of acute necrotizing encephalopathy attributed to immune-mediated process and proinflammatory cytokines and another with meningoencephalitis and leptomeningeal enhancement have been already noted31 this picture is now becoming more clear with 2 reports in this issue of the journal documented by impressive mris one a case of acute necrotizing brainstem encephalopathy presented with epilepsy and changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus32 and another with altered mental status and multiple white matter tumefactive lesions with postgadolinium enhancement in periventricular areas and corpus callosum suggestive of demyelination33 not underestimating the overwhelming burden of acute covid-19 to medical staff vigilance for these disorders is needed along with screening for autoimmune encephalitis autoantibodies14 because these cases can potentially respond to early initiation of immunotherapy especially with ivig whenever indicated which may additionally offer various potentially protective antibodies and anticytokine effects no neurologic data are yet available about the discharged patients who survived the catastrophic effects of the virus we know that several people have permanently lost smell and taste which is a form of disability affecting quality of life depriving tasting pleasures and the ability to detect danger signals like smelling gas or fire many discharged patients require assistance because of muscle weakness and gait unsteadiness which is arguably multifactorial some patients may have had critical illness neuropathy and deconditioning with significant muscle atrophy worsened by comorbidities others may have neurotoxicity or myocytotoxicity from antiviral therapies like first described with antiretrovirals or chloroquine3436 still others may have the residual effects from an unrecognized primary myopathy neuropathy or myelopathy due to postviral autoimmunity a study exploring the patients current causes of residual muscle weakness and sensory deficits is urgently needed using emg muscle or nerve biopsies autoantibody screening and csf or imaging studies to determine immediate or long-term recovery prospects identify potential reversibility and accelerate return to normalcy patients with autoimmune neuropathies especially chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and multifocal motor neuropathy but also with other autoimmunities like myasthenia gravis ms and inflammatory myopathies have been justifiably concerned as to whether their disease status adds an additional risk placing them into an immunosuppressed or immunocompromised category there is no current evidence that any of the aforementioned autoimmune disorder itself makes them more susceptible to covid-19 but some immunosuppressive or even immunomodulating therapies they are receiving may have this potential although there are no validated data most autoimmune neuromuscular patients are maintained on steroids mycophenolate or azathioprine while most chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy receive monthly ivig the same applies to patients with ms where it seems safe to start or continue treatment with the standard disease-modifying drugs if clinically stable and not lymphopenic there are no compelling or data-driven reasons to change anything in these patients and disturb clinical stability for patients on monthly ivig there may be even a theoretical advantage that ivig offers additional protection due to natural autoantibodies if ivig is not infused as home infusion switching to self-administered subcutaneous igg might be an option to diminish exposure as has been proven effective37 for patients on rituximab the infusion intervals can be prolonged to more than 6 months because both b-cell reduction and clinical benefit can persist longer38 new emerging data provide credence and reassurance regarding these issues especially on immunomodulating drugs in a large number of patients from wuhan published in this issue of the journal39 it was shown that altered immunity induced by disease-modifying drugs in patients with ms or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder appears insufficient to enhance susceptibility to covid-19 infection the results are important but not unexpected considering that most of these therapies target the adaptive immune response with little if any effect on suppressing the innate immunity that facilitates infection of macrophages and viral spread similar data from new york city area show that the incidence of hospitalization among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases on therapy with steroids and biologic agents was consistent with that among patients with covid-19 in the general population concluding that ongoing use of biologics is not associated with worse covid-19 outcomes40 there is also new evidence suggesting possible beneficial effect of anticomplement therapies41 complement is an integral component of the innate immune response to viruses and an instigator of proinflammatory responses with evidence that activation of c3 exacerbates sars-covassociated acute respiratory distress syndrome and c3-c5 complement deposits are abundant in the lung biopsies from patients with covid-1941 it was proposed that complement inhibition may alleviate the inflammatory complications of covid-19 infection leading to ongoing trials with anti-c3 and anti-c5 agents4142 on this basis eculizumab an anti-c5 monoclonal antibody approved for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myasthenia gravis with some benefits in patients with gbs may not be withheld if indicated as like ivig may theoretically have added benefit  edible vaccines indu ravi mamta baunthiyal jyoti saxena jyoti saxena shweta rawat   vaccine is a biological preparation intended to produce immunity to a disease by stimulating the production of antibodies dead or attenuated organisms or purified products derived from them are generally used to produce various vaccines over the past decade scientific advances in genetics molecular biology and plant biotechnology have improved the understanding of many infectious diseases and led to the development of vaccination programs the most common method of administering vaccines is by injection but some are given by mouth or nasal spray though immunization is the safest method to combat the diseases worldwide but there are many constraints regarding its mode of production distribution delivery cost and lack of enough research hence it is desirable to look for an effectual and powerful yet cost effective easy for storage and distribution yet safe method of immunization it should also be readily acceptable to all sociocultural groups around the globe research underway is dedicated to solving these problems by finding ways to produce edible vaccines in the form of transgenic plants which have been investigated as an alternative means to produce and deliver vaccine edible vaccines are called by several alternative names such as food vaccines oral vaccines subunit vaccines and green vaccines they seem to be a viable alternative especially for the poor and developing countries they have come up as great boon in medicinal science for which biotechnologists should be given all credit the concept of edible vaccines lies in converting the edible food into potential vaccines to prevent infectious diseases it involves introduction of selected desired genes into plants and then inducing these altered plants to manufacture the encoded proteins it has also found application in prevention of autoimmune diseases birth control cancer therapy etc edible vaccines are currently being developed for a number of human and animal diseases this new technology hopefully will contribute positively toward the global vaccine programs and have a dramatic impact on health care in developing countries many people in developing countries do not have access to the vaccines they need as the traditional vaccines are costly and require skilled medical people for administration and are less effective in inducing mucosal immune response it was these needs which inspired hiatt et al 1989 who attempted to produce antibodies in plants which could serve the purpose of passive immunization the first report of edible vaccine a surface protein from streptococcus in tobacco at 002  of total leaf protein level appeared in 1990 in the form of a patent application published under the international patent cooperation treaty by conceiving the idea of edible vaccine dr charles arntzen tried to realize it arntzen 1997 in 1992 arntzen and coworkers introduced the concept of transgenic plants as a production and delivery system for subunit vaccines in which edible tissues of transgenic crop plants were used mor et al 1998 they found that this concept could overcome the limitations of traditional vaccines thereby triggering the research on edible vaccine in 1990s streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen a was expressed for the first time in tobacco the same group also pioneered the field with work on hepatitis b and heat-labile toxin b subunit in tobacco plants and potato tubers in the same year the successful expression of hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag in tobacco plants was also achieved mason et al 1992 to prove that plant-derived hbsag could stimulate mucosal immune responses via oral route potato tubers were used as an expression system and were optimized to increase the accumulation of the protein in plant tubers richter et al 2000 parallel to the evaluation of plant-derived hbsag mason and arntzen explored plant expression of other vaccine candidates including the labile toxin b subunit lt-b of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec and the capsid protein of norwalk virus the plant-derived proteins correctly assembled into functional oligomers that could elicit the expected immune responses when given orally to animals mason et al 1998 in 1998 a new era was opened in vaccine delivery when researchers supported by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid have shown for the first time that an edible vaccine can safely generate significant immune responses in people the report by collaborators from the university of maryland in baltimore the boyce thompson institute for plant research in ithaca ny and tulane university in new orleans appeared in the may issue of nature medicine according to the then director of niaid edible vaccines offer exciting possibilities for significantly reducing the burden of diseases like hepatitis and diarrhea particularly in the developing world where storing and administering vaccines are often major problems mor et al 1999 also discussed the rapid increase of research in the edible-vaccine field and pointed out that plants could be used to create multicomponent vaccines that can protect against several pathogens at once this is an aspect of the edible-vaccine approach that further strengthens its impact later in 2003 sala and research group reported that proteins produced in these plants induced the mucosal immune response which was the main aim behind this concept research into edible vaccine is still at a very early stage and scientists have a long way to go before it will become a major part of immunization program world wide 
the concept of edible vaccine got impetus after arntzen and coworkers expressed hbsag in tobacco the first edible vaccine was produced in tobacco in 1990 in which 002  recombinant protein a surface protein from streptococcus of the total soluble leaf proteins was found it appeared in the form of a patent application published under the international patent cooperation treaty transgenic tobacco is successfully engineered for the production of edible vaccines against hepatitis b antigen using s gene of hepatitis b virus hbv the optimum level of recombinant protein was obtained in leaves and seeds since acute watery diarrhea is caused by enterotoxigenic e coli and vibrio cholerae that colonize the small intestine and produce one or more enterotoxin an attempt was made toward the production of edible vaccine by expressing heat-labile enterotoxin lt-b in tobacco besides antibodies against dental caries expressed in tobacco are already in preclinical human trials italian researchers have now developed an immunologically active cost-efficient vaccine against human papilloma viruses hpv hpv are the causative agents for cervical cancer and are also involved in skin head and neck tumors cervical cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths 
genetically modified potatoes are also a viable option and seem to be the desired vector many of the first edible vaccines were synthesized in potato plants the transgenic potatoes were developed and grown by arntzen and mason and their research group at the boyce thompson institute for plant research cornell university previously niaid supported in vitro and preclinical studies by john clements and colleagues at tulane university school of medicine in which 14 volunteers ate bite-sized pieces of raw potato that had been genetically engineered to produce part of the toxin secreted by e coli causing diarrhea the investigators periodically collected blood and stool samples from the volunteers to evaluate the vaccines ability to stimulate both systemic and intestinal immune responses ten of the 11 volunteers 91  who ingested the transgenic potatoes had fourfold rise in serum antibodies at some point after immunization and 6 of the 11 55  also showed fourfold mount in intestinal antibodies the potatoes were well tolerated and no one experienced serious adverse side effects vaccine development has successfully tested a potato-based vaccine to combat the norwalk virus which is spread by contaminated food and water the virus causes severe abdominal pain and diarrhea a research team led by william langridge of the loma linda university in california has reported that transgenic potatoes engineered with a cholera antigen ctb can effectively immunize mice mice fed transgenic potatoes produce cholera-specific antibodies in their serum and intestine iga and igg antibodies reach their highest levels after the fourth feeding in yet another experiment genetically engineered potatoes containing a hepatitis b vaccine have successfully boosted immunity in their first human trials attempts have also been made to boil the potatoes as raw potatoes are not very appetizing but unfortunately the cooking process breaks down about 50  of the proteins in the vaccine while some proteins are more tolerant to heat for most proteins it will be necessary to amplify the amount of protein in the engineered foods if they are to be cooked before consumption 
tomatoes are an excellent candidate because they are easy to manipulate genetically and new crops can be grown quickly moreover they are palatable and can be eaten raw while tomatoes do not grow well in the regions in which the edible vaccines are most needed the engineered tomatoes can be dried or made into a paste to facilitate their delivery the anti-malaria edible vaccines in different transgenic tomato plants expressing antigenic types have been proposed by chowdhury and bagasara in 2007 they hypothesized that immunizing individuals against 23 antigens and against each stage of the life cycle of the multistage parasites would be an efficient inexpensive and safe way of vaccination tomatoes with varying sizes shapes and colors carrying different antigens would make the vaccines easily identifiable by lay individuals tomatoes serve as an ideal candidate for the hiv antigen because they unlike other transgenic plants that carry the protein are edible and immune to any thermal process which help to retain their healing capabilities scientists have claimed that tomatoes could be used as a vaccine against alzheimers disease the work is in progress to genetically modify the fruit to create an edible vaccine that fires up the immune system to tackle the disease by attacking the toxic beta-amyloid protein that destroys vital connections between brain cells causing alzheimers researchers have engineered tomato plants lycopersicon esculentum mill var uc82b to express a gene for the glycoprotein g-protein that coats the outer surface of the rabies virus the recombinant constructs contained the g-protein gene from the era strain of rabies virus including the signal peptide under the control of the 35s promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus camv 
a common fruitthe bananais currently being considered as a potential vehicle for vaccines against serious as well as too common diseases the advantage of bananas is that they can be eaten raw as compared to potatoes or rice that need to be cooked and can also be consumed in a pure form furthermore children tend to like banana and the plants grow well in the tropical areas in which the vaccines are needed the most hence the research is leaning toward the use of banana as the vector since a large number of third-world countries who would benefit the most from edible vaccines have tropical climates on the negative side a new crop of banana plants takes about 12 months to bear fruit after fruiting the plants are cut down and a new crop of vaccine-bearing plants must be planted researchers have also developed bananas that deliver a vaccine for hbv the banana vaccine is expected to cost just 2 cents a dose as compared to the 125 for the currently available injectable vaccine 
maize has also been used as a vector for various edible vaccines egyptian scientists have genetically engineered the maize plants to produce a protein known as hbsag which elicits an immune response against the hepatitis b virus and could be used as a vaccine if human trials are successful more than 2 billion people infected with hepatitis b and about 350 million of these at high risk of serious illness and death from liver damage and liver cancer would be benefited researches are in offing at iowa state university with the aim to allow pigs and humans to get a flu vaccination simply by eating corn or corn products it is quite likely that corn vaccine would work in humans when they eat corn or even corn flakes corn chips tortillas or anything that contains corn genetically modified maize could provide protection to chickens against a highly contagious and fatal viral disease affecting most species of birds mexican researcher octavio guerrero-andrade and his colleagues at the centre for research and advanced studies in guanajuato central mexico genetically modified maize to create an edible vaccine against newcastle disease virus ndv they inserted a gene from the ndv a major killer of poultry in developing countries into the maize dna and found antibodies against the virus in chickens that ate the genetically modified maize one pig vaccine has also been produced in corn successfully efforts are being made by us company prodigene to genetically modify maize to contain a key protein found on the surface of the monkey form of hiv according to us national institute of health this development brings an edible more effective hiv vaccine for people a step closer transgenic maize expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein g of the vnukovo strain has also been produced using ubiquitin maize promoter fused to the whole coding region of the rabies virus g gene and a constitutive promoter from camv maize embryogenic callus were transformed with the above construct by biolistics regenerated maize plants were recovered and grown in a greenhouse the amount of g-protein detected in the grains was approximately 1  of the total soluble plant protein 
rice is another potential crop which has been used for developing vaccines it offers several advantages over traditional vaccines it does not require refrigeration in fact the rice proved just as potent after 18 months of storage at room temperature and the vaccine did not dissolve when exposed to stomach acids in an attempt predominant t cell epitope peptides which were derived from japanese cedar pollen allergens were specifically expressed in rice seeds and delivered to the mucosal immune system mis the development of an allergic immune response of the allergen-specific th2 cell was suppressed furthermore not only the specific ige production and release of histamine from mast cells were suppressed but the inflammatory symptoms of pollinosis such as sneezing were also suppressed these results suggest the feasibility of using an oral immunotherapy agent derived from transgenic plants that accumulate t cell epitope peptides of allergens for allergy treatment the transfer of genetic material from the microbe responsible for producing cholera toxin into a rice plant has been achieved the plants produced the toxin and when the rice grains were fed to mice they provoked immunity from the diarrhea-causing bacterium 
genetically modified spinach has also been considered for the development of edible vaccine spinach is being investigated as a plant-derived edible vehicle for anthrax vaccine as well as a vehicle for the hiv-1 tat protein a prospective vaccine candidate in an experiment a fragment of protective antigen pa that represents most of the receptor-binding domain was expressed as a translational fusion with a capsid protein on the outer surface of tobacco mosaic virus and spinach was inoculated with the recombinant virus the plant-expressed pa is highly immunogenic in laboratory animals among other food crops with potential to be developed as edible vaccine sweet potato peanuts lettuce watermelon and carrots are on the top priority the development of plant-based vaccines to protect against many other diseases such as hiv-1 hepatitis b rabies and non-hodgkins lymphoma are ongoing throughout the globe using one of these edible plants the advantages and disadvantages of various plant host systems are given in table 121
 conventional subunit vaccines are expensive and technology-intensive need purification require refrigeration and produce poor mucosal response in contrast edible vaccines would enhance compliance especially in children and because of oral administration would eliminate the need for trained medical personnel their production is highly efficient and can be easily scaled up for example hepatitis b antigen required to vaccinate whole of china annually could be grown on a 40-acre plot and all babies in the world each year on just 200 acres of land they are cheaper sidestepping demands for purification single dose of hepatitis b vaccine would cost approximately 043 cents grown locally using standard methods and do not require capital-intensive pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities mass-indefinite production would also decrease dependence on foreign supply fear of contamination with animal viruseslike the mad cow disease which is a threat in vaccines manufactured from cultured mammalian cells is eliminated as plant viruses do not infect humans edible vaccines activate both mucosal and systemic immunity as they come in contact with the digestive tract lining which is not possible with subunit vaccines which provide poor mucosal response this dual effect of edible vaccines provides first-line defense against pathogens invading through mucosa such as mycobacterium tuberculosis and agents causing diarrhea pneumonia stds hiv etc the specific advantages are stated belowedible means of administrationno need of medical personnel and syringessterile injection conditions are no more requiredeconomical in mass production by breeding compared to an animal systemeasy for administration and transportationeffective maintenance of vaccine activity by controlling the temperature in plant cultivationtherapeutic proteins are free of pathogens and toxinsstorage near the site of useheat stable thus eliminating the need of refrigerationantigen protection through bioencapsulationsubunit vaccine not attenuated vaccine means improved safetyseroconversion in the presence of maternal antibodiesgeneration of systemic and mucosal immunityenhanced compliance especially in childrendelivery of multiple antigensintegration with other vaccine approachesplant-derived antigens assemble spontaneously into oligomers and into virus like particlesno serious side effect problems have been noticed until nowreduced risk of anaphylactic side effects from edible vaccine over injection system is one benefit reported by the bio-medicineorg they reported that the edible vaccine carries only part of the allergen compared to injection methods which reduce anaphylactic riskadministration of edible vaccines to mothers to immunize the fetus-in utero by trans-placental transfer of maternal antibodies or the infant through breast milk edible vaccines have a potential role in protecting infants against diseases like group-b streptococcus respiratory syncytial virus rsv etc which is under investigationedible vaccines would also be suitable against neglectedless common diseases like dengue hookworm rabies etc they may be integrated with other vaccine approaches and multiple antigens may also be delivered
 with advancement come many hurdles and problems so is true for edible vaccines like one could develop immunotolerance to the vaccine peptide or protein though a little research has been done on it one of the key goals of the edible-vaccine pioneers was to reduce immunization costs but later many limitations were reported as given belowconsistency of dosage from fruit to fruit plant to plant lot to lot and generation to generation is not similarstability of vaccine in fruit is not knownevaluation of dosage requirement is tediousselection of best plant is difficultcertain foods like potatoes are generally not eaten raw and cooking the food might weaken the medicine present in itnot convenient for infants as they might spit it eat a part or eat it all and throw it up later concentrating the vaccine into a teaspoon of baby food may be more practical than administering it in a whole fruitthere is always possibility of sideeffects due to the interaction between the vaccine and the vehiclepeople could ingest too much of the vaccine which could be toxic or too little which could lead to disease outbreaks among populations believed to be immunea concern with oral vaccines is the degradation of protein components in the stomach due to low ph and gastric enzymes however the degradation can be compensated by repeating the exposure of the antigen until immunological tolerance is accomplished mason et al 2002potential risk of spreading the disease by edible vaccine delivery is a concern of many potential contamination of the oral delivery system is a possible danger
 foreign proteins in plants accumulate in low amounts 0012  of total protein and are less immunogenic therefore the oral dose far exceeds the intranasalparenteral dose for example oral hepatitis b dose is 10100 times the parenteral dose and 100 g potato expressing b subunit of labile toxin of etec lt-b is required in three different doses to be immunogenic attempts at boosting the amount of antigens often lead to stunted growth of plants and reduced tuberfruit formation as too much mrna from the transgene causes gene silencing in plant genome techniques to overcome these limitations are given belowoptimization of coding sequence of bacterialviral genes for expression as plant nuclear genesexpression in plasmidsplant viruses expressing foreign genescoat-protein fusionsviral-assisted expression in transgenic plantspromoter elements of bean yellow dwarf virus with reporter genes gus  -glucuronidase and green fluorescent protein gfp substituted later with target antigen genesantigen genes may be linked with regulatory elements which switch on the genes more readily or do so only at selected times after the plant is nearly fully grown or only in its edible regions exposure to some outside activator molecule may also be tried
 development of edible vaccines is a possible high-volume low-cost delivery system for third-world countries to fight against fatal maladies like aids hepatitis and diarrhea researches by the niaid and the university of maryland showed no significant side effects in a small study using genetically engineered potatoes to make toxin of the e coli a diarrhea-causing bacterium volunteers reported no serious adverse reactions to genetically altered potatoes used to deliver edible vaccine toxin according to the national institutes of health nih the nih reported that 1011 volunteers who ate the raw potato bites developed four times the antibodies against e coli without obvious side effects long-term reactions to edible vaccines are yet to be determined and possible delayed reactions have not yet been discovered an organized large scale study is required before edible vaccines are put into large scale production plant transformation mediated by the plant pathogen a tumefaciens has become the most popular method lately it is a naturally occurring gram-negative soil bacterium which infects the wound sites in dicot plants causing the formation of the crown gall tumor this bacterium is capable of transferring a particular dna segment t-dna of the tumor-inducing ti plasmid into the nucleus of infected cells where it is subsequently integrated into the host genome and transcribed the t-dna usually contains cancer-causing oncogenic genes and genes that synthesize opines which are excreted by infected crown gall cells and are a food source for bacterium during the genetic manipulation the ti plasmid is engineered to carry the desired gene for vaccine and the virulent genes that cause tumor growth in plants are deleted the transgene is integrated expressed and inherited in mendelian fashion the whole plant can be then regenerated from individual transformed plant cell it has been studied that genes are successfully expressed in experimental model plants and when given orally to animals the extract of transgenic plant containing the antigen induced serum antibodies thus can be used to produce the edible vaccine the application of agrobacterium mediated transformation is at present possible to most species of agronomic interest including members of family graminae and leguminosae this opens interesting new aspect for the development of edible vaccines for both human and veterinary uses the second approach for nuclear transformation is based on the microprojectile bombardment method also known as the gene gun or biolistic method this method is especially beneficial for those plants which can not be transformed by a tumefaciens mediated gene transfer method selected dna sequences are precipitated onto metal microparticles and bombarded with a particle gun at an accelerated speed in a partial vacuum against the plant tissue placed within the acceleration path microparticles penetrate the walls and release the exogenous dna inside the cell where it will be integrated in the nuclear genome thus this method effectively introduces dna the cells that take up the desired dna are identified through the use of a marker gene in plants the use of gus is most common and then cultured to replicate the gene and possibly cloned this method has various advantages including 1 thousands of particles are accelerated at the same time causing multiple hits resulting in transferring of genes into many cells simultaneously 2 since intact cells can be used the difficulties encountered with the use of protoplast are automatically circumvented and 3 the method is universal in its application so that cell type size and shape or the presenceabsence of cell wall do not significantly alter its effectiveness another important use of the gene gun involves the transformation of organelles such as chloroplasts and yeast mitochondria the biolistic particle delivery system shoots adequately processed dna particles which penetrate into the chloroplast and integrate with its genome the chloroplasts transformation is an interesting alternative to nuclear transformation which has come up in recent past all plant cells have chloroplasts that capture light energy from the sun to produce free energy through a process called photosynthesis in chloroplast genetic engineering the recombinant dna plasmid is bound to small gold nanoparticles that are injected into the chloroplasts of the leaf using a gene gun as described above this device uses high pressure to insert the plasmid coated particles into the cells these plasmids contain multiple genes of importance such as the therapeutic gene a marker gene may or may not be for antibiotic resistance a gene that enhances the translation of therapeutic gene and two targeting sequences that flank the foreign gene the foreign genes are inserted through homologous recombination via flanking sequences at a precise and predetermined location in the organelle genome the gene expression level in plastids is predominately determined by promoter and 5-untranslated regions 5-utr elements gruissem and tonkyn 1993 therefore suitable 5-utrs including a ribosomal binding site rbs are important elements of plastid expression vectors eibl et al 1999 in order to obtain high-level protein accumulation from expression of the transgene the first requirement is a strong promoter to ensure high levels of mrna most laboratories use the strong plastid rrna operon rrn promoter prrn besides gene gun peg mediated transformation and galistan expansion femto syringe microinjection techniques are also used for gene delivery in chloroplast some of the advantages of chloroplast transformation technology are its low cost natural gene containment site specific insertion very high level of stable expression generation of production lines with a competitive timeline elimination of gene silencing and high accumulation of the recombinant protein precise steps are given below

malaria is a disease of humans transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito it remains one of the most significant causes of human morbidity and mortality worldwide according to whos 2010 world malaria report there are more than 225 million cases of malaria killing around 781000 people three antigens are currently being investigated for the development of a plant-based malaria vaccine merozoite surface protein msp 4 msp 5 from plasmodium falciparum and msp 45 from p yoelli wang et al 2004 have demonstrated that oral immunization of mice with recombinant msp 4 msp 45 and msp 1 co-administered with ctb as a mucosal adjuvant induces antibody responses effective against blood stage parasite 
measles is an infection of the respiratory system caused by a virus in an experiment mice fed with tobacco expressing mv-h measles virus haemagglutinin from edmonston strain antibody titers five times the level considered protective for humans could be attained and secretory iga was found in their feces prime boost strategy by combining parenteral and subsequent oral mv-h boosters could induce titers 20 times the human protective levels these titers were significantly greater than with either of the vaccine administered alone mv-h edible vaccine does not cause atypical measles which may be occasionally seen with the current vaccine thus it may prove better for achieving its eradication the success in mice has prompted similar experiments in primates transgenic rice and lettuce and baby food against measles are also being developed when given with ctb adjuvant 3550 g mv-h lettuce is enough however an increased dose would be required if given alone 
rabies is a deadly viral infection that is transmitted to humans from animals tomato plants expressing rabies antigens could induce antibodies in mice alternatively tmv may also be used transformed tomato plants using camv with the glycoprotein g-protein gene of rabies virus era strain was shown to be immunogenic in animals 
hepatitis b is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis b virus it is estimated to have infected 400 million people throughout the globe making the virus one of the most common human pathogen first human trials of a potato-based vaccine against hepatitis b have reported encouraging results since immunization is the only known method to prevent the disease of the hepatitis b virus any attempt to reduce its infection requires the availability of large quantities of vaccine hbsag  the amount of hbsag needed for one dose could be achieved in a single potato levels of specific antibodies significantly exceeded the protective level of 10 miuml in humans when cloned into camv the pcmv-s plasmid encoding the hbsag subtype ayw showed higher expression in roots as compared to leaf tissue of the transgenic potato furthermore expression of the antigen was found to be higher in roots of transgenic potato than in leaf tissues however the expression of hbsag in transgenic potatoes is not sufficient for using as oral vaccine further studies are underway to increase the level of hbsag by using different promoters eg patatin promoter and different transcription regulating elements

coli to address this limitation plants were transformed with the gene encoding b subunit of the e coli heat liable enterotoxin lt-b transgenic potatoes expressing lt-b were found to induce both serum and secretory antibodies when fed to mice these antibodies were protective in bacterial toxin assay in vitro this is the first proof of concept for the edible vaccine since people eat only cooked potatoes the effect of boiling on the properties of ctb expressed in transgenic potatoes was examined after boiling for 5 min over half of the vaccine protein survived in its biologically active form providing evidence that cooking does not always inactivate edible vaccines thus the spectrum of plants for producing edible vaccines may be expanded beyond raw food plants such as fruits co-expression of mutant cholera toxin subunit mct-a and lt-b in crop seeds has been shown to be effective by nasal administration and is extremely practical the prevalence of diabetes is increasing globally and india is no exception more than 100 million people are affected with diabetes worldwide type-i diabetes also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus iddm or juvenile-onset diabetes primarily affects children and young adults and accounts for 510  of the diagnosed diabetes in north america research by ma and hein 1995 at the university of western ontario showed that diabetes can be prevented in mice by feeding them with plants engineered to produce a diabetes related-protein the idea is based on oral tolerance where the autoimmune system is selectively turned off early by teaching the body to tolerate the antigenic proteins the pancreatic protein glutamic acid decarboxylase gad67 is linked to the onset of iddm and when injected into mice it is known to prevent diabetes the canadian group developed transgenic potato and tobacco plants with the gene for gad67 fed them to nonobese diabetic mice which developed insulin-dependent diabetes spontaneously the results were intriguing only 20  of the prediabetic mice fed with transgenic plants developed the diabetes while 70  nontreated mice developed the disease the treated mice also showed increased levels of ig1 an antibody associated with cytokines which suppresses harmful immune responses thus the antigen produced in plants appears to retain immunogenicity and prevent diabetes in an animal model according to canadian scientists this is the first proof of principle for the use of edible vaccines in the treatment of the autoimmune diseases 
human immunodeficiency virus hiv is a retroviral that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancer to thrive in order to produce edible vaccine initial success in splicing hiv protein into cpmv has been achieved two hiv protein genes and camv as promoter were successfully injected into tomatoes with a needle and the expressed protein was demonstrable by polymerase chain reaction pcr in different parts of the plant including the ripe fruit as well as in the second generation plants recently spinach has been successfully inoculated for tat protein expression cloned into tmv each gram of leaf tissue of spinach was shown to contain up to 300500 g of tat antigen mice fed with this spinach followed by dna vaccinations resulted in higher antibody titers than the controls with the levels peaking at 4 weeks post-vaccination edible vaccines are future vaccines and some challenges are yet to be overcome before these can become a reality like all products regulated by food and drug administration edible vaccines undergo a rigorous review of laboratory and clinical testing that are conducted to get information regarding safety efficacy purity and potency of these products these trials can take place only after satisfactory information has been collected on the quality of the nonclinical safety successful expression of antigens in plants has been demonstrated in the past the vaccines have also been checked for their efficacy in humans results from the primary phase of the first-ever human clinical trial of an edible vaccine were published in the journal nature medicine in 1998 blaine p friedlander boyce thomson institute of plant research which indicated that consumption of servings of raw potatoes resulted in immunity to specific diseases the human clinical study was conducted under the direction of dr carol tacket at the center for vaccine development university of maryland school of medicine in baltimore in the first phase of human testing the potatoes eaten by volunteers contained a vaccine against travelers diarrhea a common condition resulting from intestinal infection by the bacterium e coli which contaminates food or water supplies the clinical trials were approved in advance by the food and drug administration encouraged by the results of this study scientists started exploring the use of this technique for administering other antigens in 2005 thanavalas group has developed a potato vaccine booster for use in conjunction with injected hepatitis b vaccine it is currently in phase ii clinical trial and phase i for patients who have previously been vaccinated in 2000 tacket and his team mates studied the human immune response to the norwalk virus capsid protein expressed in potatoes overall 95  19 out of 20 volunteers developed some kind of immune response although the antibody increase in some cases was modest in same year pogrebnyaks lab developed an effective vaccine against the coronavirus which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars tomato and tobacco plants are used for high expression of the coronavirus spike protein s1 first lyophilized tomato fruit was fed to mice and then boosting occurred with s1 protein expressed in tobacco roots high igg1 immune responses and significant igg2a and igg2b responses were observed in their sera research is also going in the direction to engineer the plants to produce a variety of functional monoclonal antibody ma et al 2005 in the first human study of transgenic plant vaccine designed to induce active immunity 14 adult volunteers were given either 100 g of transgenic potato 50 g of transgenic potato or 50 g of wild type potato each transgenic potatoes containing from 37 to 157 gg of lt-b the variable dose per gram of potato was due to the tissue specificity of the promoter therefore that lt-b was expressed to a different degree in the different tissues of the potatoes the potatoes in this study were ingested raw however subsequent studies have shown that transgenic potatoes expressing the b subunit of cholera toxin could be boiled for 3 min until the tissue becomes soft with loss of only about 50  of the ct- b pentameric gm1-binding form serologic responses were also detected after vaccination totally 10 out of the 11 volunteers 91  who ingested transgenic potatoes developed igg anti-lt and in half of them responses occurred after the first dose there are 6 of the 11 55  volunteers developed fourfold rise in serum iga anti-lt researchers supported by the niaid have shown for the first time that an edible vaccine can safely trigger significant immune responses in people the goal of the phase 1 proof-of-concept trial study was to demonstrate that an edible vaccine could stimulate an immune response in humans volunteers ate bite-sized pieces of raw potato that had been genetically engineered to produce part of the toxin secreted by e
coli which causes diarrhea the trial enrolled 14 healthy adults 11 were chosen at random to receive the genetically engineered potatoes and 3 received pieces of ordinary potatoes the investigator periodically collected blood and stool samples from the volunteers to evaluate the vaccines ability to stimulate both systemic and intestinal immune responses the potatoes were well tolerated and no one experienced serious adverse side effects niaid supported scientists are exploring the use of this technique for administering other antigens edible vaccines for other intestinal pathogens are already in the pipeline potatoes and bananas that might protect against norwalk virus a common cause of diarrhea and potatoes and tomatoes that might protect against hepatitis b are being developed thirty million children throughout the world do not receive even the most basic immunizations each year as a result at least three million of these children die from diseases that are fully vaccine-preventable the solution to vaccinate these children might seem simple with the idea of large scale production of edible vaccines for various diseases as a recent progress the first human clinical trials for plant-based vaccine have been performed it brings many challenges like optimization of expression levels stabilization during post harvest storage etc long-term reactions to edible vaccines are yet to be determined possible delayed reactions not yet discovered may be the point of consideration in addition to that edible vaccines can be further improved for their oral immunogenicity by the use of specific adjuvant which can be applied either as a fusion to the candidate gene or as an independent gene some of the diseases to which edible vaccines have shown promising application may be elaborated in the veterinary as well as human spectrum these studies conclude plant-derived vaccines as a new hope and promise for more immunogenic more effective and less expensive vaccination strategies against both respiratory as well as intestinal mucosal pathogens research in the field of edible vaccines holds immense potential for the future and every advancement made in this direction is bringing the dream of edible vaccine one step closer there is hope that in coming future edible vaccines will conquer all serious diseases and make the planet beautiful to

further and found to contain an apparently complete 135-kb mini-exon repeat using the recombinant plasmid pmesi and the strategy shown in fig i  the complete nucleotide sequence of one repeat unit containing the mini-exon was determined this is presented in fig 2 with position  i being the first nucleotide of the mini-exon the region from -270 to 61 was also sequenced from the independently generated plasmid pmepi see fig 1  the results from the two plasmids were identical in this region although southern blot analysis suggested that the repeat unit was defined by a single sau3a site refs 20 21 and dat and jcb unpublished results the possibility remained that two closely adjacent sau3a sites were contained within each repeat and that pmesi therefore lacked a small portion of the repeat to test this a further recombinant plasmid contaiing a mini-exon repeat was generated using an sphi digest of genomic dna as cloned in a bacteriophage a recombinant containing several135-kb repeats dac unpublished results and ligated to sphi-digested patl53 sphi was known to cut the repeat once from sequence analysis of pmesi and southern blot analyses dac unpublished results and thus should give a fragment spanning the sau3a site in question mini-exon-containing plasmids were identified as above and pmehl was obtained mapped and sequenced see fig 1  from this plasmid a contiguous sequence spanning the sau3a site used to construct pmesl was obtained data not shown demonstrating that the sequence presented in fig 2 represents a complete mini-exon repeat to ensure that this sequence was not only complete but also representative we compared its restriction map with the fragment sizes observed on southern blots of genomic dna cut with several enzymes using the pvull insert of pmepi as a radiolabelled probe data not shown the predominant bands obtained in each digest agreed in all cases with the fragment sizes predicted from the sequence this demonstrated that the mini-exon repeats are highly conserved and that pmesi contains a typical member a testable prediction of the model proposing discontinuous transcription is that there should be detectable levels of a small rna that is  135 kb derived from each mini-exon repeat one of the most sensitive methods for detecting and characterizing particular transcripts is st-protection 29  whereby a radiolabelled dna probe from the region of interest is denatured and renatured in the presence of rna the resulting material is then digested with the single-strand-specific s nuclease and the length of any protected fragments measured by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography the dna substrate used here was from pmesi extending from the 3-32 pj-labelled pvull site at position 58 downstream through the sau3a site position 183 to the ecori site in the vector see fig i  this fragment was mixed with total trypanosome bloodstream-form rna or sucrose-gradient fractions thereof precipitated redissolved denatured and renatured in conditions favouring rnadna hybridization 3o  this mixture was then cooled diluted and digested with st nuclease before electrophoresis on a 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel the resulting autoradiogram fig 3 a shows a single major end point of protection by total rna which corresponds to nucleotide 137 in the sequence presented in fig 2  minor bands immediately flanking this protected region may be indicative of slight heterogeneity at the 3 end of the rna or nonspecific digestion by s nuclease at the end of the rnadna duplex this result could be interpreted as protection by a short rna of 137 nucleotides derived from the mini-exon repeats andor by a longer transcript with a discontinuity at this position in the rnadna duplex to discriminate between these two alternatives two procedures were used the first examined the st-protection by different size fractions of rna produced by sucrose-gradient centrifugation fig 3b  maximal protection was found in fractions 19-21 which possessed rna with a peak size slightly larger than 4s rna that is -100-200 nucleotides with diminishing but detectable protection in the remaining fractions fig 3a  this strongly suggested that the protection observed with total rna was due at least in part to the presence of a small rna the protection observed with other fractions particularly those containing larger rna may be due  to contamination with the small rna alternatively they may be a result of protection by hybrid transcripts comprising the small rna at their 5 ends linked to rna from for example the elc region by the mechanisms discussed below the second method to detect and size transcripts from the mini-exon repeat used northern blot analysis 31  for this procedure total trypanosome rna was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page in denaturing conditions transferred to genescreen membrane 32 and hybridized with a 5 -32 plabelled synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to positions  117 to 133 this 17 -mer was chosen because it excluded the mini-exon itself which was known to give intense hybridization throughout rna blots when used as a probe 21 and because the sl-protection experiments indicated that it should hybridize to mini-ex on-derived transcripts figure 4a shows the ethidium bromide stain of a polyacrylamide7 m urea gel in which the major small rna species is readily apparent figure 4b presents the autoradiogram produced after hybridizing a genescreen transfer of a duplicate half of this gel with the 17-mer only one band is detected in the track containing trypanosome rna and no signal is observed in the track containing rna from the unrelated parasitic protozoan toxoplasma gondii the size of the band is -140 nucleotides based on published values for the small ribosomal rnas of trypanosomes 33  thus confirming that the mini-ex on repeats are transcribed to yield a short discrete rna which we have termed mini-exon-derived rna medrna with regard to its precise size this result is within experimental error consistent with medrna being 137 nucleotides long we cannot however exclude the possibility that medrna is as many as 4-5 nucleotides longer and that sl nuclease nonspecifically digested the 3 end of the rnadna hybrid note however that the nucleotides at positions 138 and 140 are cytosines which as cg pairs would be less susceptible to such action a definite answer awaits 3-sequence analysis of medrna methods a a 3-32 p-end-labelled pvull digest of pmes1 was re-cut with ecori to generate a uniquely end-labelled fragment corresponding to positions 59 to 183 plus 375 bp of the vector see fi  i s protection was done essentially as described elsewhere 3  briefly the probe was mixed with different fractions of bloodstream-fonn rna precipitated redissolved and denatured in 80 fonnamide at 80c for 10 min renaturation of rnadna hybrids was promoted by incubating at 45 c for 3 h in the same buffer before diluting with 10 vol of aqueous buffer cooling to 30c and adding 35 units ofs nuclease digestion was for 30 min after which the reactions were phenol-extracted isopropanolprecipitated resuspended in fonnamide loading buffer 43 and resolved by page in a 6 polyacrylamide gel with 7 m urea 44  b a 15-30 linear sucrose gradient was prepared in 01 m naci i mm edta 20 mm tris-hci ph 75 01  sds about i mg of total trypanosome rna was overlaid with the same buffer and the samples spun in an sw-41 rotor beckman at 40000 rpm at 20c for 95 h fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and the a 260 measured for the s-protection experiments 5 of each sample was removed and pooled in groups of three numbered by the middle fraction these results also suggest that the 5 -terminus of medrn a is at about position  1 in the mini-ex on repeat to confirm this we used the synthetic oligonucleotide from the rna blot analyses as a primer for reverse transcriptase extensions of medrna the result fig 5 shows a major band co-migrating with a heterologous dna marker of 135 nucleotides using a different heterologous marker a hindiii digest of bacteriophage a dna the size of this band was estimated as 133 nucleotides this slight discrepancy is probably due to differences in base composition allowing for this variation the extension has an approximate length of 134  1 nucleotides given that the 5-end of the primer represents position 133 of the mini-exon repeat this result confirms that the 5-end of medrna corresponds to position 1 the same as that found for the spliced leader of mature vsg mrnas i3 14 the minor band in fig 5 at 138 i nucleotides may be an artefact of reverse transcriptase for example loop-back synthesis or it may be indicative of a minor rna 4 nucleotides longer than the major species such minor heterogeneity might be due to variation in the mini-exon repeat sequences andor in the site of transcriptional initiation no other major bands were observed in other loadings of this sample run for longer or shorter periods data not shown  we have cloned and sequenced a complete copy of the 135-kb mini-exon repeat of t brucei and identified a short rna of 137 nucleotides as its transcriptional product the data indicate that this repeat is a typical member of a highly conserved family-this is demonstrated further by the virtually complete agreement of the sequence presented in fig 2 with the partial sequence for the region from -130 to 61 recently published elsewhere 2  the four differences three single base changes one insertion are all localized to between -115 and -125 as the sequences in both cases were determined from two plasmids the differences may be indicative of minor but real variation in the repeats in addition to the region coding for medrna each 135-kb mini-exon repeat contains about 1200 nucleotides whose function is not clear part of this region is presumably involved in the regulation of medrna expression but the remainder could be involved in some other aspect of trypanosome gene expression of particular note is the repetitive nature of the sequence around the sau3a site consisting of 1- 2- 4-and 6-nucleotide repeats t at ac atttgttt and acactc respectively it will be interesting to determine whether these regions of the repeat are as exactly conserved as that coding for the medrna the predicted sequence of medrna can be drawn with several alternative regions of intramolecular base-pairing data not shown this suggests that medrna might adopt a stable conformation with substantial secondary structure but as we have no data on rnase sensitivity we cannot present a reliable structure the detection of medrna raises questions about the signals directing its transcription as noted by de lange et a 2i further studies on relative drug sensitivities and 5 -cap structures are needed to confirm medrna as an rna polymerase ii transcript the termination site cannot be compared with the general case as too few sequences of eukaryotic transcriptional terminators have been reported to enable consensus sequences to be made recently the complete sequence of a small nuclear rna snr3 and its gene have been reported in yease z  35 this transcription unit shows remarkable similarity to the mini-exon repeat at four critical positions fig 6  the remainder of the two sequences sharing no significant homologies first the snr3 gene also has the octanucleotide t a tttttg centred at position -27 relative to the start site for transcription second the 354  articles  n2aturevol31127september1984 initiation site for transcription lies within a heptanucleotide sequence which is very similar in the two genes six out of seven bases identical third both sequences although of different overall length 137 versus 194 nucleotides for medrna and snr3 respectively end near the beginning of an extremely t-rich region finally the region containing the putative donor splice site of the medrna also shares a 5-out of 6-residue homology with the yeast snr3 the potential significance of which is discussed below the finding of medrn a fulfils one of the predictions of a model for vsg gene expression involving discontinuous transcription however it is not definitive because of the multiplicity of the mini-exon repeats it could be that although the majority of the repeats are indeed transcribed to give the short medrna one repeat is used in the initiation of a very long transcript including the vsg coding exon this is a difficult possibility to exclude because pulse-chase experiments which have been traditionally used to demonstrate precursorproduct relationships suffer from the same shortcoming-it is impossible to demonstrate that a given mini-exon repeat is used for one purpose compared with another indistinguishable repeat nevertheless together with published observations regarding the abundance of transcripts containing mini-exon-derived sequences and the inability to detect linkage between a mini-exon sequence and the vsg coding ex on the identification of a short discrete medrna strongly supports a model of discontinuous transcription in this model the mini-ex on-derived leader segment of vsg a reinitiation mini -exon repeats  mrnas is transcribed as a discrete product of the mini-exon repeats and by one of several possible mechanisms is ultimately found attached to the 5-end of the vsg precursor rna the chimaeric intervening sequence is then removed by splicing bringing together the 35-nucleotide leader with the coding portion to give the final mrna of -17 kb there are two general schemes by which this can most easily be imagined to occur the first model presented in fig 7 a predicts that rna polymerase transcribes the medrna and then dissociates from the mini-exon repeat possibly as a medrnapolymerase complex transcription then reinitiates just upstream of the elc using medrna as a primer the second model fig 7 b proposed that medrna and the codingregion rna are independently produced as discrete transcripts and then post-transcriptionally ligated to each other in both cases splicing ultimately removes the intervening sequence to generate the mature mrna the critical difference between the two alternatives is that post-transcriptional ligation requires a functional promoter in the sense of a site for de novo initiation of transcription upstream of the elc whereas the reinitiation model proposes a site in this same position where rna polymerase could only act in the presence of a primer that is medrna we are now attempting to test for this distinction in vitro we have previously reported the sequence upstream of an expressed copy of a vsg gene and compared it with a silent copy of that gene 19  we found that the upstream region of the expressed copy consisted of multiple tandem repeats of -76 bp flanking an unusual sequence of t aa90 although three 76-bp repeats are found upstream ofthe silent copy t aa90 is unique to the expressed copy of this gene-and is therefore a candidate for the reinitiation site upstream of expressed vsg genes if this sequence is unique and mobile it could be the basis for the mutual exclusion observed between the different expression sites equally another as yet undetected mobile control element might have this role a critical question raised by the results reported here is whether discontinuous transcription involving a small rna is a unique property of t brucei is it for example a special adaptation which has co-evolved with antigenic variation this is argued against by the finding that the same or similar miniexon sequences are found in many rnas of unknown coding function not only from bloodstream-forms of the parasite but also from the procyclic insect forms where vsg genes are not in addition the mini-exon sequence or a conserved homologue has been shown to be present in the genomes of several related species and genera which lack antigenic variation of the type observed for t brucej22 could discontinuous transcription be operating in these other cases this question cannot as yet be answered but some precedent does exist in systems which are otherwise totally unrelated transcription of the influenza virus is known to require a 5-capped primer 10-15 nucleotides long derived from cleavage of host mrnas 36 37 coronavirus transcripts on the other hand are known to have a common 5-leader sequence which is seemingly not joined to the coding portion of the rna by conventional splicing again strongly suggesting discontinuous transcription 38 39 the fact that in both these cases transcription occurs by an rna-dependent viral transcriptase may be an important distinction but they do provide a mechanistic precedent for discontinuity in primary transcripts the lyttieton hypothesized long ago that triton and pluto originated as adjacent prograde satellites of neptune l  with the presently accepted masses of triton and pluto-charon 1   however the momentum and energy exchange that would be required to set triton on a retrograde trajectory is impossible the mass of triton has probably been seriously overestimated 4 5 but not by enough to relax this restriction it is implausible that the present angular momentum state of pluto-charon has been significantly influenced by neptune it could not acquire such angular momentum during an ejection event unless a physical collision was involved which is quite unlikely the simplest hypothesis is that triton and pluto are independent representatives of large outer solar system planetesimals triton is simply captured with potentially spectacular consequences that include runaway melting of interior ices and release to the surface of clathrated ch 4  co and nl ref 7  condensed remnants of this proto-atmosphere could account for features in tritons unique spectrums-h the dynamics of tritons orbital evolution are considerably simplified by the fact that its specific dissipation function q at tidal frequencies is much less than that of neptune qt qn here i assume a standard solid-body q for triton of -100 ref 12  a lower bound on qn can be derived by requiring that the outward orbital eyolution of a satellite given by is not so rapid that the satellite originated at the corotation radius of neptune 4500 myr ago l2 where ms and as are the satellites mass and semimajor axis m n  rn and k2n are neptunes mass radius and tidal-effective potential love number of the second degree and g is the gravitational constant k2n is estimated at 043 subject to uncertainties in neptunes rotation rate and 12 the coefficient of the second harmonic of the gravitational potential see ref 13 other parameter values are given in table i  if neptunes third satellite l4 is confirmed and proves to be regular and non-commensurate then qn 10 4  a lower bound on the q of uranus of -2 x 10 4 is set using miranda 15 and a kz for uranus of 028 the qs of both planets should be comparable and are probably much larger accordingly the monthly radial tide raised on triton by neptune dominates tritons orbital evolution except for orbits of very small eccentricity this tide does not transfer angular momentum for a synchronously-rotating triton but in the cases of interest here such non-synchronous spin angular momentum would be negligible compared with orbital angular momentum the present fractional rate of change in tritons orbital angular momentum due to the tide raised on neptune by triton is  das akut-auf-chronische leberversagen als diagnostische und therapeutische herausforderung der intensivmedizin p hbener g braun v fuhrmann   das akut-auf-chronische leberversagen aclf wird im zusammenschluss der european association for the study of the liver

auslsenden ereignis steht und aufgrund eines multiorganversagens mit erhhter 3monats-letalitt verbunden ist definiert 1 der fokus der definition liegt dabei eindeutig auf dem organversagen das zumeist extrahepatische organe betrifft abb 1 und die prognose betroffener patienten am strksten beeinflusst 2 3 zur identifizierung risikostratifizierung sowie definition in abhngigkeit von klinisch

wertigkeit klinischer scores fr das aclf evaluiert 4 5 hierbei zeigte sich ein in der tendenz erwarteter in der tatschlichen ausprgung jedoch alarmierender anstieg der kurzzeitletalitt bis hin zu ber

manahmen in ber 70  der flle ein berleben ohne organtransplantation erreicht werden kann 6 7
 die identifikation spezifischer auslser des aclf ist fr die diagnosestellung nicht zwingend erforderlich tab 1 die hufigsten auslser des aclf sind geographisch unterschiedlich verteilt und oft fr den krankheitsverlauf relevant 4 die hufigsten auslser des aclf sind geographisch unterschiedlich verteilt und oft fr den krankheitsverlauf relevant 4 5 sie beinhalten lokale und generalisierte infektionen neue oder fortgesetzte leberschdigung durch alkohol undoder andere hepatotoxische substanzen operationen zirkulationsstrungen sowie seltenere ursachen wie beispielsweise einen schub einer autoimmunen hepatitis tab 2 whrend die varizenblutung traditionell eher als dekompensation einer vorbestehenden leberzirrhose gewertet und ihre mortalitt in den letzten jahren durch moderne evidenzbasierte behandlungsstrategien einschlielich endoskopischer blutstillung medikamentser und interventioneller senkung des portosystemischen druckgradienten und vermeidung infektiser komplikationen gesenkt werden konnte knnen sowohl hmorrhagischer als auch septischer schock nach einer blutung ein aclf auslsen in bis zu 40  der flle kann kein auslsendes ereignis identifiziert werden in diesen fllen liegen mglicherweise subklinische infektionen passagere strungen der intestinalen barriere oder unerkannte hepatotoxische effekte als mgliche auslser zugrunde 9

 unabhngig davon ob das aclf durch direkte oder indirekte schdigung der leber ausgelst wird scheinen 2 faktoren im zentrum der pathophysiologie der erkrankung zu stehen 1 hmodynamische vernderungen und 2 systemische inflammationsreaktionen systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs 9 11 bei der fortgeschrittenen zirrhose besteht eine hyperdyname kreislaufsituation mit portaler hypertension was die pathophysiologische grundlage fr die kardinalen dekompensationszeichen hypotonie aszites hepatorenales syndrom gastrointestinale blutungen und gleichzeitig den ansatzpunkt fr lebensrettende interventionen darstellt in der komplexen wechselwirkung aus volumenhaushalt kardialer auswurfleistung und aktivierung neurohumoraler regelkreise scheint nach der gngigen auffassung die effektive hypovolmie durch periphere vasodilatation im splanchnikusgebiet eine hauptrolle zu spielen diese vasodilatation wiederum wird zunehmend als resultat einer generalisierten entzndungsantwort des krpers aufgefasst die durch verschiedenste mediatoren ausgelst und unterhalten werden kann so wird angenommen dass zugrundegehende parenchymzellen in allen geweben zellulre bestandteile damage-associated molecular patterns damp freisetzen die umliegende entzndungszellen aktivieren und im sinne einer immunpathologie durch sterile entzndungsmechanismen zur verstrkten organschdigung beitragen bei bakteriellen infektionen hingegen gelten neben toxinen und virulenzfaktoren molekulare fremdsignaturen pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamp als stimulus fr angeborene und adaptive immuneffektoren die der pathogenabwehr dienen sie tragen jedoch ihrerseits lokal durch unterdrckung der normalen parenchymfunktionen und immunologische kollateralschdigung gesunder gewebezellen zum organausfall bei zirkulierende pamp und damp und durch sie ausgelste immunologische effekte werden neben der vasodilatation im splanchnikusgebiet auch fr die ausbildung eines sirseiner sepsis als klinische syndrome einer generalisierten entzndungsantwort des krpers verantwortlich gemacht vieles deutet dabei darauf hin dass eine berschieende immunantwort bei zirrhosepatienten zur ausbildung eines aclf beitrgt so weisen zirrhotiker sowohl in der frh- als auch der sptphase nach bakterieller infektion signifikant hhere level an proinflammatorischen zytokinen tnf- il-6 auf als patienten ohne zirrhose 12 zudem wurden auch andere pro- und antiinflammatorische zytokine stnf- r1 il-2 il-8 il-10 ifn- in stark erhhten plasmatischen konzentrationen bei patienten mit aclf nachgewiesen 13 auch routinelaborparameter wie leukozyten und crp sind bei patienten mit aclf erhht und korrelieren in ihrer hhe mit der anzahl von organausfllen und dem aclf-grad 5 bei patienten die eine erste immunaktivierung im rahmen des auslsenden stimulus berleben wird hnlich wie bei der sepsis ohne lebererkrankung ein bergang in einen immunsupprimierten bzw immundysregulierten zustand immune paralysis 14 beobachtet der das risiko fr weitere infektionen signifikant erhht angesichts der hohen letalitt hospitalisierter zirrhotiker bei infektionen etwa 15  bzw bei schweren bakteriellen infektionen mit septischem schock 60100  1517 erscheint eine aggressive antiinfektive prventions- und therapiestrategie bei aclf-patienten von zentraler bedeutung die canonic-studie ging der frage nach welcher anteil von  zunchst meist auf einer normalstation  hospitalisierten zirrhosepatienten ein aclf aufweisen oder im verlauf entwickeln und welche prognostischen parameter sich in dieser patientengruppe ausmachen lassen um besonders gefhrdete subgruppen frhzeitig zu erkennen das aclf wurde dabei als hufigste indikation fr eine aufnahme von zirrhosepatienten auf eine intensivstation identifiziert die anzahl und das jeweilige ausma von organversagen wurden mittels eines modifizierten sequential-organ-failure-assessmentsofa-scores erfasst da sich dieses system in der vergangenheit zuverlssiger in der mortalittsabschtzung von kritisch kranken zirrhosepatienten erwiesen hatte als die meld- oder child-pugh-klassifikation der sofa-score wurde fr die studie modifiziert tab 3 und schlielich in eine vereinfachte form clif consortium organ failure score clif-c-ofs mit identischen organparametern und hnlichem prognostischem wert modifiziert der schweregrad des aclf wurde anhand der anzahl der organausflle of stratifiziert aclf 1 1 of aclf 2 2 of aclf 3 36 of

deutlichsten mit dem aclf-grad mit einer 28- bzw 90-tages-mortalitt von 22  bzw 41  beim aclf 1 32  bzw 55  beim aclf 2 und 73  bzw 77  beim aclf 3 alkoholismus 60  hepatitis c 13  sowie deren kombination 5  wurden als hufigste zugrunde liegende lebererkrankungen identifiziert whrend des aclf waren in der analyse die nieren das hufigste ausfallende organsystem 56  der patienten gefolgt von der leber 44  blutgerinnungssystem 28  zns 24  kreislauf 17  und lungen 9  wobei letztere nur bei aclf 3 beobachtet wurden interessanterweise trat das aclf in fast 50  bei patienten auf die zuvor keine akute dekompensation der leber erlitten hatten und nahm in diesen patienten auch einen gravierenderen verlauf als in patienten mit zurckliegender dekompensation 28-tages-mortalitt 42  vs 29  5 whrend bakterielle infektionen und aktiver alkoholismus als hufigste auslser des aclf ausgemacht werden konnten verblieb in vielen fllen kein spezifischer auslser des aclf eruierbar art und etwaige erfassung bzw nichterfassung eines aclf-triggers waren indes ohne auswirkung auf die mortalitt die auerordentlich hohe dynamik des krankheitsbilds aclf spiegelt sich auch in der tatsache wider dass whrend der hospitalisierung in etwa 50  eine besserung und in 20  eine verschlechterung auftrat 18 die heilungsrate sank mit dem aclf-grad von 55  aclf 1 ber 35  aclf 2 bis auf 15  aclf 3 da sich der aclf-grad zumeist in den ersten beiden bis maximal 7 tagen nderte wird hier ein goldenes zeitfenster fr therapeutische interventionen vermutet abb 1 fr eine risikoabschtzung von patienten mit akuter dekompensation einer leberzirrhose mit oder ohne aclf wurden klinische und laborchemische parameter identifiziert die mit erhhter mortalitt assoziiert waren hier wurden 1 die anzahl von organversagen nach clif-kriterien 2 das patientenalter sowie 3 die konzentration zirkulierender leukozyten als unabhngige variablen identifiziert diese resultate gingen wiederum in eine erweiterung des clif-c-ofs

kalkulation kann jedoch beispielsweise durch einen onlinerechner des clif consortium erfolgen 20 in der weiteren aufarbeitung der canonic-kohorte zeigte sich eine 100 ige letalitt von patienten mit 4 organversagen undoder einem clif-aclfs score 64 nach 37 tagen therapie sofern keine lebertransplantation erfolgte 18 die zahlen unterstreichen den stellenwert eines frhen und raschen  insbesondere intensivmedizinischen  therapiebeginns um das fortschreiten des multiorganversagens zu durchbrechen ob eine frhzeitige lebertransplantation bei patienten mit aclf zielfhrend ist ist derzeit thema kontroverser debatten und wird erst durch zuknftige studien geklrt werden knnen zustzlich kann die wiederholte risikostratifizierung mittels scores bei patienten mit aclf in dem schwierigen entscheidungsprozess hinsichtlich der art des weiteren therapeutischen vorgehens kurativer oder palliativer therapieansatz helfen wir mchten jedoch betonen dass derartige entscheidungen definitiv rztliche entscheidungen sind die niemals von einem score bernommen werden drfen im rahmen dieses rztlichen entscheidungsprozesses mssen neben der unmittelbaren schwere der erkrankung beispielsweise auch der mutmaliche patientenwunsch jeweilige lokale und nationale berlebensraten eine potenzielle reversibilitt der organausflle sowie die komorbiditten des patienten bercksichtigt werden die hufigsten mit einem aclf assoziierten infektionen sind die spontan-bakterielle peritonitis sbp pneumonien und harnwegsinfekte gefolgt von haut- und weichteilinfekten und bakterimien 4 5 die schnelle diagnosestellung und umgehende einleitung einer antibiotikatherapie sind von entscheidender bedeutung fr den krankheitsverlauf auch fr prophylaktische antibiotikastrategien gibt es bei hochrisikokonstellationen obere gastrointestinale blutung fortgeschrittene zirrhose mit niedrigem aszitesproteingehalt sekundrprophylaxe nach stattgehabter sbp wie sie hufig bei kritisch kranken patienten bestehen eine sehr starke evidenz 29 bei klinischem verdacht auf vorliegen einer infektion sollte niedrigschwellig eine frhzeitige sich nach dem vermuteten fokus dem schweregrad der infektion und dem lokalen resistenzmuster richtende breit kalkulierte antibiotikatherapie eingeleitet werden die nach eingrenzung des keimspektrums oder nachweis des auslsenden erregers und sofern mglich sanierung des infektherds konsequent antibiogrammgerecht de-eskaliert werden sollte bei entsprechendem klinischem verdacht sowie bei nichtansprechen einer kalkulierten breitspektrumantibiose mssen auch pilzinfektionen in betracht gezogen werden hmodynamisch weisen aclf-patienten wie zirrhotiker allgemein meist eine hyperdyname kreislaufsituation auf bei der infolge der vasodilatation im splanchnikusgebiet eine effektive zentrale hypovolmie vorherrscht die sich mit fortschreiten des aclf meist noch aggraviert in ermangelung klinischer daten erscheinen ein mittlerer arterieller blutdruck von 6065 mm hg sowie als transfusionstrigger ein unterer hb-wert von 7 gdl bei zirrhotikern als hmodynamische zielvariablen sinnvoll hb-werte ber 9 gdl nach bluttransfusionen knnen das risiko portalhypertensiver blutungskomplikationen unntig erhhen und sollten daher vermieden werden 30 31 bei der volumentherapie zur kreislaufstabilisierung sind kristalloide die erste wahl die zustzliche gabe von humanalbumin zur volumenexpansion verbessert im rahmen der antibiotikatherapie bei sbp bei der behandlung des typ-1-hepatorenalen syndroms und nach grovolumiger parazentese das berleben und ist hierbei von zentraler bedeutung bei anderen infektionen als der sbp verzgerte die albumingabe in einer kleinen studie zwar das auftreten von renaler dysfunktion nicht aber das berleben 32 und sollte dementsprechend zurckhaltend eingesetzt werden der einsatz von kolloidalen volumenersatzmitteln wie hydroxyethylstrke wird aufgrund potenzieller nephrotoxizitt nicht empfohlen der stellenwert von nichtselektiven blockern nsbb einer hauptsule in der therapie des portalen hypertonus zur prophylaxe von varizenblutungen wird bei patienten mit fortgeschrittener dekompensierter leberzirrhose zunehmend kritisch diskutiert 3335 so zeigten einerseits retrospektive untersuchungen eine erhhte mortalitt bei infektionen bei leberzirrhotikern die blocker erhielten 34 andererseits zeigte sich bei den aclf-patienten in der canonic-studie retrospektiv ein gnstiger effekt einer fortgesetzten blockade auf sirs und berleben sodass zumindest das unkritische absetzen einer vorbestehenden medikation mit nsbb bei auftreten eines aclf nicht gerechtfertigt erscheint 36 zur endgltigen klrung dieses kontrovers diskutierten themas sind jedoch weitere studien vonnten die nieren sind das beim aclf in seiner funktion am hufigsten gestrte organsystem und renale dysfunktion ist mit einer gravierenden verschlechterung der prognose betroffener patienten assoziiert 37 grundstzlich kann die nierenfunktion im rahmen von infektionensepsis canonic-kohorte 39  der aclf-patienten volumendepletion blutung diarrh etc 21  sowie im rahmen des typ-1-hepatorenalen syndroms hrs 12  sowie anderweitiger nierenschdigung einschlielich medikamentennebenwirkungen-toxizitt etwa 30  eingeschrnkt werden wobei auch mischbilder auftreten knnen 38 39 hierbei ist zu beachten dass eine statische beurteilung des serumkreatinins das tatschliche ausma der dysfunktion nicht korrekt abbilden muss und eine beurteilung der dynamik des kreatininwerts sowie des ausgeschiedenen harnvolumens ber die zeit repsentativer fr die aktuelle nierenfunktion ist 40 als therapie beim hrs gilt derzeit 1 das absetzen jeglicher potenziell nephrotoxischer medikamente einschlielich diuretika 2 die behebung von beeintrchtigenden faktoren der renalen perfusion wie beispielsweise die beseitigung einer intraabdominellen hypertension durch aszites parazentese sowie schlielich 3 eine volumenexpansion mit albumin und ggf der einsatz von vasopressoren primr terlipressin alternativ noradrenalin als manahmen der wahl um die nierenfunktion zu verbessern bei gravierenden strungen des flssigkeits- sure-base- undoder elektrolythaushalts knnen extrakorporale verfahren angewandt werden wobei deren einsatz insbesondere bei fehlender mglichkeit einer lebertransplantation unter bercksichtigung der hohen mortalitt und des niedrigen regenerationspotenzials bei derart weit fortgeschrittenen lebererkrankungen mit mehrorganversagen kontrovers ist der einsatz sollte in abhngigkeit von der mglichen reversibilitt der mglichkeit der berbrckung zur transplantation sowie der anzahl und schwere der organversagen erfolgen in der regel wird einem kontinuierlichen extrakorporalen ersatzverfahren aufgrund der besseren hmodynamischen eigenschaften der vorzug vor intermittierender dialyse gegeben zitratbasierte extrakorporale antikoagulationsverfahren knnen hierbei unter bercksichtigung der gefahr einer akkumulation von zitrat durch beachtung entsprechender vorsichts- und berwachungsmanahmen zum einsatz kommen und die dauer und effektivitt der behandlung verbessern erweiterte extrakorporale dialyseverfahren leberuntersttzungsverfahren mit der mglichkeit einer erweiterten entgiftung neben wasserlslichen substanzen knnen auch eiweigebundene substanzen eliminiert werden sind die am besten untersuchten dialyseverfahren bei patienten mit aclf die albumindialyse mittels molecular adsorbent recirculating system mars gambrobaxter unterschleiheim deutschland hat sich als effektives verfahren zur elimination unterschiedlicher substanzen die als aktive antreiber des aclf vermutet werden z b prostaglandine no erwiesen und konnte in einer kleinen randomisierten studie einen berlebensvorteil bei aclf-patienten erzielen 41 des weiteren konnte in einer randomisierten kontrollierten multizentrischen studie eine signifikante verbesserung der fortgeschrittenen hepatischen enzephalopathie durch den einsatz des mars-verfahrens belegt werden 42 in einer groen europischen multizentrischen studie an 189 aclf-patienten relief-studie wurden zwar verbesserungen von kreatinin- bilirubin und he-werten beobachtet aber es konnte kein berlebensvorteil in der mars-gruppe festgestellt werden 43 auch die fraktionierte plasmaseparation und -adsorption fpsa prometheus fresenius medical care ag bad homburg deutschland die als intermittierendes verfahren albumin- und wasserlsliche toxine effizienter als das mars-system aus der zirkulation entfernt 44 jedoch hmodynamisch nachteilig ist 45 blieb bei aclf-patienten im randomisierten vergleich mit standardtherapieverfahren in der helios-studie ohne vorteil fr das berleben in der subgruppenanalyse zeigte sich allerdings ein signifikanter berlebensvorteil bei aclf-patienten mit meld-score 30 sowie bei patienten mit typ-1-hrs unter prometheus-therapie im vergleich mit standardtherapieverfahren 46 obwohl eine rezente publikation bei patienten mit akutem leberversagen durch den einsatz eines hochvolumigen plasmaaustausches high volume plasma exchange hvp einen berlebensvorteil beobachten konnte ist der stellenwert des hvp beim aclf gegenwrtig durch studien nicht ausreichend untersucht 47 der einsatz bioartifizieller systeme bei denen zustzlich zur dialyse die lebersynthesefunktion durch kultivierte hepatozyten untersttzt wird sind in ermangelung von in studien nachgewiesenen vorteilen nicht fr die klinische routineanwendung zugelassen 48 pulmonale komplikationen sind beim aclf hufig und bis zu 9  der aclf-patienten weisen eine ventilatorische insuffizienz pao2fio2  200 auf urschlich hierfr sind neben pneumonien oft mechanische einschrnkungen bei ausgeprgtem aszites und pleuraergssen bei respiratorischer insuffizienz mit aszites und pleuraergssen sollten zunchst eine therapeutische parazentese und bei beschwerdepersistenz pleurapunktionen durchgefhrt werden fr pulmonalvaskulre ursachen wie das hepatopulmonale syndrom hps und die portopulmonale hypertension pph existieren abgesehen von der lebertransplantation andere therapeutische optionen wie langzeitsauerstofftherapie bei hps oder verschiedene medikamentse therapieoptionen pph 4952 bei beatmeten patienten sollten die konsequente durchfhrung oraler dekontaminationsstrategien z b durch chlorhexidin und lungenprotektive beatmungsschemata beachtet werden eine engmaschige klinische und laborchemische arterieller ammoniak berwachung auf eine entstehende oder progressive hepatische enzephalopathie sollte ggf durch frhzeitige einleitung therapeutischer manahmen wie verabreichung von laktulose undoder rifaximin beantwortet werden wenngleich diese therapiemanahmen bei aclf-patienten durch studien nicht gut belegt sind sedative medikation sollte nach mglichkeit vermieden werden ab drittgradiger hepatischer enzephalopathie sollte die schutzintubation zur verhinderung einer aspiration erwogen werden 53 ptt- und inr-wert bilden bei zirrhotikern das blutungsrisiko aufgrund der meist gleichsam verminderten antikoagulatorischen faktoren nicht adquat ab die strksten prdiktoren fr das neuauftreten einer klinisch relevanten blutung bei patienten mit zirrhose auf der intensivstation sind fibrinogen sowie thrombozyten 54 vor routineinterventionen wie anlage eines zentralvensen katheters parazentese gastroskopie oder bronchoskopie ist eine erweiterte gerinnungsdiagnostik sowie eine routinemige substitution von gerinnungsprodukten nicht erforderlich lediglich bei aktiven blutungen sollten bei hepatischer koagulopathie entsprechende gerinnungsprodukte verabreicht werden bei der entscheidung ber art und menge der produkte knnte neben den im rahmen der klinischen routine erhobenen parametern auch die rotem-analyse beim einsparen der verabreichung von gerinnungsprodukten helfen 55 die bei chronisch lebererkrankten hufig vorbestehende und im rahmen des aclf noch exazerbierte malnutrition erfordert eine sorgfltige erhebung des ernhrungsstatus und eine adquate mglichst enterale versorgung mit nhrstoffen mangels gezielter studien an aclf-patienten erscheinen die aktuellen empfehlungen fr patienten mit fortgeschrittenen lebererkrankungen unter bercksichtigung des durch organversagen und infektkomplikationen dynamischen bedarfs sowie der jeweiligen auswirkungen der nahrungsbestandteile auf enzephalopathie undoder aszites am ehesten zielfhrend 56 57 demnach sollte auf eine ausreichende kalorienzufuhr geachtet werden wobei die historische praxis einer proteinrestriktion obsolet ist und zirrhotiker mit oder ohne he ebenso wie nichtzirrhotiker etwa 1215 gkgkg protein tglich erhalten sollten 58 eine glutaminsubstitution ist in diesem zusammenhang aufgrund der ungnstigen wirkungen auf den ammoniakhaushalt kontraindiziert auf das risiko einer hypoglykmie muss insbesondere beim leberversagen geachtet werden auerdem sollten niedrigschwellig thiamin und andere vitamine substituiert werden grundstzlich ist die enterale zufuhr der parenteralen ernhrung vorzuziehen diese kann per magensonde auch bei patienten mit bekannten sophagusvarizen ohne erhhtes risiko einer varizenblutung durchgefhrt werden 59 ein weiterer therapieansatz des aclf besteht in der medikamentsen stimulation des knochenmarks durch gcsf zur mobilisation cd34-positiver immunzellen und zur verbesserung der funktion neutrophiler granulozyten durch die bei patienten mit aclf 1 und aclf 2 niedrigere raten von nieren- und zns-versagen und septischen komplikationen sowie ein verlngertes kurzzeitberleben erzielt werden konnte 60 mit dem fortschritt zell- und molekularbiologischer verfahren rcken zelltransplantationen von adulten hepatozyten oder ihrer vorluferzellen in die reichweite therapeutischer applikationen zum gegenwrtigen zeitpunkt haben diese verfahren allerdings in der klinischen routine noch keinen stellenwert das aclf stellt ein akut lebensbedrohliches hochkomplexes und nahezu alle organsysteme des krpers betreffendes krankheitsbild bei patienten mit vorgeschdigter leber dar neben der frhzeitigen identifikation und beseitigung auslsender faktoren steht die hohe vigilanz fr die

  hospital costs impact of post ischemic stroke dysphagia database analyses of hospital discharges in france and switzerland introduction oropharyngeal dysphagia is frequent in hospitalized post-stroke patients and is associated with increased mortality and comorbidities the aim of our analysis was to evaluate the impact of dysphagia on length of hospital stay los and costs the hospital perspective was used to assess costs methods hospital discharge databases comparing hospital stays for ischemic stroke associated with dysphagia vs stroke without dysphagia in france and switzerland were analyzed the french medical information system program pmsi database analysis focused on 62297 stays for stroke in the public sector 6037 hospital stays for stroke were analyzed from the swiss ofs office fdral de la statistique statistique des cots par cas 2012 database diagnosis codes and listing of procedures were used to identify dysphagia in stroke patients results patients with post-stroke dysphagia accounted for 84 of stroke hospital stays in switzerland which is consistent with recently reported prevalence of dysphagia at hospital discharge arnold et al 2016 the french database analysis identified 42 stays with post-stroke dysphagia we hypothesize that the difference between the swiss and french datasets may be explained by the limitations of an analysis based on diagnosis and procedure coding patients with post-stroke dysphagia stayed longer at hospitals los of 237 vs 118 days in france and los of 149 vs 89 days in switzerland compared with patients without post-stroke dysphagia post-stroke dysphagia was associated with about 3000 and chf14000 cost increase in france and switzerland respectively discussion in this study post-stroke dysphagia was associated with increased los and higher hospital costs it is difficult to isolate the impact of dysphagia in patients with multiple symptoms and disabilities impacting rehabilitation and recovery after adjusting for confounding factors by matching stays according to age sex and stroke complications post-stroke dysphagia association with increased los and higher hospital costs was found to be independent of sensory or motor complications conclusion post-stroke dysphagia is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher hospital costs muehlemann natalia  jouaneton baptiste  de lotoing lucie  chal jean-jacques  fernandes jrme  kgi georg  sarikaya hakan  arnold marcel fecal coliforms as indicators in tropical waters a review terry hazen c  nowhere is the importance of accurate determination of recent human fecal contamination greater than in the tropics the diversity of waterborne diseases and their severity is greatest in tropical environments since most of the countries in tropical climates are underdeveloped with large populations that are undernourished ill-housed with poor medical services waterborne diseases may have a much greater effect on public health in the tropics than in temperate areas universally tropical areas accept water maximum contaminant levels developed by temperate nations despite the obvious differences in tropical climates high densities of total and fecal coliform bacteria have been detected in pristine streams and in groundwater samples collected from many tropical parta of the world even in epiphytic vegetation 10 m above ground in the rain forest of h e r t o rico nucleic acid dna analyses of escherichiu coli from pristine tropical environs has indicated that they are identical to clinical isolates ofe coli many tropical source waters have been shown to have enteric pathogens in the complete absence of  coliforms diffusion chamber studies with e coli at several tropical sites reveal that this bacterium can survive indefinitely in most freshwaters in puerto rico an evaluation of methods for the enumeration of fecal coliforms showed that currently used media have poor reliability as a result of large numbers of false positive and false negative results when applied to tropical water samples total and fecal coliform bacteria are not reliable indicators of recent biological contamination of waters in tropical areas fecal streptococci and coliphages in tropical waters violate the same underlying assumptions of indicator assays as the coliforms anaerobic bacteria like bifidobacterium spp and clostridium perfringens show some promise in terms of survival but not in ease of enumeration and media specificity the best course at present lies in using current techniques for direct enumeration of pathogens by fluorescent staining and nucleic acid analysis and developing tropical maximum contaminant levels for certain resistant pathogens in tropical waters over 2 billion people or half of the worlds population have suffered from diseases due to drinking polluted waters barabas 1986  more than 250 million new cases of waterborne disease are reported each year resulting in more than 10 million deaths nearly 75 of these waterborne disease cases occur in tropical and subtropical areas indeed nearly 50 of diarrheal disease deaths 46 million occur in children under 5 years of age living in the tropics snyder and merson 1982 bockemuhl 1985  many investigators and government administrators assume that these high morbidity and mortality rates simply indicate the contaminated nature of water in tropical areas however determining the level of biological contamination in tropical source water is much more difficult than most regulatory agencies perceive even regulatory agencies residing in tropical nations yet the need to accurately determine the level of biological contamination is much greater in tropical areas than it is in temperate areas tropical areas have a much greater number of waterborne diseases tables i and 11  in turn these diseases are exacerbated by the greater reliance on surface water as a drinking water source and the lack of adequate sewage treatment feachem 1977 esrey et al 1985  the literature is sparse with specific references to fecal contamination in the tropics yet there are some notable exceptions evison and james 1973 reviewed literature from ceylon egypt india and singapore and reported that densities of escherichia coli in water did not seem to coincide with known sources of fecal contamination feachem 1974  working in rural areas of new guinea found fecal coliform fc densities from 0 to 10000 colony-forming units cfu per 100 ml and fecal streptococci fs levels from 0 to 6000 cfu per 100 ml although his mean densities for both indicator bacteria was greater than 100 cfu per 100 ml for nearly all sites all sites were totally unacceptable for drinking water and feachem concluded that all sites were grossly contaminated with fecal material because of the high indicator counts yet he stated that fc and fs densities were more closely correlated with the number of domestic animals in the watershed than with the number of people in fact fc and fs densities closest to the highest human population density were the lowest in addition typical of many tropical studies feachem did not do complete identification of positive isolates in sierra leone wright 1982 reported densities of fecal coliforms from 40 to 240000 most probable number mpn per 100 ml and fs densities from 7 to 64000 cfu per 100 ml for water sources used by 29 settlements however wright 1982 found no correlation between any of the fecal indicators that he measured and salmonella spp fujioka and shizumura 1985 found that streams in hawaii had densities of fecal colifoms and fecal streptococci from 100 to 10000 cfu per 100 ml including those not known to be receiving contamination from any fecal source oluwande et al 1983 found that rivers in nigeria ccfu colony-forming units see hazen et al 1987  dufour 1986  found exclusively in the tropics hutchinson and ridgway 1977  and hawkins et al 1985  19871 dufour 1986  hutchinson and ridgway 1977  and hawkins et al 1985  had total coliform counts from 8 to 100000 cfu per 100 ml oluwande et al 1983 also assumed that the high densities of fecal indicators meant that these waters were heavily contaminated with human feces even though their own data showed that densities of total coliforms were often higher upstream from known contamination sources thomson 1981 also found that salmonella spp in drinking water from wells in botswana were not correlated to densities of total coliforms fecal coliforms or e coli he observed that salmonella spp could be found in the complete absence of e coli or fecal coliforms and with either high or low densities of total coliforms lavoie and viens 1983 reported that 95 of the traditional water sources in the ivory coast west africa had unacceptably high densities of fecal coliforms 11421 cfu per 100 ml yet fewer than 55 of the positive total coliform isolates were actually e coli and fewer than 66 of the fc isolates were actually e coli lavoie 1983  however when he examined the feces of local inhabitants he found that 92 of the total coliform isolates were e coli and 89 of the fc isolates were e coli few if any of these studies have carefully examined and tested the underlying assumptions of the fecal-pathogen indicator being used bonde 1977 eloquently enumerated these criteria as follows 1 the indicator must be present whenever pathogens are present it must be present only when the presence of pathogenic organ-3 it must occur in much greater numbers than the pathogens 4 it must be more resistant to disinfectants and to aqueous envi-5 it must grow readily on relatively simple media 6 it must yield characteristic and simple reactions enabling as far as possible an unambiguous identification of the group or species it should preferably be randomly distributed in the sample to be tested its growth on artificial media must be largely independent of any other organism present in the late 1800s houston proposed the idea of using three groups of bacteria ie coliforms fecal streptococci and the gas-producing clostridia that are commonly found in the feces of warm-blooded animals as indicators of fecal pollution of waters hutchinson and ridgway 1977  he argued that since these groups could only come from fecal sources their presence would indicate recent fecal pollution hutchinson and ridgway 1977  for nearly 80 years the coliform group of bacteria has been used as such indicators the indicator used isms is an imminent danger ronments than the pathogens universally to access biological contamination of water is e  coli in both tropical and temperate countries barbaras 1986  the first drinking water regulation for microbial contamination in the united states was published in 1914 this was the first public health service drinking water standards regulation subsequently this regulation was replaced by the us public service acts of 1915 and 1962 the current us regulation comes from the safe drinking water act public law 93-5231974 the us environmental protection agency proposed changes that are now being implemented fed -era1 register 4845502-45521 october 1983 the law was approved in july 1986 and is currently in its first phase of implementation the new regulation requires that there be 0 coliforms100 ml by any method for any sampling frequency for drinking waters who barbaras 1986 only allows 10 coliforms100 ml for small community water sources for tropical nations and tropical parts of the united states even the old regulations may be unrealistic 4s observed in botswana thomson 1981 and sierra leone wright 319821 perez-rosas and hazen 1988  yersinia enterocolitica elias et al 19881  and aeromonus hydrophila were also found to be unrelated to densities of e coli in source water thus pathogens could be present in the absence of e  coli in tropical source water indeed it has been well demonstrated that high densities of enteric viruses a dominant cause of waterborne disease in both temperate and tropical areas may be found in the complete absence of fecal coliforms or e  coli berg and metcalf 1978  in nigeria oluwande et al 19831 hawaii fujioka and shizumura 1985  new guinea feachem 19741  puerto rico carrillo et al 19851 sierra leone wright 19821  and the ivory coast lavoie 1983  high densities of e  coli were found in the complete absence of any known fecal source ie no pathogens monitoring of puerto rican waters by the us geological survey reported that 54 out of 67 water sampling stations on rivers in puerto rico exceeded the recommended maximum contaminant levels mcl for recreational waters ie lo00 fecal coliforms per 100 ml during 1984 curtis et al 1984  thus only 19 of all sites sampled met the recommended mcl for recreational waters and none of these waters could meet raw source water standards 2 fecal coliforms per 100 ml these findings have resulted in condemnation of sewage treatment facilities in puerto rico as a source of fecal pollution of natural waters  yet sampling sites upstream from sewage treatment plants in puerto rico had fc densities that were just as high as most downstream sites even in temperate waters coliforms have been shown to have limitations using viable count media burlingame et al 1984 found bacterial interference with coliform colony green-metallic sheen production on membrane filters on m-endo medium american public health association apha 19851 by noncoliform pseudomonas ueruginosa and a hydrophila as well as coliform bacteria e coli and enterobacter cloacae means and olson 1981 reported the formation of products by noncoliforms antagonistic to the growth or biochemical activity of coliforms thus high densities of background bacteria typical of tropical waters could result in significant underestimation of coliform bacteria recent studies by xu et al 1982  colvrell et al 1985  baker et al 19831 and roszak et al 1984 have shown that enumeration by complex media like those used to grow e coli may not be reliable these studies have demonstrated that e coli and pathogens like salmonella enteridis and v  cholerue may be able to survive and remain pathogenic and yet be unculturable pagel et al 1982 compared four standard apha 1985 fc assays in various types of freshwaters in southern canada they found that while these assays were somewhat variable in their abilities to detect fecal coliforms from environmental samples they were all acceptable in terms of their specificity and selectivity in similar studies in our laboratory hazen et al 1987  using the same methodology to detect fecal coliforms from freshwaters in puerto rico we found that the specificity of the media determined by the ability of the medium to restrict growth of organisms other than the target bacterium was at least 20 less than the specificity claimed by the canadian investigators table 111  thus all the methods gave significantly higher false positive and false negative errors controls using known strains of e coli indicated the accuracy of the methods to be the same in both studies table 111  identification of more than 300 fc isolates from various freshwater sites around puerto rico showed that less than 40 of these isolates were actually e coli hazen et al 1987  similar studies using the same methods in the continental united states dufour et al 19811 south africa grabow et al 1981  canada pagel et al 1982  and england evison and james 1973 have demonstrated that more than 90 of fc positive isolates are identified as e coli wright 1982 found that in sierra leone waters fewer than 10 of the positive isolates from fecal coliform assays were e coli lavoie 1983 found that less than 66 of the fc isolates from ivory coast well waters were actually e coli it is not surprising that the thermotolerant e coli encounters more mesophilic and thermotolerant background flora in the tropics given the higher and more constant temperatures and productivities santiago-mercado and hazen 1987 in puerto rico and jen and bell 1982 in singapore showed that high densities of mesophilic and thermophilic background flora in tropical source waters were significantly reducing the numbers of e coli on the standard fc media in general the microbial diversity of tropical waters is greater than temperate source water as are the floral and faunal communities in the watershed thus not only is there a greater array of autochthonous microorganisms but a greater array of allochthonous microbes and substances entering tropical waters from the surrounding milieu hill and h i  1982  barrel1 and roland 1979 showed that rainfall in gambia significantly increased bacterial densities in well water fujioka and shizumura 1985 also found that densities of all bacteria were significantly greater in hawaiian streams after a rainfall carrillo et al 1985 demonstrated that after a torrential rainfall even densities of total anaerobes in puerto rico stream water exceeded the most polluted temperate waters for total anaerobes daily et al 1981  thus the tropical background microbial flora environmental characteristics and survival and activity characteristics of allochthonous microbes are quite dissimilar from temperate waters gordon and fliermans 1978 demonstrated that e coli could survive for much longer periods of time in a temperate lake receiving thermal effluent thus environmental factors in the tropics might also significantly affect the recovery of fecal coliforms in environmental samples bigger 1937 first reported the growth of coliforms in tropical waters while in india ragavachari and iver 1939 showed that coliforms can survive for several months in natural tropical river waters in puerto rico carrillo et al 1985 l6pez-torres et al 1987 valdks-collazo et al 1987 hazen et al 1987 showed that e coli not only survived in rain forest streams but also grew table iv  once introduced e coli could remain andor become part of the normal flora under in situ conditions in a tropical rain forest y  enterocolitica elias et al 1988  k  pneumoniae l6pez-torres et al 19871 candida albicans valdks-collazo et al 1987  a  hydrophila hazen et al 1982  salmonella typhimurium jimenez et al 1988  and v cholerae perez-rosas 1983  were all shown to have different survival rates from e coli their indicator the inability of e coli to survive in a manner similar to pathogens would further impede its ability to indicate those pathogens a few temperate investigators have also suggested that coliforms are an inadequate index of water quality in temperate waters dutka 1973 evans et al 1981  temperate survival ofe coli in source waters has been shown under numerous circumstances to be only a matter of days with densities decreasing by more than 90 every 60 min bonde 1977  regrowth of e coli extraenterally in temperate areas has only been rarely observed bonde 1977  as seen in table iv e coli always survives significantly longer in situ in tropical waters as compared to temperate waters the increased survival of e coli in tropical waters alone suggests that temperate mcls based on fecal coliforms cannot be applied to tropical waters recent studies have shown that e coli can be isolated from pristine areas of tropical rain forests in puerto rico rivera et al 1988 bermudez and hazen 1988  plasmid profiles antibiotic sensitivities coliphage susceptibility and physiological and biochemical characteristics confirm that even e coli isolated from epiphytes in trees 15 m above the ground are very similar to clinical isolates of e  coli rivera et al 1988  these environmental isolates have identical mol g  c of the isolates dna and more than 85 dna homology with e coli b bermdez and hazen 1988  thus tropical source waters may not only have high densities of e coli in the absence of pathogens or fecal sources but e coli may be naturally occurring in some tropical areas this observation is further suggested by the high densities of e coli in diverse tropical countries in the absence of identifiable fecal sources escherichia coli the indicator used by most developed nations for determining biological contamination of source waters does not fit most of the underlying assumptions of a good indicator in tropical waters in fact only criteria 7 of bonde 1977 see above seems suitable for tropical waters it is not surprising therefore that developing nations in tropical areas are finding it difficult if not impossible to meet their own legislated standards for biological contamination since the problems with the fc assay are in part due to e coli being the target organism changes in media and incubation would not correct these problems for tropical systems coliphages have been suggested as being more specific and not subject to the cultivation problems of e coli berg and metcalf 1978  however since the host organism for these viruses is e  coli if e  coli survives and grows in tropical source water then likewise the viruses that infect coliforms would also survive and grow therefore coliphages would be no better than e coli their host in the tropics several investigations of tropical source water have looked at fs densities feachem 1974 found that streams in the new guinea highlands had densities of fecal streptococci from 0 to 6000 per 100 ml and the fcfs ratio ranged from 020 to 131 feachem interpreted these results to mean that these waters were 25 times more likely to be contaminated by pigs than humans based upon the studies of geldreich and kenner 1969  however if e coli is able to survive in these waters the ratio could be inflated because of their high densities the fecal streptococci would also seem to be indicating fecal contamination when none may be present wright 1982 found that source water in sierra leone had densities of fecal streptococci 7-64000 per 100 ml that were a n order of magnitude lower than densities of either fecal coliforms 40-240000 per 100 ml or presumptive e coli 30-120000 per 100 ml when fs positive isolates were identified wright 1982 found that anywhere from 14 to 100 were confirmed as streptococcus faecalis the target organism for the assay in addition wright 1982 could find no correlation between the incidence of salmonella spp in these source waters and the densities of fecal streptococci fujioka and shizumura 1985 also found 100-10000 cfu per 100 ml of fecal streptococci in streams in hawaii even though many of these streams were not known to have any fecal source of contamination densities of fecal streptococci in hawaiian streams were quite similar to densities of fecal coliforms studies in puerto rico have demonstrated that s faecalis can survive and remain active for long periods of time in diffusion chambers in a tropical rain forest stream muiiiz et al in preparation  even tropical marine waters with petroleum contamination could support high densities of s faecalis santo doming0 et al in press  monitoring of puerto rican waters by the us geological survey has shown that like fecal colifonns fecal streptococci exceeded recommended mcl for recreational waters more than 80 of the time curtis et al 1984  yet like fecal coliforms densities of fecal streptococci were only slightly lower and occasionally higher at sampling stations upstream from sewage treatment plants evison and james 1973 suggested that e  coli in feces from tropical countries is in much lower proportions to s  faecalis this would also invalidate the use of the fcfs ratio for determining the origin of the fecal contamination as would the higher survival rates of both e coli and s faecalis in the tropics although even fewer studies have been done in tropical water with the fecal streptococci than with fecal coliforms the fecal streptococci also only seem to satisfy one of bondes eight criteria for an ideal indicator evison and james 1975 suggested that bifidobacterium spp might be a more appropriate indicator for the tropics bifidobacteria are obligate anaerobes and thus could not grow in most extraenteral environments in addition they are always found in the human gut quite often in higher densities than e coli and yet are seldom found in other animals resnick and levin 1981  with the advent of the yn-6 medium resnick and levin 1981  bifidobacteria would seem to be an excellent candidate for fecal indicator in tropical source waters carrillo et al 1985 showed that bifidobacterium adolescentis decreased one order of magnitude each day during in situ exposure in a tropical rain forest stream in puerto rico gyllenberg et al 1960 and evison and james 1975 showed that densities of bifidobacteria were always greater than densities of e  coli in contaminated waters in temperate areas in a puerto rico rain forest densities of bifidobacteria were greater than e  coli at all sites except those at a sewage outfall carrillo et al 1985  in addition identification of isolates from the rain forest stream using the yn-6 medium showed that less than 80 were actually bifidobacteria bifidobacteria show promise as an indicator of recent fecal contamination in terms of lack of survival in situ and specificity as a human fecal indicator unfortunately the currently available medium for enumeration yn-6 is hampered by a lack of specificity and insufficient resolution when background bacterial densities are high carrillo et al 1985  clostridiurn perfringens has also been suggested as a suitable alternative indicator to fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci in tropical source waters fujioka and shizumura 1985  they found that in uncontaminated streams densities of c perfringens were from 0 to 46 cfu per 100 ml while discharge sites had from 56 to 2100 cfu per 100 ml fujioka and shizumura 1985 found that 91 of hawaiian isolates from mcp medium were confirmed as c perfringens this compares favorably to the temperate studies with c perfringens of bisson and cabelli 1980  however densities of c perfringens in human fecal material from the tropics are much lower than any of the previously mentioned indicators wright 19821 and this raises serious doubts as to the ability to easily detect c perfringens when pathogens are a n eminent danger carrillo et al 1985 found that sites receiving heavy rainfall had high densities of total anaerobes 500000 per 100 ml fujioka and shizumura 1985 made the observation that densities of c perfringens increased significantly in uncontaminated sites after rainfall this suggests that under some conditions c perfringens might have an extraenteral source wright 1982 found that source waters in sierra leone had densities of c perfringens from 40 to 1500 per 100 ml that they compared favorably with densities of fecal streptococci and like the fecal streptococci they were unrelated to the isolation of salmonella spp c perfringens seems to satisfy more of bondes criteria for an ideal indicator than the fecal coliforms or the fecal streptococci yet it falls short on at least three points because few other studies have reported the use of fecal indicators other than e  coli in tropical source water objective evaluations of the efficacy of these alternate indicators is difficult at present obligate anaerobes seem the best candidates for a better indicator for tropical source water primarily due to their inability to survive extraenterally however all of these indicators have the inherent difficulty that under some conditions they may survive and that the media used for their enumeration may allow false positive background flora in addition the viable but nonculturable phenomena reported for many pathogens in both temperate and tropical waters suggests that indicators may only rarely be correlated with disease risk in source waters colwell et al 1985 hazen et al 1987 l6pez-torres et al 1987  the best indicator may be no indicator ie directly enumerate selected resistant pathogens this would allow a more realistic estimation of health risk immunofluorescent staining can detect densities of pathogenic bacteria as low as 10 cells per ml a density that may give no culturable counts colwell et al 1985  nucleic acid probes can detect enteric viruses at densities as low as one virus particle per liter dna probes have also been developed for enterotoxigenic e coli bialkowska-habrzanska 1987 hill et al 1983 moseley et al 1982 and salmonella spp fitts et al 1983  thus direct enumeration of pathogens is currently possible common enteric pathogens that might be enumerated could be polio virus or salmonella typhimurium detection of either one of these in tropical source water would indicate risk of human disease instead of enumeration mcls could be based on detection only the public health of people living in the tropics and the economic development and respect of their countries in the world community is dependent upon a more suitable standard being developed for tropical source waters the currently used fc assays are unacceptable for indicating biological contamination of tropical source waters

goods fmcg are setting ambitious goals to shift to recycled content nestle for example is investing 152 bn to use 2 m tonnes of food-grade recycled polyolefins most of which will be obtained via chemical recycling by 2025 other packaging companies are also considering chemical recycling as a means to tackle the problem of plastic waste and achieve a circular economy for plastics chemical recycling makes it possible to convert plastic waste into new material with virgin-like properties and allows companies to get around the european food safety authority efsa requirements for traceability as part of the foodgrade approval process for food and packaging approval a viable solution is to recycle back to propylene or ethylene and to reprocess the material to virgin polymer this does not seem to be a problem for materials like polyethylene terephthalate pet which is primarily based on post-consumer plastic bottles however for polymers such as polyolefins in which postconsumer collection comes from various types of packaging waste including food packaging cosmetics and household and domestic cleaners chemical recycling presents a major challenge in fact it may take some time -at least 5-10 yearsbefore chemical recycling can evolve into an industrial scale technology this is mainly due to constraints in collection and sorting there is also the possibility that competition for post-consumer material such as polyolefins will intensify thus restricting their availability and sparking an increase in the price of waste and finished products with this scenario recyclers might shift to alternative materials  the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted chemical production in china amid the extension of the lunar new year holiday period and restrictions on

occasionally in full-term neonates 1  the etiologic roles of the infectious agents in this condition are not yet well established although nec has been reported in neonates during the course of bacterial viral and mycotic infections 2  in this paper we describe a full-term neonate who developed nec in the course of sepsis caused by streptococcus agalactiae to our knowledge nec has not been previously reported in association with this microorganism a female infant weighing 3300 g was born by forceps delivery after an uneventful 36-week gestation amniorrhexis occurred intrapartum and the amniotic fluid was clear apgar scores were 6 and 7 at 1 and 5 min respectively the infant had respiratory distress that started at birth and she was transferred to our hospital at 12 h of age examination on admission showed an ill-appearing cyanotic and poorly perfused newborn who had a blood pressure of 5336 mm hg a pulse of 195 beatsmin and respiratory rate of 84lmin the rectal temperature was 38c the infant had respiratory distress and auscultation revealed bilateral hypoventilation and tachycardia the liver was palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin she was hypotonic and hypoactive the anterior fontanelle was flat and there were no meningeal signs laboratory investigation included leukocyte count of 3100mm3 with 38 neutrophils 6 band forms and 56 lymphocytes hemoglobin was 167 gdl hematocrit 478 platelet count 197ooomn quick test 44 and partial thromboplastin time 68 set control 30 set blood urea was 43 mgdl and creatinine 1 mgdl arterial blood gases showed severe hypoxemia hypercapnia and mixed acidosis the urine antigen detection test was positive for group b streptococcus antigen a blood culture grew group b streptococcus the cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal and its culture was sterile culture of a vaginal swab from the mother yielded group b streptococcus a chest radiograph revealed a micronodular bilateral alveolar pattern bacterial sepsis was initially suspected and the patient was treated with ampicillin gentamicin dopamine dobutamine plasma therapy and mechanical ventilation umbilical artery and vein catheterizations were performed her condition initially improved but deteriorated again on day 3 and she developed a marked abdominal distention with signs of paralytic ileus an x ray examination of the abdomen at this time showed a large pneumoperitoneum after her thrombocytopenia was corrected a surgical intervention was carried out at laparotomy fecal material was found in the abdominal cavity and she had 40 cm of necrotic small bowel removal of this loop and a proximal end to distal side anastomosis were performed the surgi-cal pathology findings showed a congested small bowel with edema hemorrhage and ischemic necrosis and wall perforation compatible with necrotizing enterocolitis the patient had a complicated postoperative course with dehiscence of the sutures and outward fistulation on day 22 she underwent surgery again and resection of another 20 cm of necrotic small bowel was required after this procedure the patient had a favorable course with mild symptoms of short bowel syndrome nec mainly occurs in premature infants but has occasionally been reported in full-term neonates in most of these cases predisposing factors are usually present although our understanding of the pathogenesis of nec remains incomplete the disease seems to have a multifactorial basis 3 4 5  a role of infectious agents as factors or cofactors in the development of some cases of nec has been proposed albicans and glabrata 2  although 20 to 30 of patients with nec may have an associated bacteremia most likely this represents bacterial translocation through a previously injured intestinal mucosa rather than the primary initiating event 1 the speculation that a bacterial species can be the primary etiologic factor in the development of nec with secondary bacterial translocation fiom the bowel lumen resulting in septicemia has not been proven the patient that we describe had sepsis and pneumonia caused by group b streptococcus and had two main factors for the development of nec septic shock and umbilical catheterization both factors reproduce the ischemichypoxic state that decreases the mesen-teric blood flow and ultimately causes a hypoxic damage to the enteric mucosa we have not seen previous mention in the english literature of the association ofs agalactiae with nec therefore this report adds a new infectious agent to the list of those associated with this devastating gastrointestinal entity   detection of animal pathogens by using the polymerase chain reaction pcr  the   the development of polymerase chain reaction pcr has revolutionized the field of molecular biology the technique consists basically of the enzymatic synthesis of millions of copies of a target dna sequence saiki et al 1985  using a thermostable dna polymerase saiki et al 1988  and a succession of cycles that includes denatnration of the template dna hybridization of specific dna primers to the template and extension of the primers it is possible to generate multiple copies of the target region enzymatically thus pcr provides a method or obtaining large quantities of specific dna sequences from small amounts of dna including degraded dna samples the technolo has been extensively reviewed see for example ehrlich 1989 innis el al 1990 griffin  grittn 1994  although pcr is widely used in an increasing number of applications those in the area of microbiolo and diagnosis of infectious diseases have undergone outstanding advances in recent ears traditionally strategies for identifying 1090-0233970302x7-1912000 most microbial pathogens invohe isolation on selective agar media or cell cultures and the use of phenotypical tests but these techniques are usually slow and laborious the important cost that animal infectious diseases can have on national economies has therefore stimulated the search for faster moe sensitive and more specific methods to identid microbial pathogens many useful nucleic acid probes and immunological assays have been developed for diagnostic purposes but these techniques also have some deficiencies jones  bej 1994  the emergence of pcr however offers the potential to improve the laboratory-based diagnosis of pathogens mahbubani  bej 1994  althougla pcr has some shortcomings such as the problems caused by contaminants and inhibitors or the lack of suitable sequences for designing specific primers the outstanding research effort focused on tiffs technique together with the remarkable development of molecular biology have minimized the deficiencies and allowed its increased general use as a

to the beef and dai d industries of many countries fast and accurate detection of fmd outbreaks is needed to limit spread of the disease the virus consists of 60 copies of each of the four proteins vp1 to 4 of which vp1 is the main protein determining antigenic identig pcr systems for detecting fmdv have been developed by different laboratories meyer et al 1991 laor et al 1991 laor et al  1992

should enable fast implenlentation of control measures to minimize losses this is particularly important in the case of highly-contagious pathogens such as rpv and peste des petit ruminants pprv viruses they are at present confined to developing countries where they remain a constant threat to livestock rpv may infect all artio-dacls with cattle and buffaloes being the most susceptihle species while pprv specifically causes disease in small ruminants field diagnosis of classical rinderpest with its many indicative clinical signs is easy but those signs are not ahvays clearly seen particularly in countries where the disease is endemic diallo et al 1995  moreover some mild strains can fail to produce clinical signs unless the infected animals are stressed the situation is more complicated in small ruminants becanse they can be infected with rpv andor pprv and the disease produced by both viruses is similar the laboratory tests commolaly used are either expensive animal inoculation slow virus isolation or neutralization or insensitive agar gel immunodiffusion pcr can drastically improve the diagnosis chamberlain el al 1993 grouped different isolates of rpv combining pcr with sequencing studies using the same procedure barrett el al 1993 identified two different rpv strains in the same clinical sample and warmwayi el al 1995 showed that there was co-circulation of two different lineages of rpv in nigeria during the epizootics of the 1980s bvdv is another important pathogen of cattle causing considerable economic losses throughout the world three syndromes caused by bvdv have been described an acute gastroenteritis with severe diarrhoea mucosal disease and chronic infections of several weeks dnration in calves up to l-year-old persistently infected animals are the main source of infection to herdmates because they continually shed large quantities of virus in body secretions and excretions due to the obvious impact of bqv infections screening of animals must be carefully made and current methods of detection such as virus isolation or immunoassays either lack optimal sensitivity or rapidity for consistent and large scale testing in animal specimens radwan et al 1995  pcr however can readily detect bqv belak  ballagi-pordany 1991 brock 1991 hertig el al 1991 ward  misra 1991 hoft van iddekinge et al 1992 gruber el al 1994  and pcr analysis of hulk tank milk samples has provided a rapid and sensitive method to screen herds for the presence of the virus sensitive studies using reference strains of bvdv fi-om persistently infected carriers have shown that reverse transo-iption rt-pcr has greater sensitivity than other tests including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa horner el al 1995  unfortunately cost currently makes this technique unsuitahle for large-scale testing but it should be valuahle as a coniirmatm t test in cases where elisa resuhs are in the suspicious range or where the viral titre is low such as in batches of foetal bovine serum additionally it is possible to discriminate among different bvdv strains using pcr tajima el al 1995 and pcr-restriction fiagment length polymorphism rflp tests have demonstrated that 13 bqv isolates fiom ruminants on four different farms in sweden were herd-specific rather than speciesspecific and that the virus is readily transmitted between cattle and sheep paton et al 1995  bt is an arthropod-borne viral infection of rmninants caused by bluetongue virus btv clinically bt varies depending on factors such as population density and competence of the cullicoides sp vector the distribution of susceptible hosts and the virulence of the different serotypes of btv among ruminants only sheep are clinically affected while cattle are usually asymptomatic reservoirs pcr-based procedures have been developed for the diagnosis of btv gould el al 1989 dangler el al 1990 wade-evans et al 1991 mccoll  gould 1991 akita el al 1993 parsonson el al 1994  whole

wild runainants clinical signs and pathological changes caused by ehdv and btv are indistinguishable aradaib el al 1995 compared the value of pcr with virus isolation for the detection of ehdv in clinical samples taken fiom naturallyinfected deer and concluded that pcr assays for edhv can provide a diagnostic ahernative superior to the current cumbersome and timeconsunfing x4rus isolation procedures bovine immunodeficien o vimts bi9 bw is structurally and genetically related to human immunodeficiency virus hiv biv causes lymphoproliferative changes and enlargement of subcutaneous lymphatic nodules in cattle although infection by bw is widely prevalent in beef and dai d cattle there is no accurate diagnostic test for the virus using pcr nash et al 1995 detected biv-infected leucocytes in the blood and milk of biv-seropositive cows these data confirmed the presence of bw in milk and laighlighted the potential for lactogenic transmission of the virus suarez el al 1995

these viruses produce a similar clinical syndrome and the histological changes that they produce in the brains of affected sheep are indistinguishable moreover animals fiom affected flocks have antibodies that cross-react with the other viruses gonzalez et al 1987  sequencing of pcr products obtained from cdna of sse have permitted the location of specitic genetic markers for this flavmrus

is a worldwide multisystemic disease of domestic goats characterized by progressive arthritis leucoencephalomyelitis and mastitis although the virus persists for life infection of goats with cae is often subclinical isolation of cae is not attempted routinely as a diagnostic tool but pcr has recently been adapted for the detection of proviral dna in caev-infected cells from clinical specimens clavijo  thorsen 1995  the technique has a sensitivity which is several orders of magnitude higher than direct hybridization and may represent an important alternative procedure for identification of

detection of ppv thereby minimizing the risk of transmission of ppv to seronegatives recipients through embryo transfer gradil et al 1994  swine influenza swine influenza induces high morbidity and low mortality in pig populations throughout the world although the disease usually resolves infected pigs represent a substantial source of economical loss to the producer because of their weight loss and poor weight gain the results obtained by schorr et al 1994 proved that rt-pcr from nasal swabs specimens of pigs is significantly more sensitive than the techniques currently used such as the infectivity assay in embrionating chicken eggs porcine reproductive and respirato 7 syndrome prrs  the disease complex known as prrs has become an economically important health problem throughout europe and north america pcr has been used to confirm the presence of prrs genes in infected monolayers katz et al 1995  thus providing the first steps for the development of a pcr test to analyze prrs virus in clinical samples  prv is the aetiological agent of a major disease that has substantial economic impact in swine industry the disease is fatal to young pigs but in adults the infection is less severe and sometimes clinical signs are not apparent pigs surviving prv infection remain latently infected for life pcr has become the recommended method for evaluating prv latency reports from several laboratories have indicated that neuronal tissues and especially the trigeminal ganglia are the most reliable sources for detection of latent prv genome belak et al 1989 wheeler  osorio 1991 volz et al 1992 brockmeier et al 1993 but trigeminal ganglion assay can be performed only after death of the affected animal tonsil biopsy specimens can be obtained from live animals and used to amplify prv sequences by pcr chung 1995  prv has also been detected in the semen of boars guerin et al 1995  the method is simple and allows the detection of around 370 viral dna sequences per microlitre of sample prv infects cells of the lymphatic tissue and white blood cells of a variety of mammals these cells are also present in sausages and schunk  rziha 1994 established a pcr method specifically to detect prv in artificially contaminated sausages and showed that pcr was less affected by extreme ph values than tissue culture techniques usually employed to recover the virus other important swine virus that have been detected by pcr include hog cholera virus boye et al 1991 liu et al 1991 wirz et al 1993 and african swine fever virus steiger et al 1992  intensive breeding of poultry means that high populations often live in confined spaces under such conditions the entry of a virulent virus can cause high mortality and big economical losses rapid diagnostic tests are needed to minimize the consequences of viral outbreaks in these environmerits when compared with virus isolation and other classic techniques pcr is the method of choice for diagnosis of many poultry

present throughout mainland europe the variety and sevelity of clinical signs vary widely from inapparence to abortion and death a proportion of seropositive stallions shed the causal organism equine arteritis virus eav in their semen and play a primary role in its dissemination and perpetuation in the equine population therefore when a stallion is identified as eav positive the first priority is to ascertain whether virus is being shed before the animal is allowed to cover mares pcr is included among the three methods that may be used to establish the presence of virus in the semen chirnside  spaan 1990 horserace betting levy board 1993  equine herpesvirus pcr has been successfully applied to detect ehv 1 and 4 in aborted equine fetuses ballagi-pordany el al 1990 and in nasopharyngeal swab

fast and accurate detection of infected animals is of vital importance research resuhs have shown that pcr can play a remarkable role in the rapid sensitive and specific detection of the rabies virus ermine et al 1990 sacramento et al 1991 shankar el al 1991 kamolvarin et al 1993 mccoll et al 1993 and the technique should spread among the reference laboratories located in regions at risk canine pavovirus cpi9 cpv is the causative agent of haemorrhagic enteritis and myocarditis and at present is one of the most common pathogenic viuses causing diarrhoea in dogs cpv is not easily inactivated with the usual disinfectants and can survive more than 3 months once a hospital or kennel is contaminated often leading to secondary infections as a result it is important to have a rapid specific and sensitive method to distinguish infected flom uninfected dogs pcr assays based on vp1 and vp2 genes have been used to detect cpv in paraffin-embedded tissues truyen el al 1994 uwatoko el al 1995 and

infectious peritonitis vinls fipv  fipv causes a severe often fatal disease in domestic and wild cats despite considerable research no routine diagnostic method is available detection of fipv by nested pcr has been attempted egberink el al 1995 but the authors concluded that the value of pcr for the identification of sick animals and asymptomatic carriers needed to be further studied in their work a positive pcr in healthy animals failed to provide an absolutely definitive diagnosis of fip equally a negative pcr result from a sick animal did not completely exclude fip better results have been achieved in the pcr detection of active and latent feline herpesvirus 1 nunberg et al 1989 reubel et al 1993 and feline immunodeficiency virus rimstad  ueland 1992  morbillivius infections in marine mammals were first reported in 1988 and are known to be distributed among a wide spectrum of seals and cetaceans in the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea rt-pcr has revealed that there were no obvious links between the morbillivirus outbreak ill marine seals in northern europe in 1988 and that which occurred in freshwater seals in lake baikal in 1987 visser et al 1990 barrett et al 1992  direct sequencing of pcr products that included the haemagluttinin protein gene of the lake baikal seals isolate pdv-2 revealed that it was closely related to two isolates of cdv from germany but different from cdv vaccines currently used in the lake baikal region mamaev et al 1995  staphylococcal mastitis is an important problem in dairy farms several staphylococci mainly staphylococcus aureus strains cause acute and chronic mastiffs and can lead to gangrenous mastitis human handling of the udder or the milking machine is a potential source of staphylococci and contaminated milk can be the cause of foodborne intoxication in man rapid detection of staphylococci including those killed by heat treatment in suspected food could prevent foodborne staphylococcal gastroenteritis and differentiation of s aureus strains has been achieved by dna amplification fingerprinting saurnier et al 1993 van belkum et al 1993  although listelia monocytogenes infection may produce clinical syndromes of abortion and neonatal septicaemia encephalitis is most common in adult animals the clinical diagnosis of listeric encephalitis in ruminants is difficult because of the existence of a broad spectrum of central nervous system diseases with similar clinical symptoms in addition listeria can only rarely be cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid csf of affected animals because pcr is able to detect low numbers of bacteria it may be a tool for increasing the sensitivity of listeria detection in csf of ruminants peters et al 1995  it is also important to detect asymptomatic carriers because of the zoonotic nature of the infection during the last decade several outbreaks and single cases of human listeriosis have demonstrated that the disease is often transmitted by contaminated food jaton et al 1992 developed a sensitive nested pcr assay for the detection of l monoctogenes in human csf additionally pcr has confirmed its usefulness to detect specific strains in the epidemiological investigations of listeriosis ericsson et al 1995  anthrax is a fatal infection of humans and livestock that is caused by the gram-positive endospore-forming bacterium bacillus anthracis humans are infected primarily through contact with products derived fiom contaminated animals there is a growing need for methods to detect b anthracis spores and vegetative cells not only to prevent large-scale livestock destruction but also to protect humans that may come into contact with them pcr amplification of some b anthracis genes has already been reported carl el al 1992 turnbull el al 1992 hutson et al 1993 johns et al 1994 reif et al 1994  allowing the detection of even a single spore of b anthracis reif et al 1994  henderson et al 1994 examined the variation among isolates of b anthracis using restriction patterns and pcr and found that the b anthracis profiles were unique when compared with those of closely related species including b cereus b thuringiensis and b mycoides their results showed that isolates of b anthrads are ahnost completely homogeneous and distinct from other members of the b cereus group botulism is a severe foodborne disease caused by clostridium botulinum and is characterized by generalized flaccid paralysis botulinal neurotoxins produced by seven distinct serological tqoes of c botulinum are among the most potent biological substances known and neurotoxins a b c d e and f have all been implicated as causes of human andor animal disease the mouse bioassay is the established method for the detection of neurotoxin but alternatives to the use of animals for diagnostic purpose are ethically desirable and should be encouraged some immunological methods have been proposed but the use of dna-based techniques has not been extensively explored however some authors have confirmed that pcr has a great potential for the identification of botulism neurotoxin-producing strains szabo et al 1992 szabo et al  1993 fach et al 1995  and clearly demonstrated that pcr methods should be used for the development of highly sensitive and specific assays for organisms harbouring botulismneurotoxin genes closhfdium pfifngens enterotoxin genes have also been detected in stools without isolation of tile organism saitoet al 1992 fach et al 1993  although the isolates were fiom human foodpoisoning outbreaks or sporadic diarrhoeal cases c perfringens is also a well-known animal pathogen being the aetiological agent of haemorrhagic and necrotic enteritis thus the application of pcr should be desirable and appropriate in veterinal t laboratories a pcr assay has in fact been developed recently for the rapid detection of genes encoding c pefringens enterotoxins buogo et al 1995  and successfully applied in samples of small and large intestine from infected piglets enterotoxigenic eschenlchia coli etec is a major cause of diarrhoea in neonatal and postweaned calves lambs and piglets several fimbrial adhesins and enterotoxins are recognized as the virulence factors of etec the sequencing of the enterotoxins and fimbrial genes have made possible the application of nucleic acid-based methods for their detection harel et al 1991 woodward et al 1992  these methods have the advantage that they are readily applicable to a large number of isolates in contrast to classic methods such as agglutination infant mouse ligated swine intestine and cell culture assays pcr resuhs obtained in sweden by kennan et al 1995 showed that the gene for the major subtmit of f107 fimbria was present on approxiinately half of the strains not expressing k88 k99 987p and f41 fimbria isolated from piglets older than 1 week with diarrhoea this suggested that f107 fimbria are of major importance among etec strains causing post-weaning diarrhoea ojeniyi et al 1994 applied two different genotyping methods colony laybridization and pcr to detect enterotoxin verotoxin and fimbrial genes in 708 e coli strains from piglets with diarrhoea and the results were compared with those obtained by phenotypic methods the correlation between the genotypic and phenotypic resuhs was 977-100 detection of fimbrial and enterotoxin genes detected more pathogenic strains than the serotyping using a set of rabbit ok antisera using such techniques the verotoxin and the fimbrial f107 genes were found to be more frequent in post-weaning than in neonatal e coli strains and genotypic tests are becoming valuable tools in the identification of pathogenic e coli together with staphylococcal mastitis coliform mastitis is a major problem in dairy farms identification of e coli strains from cows with clinical mastitis can be accomplished by pcr amplification using repetitive extragenic palindromic rep and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus eric sequences such procedure has revealed that e coli strains isolated from repeated episodes of clinical mastitis in the same cow have similar genotypes lipman et al 1995  in western countries enterohaemorrhagic e coli ehec especially serotype o157h7 have become a major concern for human health ehec strains produce verocytotoxins and have been identified as causative agents of human diarrhoea haemorrhagic colitis hc haemolytic-uraemic syndrome hus and thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura ttp cattle seem to be the most important reservoir of ehec and although ehec can produce haemorrhagic colitis in calves many healthy animals are carriers the high levels of ehec carriage among young animals is of concern as meat may be a significant source of transmission from bovines to humans because verocytotoxin genes can be detected by pcr smith et al 1988 tyler et al 1991  this technique has become useful to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of ehec isolated from cattle herds with and without calf diarrhoea burnens et al 1995 found a 20 level of ehec carriage among cows but it was reassuring that no ehec were detected in milk samples enteric disease caused by infection with salmoneua is an important cause of morbidity in animals s enteritidis in particular is associated with human food-borne illness resulting from the consumption of contaminated poultry eggs or meat salmonellas are generally identified by microbiological culture of faeces tissue or body fluids although elisas may be used to identify salmonellas full identification still requires culture amplification of salmonella genes offers a specific and direct means of detection rahn et al 1992 widjojoatmodjo et al 1992 aabo et al 1993 cohen et al 1993

detection possible within 10-12h from the time of submission of samples although booster pcr is highly sensitive its cost is about twice that of a simple pcr reaction cohen et al 1995 described an alternative method using enrichment followed by a simple pcr reaction that enabled salmoneua to be detected in faeces within 24 h of submission of samples a quantitative method using a known quantity of competitor dna to quantify the numbers of sahnonellas in chicken faeces has also been developed mahon  lax 1995  but some problems with inhibitor substances have been reported comparison of pcr and microbiological cultures for the detection of salmonellas in drag-swabs from poultry houses have revealed that pcr is significantly more sensitive than culture for environmental monitoring cohen et al 1994c  y enterocolitica also causes food-borne human gastroenteritis with pigs implicated as the major reservoir for the pathogenic serotypes 03 08 and 09 detection of y enterocolitica often includes enrichment and biochemical confirmation but the whole process can take up to 3 weeks pcr can be successfully used for recognition of pathogenic y enterocolitica kapperud et a 1993 koeppel et al 1993 rasmussen et al 1994  and the best results are achieved if the bacteria are concentrated by immunomagnetic separation ims before pcr this approach has been used to detect y enterocolitica 03 in faecal samples and tonsil swabs from pigs rasmussen et al 1995 and the authors concluded that ims-pcr was a reliable method when used on pre-enriched medium enabling the detection of positive samples which are not recognized by traditional methods h pyrlori is a microaerophilic gram-negative spiral organism that has received great attention for its association with human gastritis peptic ulcers and even gastric cancer other species of the genus have been isolated from the gastric mucosa of animals and mostly associated with gastritis of the host because it has been suggested that some strains of helicobacter canis are capable of zoonotic transmission sensitive methods for their detection are needed and pcr has already been shown to be useful stanley et al 1993  clinical samples cousins et al

especially in temperate farming areas although hot rot results fiom a mixed bacterial infection dichelobacter nodosus has been shown to be the essential pathogen for the initiation and estahlishment of the disease clinical diagnostic methods currently available for foot rot are subjective and lack precision consequently there is a demand for rapid and precise tests to differentiate virulent

mycobacterium bovis the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle is a member of the tuberculosis complex a group of related species that includes mycobaclerium tuberculosis the major cause of human tuberculosis histological examinations enable rapid decisions to be made on suspect carcasses during meat inspection however agents other than m bovis can induce similar lesions and additionally the microscopic detection of acid-fast organisms can only detect bacteria in great concentrations laboratory culture of m bovis is sensitive but requires viable bacteria and the growth of this organism may take 6-8 weeks species identification procedures extend the reporting time even further tests based on pcr have been shown to be very promising for mycobacterial detection in leptospirosis is probably one of the worlds most widespread zoonoses rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis is important in view of the need for adequate early treatment clinically it is sufficient to know whether or not a patient is infected with pathogenic leptospires but epidemiologically it would be of considerable value if tile causative leptospira can be identified at the strain level serology does not contribute to early diagnosis as antibodies become detectable on approximately the seventh day of infection conventional methods to detect leptospires in blood are either unreliable or too slow to give early results pcr is a promising tool for early detection of leptospires in blood urine or csf in the period between the first appearance of clinical symptoms and the time when antibodies become detectable van eys et al 1989 gerritsen et al 1991 hookey 1992 merien et al 1992 gravekamp et al 1993  the genus borrelia contains several human and animal pathogens the aetiological agent of lyme disease is

it is well-known that ticks feed on deer species and using pcr kimura et al 1995 demonstrated the presence of b imrgdmfefi in the skin of naturally infected wild sika deer thus confirming the potential of deer as a source of transmission pcr data also support the notion that birds are partly responsible for the heterogeneous distribution of lyme disease borrelia spirochetes in europe ols6n et al 1995  zingg and lefebvre 1994 have developed a high-sensitive pcr assay for bonelia cm4aceae that does not cross-react with any other closely related spirochetes disease in chickens which results in reduced egg production and significant downgrading of carcasses at slaughter chlamydia psittaci includes a heterogeneous group of mammalian and avian isolates but at present there is no generally accepted and accessible method for typing these the major outermembrane protein momp is the most important antigen at the cell surface of chlamydia recently pcr-rflp analysis of the momp

infected with 1coplasma mycoides subsp mycoides infection can either remain apparently healthy or develop contagious bovine pleuropneumonia cbpp a disease characterized by respiratory problems post mortem findings should be followed by bacteriological culture of the organism from affected tissue which can take up to 2 weeks to complete the serological detection of antibodies is highly specific but asymptomatic animals in the early stages of infection and chronically-infected animals may not have detectable levels of antibodies bashiruddin et al 1994 described the use of pcr to detect specific dna in clinical material and isolates from outbreaks of cbpp in cattle and buffaloes in italy these data showed that pcr can identify the aetiological agent within 2 days of extraction of clinical material and the specificity of the pcr test to distinguish lvl subsp nqcoides from other subspecies was confirmed mcoplasma hyopneumoniae has been identified as the causative agent of mycoplasmal pneumonia in pigs because an effective vaccine is not currently available efforts to control the disease have focused on the elimination of sick animals unfortunately efforts have been hampered by difficulties in differentiating m hyopneumoniae fiom crossreacting mycoplasma flocculare and mycoplasma hyorhinis stemke et al 1994 developed a method for differentiation of those three

and patho-genesis of micro-organism infections in animals but is not yet used routinely for the diagnosis of any animal infectigus disease in fact pcr has become a routine tool only in research laboratories however infectious diseases will remain among the major areas for application of pcr detection and genotyping offering the potential to analyse most micro-organisnas of veterinary importance by a single technique although many systems have been developed few have proceeded towards field trials or large-scale clinical evaluation and pcr application to the routine analysis of biological salnples is still a major diagnostic challenge most of the assays to detect microorganisms have high sensitit t with purified dna samples but advances in sample preparation and detection of amplified products under field or clinical laboratol 3 conditions are needed in order to achieve high sensitivity with animal specimens diagnosis of viral diseases should be a major target for pcr application because laboratou tests tbr identification of viruses are either slow expensive or insensitive the technique has found large-scale application for the routine detection of human patlaogens such as hiv and hepatitis viruses among animal viral diseases pseudorabies equine viral arteritis bovine leukaemia and bovine viral diarrhoea are good candidates for early development the approach should also be focused on viral diseases that have a deep socioeconomic impact in endemic regions such as african swine fever or rinderpest eradication programmes must include the diagnosis of sick animals asymptomatic carriers and vectors and often involve the rapid screening of a large number of samples for which pcr would be vel t useful in relation to bacterial diseases pcr can be used for the rapid detection of those pathogens whose in vitro cultivation is difficult time-consuming or unavailable rflp patterns using pcramplified dna is an excellent method for bacterial typing and has already been used for the identification of the bacterial strains involved in human foodborne outbreaks hill 1996  parasitic infestations will probably be the last field of veterinal-y clinical diagnosis to incorporate pcr techniques partly because of the relative scarcity of important parasitic diseases in the main countries where pcr research is being developed weiss 1995  in conclusion pcr will most likely become the standard diagnostic test in situations where either the micro-organism level is low differentiation between morphologically identical organisms is required or whether the immune response to the infection is uninformative as happened with the progressive introduction of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa as routine diagnostic tools the existence of a strong demand for improved diagnosis methods will surely lead in the next decades to the development of pcrbased test kits suitable for field application   combatting bioterrorism dean wilkening a lester kurtz   historically attacks using biological agents are rare this is not surprising given the relative ineffectiveness of biological weapons as a military weapon due to the difficulty of infecting opposing forces the availability of protective clothing a simple mask will do in most cases prompt medical treatment for troops and the risk that the attackers troops may also become infected the centuries-old revulsion to killing people with poison or disease codified in the 1899 hague convention the 1925 geneva protocol and the 1972 biological and toxin weapons convention btwc is perhaps the best explanation for why we have not witnessed more deaths due to biological attack norms have a powerful albeit imperfect influence over human behavior finally with respect to terrorist use the traditional view has been that terrorists want lots of people watching not lots of people dead to the extent this is true terrorists have little incentive to attack civilians indiscriminately because they would loose political support within their community and the attack would likely provoke a draconian response by the state to eliminate the group the question is whether this trend will continue there is reason for concern regarding bioterrorism because the knowledge materials and equipment to make biological weapons are spreading worldwide the incentives for states or terrorists to acquire and use such weapons may be increasing and civilians as well as agricultural sectors remain quite vulnerable to such attacks the knowledge materials and equipment to manufacture biological weapons are spreading due to advances in biomedical technology the dual-use character of this technology the global nature of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and the pervasive access to knowledge through rapid global information sharing unlike nuclear weapons where 515 kg of fissile material is required to build a rudimentary fission bomb no such barrier exists for biological weapons in fact biological weapon proliferation is governed more by the spread of knowledge than the spread of material and equipment traditional biological agents can be found in the environment or in numerous unprotected strain collections around the world and large batches of bacteria or virus can be grown in simple fermenters former state biological programs represent another potential source of materials equipment and especially knowledge the remnants of the former soviet biological weapon program estimated by some accounts to have once employed over 50 000 scientists and technicians represents an avenue by which states or terrorists might acquire biological weapons without the painstaking research and development required to create them ab initio president yeltsin declared in 1992 that the former soviet biological weapon program had been dismantled and that biopreparat the civilian biomedical research organization that conducted much of the biological weapons research would be converted solely to peaceful pursuits due to a lack of transparency concerns remain that a covert biological weapons program may still exist in russia cuba iran north korea and syria are also believed by the us government to have biological weapon programs at various levels of development and south africa and iraq formerly had programs from which materials or expertise could leak in addition numerous countries have biological weapon defense programs which produce small quantities of pathogens for peaceful purposes eg testing prophylaxis efficacy which is allowed under the btwc from which knowledge or materials could also leak biological weapons of varying degrees of sophistication clearly are within a states means to acquire covertly the dual-use nature of the equipment and supplies make biological weapon programs easy to hide under the guise of legitimate biomedical activities only small quantities of pathogens are required for seed stocks and biological agents emit no detectable signal making them virtually impossible to detect remotely the fact that biological weapon facilities can be small and have no distinct physical features makes their identification difficult even with intrusive on-site inspections as the un special commission charged with locating and destroying iraqs weapons of mass destruction discovered after the 1991 iraq war it took the commission 4 years to locate most of iraqs biological weapon facilities and then only after kamel hussein divulged the scope of the secret iraqi program after defecting to jordan in 1995 finally legitimate peaceful activities such as vaccine and biopesticide production can be converted to biological weapon production within weeks to months it is less clear whether terrorists can acquire effective biological weapons without state support terrorists operating rudimentary laboratories face challenges obtaining lethal pathogen strains extending pathogen shelf life and in particular mastering the weaponization hurdles  agent drying stabilization and aerosolization ie creating a respirable aerosol of viable agent less than 5 m in diameter so it does not settle out of the atmosphere close to the release point and so it can penetrate the alveolar region of the lungs where pathogens are most infectious wet pathogen slurries are relatively easy to produce but difficult to disseminate in a 5-m aerosol dry powders can be ground to less than 5 m prior to dispersal although clumping and electrostatic charge can be a problem but dry agent is more difficult to produce and handle in a safe manner thus each path has its hurdles most terrorists lack the practical knowledge required to circumvent these hurdles even if they have trained microbiologists in their ranks unless they receive outside help aum shinrikyo failed to kill anyone with anthrax because they used a nonlethal vaccine stern strain in 1993 and attempts to aerosolize the spores failed this led the cult to carry out its more infamous sarin gas attack on the tokyo subway in 1995 of course terrorists may not strive for highly efficient weapons causing panic if not terror is possible even with a rudimentary biological weapon not only are the means for acquiring biological weapons spreading but the incentives to acquire and possibly use them are increasing as well the united states emerged from the cold war as the worlds unrivaled conventional military power while the collapse of the former soviet union left its allies to fend for themselves consequently opponents of the united states must search for asymmetric means  including possibly biological weapons  to counter us military might the suicide bombings in iraq and afghanistan are a current example of this approach terrorists incentives to use such weapons may be changing as well the 11 september 2001 attack in the united states and subsequent indiscriminant attacks in bali madrid beslan and london suggest that terrorists may wish to inflict mass casualties biological attacks can also devastate sectors of the us or world economy  an attractive goal to some terrorists still some constraints may exist for example terrorists may be reluctant to use contagious agents because the subsequent contagion might spread to their home country or social group which may have less access to public health they may also eschew biological attacks because the operation is more likely to fail preferring conventional explosives instead to divinely inspired perpetrators failure can be a deterrent because it suggests that god does not support their actions the vulnerability of civilian populations and agriculture may encourage bioterrorism while modern military forces are relatively invulnerable to biological attack civilians are quite vulnerable because they do not have protective clothing would not know when to put it on if they had it and they do not routinely receive prophylaxis against common biological warfare agents the agricultural sector in most countries is also vulnerable because farms animal pens animal feed and even finished agricultural products eg milk typically are not very secure against malevolent actors the sudden appearance of diseases such as foot and mouth disease bovine spongiform encephalitis wheat rust or similar plant or animal diseases can shut down an agricultural sector very quickly preventing exports if not domestic consumption as demonstrated by natural outbreaks of these diseases in the past the bioterrorism threat is complex and diverse biological weapons may be toxins or living pathogens they may target humans livestock or crops and hence be aimed at mass murder or economic impact pathogens may be lethal or nonlethal contagious or noncontagious and they may infect the host via contact with openings in the skin animal or insect vectors ingestion of contaminated food or water or inhalation giving rise to a wide range of delivery mechanisms and attack outcomes that vary by many orders of magnitude in terms of their consequences the current threat largely involves naturally occurring pathogens and toxins in many ways biological attacks are similar to the scourge of disease that has wrought havoc on human animal and plant populations for millennia the main difference being that the consequences are greatly compressed in time if not scope in the future genetically altered or synthetic pathogens may be possible because the science of genetic manipulation and dna synthesis is evolving rapidly this diversity of threats makes it difficult to comprehend bioterrorism as a singular phenomenon requiring a singular strategy the complexity of the bioterrorism threat suggests a multifaceted approach to simplify the remaining discussion this article focuses on the elements of a strategy for combating bioterrorism aimed at humans especially airborne releases because they have the potential for creating the greatest number of casualties the strategy for protecting the agricultural sector will have similar elements but requires a separate analysis the strategy for coping with any proliferation problem involves four complementary elements diplomacy deterrence preemption and defense diplomatic initiatives may help prevent the spread of proscribed weapons thereby eliminating the problem at its source if weapons proliferate deterrence may dissuade their use if deterrence is about to fail preemptive attacks may destroy the weapons before they can launch and if preemption is not a viable option active defenses may interdict weapons before they arrive and passive defenses may protect people from their effects after detonation this framework applies to any proliferation problem  nuclear biological chemical or ballistic missile all four elements are important with different emphasis depending on the nature of the proscribed weapon for example the cold war nuclear threat was principally addressed by deterrence complemented by diplomatic ie arms control efforts to circumscribe the threat and limited efforts at preemption and defense for biological weapons the main emphasis should be on defense complemented by diplomatic efforts preemption and deterrence diplomatic efforts to prevent the proliferation of biological weapons include the 1925 geneva protocol which bans the first use of biological and chemical weapons the 1972 btwc which bans the development production stockpiling acquisition and transfer of biological agents of types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic protective or other peaceful purposes and their means of delivery the australia group which coordinates the export control policies relating to chemical and biological weapons materials and equipment among the 40 or so member states and un security council resolution 1540 which calls upon states to refrain from providing any form of support to non-state actors that attempt to develop acquire manufacture possess transport transfer or use nuclear chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery to adopt and enforce domestic legislation to prevent non-state actors from engaging in these activities and to establish domestic controls to prevent such proliferation the fundamental problem with monitoring biological weapon proliferation is that biological agents material and equipment are quintessential dual use items making it difficult to separate benevolent from malevolent applications and covert biological weapon facilities have few unique signatures that would allow for identification without intrusive inspections even with intrusive inspections it can be difficult to identify covert facilities for this reason the btwc did not include any monitoring or verification provisions common to most arms control treaties because member states could not agree on inspection provisions this difficulty is compounded by the fact that the btwc allows states to acquire small quantities of pathogens for prophylactic and other peaceful purposes the difference between a small pathogen sample used to test antibiotics or vaccines and one used as seed stock in a biological weapon production facility is solely one of intent attempts during the 1990s to strengthen the btwc with an inspection protocol ended in 2001 when the bush administration withdrew its support arguing with some justification that covert biological weapon programs could easily be hidden even if this protocol entered into force that legitimate facilities could be converted to produce biological weapons in a short period of time weeks to months and that any inspection regime that was intrusive enough to detect covert programs could compromise proprietary information crucial to commercial companies similarly the australia group faces an enormous challenge distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate end uses for exported biological material and equipment at best export controls may impede large-scale acquisition or activities but it probably cannot thwart small-scale operations future diplomatic efforts should extend beyond traditional arms control treaties and export control regimes for example the usrussian cooperative threat reduction program which has focused principally on securing nuclear weapons materials and scientists in the former soviet union should be expanded to cover a wider range of former soviet biological weapon facilities and activities material protection accounting and control would help prevent the spread of pathogens equipment and materials and funding to employ key former soviet personnel on peaceful biomedical research would discourage them from selling their expertise to foreign bidders the latter is particularly important because biological weapon acquisition is largely an issue of acquiring the tacit knowledge as opposed to the equipment and materials to build such weapons an international code of conduct for biomedical researchers could help reinforce the norm against biological weapons development the promulgation of international standards and shared best practices for safety and security at pathogen collections or biocontainment facilities that work with deadly pathogens for example could reduce the risks associated with accidents or diversion and would help promote interaction among biomedical practitioners engaged in potentially dangerous research international association and collaboration among biologists medical professionals and public health practitioners would help address emerging infectious diseases and the transparency produced through such collaborations would have as a collateral benefit the potential to detect covert activities the soviet biological weapons program would have been more difficult to conceal had there been international collaboration with soviet biologists medical and public health practitioners during the cold war detecting covert biological weapon activities increasingly will be a matter of detecting the people involved not the weapons improving international disease surveillance specifically improving public health laboratories in less-developed countries and their connectivity to the international health community is a worthy objective that also has security benefits if an attack with a contagious agent occurs in a foreign country the sooner this is detected the better governments will be able to limit its entry into their state by monitoring borders and ports of entry and restricting travel improved international disease surveillance might also detect the presence of covert biological weapon programs in the event of an accident that infects the local population the 1979 accidental anthrax release in sverdlovsk russia would have been readily detected if such a surveillance system were in place at that time of course hiding covert programs as well as avoiding political embarrassment from natural disease outbreaks is precisely why some states will resist disease surveillance that is not under their control still efforts by the world health organization who to implement the global outbreak alert and response network are well placed and the recently revised who international health regulations which require reporting of any disease of international public health concern within 24 hours when fully implemented will have public health and security benefits for all nations these efforts need sustained diplomatic and financial backing ultimately governments must recognize that the spread of disease does not respect international boundaries hence public health is not solely a sovereign issue especially in an age of rapid international travel and commodity transport however diplomacy alone ultimately cannot prevent the spread of biological weapons revelations about the size and scope of the covert soviet biological weapons program during the cold war much of which existed under the guise of legitimate biomedical research demonstrates the limited utility of diplomatic means diplomacys greatest benefit may be to reinforce the widely held norm against the use of disease as a weapon of war or terror reinforcing this norm is important not because one hopes to convince malevolent actors to abide by the norms to which the status quo powers adhere but rather for deterrence it convinces malevolent actors of the sincerity with which the united states and other like-minded states abhor biological weapons and hence the resolve with which they will respond if attacked despite the best diplomatic efforts biological weapons may still spread the question then becomes whether states can dissuade other states or terrorists from using them the efficacy of deterrence against rogue states or terrorists has been questioned because their leaders are believed to be irrational and hence cannot be dissuaded by retaliatory threats this argument distorts the character of regional leaders authoritarian leaders may be ruthless unsavory characters with little regard for their civilian population however generally they are not suicidal similarly terrorist groups often have clear strategic and tactical goals with an infrastructure that supports their operations logistically and financially while those who carry out acts of terror may be suicidal the top- and mid-level leadership frequently is not therefore in principle one may be able to identify targets against which retribution will dissuade some terrorist groups from acting in practice this often is more difficult especially if one wants to avoid civilian casualties effective deterrence depends upon the ability to identify the perpetrator of an attack therefore attribution especially against terrorists or state-sponsored terrorists is crucial for effective deterrence by holding states responsible for terrorists who acquire material from them states will have greater incentive to secure any biological agents they might possess and they will be more reluctant to provide them to terrorist groups with whom they sympathize unauthorized acquisition is a problem and will be the obvious cover for any state that contributes to a terrorists biological weapon capability un security council resolution 1540 notwithstanding deterrence relies upon clearly communicated credible retaliatory threats whose consequences outweigh any benefits the attacker might hope to gain credibility in turn depends on a states capability and resolve to retaliate public commitment to the geneva protocol the bwtc and un resolution 1540 helps convey resolve in conjunction with statements by top government officials however states often lack the capability to respond in part because they lack biological weapons themselves with which to make tit for tat retaliatory threats nuclear threats for those states that can make them are less credible because they require nuclear first use  a difficult politicalstrategic decision under any circumstances the united states may be alone in having sufficient conventional military power with which to threaten retaliation for example to topple the regime that aided or carried out the attack although nuclear response options cannot be ruled out the united states clearly should emphasize conventional military capabilities to deter biological attack such threats may help deter biological attacks by states but they are bound to be less effective than deterrence of nuclear attacks during the cold war deterring terrorists may have common elements with deterring states assuming one can locate enough of the top leadership and infrastructure that supports their operations however terrorists have less to lose so the cost-benefit calculus is more difficult to shift in the deterring states favor perhaps the best way to dissuade terrorists from attacking is to deny the success of the attack terrorists often are risk averse when it comes to the success of their mission preferring tactics techniques and targets that assure success dissuading an opponent by convincing him that his chances for success are slim is referred to as deterrence by denial however this terminology confounds deterrence with defense true defenses may divert an attack to less well defended targets or dissuade a terrorist group from attacking altogether because of the reduced chance of success however the objective of a defense is not to influence terrorist calculations but to protect the defender regardless of their calculations preemptive attacks that is thwarting an opponents ability to strike first when the threat is imminent by destroying his weapons before they can be launched is frequently practiced in conventional war and was considered by both the united states and the former soviet union with respect to nuclear war preemption will play less of a role against biological attacks because it is impractical  biological facilities and weapons are easy to conceal and even if located they are not easy to destroy without the risk of collateral damage whether this is from the radioactive fallout from a nuclear blast or the dispersal of pathogens due to their incomplete destruction in a conventional strike against terrorist attacks preemption certainly will be attempted if a state knows where biological weapons are located but again this is unlikely unless intelligence or law enforcement agencies get lucky efforts to improve intelligence on suspect groups or individuals are useful however there are no technical fixes in the offing that will allow intelligence agencies to improve their ability to detect covert biological weapon programs in the future better human intelligence is imperative therefore while states should be alert to the opportunity to preempt state or terrorist attacks it is impractical to rely upon preemption for coping with biological attacks because of the demands it places on accurate timely intelligence active defenses interdict weapons before they reach their targets interdiction frequently is cited as a preferred strategy against terrorists however interdiction is difficult against covert biological delivery because pathogens have no signature that allows one to detect them in transit on a person in luggage or in any other container moreover biological agents can be released in a myriad of ways complicating surveillance efforts again there are no clear fixes that will allow intelligence agencies to improve their ability to determine who when where and how a biological attack might occur therefore interdiction programs like the proliferation security initiative  a us effort to create international agreements and partnerships with other countries to allow the united states and its allies to board airplanes or ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction or their components  may have some deterrent role but without accurate and timely intelligence it will likely be of limited effectiveness against biological threats unlike chemical nuclear or ballistic missile threats where the cargo is easier to detect examples of efforts to improve border and transportation security in the united states either focus on identifying potential terrorists eg the united states visitor and immigrant status indicator technology us-visit program or dangerous cargo eg advance electronic cargo manifests the container security initiative and the customs-trade partnership against terrorism program screening travelers at ports of entry is useful because it potentially detects malevolent actors not their weapons screening cargo is much less useful for biological threats because again biological agents emit no detectable signature not surprisingly most cargo screening efforts focus on detecting nuclear or radiological materials traditional forms of defense such as air and ballistic missile defense will be of limited use against bioterrorism attacks air defenses can be effective provided air defense networks are alerted to the attack but covert air delivery using a commercial or private airplane will be very difficult to detect without prior intelligence ballistic missile defenses are of limited use because terrorists are unlikely to have ballistic missiles at their disposal except possibly very short-range missiles or rockets against the latter defenses such as patriot advanced capability-3 pac-3 interceptors or the mobile tactical high energy laser mthel may have some utility assuming they can prove their effectiveness on the test range against biological weapon attacks by a state ballistic missile defenses also will be of limited value because biological submunitions released early in flight a technology the united states and the former soviet union mastered in the 1950s can easily overwhelm missile defenses inhalation is the most infectious method of exposure for biological agents therefore a simple mask can provide considerable protection if one knows when to don it standard inexpensive n95 or n99 masks filter out 95 or 99 respectively of the submicron particles from inhaled air thereby substantially reducing the inhaled dose their use for example would substantially reduce the scale of an epidemic if donned immediately after a contagious disease outbreak is detected thus increasing the effectiveness of any medical response because it could focus on a smaller infected population in principle homes could be outfitted with high-efficiency particle hepa filters although this would require substantial modifications to most home heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems and would require positive overpressure systems to prevent infiltration through cracks however hermetically sealed office buildings frequently have hepa filters and positive overpressure hvac systems making it easier to harden such buildings if they are likely targets of attack or if they perform critical functions in the midst of an emergency despite the simplicity and relatively low cost associated with most physical protection schemes they all suffer from the fact that to be effective protection must either be in place at all times eg hermetically sealed office buildings or individuals must know when to seek shelter or don masks the latter relies upon adequate warning and the ready availability of shelters and masks both of which currently are not available in most countries during the 1991 iraq war most israeli citizens carried gas masks which they donned each time their ballistic missile surveillance system warned of an incoming iraqi scud missile attack however most countries do not have such plans or provisions and in any case at best they work only in war and not against covert bioterror attacks in peacetime preattack vaccination conceptually is the simplest approach to preventing disease from a biological attack this is the approach taken for most infectious diseases of public health concern for example almost all children in the united states are vaccinated against polio measles mumps rubella pertusses and varicella and large segments of the population who may be at risk are vaccinated against pneumococcal infection hepatitus a hepatitus b tetanus and influenza the reason this approach has not been widely adopted as a defense against bioterrorism is twofold first unlike mother nature terrorists are strategic opponents when it becomes known that a population has been vaccinated against specific pathogens terrorists will choose an alternate pathogen or if sufficiently sophisticated they may design the pathogen to circumvent the vaccine second some vaccines have serious medical side effects in a very small percentage of cases vaccinating the entire population prior to an attack could produce several hundred severe reactions possibly including death and hence is an option of which political leaders will be chary unless the threat of attack is imminent which as noted above will be difficult to determine postattack medical prophylaxis on the other hand does not suffer from this political liability and hence is the preferred strategy assuming it can be effective if however postattack medical intervention is not effective against some pathogen or if the threat of attack from a particular pathogen is a clear and present danger then a case can be made for preattack vaccination against this particular agent assuming the vaccine exists otherwise preattack vaccination is contraindicated until safer vaccines become available all biological agents with the exception of toxins incubate in their hosts for a period of days to weeks depending on the pathogen and the dose to which the individual is exposed moreover medical intervention  antibiotics and vaccines in the case of bacterial agents and antiviral drugs and vaccines in the case of viral agents  can be very effective if administered prior to the development of symptoms in the host or shortly thereafter under some circumstances therefore a window exists inside of which medical intervention can be very effective at saving lives this is the basis for the most important element of a biodefense strategy namely rapid postattack medical response postattack medical response involves three elements biological agent detection and identification medical logistics to deliver supplies to the exposed population and a prophylaxis campaign that can dispense the appropriate medications to the entire exposed population in a short period of time including to a potentially large number of people who believe they have been exposed but are not all three steps must occur before too many people become symptomatic if this strategy is to provide a high degree of protection the incubation period for a given disease sets the timescale on which these activities must occur the medical efficacy of postattack antibiotic treatment against inhalation anthrax for example is illustrated in figure 1 which plots the percentage of hypothetical victims that can be saved as a function of the time at which medical intervention begins the airborne anthrax release upon which this calculation is based is one for which the exposed population is approximately 300 000 people 8000 of which would become infected in the absence of medical treatment the medical intervention posited here consists of antibiotic distribution to 95 of the exposed population over a period of 48 hours possibly followed by vaccination that antibiotic treatment prior to the onset of symptoms is 98 effective and that postsymptomatic antibiotic treatment is approximately 50 effective if delivered within 4 days of symptom onset assuming intensive medical care is available of the sort provided to the victims of the fall 2001 us anthrax letter attacks ie multidrug regimens and pleural fluid drainage different curves are required for different attack sizes and different diseases and in the case of contagious diseases one must account for secondary transmission from figure 1 one observes that over 90 of this exposed population can be saved if treatment begins within 3 days after exposure the maximum medical efficacy asymptotes at 93 due to assumptions embedded in the model clearly the sooner one can provide prophylaxis to the exposed population the better as the detection and identification time is reduced more time is available to implement the medical response and some functions can overlap in time for example the logistics associated with activating the strategic national stockpile warehouses in the united states that currently store medical supplies for a massive infectious outbreak and setting up and staffing the points of distribution pods where people will eventually queue up to receive treatment can occur simultaneously and immediately after an attack is detected but before the agent has been identified
 this figure should be interpreted with care because it is based on optimistic assumptions given current us preparedness regarding the detection time the speed with which medical logistics can deliver antibiotics to the pods within the affected area the speed with which queues can be processed at these pods and the effectiveness of the prophylaxis regime eg certain medications may be contraindicated for some subpopulations such as children pregnant women and immuno-compromised individuals and other victims may not comply with the entire prophylaxis regimen but figure 1 does represent the level of protection that in principle can be achieved moreover a 90 effective medical response against an attack that hypothetically infects 8000 people still leaves 800 people infected which in the case of inhalation anthrax implies close to 800 deaths a horrific outcome compared to any bioterrorism witnessed to date this will likely be viewed as an unacceptable outcome thus the tendency will be to strive for medical effectiveness well above 90 to achieve levels of protection above 90 it will be very important to implement policies that reduce the percentage of people who do not receive prophylaxis assumed to be 5 of the exposed population in figure 1 or that do not adhere to the full antibiotic regimen over time  both of which are important social as opposed to technical challenges for a prophylaxis campaign finally it is important to note that this strategy overlaps with efforts to improve public health consequently some of the cost for biodefense will have benefits even if an attack never occurs given the low albeit uncertain likelihood of a biological attack emphasizing those biodefense programs and activities that have substantial public health benefits is a prudent way to proceed although some important biodefense programs will not meet this criterion eg developing an improved smallpox vaccine moreover given that infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in many developing countries a strategy for coping with bioterrorism that does not address the legitimate public health concerns of the developing world will gain little sympathy support or cooperation contrariwise the developed world stands to gain tremendous good will if it helps the governments of developing countries solve their public health problems  a commodity not irrelevant in the global struggle against terrorism two issues are important with respect to detecting a bioterrorism event low false alarm rate and speed false alarms quickly erode confidence in any detection system not to mention their economic costs and consequently should be very infrequent eg on the order of one per decade for a given facility or urban area being monitored the false positive rate depends on the detection technology the detection threshold lower thresholds give more false positives and background biological aerosol levels in the environment that cannot readily be discriminated from the agents one wishes to detect as a rule using two or more different detection technologies with uncorrelated noise and background signals reduces the false alarm rate considerably these detection methods can be sequenced in time to reduce cost with the first detector cueing the second however this increases the detection time rapid agent detection and identification is important because medical treatment is most effective if delivered prior to a victim becoming symptomatic prophylaxis efficacy drops rapidly after symptoms appear and intensive supportive care is required to ward off death making medical intervention more burdensome and costly and hence less likely to reach as many people real-time detection is not required unless physical protection  donning masks or entering protected buildings  is part of the defensive strategy detection within 24 hours is a reasonable goal for rapidly incubating diseases such as anthrax thus leaving 12 days to conduct an effective medical response for diseases that incubate more slowly eg smallpox or for contagious diseases where preventing secondary infections is an important part of preventing a widespread epidemic slower detection speeds are acceptable finally detailed dna analysis and trace element detection is important for forensic evidence however this can be collected and analyzed within days or weeks after an attack the us government has funded the development of a wide range of biological agent detectors they fall into two categories environmental sampling and detecting the host response to infection environmental sampling involves collecting air water food or swab samples and analyzing them for the presence of pathogens using antibody tests or matching dna sequences to known pathogens environmental sampling has the virtue that it can in principle be rapid on the order of a fraction of a day depending on how frequently samples are taken and it can be used to identify the pathogen though not necessarily whether the pathogen is virulent the us biowatch program which currently monitors the air in approximately 20 american cities for a range of pathogens is an example of this approach if a pathogen plume passes one of the biowatch air sampling stations in sufficient concentration it would be detected within approximately 1 day the disadvantage of environmental sampling is that a large number of sensors or air collection stations must be deployed to ensure that small releases are detected with high probability if intelligence is available mobile sensors can be deployed to the area of concern however without reliable intelligence the system costs become prohibitive if one wishes to monitor the air for small releases in hundreds of cities all the time finally such a sensor network provides little benefit to public health because it cannot detect contagious diseases of public health concern for example severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or influenza because the concentration of these microorganisms in the open environment is well below any detection threshold methods to detect the human response to infection currently involve clinical diagnosis and syndromic surveillance the data from which would be sent over a nationwide alerting network clinical diagnosis relies upon symptomatic patients visiting a physician or hospital emergency room not all symptomatic victims would seek medical care immediately because the early symptoms of diseases caused by biological agents are frequently similar to those for influenza  fever nonspecific cough congestion etc physician aids can improve differential diagnosis of the relatively uncommon diseases caused by biological warfare agents thus reducing the time for detection and identification however one must still wait for the first few victims to present which may take on the order of 12 days moreover laboratory cultures commonly used to confirm the infectious agent take an additional 12 days although antibody tests such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisa can reduce this to a fraction of a day if the test is conducted immediately therefore clinical diagnosis currently cannot warn of an attack within 24 hours syndromic surveillance systems monitor clinical reports pharmacy sales school absentee rates and other data to detect an above-normal rate of symptoms in a geographic area these systems for example biosense in the united states have detected unusual increases in local infection levels from natural outbreaks however they detect events only when the number of symptomatic cases rises above the background level which by definition is late for effective medial intervention in the event of a biological attack hence while syndromic surveillance systems may have public health benefits they cannot provide sufficient warning ie within 24 hours of a biological attack to implement a highly effective medical response veterinary and wild animal disease surveillance may detect disease among animal and bird populations before they become apparent in the human population as was the case with the west nile virus natural outbreak between 1999 and 2001 in the united states however monitoring animal disease outbreaks benefits public health more than defense against intentional attacks where exposure of animal and human populations would be simultaneous because the incubation period in animals and birds frequently is comparable to that in humans implying that animal disease detection is unlikely to precede the detection of zoonotic diseases in humans in any case rapid veterinary and wild animal disease detection and its integration with human disease surveillance systems has not occurred in the united states future research and development in the area of attack warning should emphasize improving the detection time for the hosts response to infection as opposed to environmental sampling because the latter will be expensive and have very limited benefits for public health automated laboratory testing for example using elisa techniques or dna chips can reduce detection and identification times to a few hours from the time samples enter the laboratory however clinical diagnosis still requires the presentation of symptomatic patients presymptomatic diagnostic techniques that detect the early host immune response to infection for example mrna transcription of the genes involved in the hosts immune response which begins within approximately 24 hours of exposure would be more useful assuming further research demonstrates that gene expression patterns are reliable fingerprints for the presence of a given pathogen or small class of pathogens such techniques could reduce the warning time to approximately 1 day assuming it is used routinely in hospitals and medical clinics by detecting asymptomatic victims who visit for other reasons presymptomatic diagnostic methods would have tremendous benefits for routine medical diagnosis of common infectious diseases and the resulting economies of scale will reduce their cost the united states currently can probably detect and correctly identify a bioterrorism event within approximately 4 days of the initial release by clinical diagnosis note however that it took 710 days to diagnose cases from the 2001 anthrax letter attacks including the time for blood culture confirmation diagnosis information would then be conveyed to the us center for disease control cdc via the public health information network in a matter of hours from most major urban areas although this network has not been fully implemented in the future the us national biosurveillance integration system is being designed to provide warning of disease outbreaks of natural or terrorist origin integrating food agriculture public health clinical diagnosis and syndromic surveillance and environmental sampling data the speed with which this system will be able to detect an outbreak will be constrained by the above-mentioned limits associated with the different detection methodologies again real-time detection is not required twenty-four hour warning should be sufficient to mount an effective medical response since medical prophylaxis should begin within approximately 48 hours of an atmospheric release in the case of anthrax a 24-hour detection capability would leave at least one day to implement medical logistics and to begin providing prophylaxis to a large number of exposed and worried citizens providing prophylaxis to a large number of people requires the delivery of large quantities of medical supplies to the exposed population the suggestion that people keep supplies of the necessary medications at home thus obviating the need for rapid distribution have been rejected because some people will take the medications inappropriately eg antibiotics when they have the flu they may take inappropriate doses a large selection of medications would be needed to protect against all possible biological agents and self-vaccination would not be possible consequently current us plans call for stockpiling the necessary medical supplies antibiotics antiviral drugs vaccines syringes intravenous supplies ventilators etc in central warehouses referred to collectively as the strategic national stockpile with the intent to rapidly dispense these supplies after an attack has been detected palletized push packs of medical supplies can be delivered to any local staging area in the united states by aircraft or truck within 12 hours of a decision to deploy them the greater challenge is to distribute these supplies from the local staging area to the pods where people queue up to receive medications these pods could be local schools fire stations or shopping malls but not hospitals hospitals should remain free from congestion to handle acute cases of victims who have passed into the symptomatic disease phase the united states has little hospital surge capacity due to managed healthcare however hospital surge capability is important only for those victims who need intensive care the principle challenge for effective medical response is to provide prophylaxis prior to the appearance of a large number of symptomatic cases if hospitals become overwhelmed with acute cases surge capacity is not the answer but rather more rapid and effective presymptomatic prophylaxis therefore pod surge capacity is more important in particular augmenting the personnel capable of servicing queues to increase pod throughput diagnostic techniques to triage noninfected individuals will greatly reduce the number of people requiring prophylaxis because the number of people concerned about exposure will exceed the actual number of people who become infected by a factor of 10 to 100 if not more the time it takes to transfer medical supplies from the local staging area to the pods depends on the time required to repackage supplies into smaller quantities and to transport them to individual pods most likely via small trucks efforts clearly should be made to minimize the extent to which repackaging is necessary helicopter backup may be required if roads are congested with people fleeing an exposed area depending on the size of the urban area several tens to several hundred pods will be required to minimize the time required to treat the exposed population local officials must identify suitable pod locations transportation and staff for each pod and exercise these logistics plans so they go smoothly in an emergency this is beginning to occur in the united states the prophylaxis campaign requires medically trained personnel to triage individuals according to their medical status and prescribe the appropriate prophylaxis regimen paperwork is required to track individuals and the mediations they receive and to provide information about the medications and possible side effects security personnel will be required to ensure order if detection occurs within 24 hours and it takes 12 hours to distribute supplies from the strategic national stockpile to local staging areas 12 hours to distribute supplies from there to the pods and 24 hours to set up the pods this can occur concurrently with stockpile dispersal then prophylaxis can begin within 48 hours of a release if 40 urban pods can process 500 people each per hour around the clock then such a rapid medical response can in principle provide prophylaxis to approximately 1 million people within 2 days thereby saving over 90 of a population exposed to anthrax according to figure 1 again these numbers do not reflect current capability but rather the level of protection that is possible with sufficient effort effective medical treatment depends on stockpiling the appropriate medications in sufficient quantity while antibiotics have an efficacy of approximately 98 for healthy individuals they may be contraindicated for certain subpopulations eg children pregnant women and immuno-suppressed individuals in the united states the immuno-suppressed population is growing due to cancer treatments human immunodeficiency virus hiv organ transplants and other medical interventions which is cause for some concern if a highly effective medical response is desired for all significant subpopulations vaccination is an effective defense against many infectious diseases however vaccines often take 34 weeks for primary seroconversion and may require one or more booster shots thereafter to achieve full protection consequently they are generally less effective for postattack prophylaxis unless antibiotic or antiviral drugs are available to control the disease until vaccination takes effect moreover vaccines do not exist for some biological agents and they do not exist in sufficient quantity for others because they are not routinely stockpiled for diseases that are not current public health concerns therefore research and development should focus on new broad spectrum antibiotics antiviral drugs and safe effective vaccines against known biological agents that can be administered to most segments of the population medical research in these areas will also have important benefits for public health as new treatments are discovered for emerging infectious diseases concern with antibiotic or antiviral resistant pathogens is best addressed by limiting the overuse of these drugs and by having multiple medications on hand that are effective against a given pathogen strain again highlighting the importance of medical research and development finally genetically engineered pathogens that have enhanced effects circumvent detection systems or circumvent medical countermeasures may become more widespread in the future however increasing the virulence of pathogens through genetic manipulation is not trivial notwithstanding the australian mousepox experiment nor would terrorists need to go to this trouble since natural pathogens are terrifying enough at the current time bioterrorism countermeasures should focus on naturally occurring pathogens however biotechnology is in its infancy and powerful discoveries lie ahead hence any defensive policy must strike a balance between developing countermeasures to current versus possible future pathogens research on new prophylactic drugs and vaccines should be carried out largely by private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies because they have the resources and the expertise to create new drugs with government sponsored financial incentives to encourage them to develop countermeasures that otherwise would be unprofitable the us bioshield act of 2004 and follow-on bioshield ii legislation currently under congressional review illustrate the kinds of incentives that may be effective for example tax credits patent extension and liability limitations debates have also surfaced about the wisdom of censorship in biomedical publications the world has a lot more to gain from improved public health than it stands to lose from bioterrorism by allowing unfettered access to scientific advances in biology and medicine thus censorship or classification schemes to keep certain information from malevolent actors should be carefully scrutinized with open access being the norm unless a clear and present danger exists this is the best hope for having the medical countermeasures available if and when the need arises while at the same time providing benefits to public health the us government has established the national advisory board for biosecurity a group of 25 biologists physicians and security experts from outside the government to help maintain the balance between scientific openness and preventing bioterrorism in addition to developing guidelines for research and publications in the life sciences they have helped draft a code of conduct for life science professionals and fostered international cooperation to help define these issues decontamination is required to prevent bioterrorism from becoming a threat to physical infrastructure by rendering buildings unusable for months or years because public officials cannot certify that they are safe for occupancy an effective decontamination policy must determine safe public exposure levels which depend on site use and individual susceptibility to infection little data exists on environmental background levels for common pathogens moreover the scientific debate regarding the effects of low-level exposure to pathogens may be as contentious as the low-level radiation debate therefore the seemingly simple question of how clean a site must be to ensure public safety will in fact be difficult to answer with existing scientific data answering this question should be the first priority for decontamination research pathogen levels will have to be monitored for months to years after an event which is both expensive and complicated by the fact that some detection techniques eg dna sequence matching do not distinguish living from dead pathogens in addition communicating the risks associated with residual contamination to the public in a credible way is vital to allay public anxiety and the economic consequences that flow from these fears this will be a nontrivial challenge for federal state and local authorities working in conjunction with the media postattack vaccination of the local population is an important adjunct to any decontamination strategy because vaccinated individuals can live safely with much higher residual contamination however not everyone can be vaccinated due to health risks and vaccinating all visitors to a contaminated area will be inconvenient decontamination strategies differ for outdoor and indoor contamination outdoor contamination can be partially removed by washing surfaces with water and in any case will decrease with time due to environmental degradation of the agent eg ultraviolet light reduces anthrax spore viability by 10- to 100-fold each day locating hot spots will be important but costly because all possible outdoor locations where pathogens might collect in quantity must be sampled initially and monitored thereafter outdoor chemical decontamination is expensive and therefore will be feasible only for areas on the order of a few square kilometers indoor contamination is a more serious problem because of the absence of ultraviolet light thus slowing environmental degradation and because of the amount of time people spend indoors thus increasing exposure indoor remediation can be very expensive as demonstrated by the experience with the hart senate office building and the brentwood postal facility after the 2001 us anthrax letter attacks the latter of which took 1 year at a cost of approximately 130 million to clean up moreover current decontamination chemicals eg chlorine dioxide methyl-formaldehyde para-formaldehyde methyl-bromide hydrogen peroxide and household bleach are corrosive carcinogenic andor toxic safer more effective decontaminants are an important area for research and development for example gaseous germination agents that cause anthrax spores to germinate whereupon the vegetative bacillus becomes much more vulnerable to environmental degradation combining advanced decontamination agents with high-efficiency particulate air hepa vacuuming could reduce the indoor decontamination problem to a manageable level especially when combined with vaccination of the local population ultimately a mixed decontamination strategy that takes advantage of environmental degradation washing chemical decontamination and vacuuming where appropriate should be able to render public areas usable but the cost may be quite high depending on the extent to which future decontamination technologies can avoid a repeat of the 2001 us anthrax decontamination experience the logic behind the belief that bioterrorism is a serious emerging threat is sound although reasonable people can disagree about its urgency moreover this threat is multifaceted and complex owing to the range of pathogens delivery modes and targets for attack substantial uncertainties exist in predicting the outcome of any hypothetical biological attack which implies that attack outcomes can look bleak or relatively benign depending on ones assumptions the tendency to focus on worst case scenarios which leads one to the conclusion that biological weapons are the poor mans nuclear weapon originate in part from exaggerations by those trying to move governments to action which may have the unintended consequence of convincing some that defense against bioterrorism is too hard and others that pathogens are an ideal weapon of terror hence states must develop a coherent strategy for combating bioterrorism at reasonable cost such a strategy involves diplomacy deterrence preemption and defense with the emphasis on defense arms control and export controls may constrain large-scale biological weapon programs more importantly they reinforce the norm against the acquisition or use of pathogens in war or as weapons of terror this helps reinforce deterrence which may be effective against states but is less likely to be effective against terrorist groups attribution will be crucial to deter states from aiding terrorist groups however neither diplomacy nor deterrence is sufficient alone or in combination to reduce the biological weapon threat to a satisfactory level in terms of limiting damage from such threats preemption attractive as the concept might be will be impractical because it relies on accurate timely intelligence interdiction of covert biological attacks also will be very difficult because one must detect the malevolent actors since one cannot detect the biological weapons themselves consequently the emphasis should be placed on passive defense which involves detecting the release of pathogens in a timely manner rapid postattack medical intervention and effective decontamination to restore contaminated areas to a usable state in principle postattack medical response can protect over 90 of an exposed population if pathogens can be detected within 1 day of their release medical logistics can deliver appropriate medical supplies to the exposed population within 1 day and a prophylaxis campaign can be mounted to treat the exposed population potentially numbering into the millions within 2 days while no state currently can claim to have such an effective defense in place except possibly against small outbreaks such a defense is possible moreover to the extent biodefense overlaps with efforts to improve public health the expenditures may be justified because resources are not wasted even if a biological attack

  nonpolar europe examining the causes and drivers behind the decline of ordering agents in europe hiski haukkala   for the past five centuries europe has been the veritable centre of the world at first the europeans developed the modern conceptions of statehood and international politics and then actively projected these innovations through the application of a standard of civilisation well beyond the continents boundaries bull and watson 1984 in the process an increasingly global international system was formed and it has been one where the europeans have continued to enjoy a pride of place the europeans have also been one of the main sources as well as beneficiaries of western international order since the end of the cold war it has rested on us primacy but it is a wider western phenomenon that has resulted in a liberal and rule-based world order ikenberry 2018 in europe it has been manifest in a concentric hegemonic order where the us global primacy and regionally preponderant security role through nato have been complemented by the european union eu that has assumed the position of a regional normative hegemon in its own right haukkala 2008 with a view of ordering the continent along essentially unipolar lines by envisaging a europe of concentric circles revolving around brussels aalto 2006 diez and whitman 2002 in europe the usa and the eu have formed a matryoshka hegemony deyermond 2009 of sorts that has sought to and largely succeeded in ordering the continent in a largely unified or at least complementary manner for many these developments have been welcome and benign unarguably europe has never been as stable and secure as it has been for the past three decades yet there are growing signs that this era is coming to an end on the global level the usa has entered a period of retrenchment with tensions increasing with the rapidly rising china allison 2017 under president donald trump it has also largely abdicated its global leadership role and the liberal rule-based international order is under an immense and growing strain srensen 2019 china together with russia and other smaller regional powers is challenging the current international order on the global level while staking their claims for regional spheres of influence this is visible also in europe where russia has for some time been making the case for a more equitable bipolar setting this process of contestation culminated in the ukraine conflict in 2014 that has resulted in a low-simmering conflict between the west and russia taking its cue from international relations ir debates about the effects of polarity the number of great powers on the evolution of international order for a chronological lineage see waltz 1979 kegley and raymond 1994 mearsheimer 2001 brooks and wohlforth 2008 monteiro 2014 this article poses the question whether europe is experiencing not only a period of normal geopolitical contestation but could it in fact be in a transition towards a state of affairs where it will become void of great powers capable of effectively ordering the continent let alone the wider world in a word is europe headed towards a period of nonpolarity and if so what would it entail for the future of cooperation stability and even security on the continent the article makes three main contributions firstly it links european studies with ir debates concerning polarity and the ongoing change in the structure of international politics it situates itself in the so-called third wave of hegemony studies ikenberry and nexon 2019 but concentrates on examining the unravelling of western hegemony in europe secondly it seeks to conceptually expand our understanding of great powerhood by introducing the notion of ordering agents the article seeks to add nuance to the extant literature that has largely simply assumed that great powers are always also capable of generating order instead the article draws attention to a whole gamut of prerequisites for successful ordering role in contemporary international politics moreover it is argued that these requirements are particularly salient in europe that is undoubtedly the most highly institutionalised region in the world diez and whitman 2002 thirdly the article presents an analytical narrative concerning the developments in europe during the post-cold war era it does so in two stages firstly recounting the story of western attempts at hegemonic ordering of europe and russias growing contestation of it and then moving on to analysing the main causes and drivers behind potential nonpolarity in europe the argument will be developed in four stages firstly the concepts of nonpolarity and great powerhood are introduced and refined with a view of introducing the concept of ordering agents secondly the roles that the usa the european union and russia have played in ordering europe during the post-cold war era are analysed thirdly the causes drivers and consequences of nonpolarity in europe are discussed finally the article concludes by pondering the question whether europe indeed is headed towards a period of nonpolarity and what that could entail for the future of the continent it ends with a policy relevant point by warning about the possible unintended consequences of current contestation and institutional atrophy in europe the article suggests that the current trajectory is not in the best interest of any party and engages in some normative argumentation by contending that in the twenty-first century a great power worthy of the name should be held to a higher standard in terms of providing building blocks for stability and order on both the regional and global levels than is currently the case often order is the norm in everyday life this is the case in our domestic societies where the monopoly on the legitimate use of violence enjoyed by the states ensures a hierarchical and at least most of the time also orderly conduct of our national politics the anarchical international system does not lend to a clear-cut hierarchy along the domestic lines but it is not entirely without order either that for the purposes of this article is defined as sub-systemwide structures and practicesinstitutions norms values and principlesthat govern and regulate the conduct of international politics in international politics order stems mainly from two sources see young 1989 8889 from which the following is taken it may emerge spontaneously generated by the hidden hand of international anarchy oran young has called these self-generated orders the classic example of which is the principle of balance of power that has at times been rather successful in moderating interstate conflict little 2014 yet for the purposes of this article and indeed the increasingly interdependent and global international system in which we find ourselves this is too rudimentary and in effect shallow conception of order therefore the other and arguably more important avenue for generating order is that of premeditated design in youngs terminology these imposed or negotiated orders require intentional agency on the part of key actors that take the lead or act in concert in generating upholding and at times modifying and even undoing orders there is nothing automatic in this latter type of order generation as it takes effort and the use of power to achieve in the final analysis it requires not only great power but great powers to generate and uphold an international order but being a great power is not in itself enough as one must also be both able to conduct the ordering role and willing to carry the associated burden therefore it is suggested in this article that order-generating great powers are a particular subset of the category that should be called ordering agents that are defined here as a great power that has the capacity ability and willingness to establish uphold and project sub-systemwide ordering structures and practicesinstitutions norms values and principlesand as a consequence to have intendeddesired ordering effects the essential building blocks of a successful ordering agent are summarised in table 1 let us begin with capacity this refers to power that is perhaps the most essential concept in the study of international politics baldwin 2002 177 it is also one of the most contested ones this is not the occasion to try to settle these debates suffice it to say that a multifaceted conception of power is called for the key question here pertains to the quantity and quality of power as well as its varying effects when employed in ordering the international according to waltz 1993 50 great powers require a whole spectrum of attributes size of population and territory resource endowment economic capability military strength political stability and competence traditionally the master variable has been military power which in an anarchic setting is the ultimate arbiter of conflicts between states yet it is possible to overstate its relevance especially in our global and interdependent world nye 2011 other forms of power ranging from economic to soft and normative play an increasingly important role baldwin 1989 nye 2004 manners 2002 it is also noteworthy that military power does not ensure reliable control over outcomes across the board of relevant issues in contemporary international politics states can employ strategies that offset military power differentials and they can have meaningful geopolitical effects despite not being fully credible peer competitors indeed an actor may have the power to affect the behaviour of others through disruptive forms of powerpower to avoid nonpreferred outcomes or simply acting as a spoilerwithout necessarily being fully able to coerce others into adopting a stance preferred by the actor also if military power is the hammer not every issue of consequence in contemporary international politics is a nail on the contrary there are plenty and perhaps even increasingly issues in the world today that cannot be solved nor necessarily even contained with the use of military power the question of climate change as well as other systemic risks such as pandemics is a case in point goldin and mariathasan 2016 the same applies to the disruptive forms of power as they do not generate collective capacity for problem-solving and governance therefore identifying the existence of great power capacity in the abstract is only the first step in the analysis without the ability to channel or translate that capacity into actual influence they remain only resources void of actual ordering effects see also srensen 2019 59 analysing power differentials is imperative yet it does not tell us anything about the quality of interaction and the nature of consequent contestation and ordering between the great powers the exercise of power is always an empirical issue it is an outcome of interaction and it cannot be deducted from power differentials alone regardless of how significant they may be arreguin-toft 2001 to gain a more nuanced view of the processes at play one can turn to the english school and the seminal work of hedley bull he was one of the first theorists who argued that an order is not merely a pattern that grows out of mechanical interaction between like units but it is an intentional and in the final analysis also inherently social process where the key actors take the lead in generating and upholding a particular conception of order that rests on a set of shared values norms and institutions bull 1995 for bull it was indeed the existence of shared institutions such as balance of power and international law that formed the basis of what he called international society but for him the common institutions represented something shared and universal halliday 1994 101 has pointed out how bulls international society is communitarian implying a group with shared values he also did not address the question of change but adopted a rather conservative stance advocating relative perpetuity in the constitution of the international society see friedner parrat 2017 in bulls reading norms values and institutions were static and by and large seen at the same time as both prerequisites for and in their operation beneficial to the existence of an international society the point is not that bull was entirely off the mark however international order always serves the interests of the wider international society but does so unevenly it is important to bear in mind anna leanders 2006 371 insightful words that an order is never neutral it always works to the advantage of some and to the at least potential disadvantage of others inviting us to ask whose international order we are talking about see also williams 2006 24 in this interpretation an international order does not only serve certain useful functions for the society at large but it also reflects the interests and ideas of certain key players of that society therefore an international order is never neutral nor is it necessarily an entirely voluntary exercise on the part of all its members a certain amount of co-optation and coercion at times perhaps even domination is to be expected the stance taken here is that when it comes to the question of order in international politics norms practices and institutions should be viewed as sites of contestation and struggle in the final analysis it is their content that reflects both the power and the ideas of those who are able to affect change in them wiener 2014 see also ikenberry and nexon 2019 wivel and paul 2019 in this reading a choice between power and ideas is a false dichotomy it is not either ideas or power but both that will be required to make sense of any given international order srensen 2008 although at times a single actoror a group of actors acting in concertmay be powerful enough to dictate the rules of the game on others brute strength alone is usually not enough to recalibrate international order all these point towards the role of intentional agency order does not change by itself but it is changed by wilful actors who are able to affect that change nor does an order sustain itself on its own but it requires agents that seek to uphold it this refers to the third variable in our definition namely the willingness to act as an ordering agent and to carry the associated burden here ikenberrys 2001 treatment of international order as a process where the leading states has sought to lock other states into a certain set of institutionalised practices is a useful starting point in addition order has always entailed a viable domestic model and the projection of its essential elements beyond borders to generate that very order this is the case in two different respects firstly a viable domestic model is a prerequisite for effective agency you can only function as an ordering agent internationally if you first function to a satisfactory degree internally secondly the reconstitution of an international order must also rely on legitimacy of the actors involved and the normative foundation promoted cf hoffmann 1990 1920 philpott 2001 355356 in the words of georg srensen 2019 57 a stable and legitimate order is founded on a fit among a power base a common collective image of order expressed in values and norms and an appropriate set of institutions the last conceptual issue that needs to be discussed in this context deals with the relationship between great power politics and polarity ie the number of great powers in any given international system waltz 1979 72 power is obviously the key consideration in deciphering the number of great power poles to count as one their relative capabilities must be roughly commensurate across all domains with the most powerful state in the world according to kegley and raymond 1994 75 in a bi-multipolar system great powers must be near but not necessarily absolute equals the number of poles has varied historically but in general multipolaritythe existence of more than two poles in the systemhas been the norm see kegley and raymond 1994 indeed the post-world war ii eras stand out in a sense that they witnessed first a period of intense rivalry between two superpowers locked into a bipolar setting during the cold war followed by the period of unipolarity with the usa enjoying unrivalled primacy and hegemony during the post-cold war era monteiro 2014 brooks and wohlforth 2008 see table 2 for a summary of great powers in europe during the modern era table 2 shows how although polarity has varied historically the issue of nonpolarity has not arisen during the modern era at first sight the whole notion of nonpolarity might seem odd surely we are not anticipating the wholesale collapse of the state-centric international system and the disappearance of great powers with it1 to better understand how nonpolarity in the european context might be possible and perhaps even likely we must examine the question of polarity in light of our definition of ordering agents in its established usage the relationship between great powers and polarity is almost tautologicalgreat powers are poles and vice versa but for the present purposes this is not analytically very useful instead the article contends that polarity in its traditional reading is a birds-eye view of international politics based on resources and potential whereas a more useful analytical lens would take into account the other aspects of agency namely the ability and willingness to act as an ordering agent in the sense defined above this entails that to count as a pole the agent in question must be in possession of a host of attributes a material power base ideational foundation and perceived external legitimacy to begin with but also a political variable concerning the essential competence to act as an ordering agent in international politics and willingness to carry the associated burdens in light of this discussion we may define nonpolarity as the lack of great powers that are capable able and willing to act as ordering agents in a given international system or its sub-system the term nonpolarity was introduced by richard n haass who in his article written for foreign affairs over a decade ago defined it loosely as an international system characterised by too numerous centres with meaningful power haass 2008 see also bremmer 2012 who spoke about a g-0 world yet the use of the term in this article differs from haasss conception in two respects first it is regional in scope drawing attention to europe instead of overall global politics second it does not assume that power has drifted away to or been diffused by a host of nonstate actors to a degree that would account for nonpolarity on the contrary the article argues that the potential period of nonpolarity stems from changes that are taking place within the key actors at play their indigenous capacity and willingness to act as ordering agents are atrophying in addition nonpolarity is also an outcome generated by the current interaction and growing contestation between the main contenders for an ordering role in short nonpolarity is a situation where great powers are either incapable or unwilling either alone or in concert to apply power to successfully create or uphold an international order in europe the dissolution of the soviet union and the end of the cold war division opened geopolitical space in europe the rigid bipolar confrontation gave way to a much more fluid setting where fresh opportunities and challenges rapidly mushroomed this called for new policies on the part of both the usa and the emerging eu for the usa the four main objectives were 1 managing the transition to a new post-cold war order in a peaceful and orderly fashion 2 facilitating the emergence of russia as a successor state of the soviet union as a responsible and constructive player including the development of cooperative threat reduction with russia to deal with the toxic assets left behind by the soviet union 3 ensuring the primacy of natoand by extension also the usain european security and downplaying the eus potential to emerge as a fully independent security actor while 4 using that very eu as a proxy to organise political and economic integration and consequent transition in the emerging wider europe for a discussion concerning the key tenets of us policy see goldgeier and mcfaul 2003 talbott 2002 stent 2014 the usa took the lead in ordering the post-cold war setting along liberal lines first in europe and then increasingly also globally mearsheimer 2019 for quarter of a century the usa was able to secure an unrivalled position at the top of international hierarchy it was also successful in stabilising the conflicts in europe during the 1990s while locking most of the continent into its preferred security structure through the expansion of nato mastanduno 1997 even if russia made some dissatisfied noises at the time there was an expectation that it too could be successfully placated by offering moscow some privileged forms of partnership with the west and the usa in particular asmus 2002 the eus rise to prominence dovetailed these developments in the early 1990s it started to express ambitions and develop capacities for indigenous views about international affairs and to develop them into policies and actions on the world stage the adoption of the common foreign and security policy cfsp in the maastricht treaty of 1991 was of particular significance as it created fresh instruments for external action and institutionalised a cooperative culture that over time have resulted in impressive although perhaps needlessly cumbersome finesse and complexity in todays eu see keukeleire and delreux 2014 in the process the eu was effectively thrust into assuming a leading role in responding to the economic effects of the dissolving soviet empire the objectives of the nascent european foreign policy and those of the usa were largely compatible and even complementary to each other one way to characterise the role the two played in ordering europe is to think of matryoshka hegemony where the us global primacy and regionally preponderant security role through nato set the broad liberal framework within which the eu took the lead in ordering the european continent through the expansion and outward projection of its policies norms and values haukkala 2008 consequently the usa and the eu working in tandem met practically all the requirements for a successful ordering agent in europe they enjoyed unrivalled material preponderance while portraying both competence and political willingness to act as ordering agents they also promoted a coherent set of ideals and did so during a period when their leading role enjoyed a great deal of external legitimacy reflected in the long queues of accession candidates in front of both natos and the eus doors having established this one should exercise some caution in assigning too much strategic intentionality on the part of the west both natos and the eus eventual sprung nach osten were more reactions and responses to events and demands beyond the wests control or initial appetite rather than preconceived programmes to order or subjugate the whole continent to their will see asmus 2002 smith 1999 hill 2018 the hegemonic underpinnings of their ordering role were arrived at in a piecemeal almost haphazard manner this gives the western unipolar hegemony over europe a paradoxical quality to a degree this also explains why it fizzled out so quickly in the face of growing russian resistance for quite some time russia remained an outlier to the western attempts at ordering europe it was not fully in nor fully out while it was trying to figure out its own national interests and international identity in the process russia has developed an increasingly strained relationship with both the usa and the eu and adopted a highly belligerent approach towards the concentric order they have been propagating for the russians the crux of the issue was that it lacked a voice and a role that would have been commensurate with its own self-image as a great power one way to interpret the events during the last quarter century in europe is to view it as a process of increasing frictions and tensions between the western natoeu-centric attempts at ordering the continent and russias growing frustration and even hostility towards its inability to secure a place for itself that would have allowed it a voice and a veto marten 2017 in the words of hill 2018 in the eyes of moscow the european architecture has left no place for russia related to this is the wider russian complaint concerning the role the usa has played globally the us post-cold war primacy in general and the way washington responded to the 911 terrorist strikes in 2001 accentuated the russian impression of a rampant usa bent on dominating the world unilaterally in vladimir putins resentful words uttered already in 2007 the usa had overstepped its national borders in every way putin 2007 positioning itself as a counterforce to a reckless and domineering washington became the leitmotif of putins rhetoric and russian foreign policy well before the dramatic events in ukraine although not felt as keenly at the time the eu enlargement also created its own frictions between russia and the west in particular the question of a commonshared neighbourhood created in the aftermath of the big bang eastern enlargement of 2004 proved to be a source of tensions ukraines 2004 orange revolutionwhich took both the west and russia equally by surprisechanged moscows tack concerning the eus role in the region moscows previous benign neglect subsided as it began to view the eus growing role and the western orientation of the cis countries with increasing suspicion gretskiy et al 2014 although it was not appreciated at the time the orange revolution was the starting gun for the preparation of operations and practices witnessed first in georgia in 2008 and then in crimea and eastern ukraine since 2014 franke 2015 over time russias grudging acquiescence to western liberal hegemony morphed into outright opposition yet the current conflict between russia and the west was far from inevitable on the contrary in early 2000s both parties were still looking for ways to make the relationship work for accounts that testify to this effect see forsberg and haukkala 2016 stent 2014 these repeated attempts at resets and other fresh beginnings were marred by the underlying and largely irreconcilable tension where the western unipolarity however well intended ran counter to the growing russian calls for a more equitable and essentially bipolar setting in europe by the end of 2000s russia started to take much more assertive steps to promote its preferred vision of order beyond its borders in the first instance this took the form of the eurasian economic community eurasec that soon became the eurasian economic union eaeu through which russia started to invest in a more institutionalised bipolar setting in europe with moscow as the leading power in the other half of the continent with the expectation of attracting the majority if not all of the post-soviet states under russias leadership see dragneva and wolczuk 2013 although the eaeu did gain some initial momentum as exemplified by the expansion of its members from the original three to current five the fact that russia felt compelled to resort to open blackmail and coercion to attract new members to the eaeu speaks volumes about the power of attraction of the new regional bloc the conflict in ukraine was the culmination of these unhappy trends haukkala 2016 with its actions russia made abundantly clear that it views eastern europe as its primary sphere of interests trenin 2009 that both the eu and nato must respect and that it is willing to use all the means at its disposal to enforce this policy russia also signalled its readiness to pay a high price in terms of economic hardship and international although mainly western opprobrium for doing so menon and rumer 2015 wilson 2014 the reasons for this are myriad but the main point worth stressing is that the near-existential nature of russian interests in and over eastern europe creates an asymmetry that is unfavourable to the west no matter how hard it pushes its version of order on the east moscow is always willing to push back a little harderand accept the eventual price for doing so in other words russia has been stable able and ruthless enough to act as a spoiler in europe but apart from the eaeu that contains severe internal tensions and contradictions as exemplified by the catastrophic outcome of trying to co-opt ukraine to join the organisation in 201314 testified it is not competent capable or even willing to act as an ordering agent in europe on the contrary the dramatic escalation in ukraine in 2014 has been followed by a pattern where russia has proved ruthless in the application of power to challenge and to a degree overturn the current order on the regional level admittedly compared with the west russia is lacking in many of the key attributes of power its population is stagnating and its economy is weak and almost entirely reliant on the sale of hydrocarbons on increasingly turbulent world markets yet what it may suffer in the aggregate it amply makes up in the skill and will to employ the wherewithal at its disposal see baldwin 1979 163 when this is factored in russias record of accomplishment and indeed short- to midterm potential looks more promising russia has also shown great acumen in projecting military means to achieve political ends beyond its borders both in its immediate vicinity in ukraine and even beyond as the events in syria have shown this continued contestation is also a factor that feeds into the potential emergence of nonpolarity in europe discussed next to a degree the above narrative is compatible with traditional forms of ordering in international politics it is possible that the process we are currently witnessing is merely normal turbulence associated with a period of intense contestation that will be followed by the creation of a new or at least amended order in europe gilpin 1981 yet in recent years a myriad of factors and developments have warranted asking the question whether the notion of nonpolarity is in fact more applicable by examining the factors outlined in the definition of an above ordering agent we can see how the main contenders in europe portray varying drivers for the rapid decline in the current order and augur the possible emergence of nonpolarity on the continent to begin with one must note how the unified even if concentric western hegemony in europe is rapidly unravelling both the usa and the european union portray much less cohesion and ability to act in tandem as successful ordering agents than previously under trump the transatlantic partnership has experienced growing strains even signs of serious erosion the process is documented in brookings 2020 the trump administration views the eu and its institutions with hostility and its european allies with growing suspicion over time the europeans too have started to lose faith in their partnership with the americans the relations between the eu and the usa have atrophied with no meaningful dialogue or interaction currently taking place between brussels and washington consequently the ability of the two to coordinate their activities and channel their respective energies in the same direction has been lost as a result it is difficult to talk about western hegemony in europe anymore what is more the whole idea of a unified west is increasingly being questioned on both shores of the atlantic kimmage 2020 tcherneva 2018 this is a development that affects the european order negatively and has a major impact on the evolution of relations on the global level as well if the two former hegemons have found it hard to work together the same applies to their roles individually in europe in the us case the issue is not the wholesale atrophy in the capacity to act as an ordering agent no one is suggesting that in terms of overall capacity or competence the usa is completely lacking or that it lacks economic or military power but what it increasingly is lacking is the ability through the erosion of perceived legitimacy and the lack of essential willingness to uphold the current order globally and in europe this is due to the political variable that stems from the current period of soul-searching revolving around the perceived need to recalibrate the us global role and posture in light of the new era of great power competition that is seen as being in the offing the trump presidency has accentuated and aggravated these trends but he is not the root cause behind them kagan 2018 might be right in arguing that trump has struck a stake through the heart of the liberal world order but the problem is not just him the us role would be changing in any case in the short term a lot will depend on the presidential elections in november 2020 but even if trump is unseated it will most probably affect mainly the mood and atmospherics in transatlantic relations that can be significant but will not undo nor necessarily even repair the damage that stems from deep-seated structural factors and tensions between the usa and the eu polyakova and haddad 2019 turning to the eu we find it increasingly isolated alone and adrift essentially clinging to the vestiges of its preferred order globally and regionally without the necessary means to project or protect that very order the fact that the eu does not seriously register as a military power would seem to exclude from the list of possible poles yet it would be erroneous to discount it as an ordering agent economically the eu is still in a very strong position even if the problems of governing the european common currency cast a shadow on its prospects in addition waltzs 2000 31 verdict concerning the europeans two decades ago seems to hold the eu still lacks the organisational ability and the collective political will to translate its sizable power potential into credible international actorness moreover there are mounting signs that the eu is no longer acknowledged as a key player in global affairs if indeed it ever was on the contrary european perspectives are increasingly sidelined in global politics increasingly the eu is not the actor but the stage upon which others act the eus inability to project order or at least stymie growing instability is most visible around its own borders the european neighbourhood policy enp that was meant to result in a ring of friends around the eu effectively collapsed in the ukraine conflict the aftermath of the so-called arab spring resulted in the tragic civil war in syria and completed the current outcome that the economist dubbed a ring of fire around the union haukkala 2017 none of this to argue that these developments are primarily the eus faultbut to act as a successful ordering agent one needs to be able to project stability and not just protest instability around you internally the eus situation is equally precarious during the last decade it has repeatedly succumbed into crises that have sapped its energies and legitimacy even in the eyes of its own citizens wivel and wver 2018 at times it seems as if the europeans are facing growing problems in keeping even their own eu house in order as exemplified by brexit and the growing internal fissures concerning economic governance and the rule of law in europe krastev 2017 zielonka 2018 it should however be pointed out that we are not talking about the potential collapse of the eu itself yet there exists serious doubt whether and to what extent the eu can keep up its role as an ordering agent even among its own ranks let alone aspire to a successful ordering role externally the final contender russia demonstrates very few or perhaps not at all signs of playing a constructive ordering role in europe for the moment on the contrary it does not even aim to generate order elsewhere than at home and seems busy wielding a geopolitical wrecking ball to hasten the demise of the current order considering our definition for an ordering agent russia has fallen short during post-cold war era and even before as exemplified by the collapse of the soviet union and its empire currently it does not have the economic power base to act as an ordering agent nor does it offer any coherent alternative to the order it is criticising currently moscows actions do not add up to a positive agenda nor does it seem to aspire to one consequently the external appeal and legitimacy of russias agenda in europe is very limited taken together none of these attributes translate into a capacity to act as an ordering agent in the european setting this discussion is tentatively summarised in table 3 tentatively because to assess these findings with full confidence would obviously require more rigorous analysis that said it is nevertheless hoped that the thesis has enough prima facie plausibility so that it merits to be taken seriously and is subjected to more rigorous research and analysis in the future europe has entered a period of relative decline and its role and heft in global politics is rapidly shrinking there are deep structural forces at play and the diminution in europes importance is inevitable at the same time these developments are compounded by the fact that the very order undergirding europes own security and stability is deteriorating this article argues that this not only is due to normal geopolitical contestation but is a sign that europe is in danger of losing ordering agents ie great powers capable able and willing to create or sustain order on the continent the main driver behind these developments is the changing us power and role in europe under trump washington has lost its appetite to act as the bulwark of stability in europe this has resulted in the ongoing collapse of the matryoshka hegemony the previously complementary concentric us and eu ordering roles in europe to make matters worse the eu is not up to the task on its own and it seems the final contender for the ordering role in europe russia is not even interested in it in addition the internal trajectories within both the eu and russia point towards decreasing capacity for successful ordering agency therefore it is time to put forward the question whether the conflict between the west and russia is contributing to the relative decline of europe in world politics at large and whether the unintended consequence of this contestation could be hastening the arrival of a period of nonpolarity in europe with no power being able nor necessarily even willing to shoulder the responsibility of ordering and providing good stewardship in and over europe we have no historical track record of nonpolarity in the modern era yet we can surmise about its possible effects based on conceptual and empirical understandings of international politics it is argued that a period of nonpolarity would pose serious problems for two reasons firstly europe is living in an era of high and constantly rising interaction capacity that creates both demands and challenges in terms of coordination and cooperation buzan 1993 331 trade and other flows both legal and illicit as well as the increasingly important cyber space all require governance and joint management secondly we are living in an era of high complex interdependence keohane and nye 1977 that also includes mounting risks and challenges some of them potentially catastrophic even on a global scale ord 2020 handling these issues requires order and ordering agents order is the prerequisite for governance without which the risks inherent in our current world become very difficult practically impossible to control or contain the haphazard and uneven response to the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic is a case in point these are global trends but it is argued that in europe these issues are even more pertinent because for the last three decades and more europe has generated its own web of densely institutionalised forms of cooperation rules and regulations that require capable ordering agents for their continued existence russia might find some of these entanglements too close for comfort but it is argued they along with the us military overlay have been instrumental in keeping the peace on the continent a way to read the current situation is to envisage it as a dialectical process where the western thesis has now been fully countered by the russian antithesis the synthesis remains still to be seenbut it is not an easy one to locate or arrive at due to the essential incommensurability of current positions indeed the crux of the potential for nonpolarity in europe is the fact that currently no one can impose an order anymore while the sides are deeply divided and unable to agree on a new one one avenue forward might be a return to some form of a balance of power in europe yet the discrepancies between the various forms of power are probably too large to allow for that moreover the internal dynamics within the main potential ordering agents are such that the situation is unlikely to remain stable enough to allow for a sustainable recalibration of the european setting on the contrary a safer prognosis seems to be the continued and perhaps even expanding turbulence in europe over time the lack of good stewardship over europe will result in further erosion of norms and institutions generating growing friction and potential for conflict this means missed economic opportunities and increasing inability to work successfully together to tackle wider problems facing europe and the world more worryingly the hard-won gains of the past 80 years are at risk of being undone an open conflict between russia and the west cannot be excluded this should be a cause for concern and rallying call for more responsible policies and politics the emergence of a nonpolar europe cannot or should not be in anyones interest what is more in the twenty-first century a great power worthy of the name should be held to a higher standard in terms of providing building blocks for stability and order on both the regional and global levels than is currently the case this is not a new idea as brown 2004 has argued great powers simply due to the virtue of their size and importance have always been held to a higher standard than other powers in the final analysis the advent of possible nonpolarity in europe depends on political choices by the main protagonists indeed this article is not a prognosis that nonpolarity in europe is inevitable three questions in particular stand out that will affect the future developments 1 the evolution of the us role globally and in europe 2 the eus ability to overcome its current crises and to develop more robust forms of international actorness and 3 the future of russias conflict with the west as well as the evolution of its appetite to seek more constructive roles and openings in europe nonpolar europe can still be avoided by political choices and responsible policies by the main actors that foster the return of capable credible and committed ordering agents in europe  multi-patch epidemic models with general infectious periods guodong pang andtienne pardoux  we study multi-patch sir and seir models where individuals may migrate from one patch to another in either of the susceptible exposedlatent infectious and recovered states we assume that infections occur locally with a rate that depends on the patch as well as the state of the various groups of individuals in the patch and the infectious periods have a general distribution and do not change as individuals migrate from one patch to another the migration processes in either of the three states are assumed to be markovian and independent of the infectious periods the rates of migration from one patch to another may be different due to the population density and the manner of migration for example transportation we establish a functional law of large number flln and a function central limit theorem fclt for the susceptible exposedlatent infectious and recovered processes in the flln the limit is determined by a set of volterra integral equations in the special case of deterministic infectious periods the limit becomes an ode with delay in the fclt the limit is given by a set of stochastic volterra integral equations driven by a sum of brownian motion and a continuous gaussian processes of a particular covariance structure  multi-patch epidemic models have been used to study various infectious diseases for example nosocomial infection 20  vector-borne diseases 19  hivaids transmission 18  sars epidemic 22  and so on they are often used to capture the heterogeneity between different geographic locations for example a densely populated city and a less populated rural area it also helps to study the effect of migrations or lock-down measures among different population groups or locations in the covid-19 pandemic it has been observed that the infectivity in different regions may vary and is impacted by various social-distance and lock-down measures 27  ode models are often used to study the dynamics of such multi-patch epidemic models it is well known that the ode dynamics arises from the markovian assumptions in the stochastic multi-patch epidemic model that is the infection process is poisson the infectious andor exposedlatent periods are exponentially distributed and the migration processes are also markovian 1 8 21 22 4 19  some odepde models are also used to study their dynamics when the infection rates are age-dependent depending on how long the population has been infected see for example 20 11  these models also assume exponentially distributed infectious periods and markovian migration processes in this paper we study multi-patch sir and seir models in which the infectious and exposedlatent periods have a general distribution while the migration processes are markovian the infection is assumed to be local that is the infection rate depends on the susceptible and infectious population in each patch only individuals may migrate from one patch to another in each of the susceptible exposedlatent infected and recovered stages the epidemic dynamics evolves in a manner of mixed markovian and non-markovian components which seems challenging to directly derive its first-order fluid equations we describe the evolution dynamics by tracking the time epochs of becoming exposed andor infectious and the location of an individual at these event times specifically in the multi-patch sir model each individual tracks the time epochs of becoming infected and recovered and is associated with a continuous time markov chain taking values of the patcheslocations in the multi-patch seir model each individual tracks the time epochs of becoming exposed infected and recovered and is associated with two markov chains that are used to track their movement starting when the individual becomes exposed  infectious for the initially exposed andor infected individuals we also assume that their remaining exposing andor infectious periods have general distributions which may be different from those of the newly exposedinfected individuals for these initially exposedinfectious individuals we also track their movement while being exposedinfectious given the representations with these time epochs and location processes we show a functional law of large numbers flln and a functional central limit theorem fclt for the associated counting processes in the multi-patch sir and seir models the fluid limits are determined by a set of volterra integral equations when the infectious and exposedlatent periods are deterministic we can write the fluid integral equations as a set of odes with delay remarks 21 and 31 the limit processes in the fclt are determined by a set of stochastic volterra integral equations driven by a sum of independent brownian motions and continuous gaussian processes with a certain covariance structure when the infectious and exposedlatent periods are deterministic the limits become stochastic differential equations with linear drifts and delay remarks 23 and 32 we also remark how the approach and results can be extended to study multi-patch sis and sirs models remarks 24 and 33 in the proofs of these results we employ poisson random measures prms that are constructed as the sums of the dirac masses at the time epochs of becoming infectious andor exposed the infectious and exposing periods and the markov chain starting from the location of each individual at those epochs we can then use the martingale properties and convergence theorems as critical tools in the proofs for a single patch sir and seir models with general infectious and exposing periods an approach using prms that are constructed at the time epochs of becoming infectious andor exposed was developed in 24  the approach is further developed in this paper for multi-patch sir and seir models to track the locations of each individual at each event epoch this paper contributes to the limited literature on stochastic epidemic models with general infectious periods see the overview in chapter 34 of 8 on the common approaches to study non-markovian epidemic models and lln and clt for the final sizes of the epidemic see also the recent method using piecewise markov deterministic processes in 9 and 15 for the sir model we also refer to reinert 28 that proves an flln for the empirical measure of the sir epidemic dynamics using steins method in 24  both flln and fclt were proved for the epidemic dynamics in the classical models sir sis seir sirs where the prm representations of the dynamics plays a fundamental role in the proofs although volterra integral equations were used to describe the proportion of infectious population in the sis sir or seir model without proving an flln see 6 7 10 12 17 29  no volterra integral equations have been proposed for multi-patch epidemic models with general infectious andor exposing periods our work shows both flln and fclt for non-markovian multi-patch models and identify stochastic multidimensional volterra integral equations as their limits it is also worth mentioning the multi-type epidemic models where the population splits up into multiple groups of individuals and each group may infect any other group in addition to itself no migration and different from the local infection assumption in our model and proportionate mixing taking into account control measures like social distance or lockdowns is also incorporated see chapters 61 and 62 in 1 and 2 3  this is very different from our model since infection is local in our setup and individuals in any of the stages may migrate from one group to another we also highlight that fodor et al 13 argue that volterra integral equations are more effective than the ode models in the study of the covid-19 pandemic in particular they show that the ode models can significantly underestimate the initial basic reproduction number r 0  while the integral equations results in more accurate epidemic dynamics after sharp changes in r 0 due to lockdown measures the integral equations are also used to estimate the state of the covid-19 epidemic 14  11 notation throughout the paper n denotes the set of natural numbers and r k r k   denotes the space of k-dimensional vectors with real nonnegative

each patch experience the susceptible-infectious-recovered sir process the patches may refer to populations in different locations for example a densely populated city and a less populated rural area individuals in each patch are infected locally while they may migratetravel from one to the other in any of the susceptible infectious and recovered states the rate of infection is different in the patches because of the differences in the density of population or the use of public transportations while the law of the infectious period is the same same illness let n be the total population size and l be the number of patches for each i  1     l let s n i t i n i t and r n i t denote the numbers of individuals in patch i that are susceptible infectious and recovered at time t respectively then we have the balance equation assume that s n i 0  0 l i1 i n i 0  0 and r n i 0  0 i  1     l let  i be the infection rate of patch i i  1     l define the following processes  i  1     l  let a n i t be the cumulative counting process of individuals that become infectious during 0 t then we can give a representation of the process a n i t via the standard poisson random measure q iinf  equivalently we can write where p ai is a unit-rate poisson process and independent from each other for i  1     l we let susceptible resp infectious resp removed individuals migrate from patch i to patch j at rate  sij resp at rate  iij  resp at rate  rij  let xt denote the location ie the patch at time t  0 of an infected individual xt is a markov process which alternates between states 1     l define p ij t  pxr  t  jxr  i for i j  1     l and r t  0 then these probabilities can be computed see for example corollary 22 in chapter 7 of 26  example 21 suppose that there are two patches while in state 1 resp 2 it stays there for a duration of time which follows the exponential distribution with parameter  i resp a i  we define p 11 t  pxr  t  1xr  1  p 12 t  pxr  t  2xr  1  p 21 t  pxr  t  1xr  1  p 22 t  pxr  t  2xr  2  a standard computation based upon eg corollary 22 in chapter 7 of 26  yields the following explicit formulas we will use x 0k i and x k i to indicate the associated process for individual k in patch i for the initially and newly infected ones respectively note that they are all mutually independent and have the same law as described for the process xt above also note that the processes x k i start from the time becoming infected  n ki while the processes x 0k i start from time 0 we now provide a representation of the epidemic evolution dynamics where p si  p ri  i   1     l are all unit-rate poisson processes mutually independent and also independent of p ai  here the first term in i n i t represents the number of initially infected individuals from patch   1     l that remain infected and are in patch i at time t and the second term represents the number of newly infected individuals from patch   1     l that remain infected and are in patch i at time t the first term in r n i t represents the number of initially infected individuals from patch   1     l that have recovered by time t and were in patch i at the time of recovery and the second term represents the number of newly infected individuals from patch   1     l that have recovered by time t and were in patch i at the time of recovery define a prm q inf ds du dv d on r 3   1     l which is the sum of the dirac masses at the points  n j  u n j   ji  x j   j  with mean measure ds  and an infection occurs at time  n j in case u n j     n   n j  we can then write for     1     l we denote the corresponding compensated prm q inf ds du dv d  define the prmq inf ds du d on r 2   1     l with mean measure ds du   d where       p   t o  for     1     l then we can represent flln for any process z n  letz n  n 1 z n be the fluid-scaled process we make the following assumptions on the cdf f  for a finite or countable number of positive numbers a i and the corresponding t i such that i a i  1 and t 0  t 1      t k      and f 2 is hlder continuous with exponent 1 2   for some   0 that is f 2 t    f 2 t  c 12 for some c  0 in addition assume f 0 is continuous 8 in probability locally uniformly on 0 t  where s i t i tr i t i  1     l  c 3l is the unique solution to the following set of deterministic integral equations  212  remark 22 let the infectious periods be exponentially distributed with rates   j  exp for all i  1     l and j  n due to the memoryless property the remaining infectious periods of the initially infected individuals have the same exponential distribution it is well known that the epidemic evolution dynamics can be described by the following set of odes it can be checked that the set of integral equations in theorem 21 reduces to the odes in this special case fclt for any process z n  let n   n z n z be the diffusion-scaled process wher z n is the fluid-scaled process andz is its limit  where the limits are the unique solution to the following set of stochastic volterra integral equations driven by gaussian processes 214 with b ai  b sij  b iij  b rij being mutually independent standard brownian motions and with the deterministic functionss i  i r i being the limits in theorem 21 the processes 0 ij and ij are continuous gaussian processes with mean zero and covariance functions otherwise in addition 0 ij and ij are independent and also independent of the brownian terms remark 23 as discussed in remark 21 when the infectious periods are deterministic and equal to t o  the stochastic integral equations become linear stochastic differential equations with delay in particular the term remark 24 the analysis can be easily extended to the multi-patch sis model where the population in each patch has susceptible and infectious groups and when infectious individuals recover they become susceptible immediately the epidemic evolution dynamics is described as thus in the flln we obtain the same limit i in 210 as in the multi-patch sir model and the limits i t similarly in the fclt we obtain the same limit i as in 215 for the multi-patch sir model and the limit i t 3 the multi-patch seir model with general exposing and infectious periods 31 model description in the multi-patch seir model individuals in each patch experience the susceptible-exposing latent-infectious-recovered seir process and they may migrate from one patch to another in either of the four stages as in the sir model the infection process is local the rates of infection vary among patches and the exposing and recovery rates are the same among different patches let n be the total population size and l be the number of patches for each patch i let s n i t e n i t i n i t r n i t count the numbers of individuals that are susceptible exposed latent infectious and recovered in patch i at time t respectively we have the balance equation be the cumulative counting process of individuals that become infectious during 0 t which can be represented as 21 and 22 in the sir model with infection rate  i and the e n i 0 initially exposed individuals experience the exposing and infectious periods before recovery let  0 ki  k  1     e n i  be the remaining exposinglatent periods of the initially exposed individuals in patch i after the exposing period let  ki  k  1     e n i  be their infectious times the i n i 0 initially infected individuals experience a remaining infectious period before recovery we have the same notation  0 ki  as in the sir model for them the a n i t newly infected individuals experience the exposing and infectious periods let  ji  j  n and  ji  j  n be the associated exposing and infectious periods assume that  0 ki   ji   0 ki  and  ji  are all iid sequences of random variables having cdfs g 0  g f 0  f  respectively and they are also mutually independent note that  ji is defined for j  z and 1  i  l those with j  0 code the infectious periods of the initially exposed individuals while those with j  0 code the infectious periods of the newly exposed individuals let g c 0  1  g 0  g c  1  g f c 0  1  f 0 and f c  1  f  individuals may migrate from patch i to j in any of the four epidemic stages with rates  sij   eij   iij and  rij for the susceptible exposing infectious and recovered ones respectively times between migration in each of the stages are exponentially distributed let y t be the markov process denoting the location of an individual k that is exposed from patch i at time t and let q ij t  py r  t  jy r  i for i j  1     l and r t  0 we use y 0k i t and y j i t for the initially and newly exposed individuals in patch i and note that they have the same distribution as y t these processes are only used before an individual moves from the exposing stage to the infectious stage we use the same markov processes x 0k i t and x j i t for the migration of infectious patients as in the sir model the multi-patch seir epidemic evolution dynamics can be described as follows and where p sij  p rij  i j  1     l are all unit-rate poisson processes mutually independent and also independent of p ai  it is clear that the dynamics of e n i t is the same as that of i n i t in the sir model we remark that in the expression for the i n i t in the seir model the first term counts the number of initially exposed individuals from all the patches that remain exposed and are in patch i at time t and the second term counts the numbers of initially exposed individuals from all the patches that have become infectious in patch i at time t for tracking purposes the location at the epochs of becoming infection is recorded since we use  k and x 0k  for different patches  also note that we use the markov process x 0k  to indicate that these are for the initially exposed individuals the third term counts the number of newly exposed individuals at all patches that have become infectious and in patch i at time t and we also track the patch in which each individual becomes infectious note that some of the key components in the dynamics above can be represented via prms the infection process a n  has the same representation in 21 using the prm q inf  define a prmq inf ds du dv d on r 3   1     l which is the sum of the dirac masses at the points  we can then write for     1     l    l which is the sum of the dirac masses at the points  and for each z  0  x  z     p   z and again an infection occurs at time  n j if and only if  we can then write for  i  1     l we denote the corresponding compensated prm q inf ds du dy d dz d  q inf ds du dy d assumption 31 the cdfs g and f satisfy the conditions of f in assumption 21 in addition assume that g 0 and f 0 are continuous  is the unique solution to the following set of deterministic integral equations and 314 remark 31 suppose the exposing and infectious periods are deterministic taking values of t e  0 and t o  0 also assume that the remaining exposing and infectious periods of the initially exposed and infectious are uniformly distributed over 0 t e  and 0 t o  respectively then the fluid equations it is easy to see that we obtain a set of odes with delay after taking derivative  where the limits are the unique solution to the following set of stochastic volterra integral equations driven by gaussian processes here  are continuous gaussian processes independent of the brownian motions above with mean zero and covariance functions are independent from each other and then the limits in theorem 32 become stochastic differential equations with linear drifts and delay in particular remark 33 the analysis for the multi-patch seir model can be easily extended to multi-patch sirs model where in each patch the population is grouped into susceptible infectious and recovered individuals and individuals become susceptible after experiencing a recovery period in this model the infectious and recovered processes i n  r n correspond to the exposed and infectious processes e n  i n in the seir model in the description of the epidemic dynamics we need to change the dynamics of s n i in 31 by adding the individuals that have become susceptible after recovery ie the first three terms in r n i in 34  this is similar to the susceptible process s n i in 218 for the sis model then it is straightforward to write down the limit processes in the flln and fclt for the processes s n  i n  r n  corresponding to s n  e n  i n  in the seir model in this section we prove theorem 21 we first provide a representation of the processes then for each i  1     l it has the predictable quadratic variation  are stochastically bounded in d by lemma 58 in 25  and thusm  proof we can rewrite the processess n i as the processesm n si are square integrable martingales with respect to the filtration f n s t  t  0 defined by they have the predictable quadratic variation thus the processes under assumption 22 by lemma 41 and lemma 81 with y j  0 in the map  applying the continuous mapping theorem we conclude the convergence of s n 1     s n l  we next study the processes i n i t for which we give the following representation lemma 43 where p iij  i j  1     l are all unit-rate poisson processes mutually independent and also independent of p ai  p sij and p rij  proof in the representation of i n i t we observe that and for   i is the number of initially infected individuals from patch i that are in patch  at the time t   0 k for k  1     i n  0we also observe that and for   i thus using the above identities we obtain the expression in 45 for convenience we let for  i  1     l and t  0 we next treat these processes in the following lemmas  proof we first focus on n0 11 t note that since  0 k1 and x 0k 1 are independent where the expectation is taken under the condition that x 0k 1 0  1 note that the pairs  0 k1  x 0k 1  are independent over k and have the same distributions thus by the lln of iid variables we obtain that for each t  0 note that the convergence holds in fact in probability since the limit is deterministic this can be extended to convergence of finite dimensional distributions in order to establish tightness in d we will show that lim sup the fact that this implies tightness in d follows from corollary page 83 of 5 by the independence of the pairs the convergence of the other processes n0 i follows similarly it remains to prove the joint convergence since the initial variables of the patches and their migration processes are independent it suffices to prove the joint convergence of  n0 1      n0 l for different s separately on the other hand the joint convergence of  n0 1      n0 l is straightforward since they count an exclusive partition of individuals and the associated pairs  0 k  x 0k   are independent this completes the proof for n i  we first consider their conditional expectations lemma 45 with the limit  1      l of the convergent subsequence of proof we first focus on n 11  observe that then we can writ where dg 11 t  u is the differential of the map u  g 11 t  u thus by the continuous mapping theorem we obtain n 11  11 in d as n   wher for the joint convergence it can be shown that the mapping from x 1      x k   d l to in d l 2  is continuous in the skorohod j 1 topology then we can apply the continuous mapping theorem to prove the joint convergence of the processes this completes the proof we then show that the processes n i and n i are asymptotically negligible for each  i  1     l  proof we focus on the case  i  1 we hav recall g 11 t in 410 then it is clear that for each j e  n j1 t n j1  0 and and by the independence of the pairs  j1  x j 1  and  j  1  which implies that for any   0 observe that the three terms on the right hand side are nondecreasing in u thus we obtain p sup using the prm q 1inf ds du dv d and its compensated prm q 1inf ds du dv d we have the first term converges to zero as n   and the second term satisfies which follows from assumption 21 as shown in lemma 43 in 24  the second term on the right hand side of 413 can be treated similarly as the second term right above now for the third term using 41 by 44 the first term converges to zero as n   the second term is bounded by 2 2 1  2 by 43 thus combining the above we obtain the result now follows from the next lemma  proof the lemma is a direct consequence of the inequality 421 in 24  which we repeat here for the readers convenience as a consequence of lemmas 45 and 46 we obtain the following  we are now ready to prove the convergence of  n 1      n l   with 0 i and i being defined in 46 and 48 respectively proof by the representations of i n i t in 45 we hav where  with 0 ij and ij being defined in 46 and 48 respectively proof we can represent the processesr n i t b 18 where  n ii t is given 415 and for   i thus again by lemmas 41 44 45 46 and 81 we apply the continuous mapping theorem to the mapping to conclude the convergence of r n 1     r n l  from the argument above since we have the joint convergence in lemmas 44 and 46 we can conclude the joint convergence of s n i  n i r n i  i  1     l in addition the mapping x y z  d 3  xy xyz  d is lipschitz and continuous in the skorohod topology thus we obtain the convergence and thus therefore all the limits satisfy the integral equations given in theorem 21 finally the uniqueness of solutions to the set of integral equations in theorem 21 follows from the lipschitz continuity of the mapping x y z  d 3  xy xyz  d and applying gronwalls inequality this completes the proof of theorem 21 in this section we prove theorem 22 we first provide the following representations of the diffusion-scaled processes the process n i t can be decomposed as  for the processes n i t we hav for the processes n i t we hav where for  i  1     l for the processesr n i t we hav where for  i  1     l and   i we establish the convergence of some key components in these representations proof this follows from a standard martingale convergence argument see eg 25  the main steps include proving that the quadratic variations converge involving the convergence of fluidscaled processes and then applying the fclt for martingales we omit the details for brevity where the limits are as given in theorem 22 proof we first focus on the convergence of n0 11  recall that observe that the pairs  k1  x 0k 1  and  k  1  x 0k  1  are independent and have the same law thus its proof follows in a similar approach for empirical processes see eg theorem 143 in 5  there are some differences due to the process x 0k 1  which we highlight below so we apply theorem 135 in 5  for each t  0 and   0 we have similarly it can be also shown that for any 0  s  t as n   thus for the convergence of finite dimensional distributions with t 1  t 2      t k and      1     k we can write k 1 i  n0 11 t   using the increments n0 11 t   n0 11 t 1  which have covariances equal to zero over disjoint intervals next to prove tightness we employ theorem135 and verify condition 1314 in 5  we show that for r  s  t and for n  1 for some constant c and t  t 0 p 11 udf 0 u which is a nonnegative nondecreasing and continuous function recall f 0 is continuous this will enforce condition 1314 in 5  which according to theorem135 implies tightness in d let by direct calculations following similar steps in the proof of 149 in 5  we obtain thus we have shown the convergence of the process n0 11  0 11  for the joint convergence  n0 i   i  1    l  since the variables and processes associated with patch  and patch   are independent it suffices to show the joint convergences  n0 i  i  1     l for different s separately for the joint convergence  n0 i  i  1     l  we obtain tightness from that of each process as established above so it suffices to show the joint convergence of their finite dimensional distributions take   1 i  1 2 as an example for 0  t 1  t 2 and  1   2  0 this calculation can be extended to the computation of final dimensional distributions of  n0 11  n0 12  therefore we can conclude the joint convergence finally to prove that the limit processes are continuous when f 0 is continuous since they are gaussian it suffices to show continuity in the quadratic mean 16  that is for all t  0 lim st e  n0 i t  n0 i s 2  0 this is easily checked from the continuity of the covariance functions therefore the proof of this lemma is complete where the limits are as given in theorem 22 proof recall the prm q iinf ds du dv d and its compensated prm q iinf ds du dv d and the representation in 27 we write for  i  1     l to prove the convergence we define the auxiliary processes where   t is given in 212 and is a deterministic function it can then be shown that the processes n i t are square-integrable martingales with respect to the filtration f n i t  t  0 defined by    l    j  x j  s    1     l j  1     a n  s 0  s  t  they have quadratic variations in addition their cross quadratic variations for i  i    n i  n i  t  0 and for     and any i i    n i  n   i  t  0 thus by the fclt for martingales see eg 30  we obtain  n i   i  1     l   i   i  1     l in d l 2 as n   for each  i  1     l we focus on the process n 11  it is clear that where the convergence holds by theorem 21 and the dominated convergence theorem we next show that the sequence  n 11  n 11  n is tight observe that we can decompose sign such that each of these will induce a process that is nondecreasing in t it is also clear that tightness of these processes will be implied by the tightness of the following processes since these two processes are nondecreasing in t it suffices to show see the corollary on page 83 in 5 or lemma 47 that for any   0 and j  1 2  for each s  0 and i  1     l in the representations of n i t n i t andr n i t in 54-57 respectively the following hold there exists a constant c  0 such that for all n  thus by taking squares of the processes n i t n i t andr n i t in 54-57 we can apply cauchy-schwartz inequality and gronwalls inequality to conclude that  consider the two cases of f in assumption 21 in the case f  f 1  thus in both cases we obtain 518 for the process  n 2 t we have the argument for these two terms follow from that for the second and fourth terms above for  n 1 t this completes the proof completing the proof of theorem 22 note that the processes associated with the initial variables in lemma 52 those associated with the newly infected individuals in lemma 53 and those associated with the migrations in lemma 51 are mutually independent thus all these processes converge jointly given the convergence of the initial variables in assumption 23 by the convergence results in lemmas 51 52 and 53 we can apply the continuous mapping theorem to the map  defined in lemma 82 below with m  l the proof is complete  in this section we prove theorem 31 note that for the seir model the tightness result in lemma 41 of n i  and the convergence ofs n i in lemma 42 hold with the same argument the analysis of the process n i follows the same as that of the process n i in the sir model so we will omit its proof we give the following representation of n i as in lemma 43 similarly we obtain the following representations for the process i n i t we focus on the convergence of i n i t for  i  1     l let we first treat the components associated with the initial quantities  which implies by the lln of iid variables that for each t  0 as n   the convergence of finite dimensional distribution is a straightforward extension for tightness we use the same argument as in lemma 44 we start with  n02 we newt note that each of the two terms on the right hand side are increasing in s so that as n   and the two terms in the limit both vanishes as   0 thus for any   0 thus we can conclude that n02 i  02 i in d as n   then since g 0 is continuous we can verify the continuity of the covariance function and thus the continuity of the limit processes 02 i   which is straightforward this completes the proof as in the proofs of lemmas 45 and 46 for the sir model we obtain the convergence of the processes e n i t and i n i t where for  i  1     l and t  0 with h i defined in 314 proof the proof of the convergence of n i follows from the exact same argument as in lemmas 45 and 46 so we focus on the convergence of n i  the main steps are similar so we highlight the differences define the auxiliary processes for  i  1     l we first show that  n i   i  1     l   i   i  1     l in d l 2 as n   610 observe that recall h i t in 314 then we can writ and apply the continuous mapping theorem as in the proof of lemma 45 to obtain the convergenc i n i  n i in d as n   and then the joint convergence in 610 using the mapping 411 we next show that for any   0 and for  i  1     l p sup this follows from similar steps as in the proof of lemma 46 we highlight the main differences below where it is clear that e  n ji t n j  0 and e  n ji t 2  n j  h i t n j 1h i t n j  where h i t is defined in 314  moreover e  n ji t n j  i tf n a t  0 due to the independence of the pairs  j   j   y j   x j    and  j     j     y j    x j      thus we obtain  observe that each of the five terms on the right hand side is increasing in s thus we have p sup the last term is treated in the same way as in the proof of lemma 46 for the sir model for the first two terms we use the prm representation in 36 we have it is clear that the first term converges to zero as n   and the second term satisfies the convergence follows the same argument as for the proof of 611 in 24 under assumption 31 similarly for the second term on the right hand side of 613 we have here it is clear that the first term converges to zero as n   and the second term satisfies the convergence follows a similar argument as for the proof of 69 in 24 under assumption 31 now for the third and fourth terms on the right hand side of 613 we have these two terms can be treated similarly as above thus we have shown that and we can apply lemma 47 to conclude the tightness for the joint convergence of the processes  n i   i  1     l and  n i   i  1     l  it suffices to prove the joint convergence of the processes  n i   i  1     l and  n i   i  1     l  where n it is given in 611  and 14 it is easy to prove that the mapping from x 1      is continuous in the skorohod j 1 topology thus applying the continuous mapping theorem we obtain the convergence  n i  n i   i  1     l   i t i   i  1     l in d 2l 2 as n   then the asymptotic equivalence between n i and n i  and between n i and n i results in the joint convergence in 67 this completes the proof we are now ready to prove the convergence of  n 1      n l   with 0 i  01 i and 02 i being given in 64 65 and 66 in lemma 61 and with i and i being defined in 68 and 69 in lemma 62 respectively proof by the representations of i n i t in 62 we hav 616 andm n ii t is given in 416  and its convergence in 417 holds recall the representations of e n i t and n i t as integrals with respect to n  in 614 and 611 respectively thus by lemmas 41 61 and 62 and equation 612  and by lemma 81 we apply the continuous mapping theorem to the mapping  to conclude the convergence of  n 1      n l  we next prove the convergence of r n 1     r n l  similar to 62 we obtain the following representations for the process r n i t  with 01 i  02 i and i being given in 65 66 and 69 respectively proof we can represent the processesr n i t b 18 where  n ii t is given 415  andm n ri t is given in 419  and its convergence in 420 holds recall the representation of n i t as an integral with respect to n  in 611 thus again by lemmas 41 61 and 62 and equation 612  and by lemma 81 we apply the continuous mapping theorem to the mapping to conclude the convergence of r n 1     r n l  the rest of the proof follows from the same argument as for the sir model this completes the proof of theorem 31 in this section we prove theorem 32 we first give the following representations of the diffusionscaled processes the process n i t has the same decomposition as in 51 but wit we have the same representation of the process n i t in 54  for the process n i t by the representation in 61 using the definitions of e n0 i t and e n i t in 63 we obtain where for  i  1     l and for the process n i t we obtain 5 where n0 i t and n i t are defined in 73 and 74 respectively and andm n ii t is as defined in 56 for the sir model for the processr n i t we hav wherem n ri t is as defined in 58 for the sir model the convergence of the processes n i follows the same argument for that of n i in the sir model so we focus on the convergence of n i in the seir model which is given in 75  first as in lemma 51 we have the joint convergence of the following martingales whose proof is omitted we now prove the convergence of the components associated with the initially exposed and infected individuals  we again apply theorem 135 in 5  by direct calculations we obtain for t  0 and for t  t   0 and then establish the convergence of finite dimensional distributions of n02 i  also we obtain for t   t  t  and for n  1   i  1     l  which also follows similarly as in lemma 52 finally for the continuity of the limit processes it suffices to show the continuity in the quadratic mean 16  which follows from the continuity of the covariance functions we next prove the convergence of the components associated with the newly exposed individuals where the limits are as given in theorem 32 proof the convergence of  n i  n i   i  1     l follows from a similar argument as that of  n i  n i   i  1     l for the sir model in lemma 73 it uses the prmq inf ds du dv d and the representation in 35  in particular we can writ  define the auxiliary process where   t is given in 312  it can be proved in the convergence of n i  we also hav e n i  n i  0 in d as n   for each  i  1     l we focus on the convergence of n i t recall the prm q inf ds du dy d dz d and the representation in 36 we can then writ we define the auxiliary process where   t is given in 312  since   t is a deterministic function then n i t is a squareintegrable martingale with respect to the filtration f n i t  t  0 defined by it has the quadratic variation where h i t is defined in 314 and the cross quadratic variations of the processes n i t and i n   i  t satisfy for i  i    n i  n i  t  0 and for     and any i i   1     l  n i  n   i  t  0 thus by the fclt for martingales see eg 30  we obtain  n i   i  1     l   i   i  1     l in d l 2 as n   now it remains to show that n i  n i  0 in d as n   for each  i  1     l it is clear that where the convergence holds by theorem 31 and the dominated convergence theorem we next show that the sequence  n i  n i  is tight we hav as in the proof of lemma 53 it suffices to prove tightness of the following processes by the monotone property of these two processes in t we then show that for any   0 and   1 2 similar to the derivation in 513 of lemma 53 we obtain 711 the first and third terms converge to zero as n   by the convergence e  n  s    s  0 and applying the dominated convergence theorem by a similar argument as in lemma 53 we also obtain lim sup n sup and applying cauchy-schwartz inequality and gronwalls inequality we obtain 517 together with the bound for n i t and thus the claim follows for the last term in 711 we have we can bound the sum of those two terms by by the lipschitz continuity condition in the case of g 2 and f 2 in assumption 31 say with lipschitz coefficient   and  and constants c  and c respectively we obtain the bounds for the right hand side now suppose that both functions g and f are discrete say gt  g 1 t  k b k 1 ts k for a finite or countable number of b k and the corresponding s k such that k b k  1 and s 0  s 1      s k      and f t  f 1 t  i a i 1t  t i  for a finite or countable number of positive numbers a i and the corresponding t i such that i a i  1 and t 0  t 1      t k      the first term on the right hand side of 712 is equal to similarly the second term on the right hand side of 712 is bounded by thus in both cases we obtain lim 0 lim sup the other cases where g resp f  is discrete and f resp g is lipschitz continuous can be treated similarly without difficulty thus 710 holds for  n 1  consider next we have here the first term is bounded by 2 2   2 sup s0t  e  n  s 2 and the second term is treated as above in 713  this completes the proof of 710 and thus the convergence  n i   i  1     l   i   i  1     l in d l 2 as n   it remains to prove the joint convergence of  n i  n i  for which it suffices to prove the joint convergence of  n i  n i  recall the representations of them in 78 and 79 using the prm q inf ds du dv d and q inf ds du dy d dz d respectively by their definitions of the two prms we can regardq inf as projections of q inf from r 3   1     l  r   1     l onto r 3   1     l thus it is straighrforward to prove the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions of  n i  n i  by computing and their extensions to multiple time points since tightness of  n i  n i  follows from that of each individual process we can conclude their joint convergence in d l 2  this completes the proof completing the proof of theorem 22 we observe the correspondence of the processe  n i in 71 and n i  n i  n i r n i in 54 72 75 and 76 with the mapping defined below in lemma 83 we have shown the convergence of the components associated with the initial variables newly exposed individuals and migration processes in lemmas 72 73 71 which are all mutually independent thus given the convergence of the initial variables in assumption 33 we can apply the continuous mapping theorem to the map with m  l and conclude the joint convergence of the processes  n i  n i  n i r n i   in this section we define several integral mappings and prove their continuity in the skorohod j 1 topology define the m-dimensional integral mapping   y 1      y m  z 1      z m   d 2m  x 1      x m   d m  where the y j s are nondecreasing x i t  x i 0  y i t  z i t  for given constants a ij  b ij  r and fixed functions  ij in d i j  1     m let be the mapping without y i t terms but with the integral with respect to y i t only this is an extension of the mapping in section 81 of 24  whose proof can be easily extended to this mapping thus we omit the proof for brevity lemma 81 given y 1      y m  z 1      z m   d 2m with y 1      y m  being nondecreasing a ij  b ij  r  ij  d in d i j  1     m and

1 topology that is if y n 1      y n m  z n 1      z n m   y 1      y m  z 1      z m  in d 2m  then x n 1      x n m   y n 1      y n m  z n 1      z n m   x 1      x m  in d m  and if in addition y

given a i  b i  c i   i   i   i  d some constants  i   i   i  0 and functions f i for  i  1     m let x i  y i  z i be the solutions to the following set of integral equations in the next lemma we study the existence and uniqueness of its solution and the continuity property lemma 82 assume that f i   i  1     m are bounded and continuous functions satisfying f i 0  0 and let the constants  i

continuous uniformly on compact sets in 0 t  proof for the existence and uniqueness of solutions we can apply the schauder-tychonoff fixed point theorem and modify the proofs in theorems 12 and 23 in chapter ii of 23 where these results are shown for volterra integral equations with continuous functions we now prove the the continuity of the mapping in the skorohod j 1 topology note that functions in d are necessarily bounded for the given functions  i   i   i  d let t be a common continuity point then there exists increasing homeomorphisms  n on 0 t  such that  n  e t  0  n i  i  n t  0  n i

respect to the lebesgue measure on 0 t  having derivatives n satisfying  n  1 t  0 as n   let c 0 be some constant such that sup i sup t0t  f i t  c 0  for brevity we consider one of the functions y 1  since the others can be treated similarly we have y n 1 t  y 1  n t  y n 1 0  y 1 0   n 1   1   n t  t 0 a n 1 sx n 1 s  b n 1 sy n 1 s  c n 1 sz n 1 sds   n t 0 a 1 sx 1 s  b 1 sy 1 s  c 1 sz 1 sds

for the second integral and by the boundedness of the functions x n 1  y n 1  z n 1 and a 1  n s b 1  n s c 1  n s the third term on the right hand side of 82 is bounded by  n  1 t t 0 a 1 sx 1 s  b 1

converges to zero since  n  1 t  0 and the next three terms converge to zero because of the convergences of a n 1  a 1  b n 1  b 1 and c n 1  c 1 in the skorohod topology for the fourth term on the right hand side of 82 by the change of variables for the second integrals we bound the term with   1 by  n  1 t t 0 f 11  n t   n sa 1 sx 1 s  b 1 sy 1 s  c 1 sz 1 sds  t 0 f 11 t  s  f 11  n t   n s

converge to zero since  n  1 t  0 and f 11 is continuous respectively and also because the functions in d are bounded over 0 t  for the third term similar to the second and third terms in 83  it can be bounded by c 0 c 1 a n 1  a 1   n t  b n 1  b 1   n t  c n 1  c 1   n t  t 0 x 1  n s  x 1 s  y 1  n s  y 1 s  z 1  n s  z 1 s ds  for the last term on the right hand side of 82 again by the change

holds by applying gronwalls inequality to the set of integral inequalities for x i  y i  z i  the uniform continuity property on compacts when the functions are continuous is straightforward this

tuckett ronald barnett   when we first began drafting this article we wanted to raise our collective dissatisfaction that live debate in universities has all but disappeared each of the authors of this paper has presented at and chaired a series of midlands he policy network mhepn debates that we recently developed and hosted through the education observatory university of wolverhampton each author also participated in the higher education institutional research heir conference held at the university of wolverhampton in september 2019 with the theme of measuring excellence in higher education the mhepn debates were intended as a powerful place-based forum to hear regional voices that seem to be virtually silenced by the generic structure of national policy frameworks focused on measuring excellence now as we publish our thoughts on the necessity for live face-to-face debate from regional universities unprecedented measures to resist the spread of covid-19 mean that virtual is literally all that we have left whilst the arguments that we share about audible place-based debate remain highly relevant a further layer of complexity now unfolds before us the biological work of this pandemic intermingles with technological communications and social activities to materially and emotionally alter each of our lives at this point in time then when the global economy and heathcare worldwide reel from the pressures of covid-19 we are moving even more rapidly away from face-to-face meetings by necessity yet simultaneously this crisis reveals the crucial role that local communities play in any national or global efforts to fight a spiralling pandemic now is therefore an important time to voice the essential part that regional universities play in connecting global technological and biological change with local social projects citizens and industry postdigital theory jandri et al 2018 offers one not entirely perfect but with room for discussion route towards understanding also that covid-19 does not sit apart from other global and local challenges such as developing creative skills across populations to contend with automation change unemployment and opportunity in a 4th industrial revolution 4ir peters et al 2019 peoples lives are now fusions of both analogue and digital technologies and social practices jandri et al 2018 such interconnections can be noticed all around for example even as airlines are grounded worldwide in an unplanned global detox for our atmosphere we are purchasing stockpiling perhaps and even making by hand more plastic bottles of hand sanitiser than ever before as fast as we seek to communicate crucial information virtually we also need to be aware of those who may use little or no technology or who simply cannot afford to whilst contactless forms of payment and automated checkouts are prioritised at the same time human forms of social care have never been in more demand thus health social welfare and sustainability concerns are visibly mingling before our eyes with economic and technological ones this is a situation that concerns universities at many levels and not least because it crosses disciplinary boundaries it is these messy postdigital connections where many but not all people lead lives that are now simultaneously offline and online material and virtual that are omitted from national excellence frameworks alongside deeply contextual differences between our regional universities with this in mind we will firstly discuss the problems of attempting to capture the rich work of academia through generic static national frameworks that are set for regional universities not developed by them this is akin to beginning research rather unethically by stating what the findings will be before actually approaching the participants instead adopting a grounded bottom-up approach using a variety of methods can make audible the regional voices expressing what is really being done by universities avoiding assumptions and dynamically informing policy perhaps then at the start of a new and now very uncertain decade it is time to take the triple excellence frameworks of ref research excellence framework tef teaching excellence and student outcomes framework and an emerging kef knowledge exchange framework as more of a departure point rather than a fixed agenda even as we write the deadline for ref has been suspended buying us all time to reflect on immediate and fundamental change amid a pandemic perhaps this is also a good time to thank these exercises for their contribution in revealing the many issues of a national largely quantitative rational interpretation of excellence set for universities after that we might proceed with a richer more regionally aware agenda for excellent practices set by universities one that really reflects and responds to contextual and locational diversity 
english policy has been relatively territorially agnostic for many years the dislocation of place or the relegation of civic interests when in the words of the commission university policy remains almost wholly national feels precisely the wrong approach in todays politics it downplays institutional history and purpose but worse it betrays a lack of interest in what happens to people and places at this moment in time that feels like a huge risk westwood 2019
 the singular generic concept of excellence as it has been articulated in he policy has played its part then in furthering a territorially agnostic policy discourse about universities unfortunately and somewhat irrationally this has also written out and silenced the very people who are actually positioned to participate in developing more plural excellent practices in teaching research and knowledge exchange in the community s hayes 2019a hayes 2020 therefore secondly we point to a rather ironic contrast between our national political system and our universities active debate takes place daily in the uk parliament yet through he legislation and policy delivering generic excellence frameworks such measuring effectively shuts down these forms of exchanges within regional educational institutions whilst much attention is focused towards diversity and inclusivity at a national policy level there seems to be considerably less attention placed on how this plays out differently between institutions and locations universities are immersed in different regional contexts local economies and historical backgrounds they are interlinked with the communities schools industry local dialects culture demographics deprivation and affluence of the places that surround them competing simply to occupy a similar national space risks silencing these diverse voices and overlooking varying needs talents and opportunities in each region even as we write we note that amid the escalating covid-19 pandemic the uk government is committing to distributing research-related funding more fairly across the uk pells and inge 2020 yet in the days since the budget announcement by chancellor rishi sunak of his plan to invest in rd and cutting-edge technologies to provide support for people in every nation and region of the uk to gain the skills they will need as the economy evolves the governments pledge to level up opportunity and share prosperity across the uk is also being questioned pells and inge 2020 graeme reid chair of science and research policy at university college london has expressed concern at always being told the cheque is in the post and bafflement that in a budget that has got some very interesting and clearly well-thought-through content about the place agenda theyve managed to display no progress whatsoever on the shared prosperity fund pells and inge 2020 as announcements unfold a postdigital perspective recognises that whilst scientific and medical knowledge will understandably be key all steps that are taken will also concern human-technological-material-social-global-regional aspects as advice is enacted across populations and into the future we therefore thirdly each explain in our own voices why we believe there is a need for audible place-based debate in he institutions via initiatives like our midlands he policy network mhepn we provide our insights too into why a balance of data evidence dialogue and expertise drawn from our regions is needed together with suitable investment to move beyond empty national excellence frameworks alone this has implications for universities communities individuals and policymakers live oppositional argument is just one way dynamically to raise voices from regional univerisites which are otherwise suppressed by data-driven nationally focused measures of excellence whilst it is not unusual for media companies to broadcast political debates such as question time bbc 2020 from regional locations our concern is that such live events appear now to be starkly absent from our educational institutions where once they thrived this is not easily changed under current circumstances when a national lockdown has altered for now the ways in which people live however these are key principles that can still be upheld across online technologies and indeed in this article itself though our voices are not live or being heard by a group of participants meeting in the same room they still argue as they would in that regional context after each dialogue has been presented we discuss the role of collective writing about debateto further debate lastly and certainly not least we invite others to come forward to host such events as mhern in the future once it is safe to do so but also to contribute their ideas and voices to extend the experimental format we have developed over the last year though it may not currently be safe to crowd into the same room to share the noisy friendly arguments we have enjoyed during the last year in debate we can still gather our opinions together in the act of collective writing as long ago as 1996 readings pointed out today all departments of the university can be urged to strive for excellence since the general applicability of the notion is in direct relation to its emptiness readings 1996 23 fifteen years on molesworth et al 2011 amongst many other authors who have since critiqued neoliberal policies discourse and marketisation in higher education he suggested that the development of mission statements in an attempt to mark out a distinctive space for a university sees almost all universities attempting to occupy similar spaces of excellence as a result molesworth et al 2011 229 in the uk we now have a set of largely data-driven national excellence frameworks that tend to uphold the neoliberal economic values that structure society and education these are transmitted across institutions via a rational policy logic which assumes that generic excellent practices can be automatically applied across different contexts with little effort these frameworks effectively move university mission statements even closer towards competing for a similar space rather than a diversity of place as they endeavour to respond to the generic topic of excellence this leaves he institutions simply repeating dominant patterns of rationalisation in wider society like those noted by george ritzer in his mcdonaldisation thesis and that are now also replicated and augmented online ritzer et al 2018 yet such a generic approach brings with it a troubling opportunity cost in failing to address regional inequalities particularly if policymakers discursive tropesfrom the needs of dynamic knowledge economies to the benefits of excellencedistract from the distributional conflicts and power dynamics in the sector schulze-cleven et al 2017 3 a peculiar form of reason then that configures all aspects of existence in economic terms brown 2015 17 simply reinforces persistent patterns of generic rationalisation and mcdonaldisation in universities d hayes 2017 couldry argues that neoliberal rationality is reinforced not just by explicit discourse but also through the multiple ways in which that discourse and its workings get embedded in daily life and social organization couldry 2010 12 as such neoliberalism crowds out other ways of organising labour and becomes an institutionalised culture thus shaping our organisation of space certain types of spaces become prioritised whilst others such as space for critical debate even in a staff common roomperish the thought fall out of use unfortunately the human voices in shared spaces that once existed simply stop being heard s hayes 2019a 61 this is further reinforced when in linguistic tone and structure he policy discourse in the shape of mcpolicy gives the impression that universities are now the same as any other consumer experience s hayes 2019b hayes and jandri 2018 this plays down not only the crucial part that universities need to play as sites of connectivity for linking the requirements of industry technology and market forces with the demands of citizenship delanty 2001 it also effectively removes an authenticity of place and region jopling and johnson 2019 yet it is precisely this civic focus that might just help to rebuild trust in universities as well as restoring local growth and tackling deep regional inequality westwood 2019 these are key concerns as the realities of under-investment in regions as well as nationally focused assumptions are revealed in the responses to covid-19 and a 4th industrial revolution connor et al 2019 now is not the time for policy or media rhetoric to drown out diverse regional voices that express a sense of personal investment and belonging which leads to both the civic engagement and the creative enterprise we need to draw upon in wider society nor should we further a dangerous culture where education is developed towards therapy rather than to further autonomous thinking ecclestone and hayes 2019 despite appearances this article is not simply an excuse to reject regulatory frameworks that were developed to evaluate teaching research or collaboration with the community nor is it a suggestion that we should settle for mediocrity rather than high quality our aim is to point instead to deeply contextual factors at a personal institutional and regional level that further excellent examples of authentic academic practices these are not captured in generic scales of measurement there is a dark and eerily quiet alley somewhere in the capital not due to covid-19 alone where we seem to have currently parked he perhaps we will not even incur a congestion charge whilst we stall the engine there but there are other livelier productive and interconnecting regional routes that we might actually travel along together the high speed 2 hs2 may be controversial with environmental concerns needing to be balanced against regional connectivity topham 2020 but at least these conversations can be heard our triplicate of national excellence frameworks also needs to be in audible dialogue with regional networks to avoid becoming static products rather than authentic processes at a time of review also for the uk professional standards framework psf advance he 2020 questions can be asked about whether this too is now occupying the same dark deserted alley with potential at its infancy to inform dynamic and diverse regional teaching practices warnes 2020 argues that the psf has become subsumed as part of generic university fellowship schemes to bolster corporate excellence statistics for marketing purposes this means the personal value of individual excellence is converted via performance management into impersonal institutional excellence warnes 2020 by definition then no direct links can now easily be drawn between a framework once aimed at improving the learning experiences of students through reflexive teaching practice which has been reappropriated to support neoliberal carrot and stick performance review policies aimed at improving the skill level of the workforce andor rooting out underperformers warnes 2020 fawns et al 2020 point out that many practices are not adequately captured in data that relies on teachers and students activities conforming to an anticipated model they suggest instead that a balance of data evidence dialogue and expertise is necessary furthermore within their ecological view of he institutions rather than considering the performance of individuals in isolation evaluation can also look at policies systems and environments and how these support and constrain educational practice goodyear and carvalho 2019 fawns et al 2020 s hayes 2019a as such they call for analytics that are part of a wider ecological view of education where relationships and holistic conceptions of practice are valued above individual variables goodyear and carvalho 2019 and where it is acknowledged that metrics do not capture everything that is important fawns et al 2020 it is here that we suggest that audible regional debate has an integral part to play fawns et al 2020 emphasise the importance of dialogues between teachers and students to make sense of how the formal curriculum intertwines with informal extra-curricular activity and emergent sites of learning they suggest that in engaging in dialogue through workshops interviews and other events with stakeholders including teaching and administrative staff students and the wider community a values-led vision for universities can be furthered fawns et al 2020 this is now an even more pressing concern in postdigital society where there is a need to encourage a wider dialogue on the issues raised by the growing influence of algorithms and big data beyond those specialists who are already immersed within the arena edwards and fenwick 20162 this is a debate that is not just characterised by particular technologies but by the fusions between these technologies the capacity to redraw the lines between physical digital and biological domains and the potential scale speed and spread of these changes connor et al 2019 as such we do not seem to be paying enough attention to the places or spaces where innovative and creative dialogue grows and develops because neoliberal policy refuses to take such situational factors into account jopling 2019 the irony of a national political system that encourages active debate in the uk parliament yet appears to be delivering excellence frameworks that are effectively shutting these forms of exchanges down within schools further education and he is not lost on us in this time of viral crisis individual opinions are being aired from households and locations across the country as they were during recent flood devastation in the uk yet what is missing is any means to gather live individual and collective regional opinions actively facilitated by the universities in these locations this new biological threat has further silenced live debate events but this time by necessity when human lives are at risk taking a postdigital perspective on this alarming and surreal situation however can offer a helpful critical route for collective discussion and analysis even if we need to postpone being in the same room together for example as self-isolation has recently become a global priority it is worth reminding ourselves that this new social phenomenon is more than simply social or anti-social even self-isolation may involve a physical removal of humans from social contact but it is dialectically linked to forms of digital communication online and offline choices economic and political decision-making and media reporting for those in uk universities where an array of national excellence frameworks have been structuring our activities and timescales for quite some time amid serious global health concerns this could now be a healthy time to debate some alternative approaches the first time we held a regional debate at the university of wolverhampton in february 2019 we were literally accosted the next day by individuals who attended asking for more of these events as we have begun to hold debates in other regional institutions the reaction is the same the evidence may be anecdotal but the enthusiasm and engagement are both warm and apparent we clearly miss hearing the sound of each others voices in active discussion whilst the rhetoric of excellence in policy cannot be the only factor contributing to the absence of live debate a generic focus on data and frameworks overlooks active dialogue such exchanges develop and improve our educational understanding experience knowledge and practices though as well as bring to light our rich regional differences and challenges topics for provocations in our debates so far have ranged from the re-occupation of policy discourse academic freedom the question of whether the university is dead possible futures for universities policy that drives divisions between teachers and students undergraduate supervision staff mental health policy-based evidence challenging fluentism in the academy the challenge of developing creativity and what needs to change each topic has generated live debate that indicates the deeply qualitative and contextual nature of teaching and research in regional locations that cannot be easily captured in figures and isolated metrics alone we turn now in our own voices to explain the role that we each understand active debate to contribute to this topic and how it might help us to reverse out of the dull dark alley into the network of diverse regional universities 
why debate at all the spirit of the age is against it tyrrell burgess 2004 217
 the midlands was the home of the english enlightenment in the eighteenth century groups like the lunar society and the derby philosophical society met in various towns in the midlands to debate and challenge conventional thought in philosophy and science the spirit of that age was expressed in a motto by the german philosopher immanuel kant sapere aude dare to know over two hundred years later the enlightenment tradition is in decline and challenging debate is out of fashion writing in 2004 a leading educational thinker professor tyrrell burgess declared that the spirit of the age is against it burgess 2004 217 he gave a general and a personal defence of the reason why debate is important before charting its decline in education his general defence was that unlike beasts we can use language to discuss criticise and argue we do not rely on trial and error but can discover error before a trail has damaging consequences he concluded to eschew debate is to inhibit progress his personal defence was that we seldom know anything unless we can explain it to others and defend it against criticism it is a powerful aid to personal understanding and improvement burgess 2004 217 in the educational sphere debate has vanished for two reasons firstly because teachers policymakers and politicians see education as a technical matter of correctly applying what works there is nothing to discuss we just need to work out the right way of doing things secondly there is a parallel cultural change which has turned education towards therapy debate as a consequence of the therapeutic turn has become mere self-expression it focusses on feeling the first is in part tyrrells argument the second is entirely mine d hayes 2019 resurrecting debate against the spirit of the age needs initiatives that may seem artificial but they will inhibitslowlyindulgent and even narcissistic self-expression we certainly need debating societies in schools and universities that set up debates for and against a proposition in what one educationalist called in a discussion with me debate in the old fashioned sense that old fashioned sense is debate we can leave such debate to students themselves and to initiatives like the sixth-form debating competition debating matters for academics and professionals the need is for new ways of getting out of echo-chambers and groupthink higher education institutions will not do this spontaneously in the midlands almost by accident a few academics have begun an experiment in the tradition of those early enlightenment societies like many ideas the midlands he policy network mhepn emerged out of dissatisfaction where were the spaces for academics students and others interested in the state and future of he to come together and talk we started the first mhepn debate at the university of wolverhampton in england on 27 february 2019 with four brief provocations not so much calls for action as spurs for reaction because we thought it might be interesting and because we thought others might agree and more importantly might not agree for all kinds of reasons some of which we explore in this brief overview it seems to have found its place why debate debate is a pleasingly old-fashioned word when we hear it nowadays it tends to come from a politician calling for public debate to raise the profile of whatever change they are proposing or policy they are criticising but when and where do these public debates take place not it would seem in the modern marketized university in comparing university education and public training stefan collini 2017 235 makes the important distinction that education relativizes and constantly calls into question the information which training simply transmits it is precisely this calling into question that we thought this network could encourage through discussion provocation and debate it has been striking and more than a little concerning how many people who have attended the network have said both that they relish having the opportunity to talk about ideas and that such opportunities are increasingly rare in the contemporary university why midlands place matters as our attachments to place become more complex in the uk and other countries we seem to be increasingly drawn towards and welcome simple oppositions the north-south divide in england is one such opposition where does the midlands sit in all this it is striking that even advocates for fairly radical forms of regionalism eg niven 2019 tend to fall into old oppositional geographical patterns even whilst ingeniously co-opting the south west into the north we associated mhepn with the midlands because it is simultaneously a useful regional marker although with very open borders and an ambiguous one the midlands represents both somewhere drawing on a history of debate challenge and calling into question and nowhere as a between space below the north and above the south the midlands resembles the modern university caught between oppositions such as excellence and enquiry learning and delivery student and customer this does not mean it is the only space in which to debate these kinds of issues but it does seem to make it a valuable one getting brexit done might have been the dominant theme in decembers general election but levelling up the economy across all parts of the uk has quickly become the most important domestic challenge for the new conservative government westwood 2020 regional inequality in the uk is a long-standing deeply entrenchedand growing policy problem the gaps between the best and worst performing regions are amongst the largest in both europe and the oecd see the industrial strategy commission 2017 or mccann 2019 these differences in productivity and in wages and living standards have been an important driver of political dissatisfaction influencing voting patterns in both the 2016 referendum and the 2019 election the conservatives owe much of their eighty seat majority to constituencies won in left behind towns andor in underperforming regions including in the west and east midlands the pm has promised to double government rd funding with a boost to some 18bn overall as a way of levelling up economic performance across the country his chief adviser dominic cummings has pointed to richard jones resurgence of the regions paper 2019 as a blueprint for such an approach but this will involve a significant shift in traditionalas well as more recent conservative thinking on both higher education and the economy in the black country there are new conservative mps in walsall dudley west bromwich and wolverhampton the nearest university with campuses in many of these places is the university of wolverhampton as in the north east there is also a conservative city region mayor for the west midlandsandy street in the north and east midlands there are new conservative mps representing stoke derby and lincoln but very few of the universities in these places are likely to benefit much from the proposals to double research funding instead they will be more concerned by the conservative manifesto promise to tackle low value courses in higher education data on graduate salaries tells us that weaker regional and local labour markets pay less and that those staying and working in such places will earn less over their lifetime universities that recruit locally in areas such as the black country or north staffordshire stand to suffer the most and their finances are already weakened by a market that tends to favour more established institutions in larger wealthier cities but it is also these institutions that offer the best options for increasing innovation skills and rd and growing underperforming local economies a more traditional conservative view might endorse and accelerate market principles offered by he reform since 2010 more powers to the office for students ofs more focus on value for money and possibly fewer or capped graduate places overall especially from lower value courses but that is almost a completely place blind approach and creates a big political problem withdrawing numbers and weakening institutions are more likely to undermine new geographical priorities as chris skidmore has tweeted recently if we are going to level up every part of the uk universities as anchor institutions will be part of the solution skidmore 2020 is this a sign of governments acceptance of these issues perhaps but he lost his job as minister for universities and science in the recent reshuffle gavin williamson remains as education secretary and represents the south staffordshire constituency which borders that of several new and existing tory colleagues across the west midlands amanda solloway is the new minister for science and innovation and she represents derby north both should have a better understanding of these areas institutions and the contradictions of traditional policy approaches above all theyas well as universities in these placesmust understand the pressing need to rethink what higher education can now achieve encouraging academic dialogue understanding and action will be key as well as places of student learning and for challenging knowledge universities are crucial sites of connectivity for linking the requirements of industry technology and market forces with the demands of citizenship delanty 2001 in postdigital times jandri et al 2018 regional institutions provide places and spaces for innovative and creative dialogue to develop even as we contemplate the emerging global effects of a 4th industrial revolution and attempt to navigate a devastating pandemic a universal national chant of excellence where the parameters have already been set for uk universities will not help us to creatively meet the technological biological and social challenges unfolding around us decades of neoliberal he policy has treated technology as a neutral add-on and a quick fix to enhance education automatically and generically s hayes 2019a 92 rather than as dialectically intertwined with all human activity this logic has left institutions considerably unprepared for the implications arising from artificial intelligence ai big data algorithms biometrics and neurotechnologies as these fuse with politics human identity ethics and the law couldry argues that neoliberalism literally changes where we can and cannot speak and be heard couldry 2010 12 collini suggests that the language we use when discussing the university plays its part in how we understand and situate it and also how we live in relation to it collini 2017 35 as regional institutions where a rich array of voices express what is actually being done by universities we have a much stronger chance if connections can be made with wider policy in order to develop this dialogue we need to move away from an approach to writing policy that effectively writes out the labour of students teachers and leaders s hayes 2019a it is their place-based innovations creativity and diverse voices that contribute towards reducing regional inequalities and developing skills it is here in the varied regions of the uk that universities are crucial sites too for connecting global technological change with local social projects and citizens in a new political economy of higher education it is a problem if research simply remains policy-orientated descriptive and under-theorised schulze-cleven et al 2017 debate across regional institutions therefore provides a vehicle to connect new modes of inquiry and to surface academic perspectives on personal positionality in the new postdigital political economy of he s hayes 2020 postdigital positionality is just one way to interpret our individual contexts and to appreciate that peoples lives are now fusions of analogue and digital technologies and social practices jandri et al 2018 our current excellence frameworks fail to take into account these new personal and institutional realities which are also changing how individuals within he function communicate and innovate as authors we have each added our individual voices in support of developing live debate in education indeed when we first set out to write we did not realise that for now this collective article would be stepping in to raise each of our voices when we currently cannot convene live debates due to the pandemic whilst collective writing takes a different format to live debate each of these types of gatherings provides a forum to further knowledge there is scope for both of these collective acts to disturb the existing systems of academic knowledge creation jandri et al 2017 in different ways in live debate the chair encourages active participation from those in the room which increases shared understandings in this collective article we look to our open reviewers to comment as if they were chairing our exchange of argument thus helping to further each readers awareness via the act of publishing however what collective writing cannot do is to replicate the live discursive event that takes place in a region to simultaneously raise those local voices in this article each author has explained their personal position on why both voice and place matter together in live debate we have each argued from our own positioning that neither voice nor place should be reduced through frameworks that measure university excellence in purely generic national terms in a postdigital context people in local contexts also lead messy lives that are now simultaneously offline and online material and virtual therefore this postdigital reality should not be omitted either from national excellence frameworks alongside deeply contextual differences between our regional universities as dennis has argued education cannot simply remain a technical matter where seeking excellence involves correctly applying what works regardless of context nor can it turn towards therapy this simply dilutes debate into narcissistic self-expression rather than argument that furthers progress the mhepn provides local space for each of us to test what we believe we know explain it to others and defend it against criticism now as we seek to enable group meetings online in real time we need to be aware that behaviours usually change in a virtual context people joining from different locations still alter the dynamic different levels of access to the technology intervene different backdrops behind people distract us and a need to mute microphones renders conversations intermittent yet at the moment this is all we have and so perhaps we will learn to adapt as time goes on meanwhile michael pointed out that the mhepn emerged from dissatisfaction and an agreement that we need to reinstate the lost spaces where we might agree and more importantly disagree rather than making a special case for public debate this should be an inherent part of our daily activities in education even if debate appears to have gone out of fashion in postdigital times we are aware that no practices need to be consigned to history they are not replaced by the digital as he policy texts would often have us believe they simply reside alongside live debate moves us beyond a transmission of information in the form of training towards education which relativizes and constantly calls into question collini 2017 235 what we can know live debate happens in a certain place and those places matter just as we need to represent the often-overlooked places between north and south in the modern university we need oppositional debate to focus on spaces between excellence and enquiry learning and delivery student and customer the mhepn has opened up a valuable forum in which to debate such positionings reflecting on andys comments getting brexit done may not have disappeared but it currently gets little airtime right now all eyes are understandably on the conservative governments responses to the covid-19 crisis but this pandemic does not sit apart from other political economic challenges in he and beyond whilst political and economic measures to enact brexit continue a biological epidemic has travelled throughout europe and across the globe simultaneously grinding human travel to a halt over a matter of days our global lives have returned to local lives by necessity as we try to grapple with overwhelming implications postdigital insights can further our thinking and responses covid-19 has wrought tragedy on a huge scale but even amid social isolation we can make collective productive observations as we look to the future the current health crisis has all but closed universities but these regional institutions are feeding into the collective effort to both research covid-19 tests and vaccines and to manufacture lifesaving equipment across the underperforming regions surrounding many of these universities low-paid care assistants and supermarket workers are being relied upon as much as professors and doctors predicted automation linked to 4ir has therefore not simply replaced human cashiers and shelf stockers as anticipated in simple terms because technological change is interconnected with all other forms of change there is nothing new in this situation of course after the black death in the fourteenth century unskilled labour was at a premium in england at least this was pivotal in destroying serfdom as it had existed for hundreds of years thus our current circumstances alongside rapid technological changes are worthy of continuous debate as we consider how levelling up economic performance and closing gaps between regions might be achieved going forward as regions unite to tackle the crisis government thinking on he and the economy needs to recognise the anchor institutions skidmore 2020 in overlooked communities to support their research and to aid their graduates who stay and work in these regions in each of these places spaces for live academic dialogue need to gain momentum to rethink what he can now achieve sarah is particularly fond of ritzers argument concerning the irrationality of rationality meaning that a persistent rationality including how this plays out in online and augmented situations often leads to the opposite outcomeirrationality ritzer et al 2018 the imposed rationalities of national and context-free frameworks for excellence only serve to negate personal and institutional positionalities in our postdigital contexts as they stand this risks closing down critical locational dialogue that yields creative and innovative solutions to both current and future crises couldry 2010 has argued voice matters our he policy texts are currently devoid of the regional and contextual voices that matter this needs to change if the many statements about inclusivity and diversity we read in national and institutional policies are to be upheld the mhepn has experimented with one way to restore live audible human argument in response this yielded a powerful response from our colleagues requesting more of these forums given that universities are crucial sites to connect global technological change with local social projects and citizens we owe it to each other to debate what it really means for humans to re-occupy policy now and in the future s hayes 2019a a postdigital perspective recognises all of the aspects that we have brought together above as intertwined dialectically with each other across time and space in a further layer of complexity the biological work of a pandemic has connected with technological communications and social activities to materially and emotionally alter the lives of most people on the planet this too has raised some voices suppressed others and restricted global freedom of mobility requiring people to remain for now in their local places an understanding of the role of place in the wider national and global economy begins with debate this is a debate that can be furthered by regional universities who can serve as a conduit to connect local community with wider policy contexts we have argued that attempting to capture the rich work of academia across the uks regions through generic static national excellence frameworks set for regional universities but not developed by them is fraught with problems we suggested this regulatory approach is akin to beginning a research project and unethically predicting what the findings will be even before approaching the participants therefore new policy frameworks that recognise the voices from regional universities as well as their complex postdigital contexts are needed with the core of this article focused on the role of live place-based debate to surface the real contributions of universities in their communities and to link these with national policy we have used collective writing as an alternative way to raise each of our academic voices on this topic amid a pandemic alongside devastating human tragedy covid-19 has revealed messy and ironic postdigital connections whilst physically disrupting global neoliberal and mcdonaldised life on a grand scale whilst we scarcely dare to imagine a future scenario where such a pandemic might actually be repeated we need to go further now and actually voice this concern in countries across the globe national leaders seek solutions that rely on the commitment and creativity of people from across the local regions it is time to recognise universities as postdigital sites for connecting global technological and biological change with local social projects and citizens we discussed the irony of a loss of debate within regional universities when in uk parliament debate remains a key forum through which the current measures to protect the public from a pandemic are being brought into policy surely this indicates that the power of live debate should not be confined to national government bodies alone each author of this article has presented their case though not just for live debate but for place-based regional voices to be raised neither a collective article nor a virtual forum can exactly replicate the powerful contextual live debate that has been generated through the mhepn meetings so far however this collective piece with its open reviewers acting rather like chairs in a live debate has offered an alternative gathering to further knowledge on this topic at a time of unprecedented change we now invite institutions and individuals worldwide to contribute to this open forum by any means that is safe to join raymond williams 1977 122 described how a dominant discourse however powerful never manages to eradicate other ways of thinking and highlights the residual discourse of earlier ways of seeing the world and the emergent discourse where new forms are imagined and given voice raising regional academic voices reflects both a reassertion of old valuesas in dennis hayes celebration of debate as a skill to be learnedand a reassertion of emergent forms as in the post-digital exploration of collective ways of learning together captured in the central narrative what the four authors share in common is a clarity about the things of value omitted in the dominant neoliberal paradigm that has shaped so much of our public lives over the last thirty or forty years if the initial modest steps to allocate scarce resources for major science investment which inspired the first research assessment exercise worked at least for big science the subsequent explosion of centrally determined data captures and the emergence of league tablesand their attendant homogenisation of higher education has had the perhaps understandable effect of corroding academic collegiality it has done this in too many places through a top-down managerialist culture as institutional leaders trapped in a fiscal fight if not quite to the death struggle to respond to external demands that risk distorting institutional missions all of this has taken place in the name of marketization the cost of these ways of thinking to institutions responsibility to locality was for me graphically highlighted as nottingham university decimated its regional adult learning programmes whilst opening a new shiny campus in ningbo china tuckett 2017 the authors reassert the value of dialogue of argument within a collaborative exploration of the relationship between the academy and the places in which it is located the paper emerges from the debates generated in the midlands higher education policy network and is properly alive to the bleaching out of regional responsiveness from the drivers shaping current higher education yet whilst it is properly on the side of devolution rather than a one size fits all centralised higher education discourse and whilst it celebrates the diversity and difference in a co-operative dialogue it stays comfortably within the sectoral boundaries of higher education what i wondered as i read it would be different in a wider discussion of the sort that the cape learning region in south africa engaged in as educators struggled to explore the distinctiveness of different institutional forms whilst working to create a wider learning culture those ideas have fired the resurgence globally of interest in learning cities and learning regions amongst them the wolverhampton learning city region there inevitably educators recognise that in reconfiguring a learning culture academics need allies in business industry the faith and voluntary sector and need too to imagine new forms of association involving adults and young people of all sorts that surely is the humus that will be needed if a politics linking productivity skills and a learning culture are to be revitalised regions matter dialogue is vital universities open to both also matter and neoliberal certainties will be helped on their way by dialogues like this very welcome paper what is it to count as a region in higher education it can surely be spatial as well as it being geographical but the geographical region is an open matter a geographical region in the uk is somewhat different from one in the usa or china two days ago i participated in a webinar in which there were thirty participants in every part of the world all of whom were active in the event they each had a voice the software permitted group break-outs where we were placed in small groups as well as hearing distinguished international scholars giving plenary talks and a discussant drawing together the threads of the debate there we saw a region in action the event had a focusthat of academic activism as it happens and it was held within a larger territory that of the philosophy and theory of higher societyand so it had a border community voices conversation and an identity are thoseborder community voices conversation and identitynot five ingredients of indeed conditions of a region and then the matter of a geographical region becomes interesting in its own right we should look as intimated for a border community voices conversation and identity and we surely see each of these elements in the fascinating dialogue here between sarah hayes michael jopling dennis hayes and andy westwood perhaps though some elements are more clearly visible than others is there need there be a definite border to a midlands network it seems to embrace manchester but not birmingham there are certainly voices and conversation here and we can sense that it builds on a larger community that of a regional policy network of its identity we cannot be too sure but what in these days of fluidity is to count as identity can identity ever be pinned down it is always in the making all of these five elementsas to the making of a collectivity of regional voicesare thrown into high relief in the digital era i confess to be uneasy by the term post-digital it is interesting that the wordprocessor monitor frowns upon the single word postdigital as if the single entity that the unified word implies is suspect an implication of the term is that we can get beyond the digital and put the digital behind us or at least move onto a higher level of being but any such temptation must be eschewed even those who have no access to computers often forgotten by those in higher education are influenced by the internet if only in services messages cultural resources and information denied to them we are all not post-digital but co-digital whether we like it or not all of us at every level personal institutional national have our own accommodations to the digital age simultaneously we live with the digital conduct ourselves alongside the digital try to outlaw the digital embrace the digital hide from the digital spy on the digital and court the digital we are all socially distant from or socially proximate to the digital and often both of these and many other postures as well in the one set of relationships none of us is post-digital but to pick up just one issue here what is regional identity here are not new identities being forged in digital regions and how significant for the university is the element of face-to-face encounters it has long been observed that some students are more comfortable in online learning there is a shadow presencing here neither fully in the face of the other but yet sufficient space for one to express a point of view and to have a voice perhaps something similar can be observed for the academics themselves now perhaps digital media are helping to realize habermas ideal speech situationand it was advanced as an ideal in the contemporary interactive digital media inequalities of position fade if only a little formal positions and title professor dr student recede to be replaced by a name on the screen academic identifiers are now more equal if any of this is the case then there are rich pickings available in this co-digital academic age for scholarship and research into new possibilities for academic citizenship for the very notion of academic argument for the organisation of space which kinds of discursive space are conducive to intellectual innovation and for the maximisation of cross-border disciplinary flows quite new academic ecologies may await here but still the very idea of region keeps coming back the authors of this writing collective have surely hit on three key points in the presence of strong states say the uk france china the regions are subjugated a potential mismatch between debate at the national level and its near absence at the regional level and consequently the overlooking of regional identities that are sometimes at odds with the central policies which are imposed upon the regions this set of ingredients is a recipe not only for dull uniformity but also for the suppression of regional difference autonomy and vitality it is ironic that as the authors observe their exchange is conducted in the presence of a virus pandemic for its shaping in the uk has followed just this pattern of failed attempts at the centre to dominate the regions and with dire consequences so there are assuredly tasks and responsibilities for those in geographical regions to work at forming regional identities which have hitherto been subjugated voice identity community and conversation can and should all be worked at in the process new kinds of digital citizenship may emerge shall we call the new forms of happening not just gatherings but purposive gatherings it is right however that the geographical borders remain indistinct let the borders stay open well reasonably open at least

simon pitchford c richard amison t robert carrington c lorena robaina cabrera mlia magnen mark looney r elaine gray clive page p  221 words the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 infections has led to substantial unmet need for treatments many of which will require testing in appropriate animal models of this disease vaccine trials are already underway but there remains an urgent need to find other therapeutic approaches to either target sars-cov-2 or the complications arising from viral infection particularly the dysregulated immune response and systemic complications which have been associated with progression to severe covid-19 at the time of writing in vivo studies of sars-cov-2 infection have been described using macaques cats ferrets hamsters and transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace2 these infection models have already been useful for studies of transmission and immunity but to date only partially model the mechanisms implicated in human severe covid-19 there is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe covid-19 these models need to recapitulate key mechanisms of covid-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and reproduce the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease here we review the current models of sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into covid-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments  animal models are necessary in the development of all drugs and therapeutics to demonstrate efficacy and safety as well as providing essential information on route of administration pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to identify key mechanisms driving pathology in vivo the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  the disease manifestation of sars-cov-2 infection has led to the rapid development of animal models of sars-cov-2 infection which have already provided insights into the natural history of the disease and together with data from previous studies have permitted identification of potential antiviral approaches identified in studies of other viral infections alexander et al 2020  notably at the time of writing late april 2020 studies using animal models have already provided some evidence that immunity might confer protection from reinfection bao et al 2020a  and that convalescent plasma might decrease viral burden  animal studies have also confirmed the susceptibility of domestic cats to infection  and have provided evidence of the importance of angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace2 enabling infection bao et al 2020b  these animal models are well suited for proof of concept studies into efficacy of potential vaccines or antivirals however each model system has its drawbacks and at the time of writing april 2020  no reported animal model of sars-cov-2 infection fully recapitulates every key feature of severe covid-19 table 1  figure   1  this deficit in preclinical modelling is important as until vaccines are widely available there is a particularly urgent need to identify potential treatments for this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved patients who already have established sars-cov-2 infection and who are at risk of progressing to severe covid-19 requiring hospitalisation and the need for respiratory support in a high dependency or intensive care unit the ideal evidence from preclinical efficacy studies of potential therapeutic interventions to prevent or promote resolution of severe covid-19 in patients who are already symptomatic will be meaningful improvements in clinically relevant endpoints in models which deterministically progress to severe disease following infection with sars-cov-2 interventions should also be applied at realistic time points in these models  figure   2  this ideal standard of evidence will of course have to be balanced with practical and ethical considerations sars-cov-2 has zoonotic origins andersen et al 2020  but several major factors complicate the study of this virus in model organisms these include lack of infectivity of clinical isolates of sars-cov-2 in some model species including mice and dogs bao et al 2020b shi et al 2020  and an absence of the persistent infection immunopathology severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic complications which characterise covid-19 clinically furthermore sars-cov-2 predominately causes severe covid-19 in older people with comorbidities  presenting a construct validity problem with attempted use of young and immunologically nave laboratory animals in covid-19 testing scientists developing animal models therefore face a challenging set of trade-offs as well as a sense of urgency despite the pressing needs for treatments design and implementation of preclinical studies for covid-19 should maintain quality to produce meaningful results avoid needless duplicity and avoid undue reduction in consideration of animal welfare issues london and kimmelman 2020  here we review the mechanisms involved in covid-19 development and reported approaches to model sars-cov-2 infection responses we then identify key areas in which studies using animal models might improve recapitulation of important characteristics of human covid-19 to better help in the identification and assessment of new therapeutic interventions new modelling approaches are needed to improve our understanding of sars-cov-2 and covid-19 because the virus has newly transitioned to infecting humans and because aspects of the disease are different to previously described syndromes developing as a result of viral infections including sars fortunately clinical and preclinical data related to the covid-19 pandemic have been disseminated at a never-before-seen rate sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna coronavirus thought to be the descendant from a bat coronavirus which spilled over to infecting humans after infecting an intermediate host potentially a pangolin andersen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b  the genome of sars-cov-2 is 79 homologous with that of sars-cov which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreaks in 2003 lu et al 2020  studies indicate that as with sars-cov the spike glycoprotein expressed by sars-cov-2 undergoes activating cleavage by host proteases on epithelial surfaces which permits high affinity interaction of spike with host epithelial this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved ace2 bao et al 2020b hoffmann et al 2020  when it is bound by spike cleavage of ace2 by further host proteases such as tmprss2 allows viral entry into host epithelial cells for viral replication hoffmann et al 2020  damas et al 2020 assessed ace2 polymorphism and similarity to human ace2 in 410 vertebrates including 252 mammals based on conservation of 25 amino acids that are essential for interaction between ace2 and sars-cov-2 a scoring system that predicts the likelihood of infectivity was devised although experimental data would be required to substantiate the merit of this system this study does provide a rationale for choice of animal species to study the infectivity pathogenesis and treatment of covid 19 and suggested that species such as old world monkeys would be highly susceptible to infectivity while most rodents are less likely to be infected sars-cov-2 and sars-cov exhibit similar stability outside of the body van doremalen et al 2020  but differ in their incubation and transmission kinetics compared with sars-cov sars-cov-2 appears to replicate more rapidly in the upper respiratory tract zou et al 2020  where it achieves transmission in asymptomatic carriers  factors which likely contributed to the rapid global spread of covid-19 the reported clinical symptoms of covid-19 range from mild to critical  mild disease varies from no symptoms to mild pneumonia severe disease is characterised by moderate to severe pneumonia critical covid-19 involves diagnosis of ards septic shock andor multi-organ failure wu and mcgoogan 2020  risk factors including advanced age male sex obesity diabetes and immunodeficiency predispose towards development of severe or critical covid-19 sars-cov-2 appears to be less likely to cause severe disease than sars-cov  a factor which likely also enabled greater spread of sars-cov-2 and may also present an additional challenge for development of animal models pathology of covid-19 is centered around immunopathology with persistent lung infection leading to ards and clinical progression follows a time course characteristic of a dysregulated viral immune response gattinoni et al 2020 tian et al 2020 xu et al 2020b figure 1  it is clear however that critical cases of covid-19 involve damage to other systems in the body which may both be a result of ards and may also be causative of greater lung injury notably covid-19 has been associated with a coagulopathy driven by inflammation and characterised by elevated fibrinogen and d-dimer levels indicating increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis zhang et al 2020a  patients suffer from increased thrombotic risk against which standard prophylactic anticoagulants appear only partially effective llitjos et al 2020  and there is evidence that platelets autoantibodies and neutrophil extracellular traps may be involved in the pathogenesis barnes et al 2020 bikdeli et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c zuo et al 2020  the ards presentation within covid-19 is heterogenous and may involve both gas exchange and perfusion abnormalities pulmonary dead space to extents that differ between patients gattinoni et al 2020  additionally hyperactivation of inflammatory responses can result in a cytokine storm which may kill via exacerbation of multi-organ failure and lung inflammation or myositis blanco-melo et al 2020 sarzi-puttini et al 2020  recapitulation of these key processes driving severe pathology and mortality in covid-19 will validate animal models for severe covid-19 research non-human primates are close in phylogeny to humans which makes them particularly important for use in vaccine development at the time of writing nonhuman primate models of sars-cov-2 infection have been reported using rhesus macaques bao et al 2020a munster et al 2020 yu et al 2020  and cynomolgus macaques rockx et al 2020  for studies of sars-cov african green monkeys common marmosets squirrel monkeys and moustached tamarins have also been used gong and bao 2018  although non-human primate models can resemble human systems more closely than models which use more phylogenetically distant animals it is important to note that these studies frequently use limited numbers of animals in their experiments as low as 1 or 2 animals per group and so their results should be interpreted with due caution curtis et al 2018  investigators using these intelligent animals do however have limited numbers of non-human primates available for terminal proof of concept pathology studies especially as many of these animals will soon be needed for vaccine tests and so experimental designers are forced to make trade-offs between group sizes in early pathology studies versus those in later preclinical trials of therapeutics the most convincing demonstration of an animal model of covid-19 has been reported by munster et al 2020  rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally intratracheally by mouth and onto both eyes pulmonary infiltrates were observed radiologically and oedema was measured gravimetrically although superficial inspection found lesions to be focal and sporadic alveolar flooding with the presence of hyaline membranes which are rarely seen in other animal models of ards matute-bello et al 2011  were observed in lung histology this was accompanied by an irregular breathing pattern and increased respiratory rate in some animals suggestive of hypoxemia although this readout may also be a marker of pain or distress together these results suggest some degree of ards development however gas exchange impairment was not measured and serum cytokine analysis detected no consistent evidence of systemic inflammation as age is a major risk factor for severe covid-19 the response of aged rhesus macaques 15 years old to intratracheal inoculation with sars-cov-2 has also been compared with that of younger controls 3-5 years old  this report suggests that there are age-related increases in viral load 7 days after inoculation radiology and histology were indicative of mild interstitial infiltrates in younger animals with signs of more severe oedema including alveolar flooding in aged macaques although preliminary and largely qualitative this study suggests that aged macaque models may be useful for modelling more severe disease rhesus macaques have also been used to test whether seroconversion provides protective immunity against sars-cov-2 in one reported study two animals were inoculated intratracheally with sars-cov-2 and then challenged again 28 days later bao et al 2020a  lack of viral shedding after re-challenge in both macaques suggested development of protective immunity this study should not be overinterpreted however as other studies suggests low or even undetectable titres of neutralizing antibodies in previously infected patients  and the korean centre for disease control has reported reinfection of patients with previous covid-19 limited signs of lung inflammation and pneumonia were also demonstrated in this macaque study rockx et al rockx et al 2020  ferrets are useful in both studies of viral transmission and the pharmacology of the most frequently reported symptom of sars-cov-2 infection as unlike mice and rats they exhibit a cough reflex there are also ferret models used to study cystic fibrosis sun et al 2010  ferret studies also have potential veterinary and zoonotic relevance as an outbreak of sars-cov-2 infections with respiratory symptoms has this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved been reported in minks related to ferrets within the mustilidae family in two farms in the netherlands dutch parliament report 2020 following inoculation with sars-cov-2 ferrets have been shown to develop symptoms similar to those described in human covid-19 namely elevated body temperature suggestive of pyresis reduced activity and appetite and coughing between 2 and 12 days post infection kim et al 2020 shi et al 2020  histologically sars-cov-2 infected ferret lungs have exhibited severe pulmonary lymphoplasmacytic perivasculitis and vasculitis at 13 days post infection  transmission of sars-cov-2 was studied by placing nave ferrets in direct or indirect contact with inoculated ferrets kim et al 2020  it was observed that all nave ferrets placed in direct contact with infected ferrets displayed symptoms of infections elevations in body temperature and reduced activity 2-6 days post infection however ferrets placed in indirect contact with inoculated animals through separation with a partition that allowed air to move between enclosures did not show any symptoms although some tested positive for viral rna indicative of airborne transmission lung histology of inoculated ferrets in this study only showed mild signs of inflammation at 4 days post infection measurements of upper respiratory tract gene transcripts from nasal washes blanco-melo et al 2020  these studies showed a lower magnitude of upper airway immune responses relative to influenza a infection and the induction of a unique sars-cov-2 gene signature ontologically enriched for cell death and leukocyte activation-associated transcripts tracheal cell analysis also showed that sars-cov-2-unique transcripts were also associated with hematopoietic progenitors suggestive of extramedullary hematopoiesis at the infection site however importantly this study did not report any lower respiratory or systemic pathological findings and the lack of demonstrated pulmonary replication and edema in ferret sars-cov-2 infection models suggests a major limitation of ferrets in the study of lung pathology although cats are not widely used to study respiratory diseases the close association of humans and domestic cats means that investigation into sars-cov-2 infection and transmission in cats is important although the relationship of domestic cats with humans in turn complicates their use as laboratory animals it is notable here that domestic cats as well as zoo-housed tigers which are also in the felidae family have reportedly tested positive in the usa suggesting veterinary and zoonotic importance of feline sars-cov-2 studies center for disease control report 2020 to study transmission of sars-cov-2 two pairs one inoculated and one nave in each pair of sub adult aged 6-9 months and 3 pairs of juvenile cats aged 10-14 weeks were housed together with fecal samples analysed for the presence of viral rna to confirm successful infection in both the sub-adult and juvenile cats only one out of the three nave cats had viral rna detected in the fecal samples suggestive of some transmission albeit more limited than in ferrets it is notable here that the researchers were unable to perform nasal washes on the sub-adult cats due to the aggression of the cats also notable was the reported death of one of the inoculated juvenile cats at 3 days post infection during this study suggestive of the provocation of severe disease in a young animal lung histology on autopsy showed pronounced alveolar flooding suggesting pulmonary oedema development further study of whether severe disease can be reproduced in cats may be useful for severe covid-19 efficacy testing or for veterinary medicine development hamsters have been used for a range of medical research studies and importantly show a relatively high degree of homology with humans within the region of ace2 implicated in interaction with the ace2-binding domain of sars-cov-2 spike  chan et al 2020 inoculated golden syrian hamsters intranasally with sars-cov-2 viral replication occurred in the lungs of infected hamsters and lungs also developed marked lesions of pulmonary edema inflammation and cell death as assessed histologically inoculated hamsters lost weight showed an increased respiratory rate and could infect co-housed hamsters suggesting utility as a model for studying transmission the infected co-housed hamsters showed similar signs of lung pathology but did not lose weight suggesting that inoculated hamsters had greater severity due to a higher amount of virus delivered to lungs inflammation was also measured in this study using quantitative pcr on lung samples demonstrating an early interferon response and an elevation of il-6 together these data suggest that hamsters might be highly useful in modelling mechanisms of covid-19 however inflammation and lung pathology resolved by 14 days post infection suggesting that the hamster responses were reflective of a resolving inflammation and successful host defence as opposed to the dysregulated responses that are associated with severe covid-19 mice are widely used in studies of immunology and lung injury and have a highly characterized immune system rapid breeding cycle and can be used with a range of readily available research tools importantly the size and rapid breeding and growth of mice is useful for accelerating the completion of studies with group numbers high enough for statistical testing of efficacy of potential interventions however the spike proteins of sars-cov-2 and of its relative sars-cov are thought to have insufficient affinity for the murine ace2 entry receptor for infection of mice wan et al 2020  clinical isolates of sars-cov have therefore been adapted by serial passage in the respiratory tract of mice to produce related viruses ma15 and v2163 that can cause lung injury and mortality in wild-type mice roberts et al 2007 day et al 2009  with pathological exacerbation reported in aged or immunodeficient mice graham 2012 at the time of writing there are no reports of mouse-adapted sars-cov-2 and it is not known whether naturally occurring mutations in the sars-cov-2 spike ace2binding domain found in clinical isolates have altered pathogenicity in mice ou et al 2020  mouse adaptation of sars-cov-2 would be useful for the acceleration of mouse testing but may prove difficult as sars-cov-2 spike appears to have evolved high affinity for human ace2 at the expense of lower affinity for ace2 in other organisms wan et al 2020  initial studies published as preprints show that sars-cov-2 can also infect k18-hace2 mice in a transgene-dependent manner bao et al 2020b  in these mice inoculation with sars-cov-2 at 10 5 tcid50 caused weight loss antibody responses and both superficial and histological evidence of lung inflammation in a k18-hace2 this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved transgene-dependent manner although lung injury was limited and not quantified bao 2020  in contrast to previous sars-cov experiments however no mortality was reported with sars-cov-2 infection in k18-hace2 mice perhaps related to the lower virulence of sars-cov-2 observed in humans although only one dose of virus was studied further adaptations of the experimental approach to infecting transgenic mice may be required to study lethal lung injury resulting from sars-cov-2 infection another issue for future studies is whether the tissue distribution and surface expression levels of hace2 in k18-hace2 mice faithful recapitulate those in humans as murine ace2 expression appears to be highly localised to bronchial epithelium in mice sodhi et al 2019 sun et al 2020  with ace2 perhaps more generally distributed in human lungs hamming et al 2004  and with transgenic hace2 expression mouse lungs bao et al 2020b  there are also species differences in distribution of ace2 expression outside the lungs which may have implications for systemic responses to sars-cov-2 infection additionally ace2 downregulation may play a role in disease progression kuba et al 2005  and k18-hace2 have both human and non-spike reactive murine ace2 and so may be resistant to ace2 downregulation related complications the targeted insertion of human ace2 into the endogenous mouse locus may therefore be useful in better modelling severe covid-19 sars-cov-2 likely originated from a coronavirus infecting bats andersen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b  although bats are not commonly used as model organisms they are of particular research interest because a they appear to be the originating species of many particularly deadly zoonotic viruses and b their immune systems have evolved to tolerate persistent infections with viruses with higher virulence in other species which possibly accelerates viral evolution brook et al 2020 rabi et al 2020  it is also notable that sars-cov-2 isolates have shown infectivity in rabbit and pig cells in vitro chu et al 2020  although in vitro tropism does not always mean infection can occur in vivo these model organisms may be useful for studies related to covid-19 as rabbits are well suited for longitudinal lung function studies and the organ systems of pigs more closely resemble the scale of those in humans which is useful for studies involving haemodynamic measurements the route or method used for viral inoculation can affect the severity of viral disease models and a range of inoculation routes have been used in reported animal studies table 1  intranasal delivery has been widely used as this delivery method is simple some inoculum can be aspirated into airways and because the intranasal route is potentially reflective of the real-world route of entry for viral droplets however this method can lead to limited and focal delivery of inoculum to lungs su et al 2004  and viral diseases affecting the lower respiratory tract such as covid-19 may result from inhalation of aerosols which can enter deeper into the lungs or from widespread deposition of virus in lungs due to high upper respiratory tract viral load and mucociliary escalator disruption aerosolised delivery of viral inoculum may therefore be useful in the induction of widespread lung injury which might be sufficient to provoke severe disease as well as in the standardisation of the dose of inoculum that reaches the lower airways and respiratory lungs evidence that aerosolized delivery can provoke injury resembling severe ards with elevated cytokine release has been produced in cynomolgus macaque models of h5n1 influenza wonderlich et al 2017  there have also been recent developments in the quantitative delivery of aerosols and powders to lungs of laboratory animals lexmond et al 2018  aerosolized or intratracheal administration approaches for controlled delivery of inoculum may be worthy of consideration in animal models for more severe covid-19 histological analysis superficial visual inspection and radiological imaging have been the predominate approaches used to assess the development of lung inflammation and injury following experimental sars-cov-2 infection however these pathological observations have so far often been reported in only some animals under study and only some regions of the lungs of those animals table   1  this is likely due to probabilistic provocation of injury and primary focus of where pulmonary oedema was measured consistently in infected animals using the index of lung weight as a percentage of body weight munster et al 2020  this simple method may prove to be a useful terminal approach for lung injury this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved assessment that is feasible in in most studies within constraints of bsl3 conditions and later requirement for lung homogenate for viral load readouts personnel time the personal protective equipment requirements in biosafety level bsl 3 laboratories and both the size of animals and consideration of their welfare can limit measurements that are feasible in sars-cov-2 infection studies however serial measurements of blood oxygen saturation or arterial blood gases would be highly valuable in definition of the time course of impairment of gas exchange if this occurs in animal models it is notable here that in covid-19 patients decreased arterial oxygen saturation has been reported prior to the dyspnoea and dramatically decreased saturation which leads to hospitalization and pao2fio2 can fluctuate during the course of clinical covid-19 progression and so as in the clinical setting serial close monitoring of oxygen saturation is ideal cascella et al 2020  these points are reminders that some degree of hypoxemia and pneumonia is indicative of some disease but not conclusive evidence of progression to severe covid-19-like ards where possible serial noninvasive imaging approaches as reported in some macaque studies table 1  are also useful for tracking the time course of pulmonary oedema development it is notable that some patients with covid-19 ards have more limited oedema with severe hypoxemia gattinoni et al 2020  and so additional measurements of lung perfusion pulmonary dead space fraction or ventilation perfusion scans in animals may also be useful for better understanding of this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved covid-19 as disease sub-phenotypes may be also be present within animal models carla et al 2020  planning of terminal measurements should involve consideration of how the maximum number of high-value measurements can be made if inoculations can affect the lungs widely and relatively evenly this can involve the use of different lobes for different potentially confounding measurements for example bronchoalveolar lavage is useful for simultaneously measurements of viruses inflammatory cells inflammatory mediators and protein deposits in the bronchoalveolar spaces but causes artifacts in histological analysis and prevents later measurement of pulmonary oedema likewise formalin inflation is useful for histological analysis which can be performed outside of bsl3 conditions but prevents the most direct and quantitative methods of measurement of viral load in lungs and pulmonary oedema lobes of lungs can therefore be sequentially tied off and sampled to permit functional and histological measurements related to ards as well as viral load in lungs experimental designs will of course require appropriate trade-offs between study complexity and welfare and safety of animals and laboratory workers the serious and potentially lethal nature of covid-19 means that bsl3 laboratories are required for experiments using sars-cov-2 however insights into mechanisms driving covid-19 may still be derived from non-infectious models one example directly related to sars-cov-2 is the effects of absence of ace2 function on enhancement of the pulmonary edema response which were established using a mouse acid inhalation model which to provoke rapid and severe pulmonary edema kuba et al 2005  this finding has led to ongoing trials to assess whether administration of recombinant ace2 may address infection-related deficiencies in lung barrier protective ace2-derived angiotensin ii generation in addition to potential action as a decoy preventing viral entry into cells some urgently needed studies of putative therapeutic agents for covid-19 particularly those targeting host responses may therefore be possible or supportive using other lung injury models with higher throughput influenza viruses have been adapted to infect mouse cells and can be used for viral induced lethal lung injury experiments in mice in more widely available bsl2 laboratories where the mechanisms under study might feasibly be shared in sars-cov-2 responses however immune responses to coronaviruses and influenza are not the same as for example knockout of complement component 3 in mice is detrimental in influenza h1n1 and h5n1 infection models obrien et al 2011  but beneficial in sars-cov infection models gralinski et al 2018  viral pseudotypes expressing sars-cov-2 spike may also be useful for in vivo non-bsl3 studies of antiviral efficacy hoffmann et al 2020  although these will not model the evasion mechanisms and immunopathology unique to sars-cov-2 or related coronaviruses there are many other models used for the study of ards in mice and other model organisms closer phylogenetically and anatomically to humans matute-bello et al 2008 aeffner et al 2015  of these lung injury caused by instillations of bacteria or endotoxins ventilation and antibodies may be particularly relevant to covid-19 complicated by secondary infections barotrauma and antibody reactions and associated dysregulated responses additionally there may be central mechanisms of ards progression and resolution meaning that non-viral models may have utility for rapid proof-of-concept studies outside of bsl3 conditions although it is likely that in many cases efficacy studies with sars-cov-2 infection will also be needed known risk factors for severe covid-19 offer opportunities to drive models towards pathological states figure 1  advanced age obesity and diabetes are additional risk factors associated with high case-fatality rates covid-19 onder et al 2020 petrilli et al 2020  these features may predispose towards severe disease through complicating medical treatment by hypoventilation as a result of low cardiorespiratory fitness and through dysregulated immunity with imbalance of inflammation and repair mechanisms as well as a propensity for underlying cardiovascular disease and changes to haemostasis that will influence progression of respiratory infection towards ards tzoran et al 2018 sattar et al 2020  use of aged animals might allow for modelling of the age risk factor it is encouraging in this light that early development of pre-clinical models of covid-19 includes the influence of age in rhesus macaques infection with sars-cov-2 reportedly led to heightened lung pathology and viral replication in older macaques 15 years old compared to younger animals 5 years old  additionally aged mice have previously demonstrated exacerbated inflammation and lung injury following sars-cov infection rockx et al 2009  animal models which require ageing over years may not permit the rapid testing of treatments which is required for the covid-19 pandemic models incorporating other risk factors such as induced obesity eg high fat diet-induced diabetes eg leptin receptor deficiency paul et al 2007  or impaired immune responses eg stat1 knockoutinhibition frieman et al 2010  might be made available more quickly additionally covid-19 may progress to severe disease status as a result of immune priming secondary infections or intravascular sequelae and so combining sars-cov-2 infection models with a first or second hit such as immune priming with lps or additional challenges such as the non-bsl3 approaches to cause lung injury described above ie inoculation with pathogenic bacteria or injections of injurious antibodies might be capable of driving host responses towards a pathological state as discussed above severe covid-19 is also associated with low blood platelet counts and thrombosis a consumptive coagulopathy and a hyperinflammatory state involving platelet activation release of nets and prolonged systemic elevations of cytokines such as il-6 and cxcl10 these pathological features associated with severe disease have not yet been demonstrated in animal models table 1  the degree of thrombocytopaenia has been reported as a potential biomarker for severe covid-19 lippi et al 2020  a large retrospective study revealed the degree of thrombocytopaenia to be dynamic after presentation to clinic with decreasing platelet numbers being predictive of mortality later on  furthermore a shift in platelet-lymphocyte ratio may indicate the occurrence of an acute inflammatory or thrombotic event and therefore have prognostic value qu et al 2020  thus thrombocytopaenia may reflect 1 alteration in thrombopoiesis due to the bone marrow or lungs and potentially spleen being inflamedreceiving inflammatory and trauma-related thrombopoietic cues 2 localized lung recruitment of platelets as a facet of their role in the immune response or alveolar coagulation 3 disseminated intravascular coagulation dic throughout the body xu et al 2020a  or 4 platelet-viral interaction although this remains hypothetical as an engagement of platelets with sars-cov-2 has not been described amgalan  othman 2020  evidence from other disease states with features of covid-19 pathology indicate potential causative roles of platelets in the worsening of the disease which might therefore provide opportunities for adaption of more severe mechanistic models of severe covid-19 reports on animal studies published to date have not included measurements of these pathological responses but their detection would be useful further evidence for successful modelling of mechanisms of severe disease results of studies in mice modelling influenza agree on the necessity for platelets in the immune response and inflammation but conflict as to whether this is beneficial guo et al 2017 campbell et al 2019  or detrimental boilard et al 2014 l et al 2015  additionally platelets have been shown to respond to influenza virus to increase complement availability and encourage the release of nets into blood and so platelets may be important integrators linking viral infection to neutrophil responses that are associated with coagulopathy and venous thrombosis koupenova et al 2019  furthermore platelets have a complex relationship with lung inflammation in that they can be both protective of the alveolar capillary-barrier or can promote excessive vascular leak weyrich and zimmerman 2013 middleton et al 2018  given the importance of platelets in coagulopathies dic and alveolar thrombi the innate immune response and hyperinflammation their influence on the patency of the alveolar-capillary unit and the association of low blood platelet counts with severe disease the manipulation of platelets might be a useful experimental tool to reciprocate these pathological events in animal models of sars-cov-2 infection our previous findings that experimental thrombocytopenia can convert a mild selfresolving bacterial lung infection to a more severe form of systemic infection with extra-pulmonary organ involvement and death amison et al 2018 suggest that the induction of severe experimental thrombocytopenia 95 depletion in animal models of sars-cov-2 may allow these infection models to demonstrate the progression from a mild to severe disease phenotype additionally pulmonary platelet retention can be induced by intravenous injections with anti-mhc class i antibodies which are also associated with thrombocytopenia and release of nets looney et al 2009 caudrillier et al 2012  use of these antibodies combined with infection models might be useful in modelling the contributions of platelets and nets to severe covid-19 associated with lung hypoperfusion release of nets and autoantibody production zhang et al 2020c  the involvement of fcriia in viral platelet responses suggests that transgenic expression of human fcriia on platelets may be useful in driving greater platelet responses in murine sars-cov-2 infection models as mice lack activating fc receptors on platelets boilard et al 2014  treatment with heparin or low molecular weight heparin has been associated with reduced mortality in clinical studies of covid-19 yin et al 2020  and nebulised delivery of heparin is associated with a reduced requirement for ventilation in patients hospitalised by other respiratory diseases such as severe copd dixon et al 2010 shute et al 2018 ashoor et al 2020  although heparin is classically used as an anticoagulant it has also been demonstrated to bind and reduce the activity of a range of cytokines implicated in the covid-19-associated cytokine storm mulloy et al 2015  and also interacts with the sars-cov-2 spike protein in a manner which causes structural alteration of the ace2-binding domain which is likely to reduce viral entry mycroft-west et al 2020  the potentially useful polypharmacy of heparin underlines the need for integrated in vivo sars-cov-2 infection models incorporating simultaneous and clinically relevant measurements of coagulation cytokines and viral load in addition to platelet number the severity of covid-19 disease progression also correlates closely with levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators such as cxcl10 interferon-inducible protein 10 and tnfalpha both associated with the pathology and progression associated with hyperinflammatory condition associated with ards tang et al 2005  bautista et al 2013 yang et al 2020  the amelioration of lps induced ards following cxcl10 neutralisation in rats and the proposition of anti-tnfalpha therapy in covid-19 patients therefore highlights the potential for combining sars-cov-2 infections with tnfalpha and cxcl10 challenge as a further method in the development of models with a more severe phenotype lang et al 2017 feldman et al 2020  this article is protected by copyright all rights reserved persistence of infection and inflammation due to ineffective viral clearance is a key feature of severe covid-19 although maintenance of infection and systemic cytokine release has not yet been reported in animal models of sars-cov-2 infection a potential approach to model this feature of severe disease is the experimental disruption of important antiviral host defence pathways a key mediator of defensive signalling might be the transcription factor stat1 the genetic deletion of which can convert a mild sars-cov mouse infection model into one resulting in 100 mortality frieman et al 2010  pharmacologic inhibitors of stat1 are available miklossy et al 2013  and may be useful in the rapid development of animal models with deficiencies in protective antiviral responses without the requirement for multigenerational crosses or ageing out of laboratory animals dysregulated immune responses by myeloid leukocytes may also be important in pathogenesis of severe disease barnes et al 2020  although the impact of covid-19 on cystic fibrosis patients is still unclear colombo et al 2020  mouse models of cystic fibrosis mutations involve heightened platelet activation and a hyperinflammatory state with increased neutrophil responses so these models might be useful in driving increased severity of pathology ortiz-muoz et al 2020  efficacy studies using animal models of many disease processes have been criticised for over-use of the prophylactic application of interventions ie pretreatment when such approaches would not be realistic for clinical treatments denayer et al 2014  severe covid-19 has a characteristic time course which suggests that there are several windows where different treatment approaches might be useful figure 2  users of animal models for covid-19 research should wherever possible assess the time course of readouts in their models and consider the type of therapeutic being assessed the potential of risk to patients from any anticipated adverse effects and whether the intervention will likely need to take place in a hospital setting for example as viral replication increases likelihood of transmission and persistent infection mediates severe disease antivirals with low toxicity might be useful for all diagnosed cases and perhaps even prophylactically in high-risk populations some interventions such as nebulised heparin may be of benefit as anti-viral agents mycroft-west et al 2020 and in reducing the inflammatory response dixon et al 2010 mulloy et al 2015 and there may need to be dosed at different time points across the development of covid-19 once severe disease develops interventions which are aimed at resolving ards and systemic complications would be useful and robust preclinical testing might require models which include aspects of intensive care support such as invasive ventilation alexander et al 2020  careful model characterization will be required to identify analogous phases of pathology development in animal models for appropriate timing of interventions under study animal models have been rapidly mobilised to address the need for greater understanding of covid-19 and for testing of new therapeutic approaches for this pandemic while useful observations have already been shared it is important that animal studies are adapted to measure and report key readouts that are relevant to clinical covid-19 such as evidence of lung injury resembling ards physiological gas exchange impairment hyperinflammation platelet responses and coagulopathy study designs may need to incorporate additional risk factors or disease triggers to shift from modelling protective and self-resolving infection and inflammation to recapitulating severe disease with ards and multi-organ failure  table 3  development of models that reproduce these hallmarks of disease will permit better understanding of covid-19 pathogenesis

cast on the phenomenon of trump most of which prove illuminating and nearly all of which register a feeling of trauma suggests the extent to which this phenomenon itself not only represents a significant perhaps ominous political event but offers a singular illumination of the present situation indeed if the phenomenon of trump brings the present conjuncture into an unprecedented focus it is precisely insofar as the situation of the present is not merely of the present but issues from and indeed carries over the contradictions of the pastcontradictions that are dialectical in the sense of walter benjamin insofar as they reveal an order of emergent temporality of the time of the event as one might say that is radically discontinuous with the continuous order of progress indeed the emergence of nearly every new celebrity phenomenon when it is not just a matter of a new celebrity filling out an existing type but a new type of celebrity instantiated in an utterly singular individual gives rise to a kind of uncanny feeling especially among those who are not quite with itwho lag behind in becoming aware of popular culture in a single moment that which had appeared impossible having no place in the world not only suddenly seems inevitable and necessary but draws everything else into its field of attraction allowing other things to appear only in relation to it a modal logician might of course still insist that there could be a possible world without lady gaga obama or trump but this world this absolutely singular world in which we existand we have never quite had the luxury of existing in another merely possible worldhas become utterly unthinkable without them since the entire horizon of sense has come to be warped around the facts of their existence as if around a black hole with trump this feeling has not only assumed a vastly greater and fundamentally traumatic intensity but is qualitatively distinct this is in part because the seeming triviality of celebrity phenomena and indeed of everything however enormous its impact which has been relegated to the sphere of private life eg the personal computer social networking serves a function similar to that of the stages proscenium it creates the illusion of a safe distance the distance indeed of illusion in relation to what is in fact threateningly close many such as inglis 2010 have recognized that celebrity as opposed to fame renown is characteristically modern or indeed as rojek 2004 argues ineluctably woven into the fabric of contemporary society but perhaps the phenomenon of celebrity itself together with all that is subsumed within its orbit might be regarded not simply as a consequence of modernity but as a coping mechanism a reaction formation that as such has itself made it possible to survive the condition of modernity and postmodernity it is a way of processing historical change itself insofar as it has already reached a feverish and traumatic pitch of intensity into safer less threatening forms a cutification of historical time as it were the continuum-breaking irruption of the new becomes noveltyan object of contemplative pleasure enjoyment intrigue fascination with trumps election however it is as if in a single blow the world of celebrity which had already begun to rub up against the other world of the reality show had suddenly become absolutely immanentlydangerouslyreal since trump was already a celebrity in the 1980s and indeed as a celebrity businessman already straddled two worlds and unsettled the protecting veil of illusion and it is instructive in this way to take note of the two domains over which he claims his tasteless mastery television and architectureintimately related and yet polar opposites his ascent to politician indeed to leader of the free world involves a second-order shock a second-order event it is as if the entire order bound up in the phenomenon of celebrity has become the only thing it never could have been before real the enormity of this event must be recognized for what it is whatever else happens and it is perhaps still too soon to tell this has already happened the logic of celebrification transforming the event into noveltythe domestication and cutification of historical time itselfhaving served as the principal shock absorber for the shocks of modernity has in a shocking and sudden fashion failed there is now only celebrity or no celebrity celebrity has become a quantitative rather than qualitative factor as is made evident when one considers how the various ranking schemes organizing social media allow a hitherto impossible comparison between say a teenage girl in topeka kansas live-feeding videos of her cat to her ten followersor even the cat itselfand lady gaga with her millions of minions before we thought of celebrities as outliers deviations from a human norm now we think of even ourselves as failed celebrities there are now only monsters little and big no one and perhaps nothingnot even animals one thinks of cecil the lionthat are still able to exist at all if they exist outside the monstrations of media and hence there is also no realityauthoritative serious securebeyond the veil of celebrity save perhaps in the most intimate disgusting facets of daily life it is in this way that we might make sense of the recent somewhat hyperbolic talk about post-truth it is not that correspondence truth has suddenly disappeared from the world or even that the norms guiding most forms of praxis and discourse have been undermined rather what has happened is this previously media interfaced with the real by way of a strata of authorities who themselves media figures and celebrities were nevertheless able to set up a protective barrier between the mediascape and the realscape by offering an authorized authority-bearing opinion regardless what this opinion was and whose interests state corporate ideological it represented its demonstrative authoritativeness buttressed by serious gazes and steady stentorian tones served to keep the two worlds apart daytime tv might be dominated by all manner of triviality silliness melodrama but come evening when the men have returned home from work and families are gathered back together walter cronkite would remind everyone that far away a war was being fought that their neighbors sons were dying that students were protesting that the world was changing the shocks of real history this is to say were tied back to the comforting continuity of authoritative knowledge sound common sense abiding ethical political juridical norms whereas the novelty of the eventalways already corresponding to nothing the event is always already post-truthwas relegated to the sphere of the trivial and ephemeral now however this mediating functioncalled into question from both the top down and the bottom up squeezed from all sideshas lost much of its efficacy it is becoming increasingly clear that not only as the prophets of postmodernity anticipated is there no outside to the media but that the qualitative texturingthe topographic distinctionswithin the mediascape have been flattened out such that they remain mere quantitative signifers of qualitative differences akin to the markings on a topographic map the following paper does not claim to offer an exhaustive definitive analysis of the phenomenon of trump but rather seeks to encounter the vertiginous movement of event-full history by bringing into focus trump as a dialectical image for the contradictions of the present situation perhaps the most fundamental methodological principle of this investigation is the belief grounded in the remarks of the previous paragraphs that in order to gain access to the dialectical torsion at work it is necessary to start out by juxtaposing something seemingly trivial and ephemeral with that which brings the further-reaching historical horizon into view hence i will attempt to read trump starting from what might seem like an unlikely constellation on the one hand his board games and on the other fichtes highly philosophical political-economic treatise on the closed commercial state a text which may be regarded as the founding document of economic nationalism insofar as it defends the necessity of restrictions on commerce going far beyond the tactics of mercantilism not in terms of the comparative advantages to be gained by one party over another but in terms of what is absolutely necessary for the sovereign nation state to exist even though the economic nationalism of trump and bannon shares almost nothing concrete with fichtes proposals it does draw at least at an ideological level on principles that find very pure expression in fichtes treatise this is nowhere so clear than in trumps infamous promise to build a wall and make mexico pay for it this expresses the very essence of fichtean closurefichte too believes he can make other countries payhollowed out into a purely rhetorical gesture this is needless to say only one possible approach to the complex phenomenon that is trump and trumpism and yet its seemingly willful arbitrariness is precisely what is methodologically demanded only a chance point of departure can offer a point of access to that which relentlessly undermines all the resources of sound political juridical scientific reasoning among so many other firsts one suspects that donald j trump 45th president of the usa is not only the first head of state of a world power to have hosted his own reality show but can also claim the distinction of having not one not two but at least three board games consecrated to his name donald trump the game im back and your fired and the apprentice board game given that the first of these predates his reality tv show the apprentice by 15 years this suggests a certain telos driving the peculiar phenomenon that is donald trumpit could even seem as though if the survival-format reality show had not existed trump would have had to invent it1 the fulfillment of donald trump is to become the game-master the dealerthe house and yet this is perhaps not quite as simple as it might seem the house is the structure the system the law those who play the game are submitted to contingency they must compete with one another and are exposed to all the moods that go with the ups and downs of fortune the housethe system the structureby contrast like the divine beings of which the german poet friedrich hlderlin writes feels nothing experiences nothing if it is possible to occupy the position of the house it is only by becoming inhuman incapable of human pleasure trump however seems to want it both ways he wants to be the house free of risk but also free of joy and he wants to be a winner the biggest winner he wants to be both the dealer and the one who deals consummately with that which has been dealt precisely this double desire is articulated throughout trumps the art of the deal from its first pages trump claims that his animating desirethe ultimate good orienting all his choices and actionsis neither wealth nor even as one might suspect now more than ever and which is certainly in fact the case poweri dont do it for the money ive got enough much more than ill ever need i do it to do it deals are my art form other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry i like making deals preferably big deals thats how i get my kicks trump and schwartz 1987deal-making is an end in itself i do it to do itwhich is to say following aristotle deal-making belongs among the activities that can coherently be pursued for its own sake that is not merely a means to an end but an end in itself it determines a form of life in the fullest sense in the first book of the nicomachean ethics aristotle speaks of three ways of life that hold a special prominence gathering together and illuminating our varied paths as human beings upon the face of the earth the life of pleasure the political life the life of honor or of virtue and the contemplative life aristotle 2002 each of these lives is oriented around a good that can coherently present itself as the meaningful and meaning-giving end of human action by contrast the life of money making is a type of compulsory activity and it is clear that wealth is not the good being sought since it is instrumental and for the sake of something else aristotle 2002 for trump it would seem deal-making is a fourth kind of life it is worth taking a few moments to consider this claim and indeed to take it seriously far more seriously than it might at first seem to merit if deal-making can be subsumed as species to genus under one of aristotles existing three lives then trumps claim that deal-making can be done just for the sake of doing it would not amount to much yet perhaps things are not so straightforward and the deal-making life cannot be easily subsumed under aristotles rubrics let us suppose to begin with that deal-making is merely part of the active life the political life the agora the place of assembly in democratic athens was nothing else than a market place if deal-making is a political activity and even in the highest sense then it is nevertheless of a peculiar and peculiarly modern kindperhaps almost unrecognizable to aristotle it must be understood in terms of the modern reconception of politics in terms of a social contracta social contract that is not merely foundational but constantly being renegotiated with political life the continual conflict between contracting parties but there is also another possibility aristotle does not include the life of the artist among the three prominent lives he cannot imagine as can we moderns creativity and artistic production not only as something done for its own sake but as a life that can claim a dignity and significance equal or perhaps greater than that of the politician or thinker so we might say rather that the life of deal-making is a version of the creative life made possible as hannah arendt 1998 had argued in the human condition by the post-classical ascendance of homo faber or finally drawing together these two points we could even say that deal-making exemplifies the way in which political life is transformed through the rise of homo faber yet this conclusion does not seem quite adequate either since as hannah arendt argues the modern world is characterized by the rise of homo laborans and the suppression of both the life of making as well as activity we cannot then discount the possibility that deal-making belongs also or perhaps principally to the life of pleasure and even the life of contemplation if indeed deal-making is a kind of art a kind of artistic life it is characterized by a fastness and looseness an openness to the momentmost people are surprised by the way i work i play it very loose i dont carry a briefcase i try not to schedule too many meetings i leave my door open you cant be imaginative or entrepreneurial if youve got too much structure i prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops theres rarely a day with fewer than fifty calls and often it runs to over a hundred in between at least a dozen meetings the majority occur on the spur of the moment and few of them last longer than 15 min trump and schwartz 1987whereas the artist as conceived by aristotle brings forth the form contemplated beforehand by working upon the material the deal-maker a master improviser makes it up as he goes along open to what is given playing with what is given making the best of every situation2 art has become play if aristotles techn as heidegger 2002 argues is a kind of epistm involving knowledge of the form that is brought forth into the presence in the act of making then deal-making involves a peculiar knowledge quite different from knowledge of forms of the generic universal eternal the deal-maker gains knowledge of the situation the essence of the situation is the conflict the polemos that plays out with every decision that gets played out in every deal in the words of heraclituss famous fragment                      war is father of all and king of all and some he has shown as gods others men some he has made slaves others free heraclitus 1979translated into trump the deal is the leader it shows the winners and the losers the deal-maker is the one who to the greatest degree possible experiences the deal who partakes of the pleasure of deal-making of living as close to the center of the deal as possible perhaps then if deal-making constitutes an autonomous self-sufficient prominent mode of life it is because it gathers together all the other possibilities of life politics and activity more generally artistic creation knowledge and contemplation and pleasure into a single mode of life that is or at least seems to be capable of managing dealing with the modern condition the deal-maker claims at once to master the fluidity of modern life and to submit pleasurably to this fluidity to experience it as pleasure if the first chapter of the art of the deal marches us through a week of vertiginous deal-making the second chapter titled trump cards as if bringing a bit of order to the chaos will describe the elements of the deal it is not clear that deal-making can be taught more than anything else i think deal-making is an ability youre born with its in the genes still deal-making is not gambling the deal-maker confronts the contingency of the moment but he does not submit to chancepeople think im a gambler ive never gambled in my life to me a gambler is someone who plays slot machines i prefer to own slot machines its a very good business being the houseits been said that i believe in the power of positive thinking in fact i believe in the power of negative thinking i happen to be very conservative in business i always go into the deal anticipating the worst if you plan for the worstif you can live with the worstthe good will always take care of itself trump and schwartz 1987the deal-maker at once submits to the deal experiencing its vertiginous play and yet indemnifies himself against all risk by imagining and even living with what under the given circumstances would be the worst deal the deal-maker is able to elevate himself beyond true risk but of course ultimately the worst deal the ultimate trump card is death itself the only way to indemnify the deal-maker against even this risk is to live only for the sake of the pleasure of the moment closing the chapter trump writesi dont kid myself life is very fragile and success doesnt change that if anything success makes it more fragile anything can change without warning and thats why i try not to take any of whats happened seriouslythe real excitement is playing the game if you ask me exactly what the deals im about to describe all add up to in the end im not sure i have a very good answer except that ive had a very good time making them trump and schwartz 1987here the paradoxical nature of deal-making as a form of life a manner of living reveals itself most fully the deal-master tries to experience the deal and master the deal at one and the same time he tries to master the deal by forethought anticipation of risk and yet the greatest degree of forethought brings us before a risk a fragility to things that cannot be surmounted so it would seem the deal-maker must live for the present the life of the deal is not a life of art of creativity but a life of pleasure the temporal horizon of the deal-maker collapses into the present and yet it is also not clear if the deal-maker can ever actually experience the pleasure of the moment it never stops and i wouldnt have it any other way i try to learn from the past but i plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present thats where the fun is and if it cant be fun whats the point trump and schwartz 1987 one can only live in the moment but the moment only exists in the future ultimately fun is had only in the past the life of deal-making lives fully in a present that only ever exists in the future and only ever knows that it has lived at all by looking back at all the fun it has had fun in fact is not something we feel something we enjoy but something that is made bought had the commodity form of pleasure in the last pages i have tried to show that trumps deal-maker his deal-making as a way of life exemplifies the paradoxical temporality of life under late capitalism one might speak in this way of a psychopathology of everyday life though perhaps in a sense that owes as much to heidegger as to freud what is most interesting about this account is that it shows the pathology from the side of the winner the absolute winner usually capitalist pathologies start from the side of the losers failed salesmen drug addicts compulsive gamblers neurotics of all shapes and stripes3 now it is possible to see that the pathology of the loser is merely a special case and limiting case of the pathology of the winner yet what interests me above all is the way in which this pathology already manifests itself in fichtes thoughtand not simply as a private quirk an idiosyncrasy but as the constitutive horizon of german idealism and even of modern philosophy as such a horizon that continues to play itself out not only in hegel schopenhauer and nietzsche but even in heideggerthis is not meant as a critique ad hominem it speaks to the greatness of a thinker to bring forth the ruling characteristics of the age even if this is itself pathological a more far-reaching version of this argument could be sketched out as follows whereas for aristotle luck and chance mark the limit to causal explanation and hence to the rational articulation of what is things can be said to happen by chance yet chance is not a cause in its own right modern philosophy as is clear in empiricism will begin to regard contingency as a primary and positive source of knowledge the tension between necessity and contingency as also between autonomy and heteronomy comes to the fore german idealism regards this tension as generative productive and ultimately seeks a systematic reconciliation heidegger in turn following schelling and nietzsche and also hlderlin returns to this tension but makes it irreducible fundamental starting with his existential analysis of thrownness and projection the most recent philosophical encomiums to radical contingency must themselves be seen in this light the current paper will restrict itself to addressing only one piece of this puzzle though indeed a very important piece for indeed fichte recognized with greater clarity than most if not all of his contemporaries that the experience of life as a game of chance is the constitutive horizon of the present age yet at the same time he rejected both the hegelian conviction which even certain forms of marxism would continue to hold on to that this game is stacked in the direction of progress as well as schellings belief that a purely ideological mastery of the game would suffice for fichte by contrast the gaming quality of modern life demanded one last gamble that could only play itself out on the world-historical stage an extraordinarily risky play that will bring the game to an end the only way to master the game is to finish it in the eighth and final section of the third and final book of the closed commercial state fichte having presented what he regards as an absolutely compelling case for a proposal that if carried through would bring the ills of the world to an end turns in anticipation to the question that must necessarily come to preoccupy all those whose philanthropic measures are rejected and mocked by the very ones they most wish to help why wont they just do what i say4 after observing the incapacity of the great part of mankind to follow out an argument presented as a series of deductions from first principles he proceeds to set forth the true reason why the ideas he has proposed are most profoundly displeasing to so many who cannot bear to think of the state of things at which they aimit is a characteristic feature of our age standing in sharp relief to the seriousness and sobriety of our ancestors to wish to play and madly swarm to and fro with its fantasy and since there are few other means available to satisfy this play-urge it has a strong inclination to turn life into a game fichte 2013for fichte this tendency is not itself something blameworthy but rather a necessary step induced through nature alone on the path that leads our species forward suggesting that while like schillers speiltrieb it is rooted in something innate its manifestation has a decisively historical character nor moreover is its primary manifestation aesthetic or even intellectual rather the primary expression of this tendency where its effects prove most pernicious is in the sphere of economicsas a consequence of this tendency one never wishes to obtain anything by following a rule but instead to have everything through cunning ruses and luck acquisition and all human commerce should resemble a game of chance one could allow these men to have keeping to the straight and narrow the very things they hope to gain through intrigues cheating and chance save on the condition that they now be content with it for the rest of their lives they would then not want it it delights them more to strive for things cunningly than to possess them securely it is these people who incessantly call out for freedomfreedom of trade and acquisition freedom from supervision and policing freedom from all order and morality whatever aims at strict regularity and at things taking a firmly ordered thoroughly uniform course will appear to them as an infringement on their natural freedom such people must be repelled at the very thought of an arrangement of public commerce in which swindling speculation accidental profits and sudden wealth would no longer occur fichte 2013this tendency fichte goes on to claim gives rise to a frivolity more concerned with present enjoyment than future security and whose life wisdom for individuals and its politics for states consists only in the art of getting out of the present jam with no care given to the future difficulties that one is thrust into through the remedy that was taken for such frivolity the security of the future which one promises to it and which it never itself desires is no valid substitute for the unbridled freedom of the moment that alone entices it fichte 2013 it is hard not to appreciate the prescience and force of fichtes diagnosis and not least of all since it would seem as though even if the emergence of a complex apparatus of regulative structures and the welfare state might give the appearance of progress these measures appear in the end not only as reactive and insufficient but have proven incapable of resisting the triumphant march of neoliberalism which especially in the shape given to it by hayek and the chicago school has turned the anarchic power of chance now elevated and scientifically legitimated as a power of spontaneous self-organization into the ultimate principle of things precisely because fichte regards the fundamental tendency of his age not as one countervailing factor among others in a progressively unfolding historical dialectic but as an extreme horizon in which the very possibility of any sort of goal-directed action is called into question he must reject the view of the political given brilliant expression two decades later with hegels elements of the philosophy of right as the reconciliation of the freedom and particularity of the individual with the abstract universality of the state thus the closed commercial state itself proposes a social arrangement in which the economic existence of every individual is completely regulated by the state which grants to each individual not only the right to pursue a certain defined economic activity extracting produce from this piece of land pursuing this specific trade but guarantees that in return for their labor they will be able to provide themselves with the necessities of life citizens will be forbidden from freely engaging in economic activity with foreign entities and indeed travel abroad will only be permitted to scholars and artists even though this vision of the state might seem perversely anti-modern fichte indeed regards it as the culmination of the historical process of modernity the emergence of the sovereign nation state reveals a tendency toward closure and yet the merely juridical closure of the westphalian state is not enough and must be supplemented by complete economic closure in a powerful and prescient analysis of the global order of colonial relations fichte argues that these are not only fundamentally exploitative but that they must ultimately lead to the complete destitution of weak nations which as a result of trade imbalances will ultimately be compelled to sell their own sovereignty to the highest bidder the closed commercial state consists in three books the first offers a rational deduction of the ideal arrangement of economic relations culminating in a theory of property as the exclusive right to a certain kind of activity the second concerns the history of the present arguing in effect that europe originally constituted a single vast system of trade and yet was in the process of dividing itself off into nation states here he claims that mercantilism itself represented a series of half-measures undertaken in pursuit of economic closure if one were to consider the passage cited above with a view only to the argument pursued in the first two books fichtes reasoning would seem peculiar if not altogether bizarre on the one hand there would seem little or no point in offering a proposal that is so contrary to the spirit of the age and its tendencies on the other hand if the tendency of the present age is toward closure then this would not only suggest that the present age is more serious than might first seem to be the case but that indeed the relation of the playful and the serious as modes of existence is more complex than fichtes closing words suggests or perhaps indeed if playfulness is itself a necessary step driving the species forward then this might imply that the playful wheeling and dealing man of the present is in fact the agent of world historys very serious intentions whereas fichtes economic philosophy in all its ponderous heavy teutonic seriousness is a non-starter such considerations it would seem must lead us to the path taken by hegel who moreover saw with great clarity the totalitarian tendencies of fichtes seemingly consequent liberalism the third book of the closed commercial state however moves in an altogether different direction here fichte proposes nothing less than a kind of trick for catalyzing a chain of commercial closures this trick introduced under the title of politics goes as follows one of the dominant economic powers in the world will suddenly carry out a money operation that involves replacing all the gold currency used within its borders with a national currency made of a material that is at once cheap and yet impossible for private parties to counterfeit whose value is fixed and whose validity is guaranteed by the state the first state that does this will reap tremendous benefits instantly nearly doubling its wealth since its gold will be freed up from its function as a domestic means of exchange it will be able to acquire tremendous military power which it can and must use for the sole purpose of claiming the natural boundaries needed for a self-sufficient economic existence other states seeing this will follow though they will benefit less than the first eventually all states will be compelled to close themselves off economically just to survive it can hardly escape us that fichtes money operation consists in an enormous and seemingly mad geo-politico-economic wager if the first country to close itself off can reap the greatest benefits it is only because it has exposed itself to the greatest risk i do not think it could have escaped fichte that the money operation might have instantly led to an immediate and disastrous political crisis fichte does not spend much time on these risks but this is not because he does not take them seriously but rather because he is concerned above all with selling his proposal to those who are in a position of power he we might say is convinced that the danger that the present world faces is so great that only this sort of gamble could lead us back from the abyss what he fears most of all is that the very economic conditions which allow for a noble free truly human existence will be destroyed in the best tradition of the philosophers he is afraid for philosophy for the dignity of contemplative human reason and yet it is precisely the characteristic of the present age its love of risk and gambles and tricks and cunning that makes fichtes world-historical wager possible only a world that loves to gamble could find a statesman crazy enough to gamble everything but what is the payoff peace on earthamong states and within each states own territory an abrupt end to the dynamism of history the substitution of the madness of history with a gentle stable progress based on the peaceful but very limited interactions of nation states each with its own well-defined rich national characteronce this system has become universal and eternal peace is established among the different peoples there is not a single state on the face of the earth that will have the slightest interest in keeping its discoveries from any other since each will only use these for its own needs inside its boundaries and not to oppress other states and provide itself with superiority over them nothing it follows will prevent the scholars and artists of all nations from entering into the freest commerce with one another the public papers will no longer contain stories of wars and battles peace treaties or alliances for all these things will have vanished from the world they will only contain news of the advances of science of new discoveries of progress in legislation and the police and each state will hasten to make itself home to the inventions of other fichte 2013almost two centuries before francis fukayama and more than a 100 years before kojeve fichte envisions the end of history and yet the end of history will not be brought forth more or less of its own accord through the ruse of history driving forward through suffering and contradiction toward the absolute but through the ruse of fichte perhaps had fichte not existed another great thinker would have figured out the money operationyet whoever discovers it and however long this takes it will always involve an event that intervenes in the existing order of things catalyzing a chain reaction of occurrences that will leave the world utterly transformed5 this event is not destined or necessitated in any way it is an intervention and an invention a fundamentally new kind of currency imposed from the top down introducing a new kind of numismatic regime a new sovereignty beyond all sovereignty6 for fichte true property must issue in free activity he indeed believes that the fundamental error of all existing theories of property consists in the fact that one posits the first original property in the exclusive possession of a thing against this his theory maintains that the first and original property the basis of all others consists in an exclusive right to a determinate free activity fichte 2013 but if we take this idealistic theory of property already developed with great consequence seriously then we might ask how is it that the human race appropriates its own history such that it can become most fully the property of itself in its historical existenceor such that indeed its historical existence could be the very event of self-appropriation this is a vital question a necessary question since without this historical self-appropriation human freedom would amount to nothing the thought of the early humanistic marx still operates within the horizon of this question and it is perhaps still even at work in heideggers ereignisthe propriative event here however the difference between fichte and hegel comes into striking view for hegel history is the ongoing process by which absolute spirit appropriates itself passing from dunamis to energeia it is in just this sense indeed that hegel could have never actually entertained an end to history in any simple sense for fichte by contrast the highest appropriative event is the wager of the philosopher-statesman the wager to end all wagers and hence end a history that has been characterized by chance there is in this way a kind of platonism at work in fichte the philosopher is the one who owing nothing to the world in which he was born precipitates an event of conversion the first in the chain of liberating actions human beings can only take ownership of their historical existence hence of their humanity by acting in a decisive way against the riskiness in which their existence is enmeshed and yet such a decision which need in fact only happen once and can originate with one visionary is itself risky to the highest degree it is only possible as the highest wager the secret motto of fichtes closed commercial state is one could almost say the hlderlinian bon mot coined 2 years later that heidegger writing in the wake of the devastation of the second world war draws on in the question concerning technology wo aber gefahr ist wchst das rettende auchwhere the danger is there too is salvation the saving power yet this must give us pause fichte offers a powerful and prescient critique of the form of life that now more than ever has come to prevail under the conditions of capitalism but he also succumbs to the conceit that it would be possible to play the game and master the game at the same time to expose oneself to risk while indemnifying oneself against risk one might claim that risk-taking has no essential value for fichte i do not think this is so however speculative thought is risk-taking thought the speculative desire of the philosopher is of a piece with the characteristic of the age indeed fichte recognizes as much when claiming that many wrongly blame poetry and philosophy for the frivolousness of the age he remarks that poetry and philosophy are not responsible for this phenomenon but merely serve in the case of the former to divert it toward something else than life and in the case of the latter to challenge it to the extent that it concerns itself with life this can only mean that in its proper domainbeyond the sphere of ordinary lifephilosophy remains playful precisely this is the bad faiththe pathologyof capitalism as a form of life which moreover assumes ever more complex and concrete forms with the emergence of new and ever more intricate ways of monetizing risk capitalism fetishizes risk and yet the more that precariousness becomes the general condition the more that capitalists are able to profit from a risk in which they no longer has to partake the paradox of this pathology however is as follows the more relentlessly the losers at the game of life find themselves exposed to this precariousness the more they struggle to find a perspective for their own lives according to which they can become masters of the risk to which they are exposed contemporary forms of life are characterized by this dualism which itself functions as ideology regardless the particular forms it assumes let us consider once more donald trumps reality show the apprentice this genre of reality show should be thought of as a perverted brechtian drama brechts plays sought to present the human condition with its relentless struggle for survival in such a way that we could realize that this is not a fateful tragic condition to which we are condemned but a historical reality that we have created for ourselves the reality show turns this on its head the struggle for survival appears on the one hand as purely the effect of the artificial contrivances of the show which has forced people together into a confined space to compete in contrived challenges and yet at the same time elevates this very artifice to a law of fate it says in effect we must struggle against each other because the celebrity game-master tells us we must do so we must submit to the celebrity game-master because everyone who is not a celebrity everybody who is a nobody on the way to becoming somebody must want to be a celebrity yet watching the reality show grants a pleasure that is denied to the participants they are perhaps on the way to becoming celebrities they have even been granted a little piece of celebrity but they cannot identify with the game-master we however who are watching we who are not even participants in the game we who are bigger losers than the biggest loser can nevertheless identify completely with the celebrity game-master passing judgment on the winners and losers youre firedi knew it we think to ourselves that apprentice did such a bad job she deserved to lose now theyll know whose the boss if there is a uniquely american style of fascism now in the offing it consists at heart in this logic of identification it is a fascism in other words that no longer depends on the suppression of the individual in the name of communitarian or collective valuesvalues which however cynical their deployment by the propagandists of the ruling elite nevertheless retain strong rhetorical force among the multitude donald trump at once master of the game and master-player offers the perfect point for a new mode of identification in which we identify ourselves not with the state the collective by sacrificing our claim to individual autonomy and rights but rather identify ourselves in our atomized individuality with the system that governs our lives dispenses with our lives without either demanding sacrifice or offering the hope of rediscovering our individuality in the universal we take pleasure in the system live vicariously through the system even though this itself inevitably condemns us however much fun we have along the way to lose7 it is in this sense that we can understand trumps economic nationalism on the one hand it is the very opposite of fichtes it has nothing to do with securing economic rights and economic justice through even a limited recognition of the responsibility of the state to provide its citizens with the possibility of a livelihood sufficient to allow for a dignified fully human life it has nothing to do even as some in the alt-right might have it with the cultural integrity of the nation state rather trumps economic nationalism follows from the elevation of the president to the deal-maker-in-chief economic relations between nations this is to say are mere occasions for the leader to show off his deal-making prowess and this in turn serves to allow for popular identification with the one who is able to play the game enjoy the game and master it at the same time who can keep on playing the game and yet can never lose in the case of trump of course this identification itself only happens through various exclusions of the racial and ethnic and sexual of foreigners of liberals of women who refuse objectification and now of the elderly the urban poor and those with preexisting conditions all of whose lives in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic have become expendable in the rush to reopen the economy while it is this aspect of trumps political style that has provoked the greatest degree of public outrage it also suggests a point of vulnerability in the logic of late capitalism for what it reveals above all is that it is still largely impossible to identify with the system to take pleasure in the system without these gestures of exclusion it might be tempting to claim that this is because the logic of exclusion is itself structurally necessary to the system yet while it may well be the case that capitalism at once depends on and gives rise to stratifications that fall outside the strict logic of class conflict the tendency of capitalism remains directed at the dissolution at least at the level of the explicit public ideology of all qualitative distinctions since these will inevitably stand in the way of the maximization of profit what trump has made clear in a particularly brutal fashion is that while it is increasingly necessary to identify with the system since all other forms of life have become hollowed out and can no longer offer a path to enjoyment and happiness it is also at least for a broad section of the population impossible to identify with the system in its outermost purity and abstraction to become relatable to become livable the system must again become precisely what it no longer is a nation an ethnicity a race thus in the eyes of many the system has become divided into two systems one good one evil the radically impersonal system of capitalism itself impersonated in the ethno-racial state and ultimately in the felicitous and happy image of the businessownertrump himself is a small businessman grown to monstrous proportionsand the radically impersonal system of the deep state impersonated in the scheming agent the journalist the cultural-marxist jew the need for this impersonation and the surge of explicitly exclusionary idioms back into mainstream national politics itself results from the failure of the project of division and identification that since the end of the second world war conservatism in the united states and england has pursued of the good system of life-affirming creative entrepreneurial capitalism versus the bad system of totalitarianism and government regulation yet the complete failure of trump to do anything beyond adventuresome grandstanding in the global arena to challenge the unfettered dominion of corporate interests suggests that the ethno-racial and nationalist impersonation of capitalism is just a mask for neoliberalism which remains in force this circumstance is dangerous to the highest degree but it also discloses an internal structural contradiction within late capitalism that may well also offer a certain hope it reveals the ultimate incapacity of capitalism to reproduce the ideological conditions of its survival  current global vaccine and drug efforts against covid-19 pros and cons of bypassing animal trials bijayeeta deb hemal shah suchi goel   the recent pandemic of novel coronavirus has already affected thousands of people and is continuing to spread around the world this virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease caused is called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of 5 may 2020 a total of 3517345 confirmed clinical episodes of covid-19 and 243401 deaths have been reported worldwide who 2020a most sars-cov-2-infected people experience mild to moderate respiratory distress and generally recover without requiring any special treatment however older people generally 60 years of age and those with underlying medical complications like diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious symptoms like acute respiratory disease and multiorgan failure ultimately leading to death lai et al2020 sars-cov-2 belongs to the same family as that of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle east respiratory syndrome viruses that were responsible for epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively lu et al2020 the genomes of sars-cov-2 is a single positive-strand rna and codes for similar structural protein as of sars giving rise to a debate about whether it is a laboratory engineered sars virus or a naturally evolved new virus the sequence analysis of its rna made available by china in the public database showed that it is a novel virus that originated possibly from bats through natural evolution andersen et al2020 however how it got transmitted from bats to humans with such high transmission rates from humans to humans is still ambiguous for infection into human cells the receptor-binding domain of spike protein s present on the envelope of the virus binds to ace2 protein present on human cells initiating the entry process this binding induces large conformational change in s protein that leads to exposure of its proteolytic site the proteolytic site is then cleaved by a protease causing the fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane completing the entry of the virus into a human cell further it is shown that the s protein of sars-cov-2 has a higher binding affinity with ace2 as compared to sars wrapp et al2020 based on these results it could be concluded that sars-cov-2 is a variant of sars however the sars-cov-2 genome has additional features like the presence of a polybasic rrar cleavage site at the junction of s1 and s2 subunits of the spike protein the presence of a polybasic cleavage site helps in effective cleavage by furin and proteases and determines viral infectivity and host range andersen et al 2020 interestingly in case of the avian influenza virus the gain of this polybasic site in ha that performs a similar function of host receptor binding like spike protein can transform the virus from low virulent to high virulent forms along with this the acquisition of cleavage site is positively selected for fast replication and transmission rates alexander and brown 2009 to better understand the transmission rates the growth rate r0 that defines the natural transmission of a pathogen needs to be calculated for sars mers and sars-cov-2 it is interesting to observe that although they belong to the same family sars-cov-2 has twice the transmission rate when compared to sars along with this the multiplication cycles range is 510 days for sars and mers and 23 days for sars-cov-2 liang 2020 probably this the reason why sars and mers were far more contained whereas covid-19 is highly widespread the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 during the early outbreak in wuhan china was calculated as 14 wu et al2020 however in late february who estimated this rate to increase to 58 on the other hand south korea registered a death rate of 1 or less while the death rate in italy seems to be for now several folds higher rosenbaum 2020 the infection has advanced to more than 210 countries and territories with an average mortality rate of 34 according to recent reports rajgor et al2020 therefore therapeutic and vaccine initiatives in this direction are inevitable efforts have been made in drug therapy as well as vaccine development to combat covid-19 till date the us food and drug administration fda has approved an antiviral drug remsdesivir developed by gilead inc usa and an antimalarial drug chloroquine cqhydroxychloroquine hcq for the treatment of covid-19 an array of drugs approved for other diseases are also considered potentially useful while several investigational drugs are under study in several clinical trials conducted across the globe table 1a and b figure 1 in order to clinically manage coronavirus researchers from china france and a team of doctors from rajasthan india have started using antiviral drugs in combination with chloroquine colson et al2020 lai et al2020 liu et al2020 recently who announced a global trial called solidarity to investigate whether this dangerous respiratory disease could be treated with the available therapeutic aids httpsnewsunorgenstory2020031059722 it is however an unprecedented effort that includes thousands of patients across many countries to volunteer for the clinical trials the trials aim to test the effectiveness of the four potential candidates 1 the antiviral drug remdesivir that is known to inhibit rna dependent rna polymerase 2 a combination of two hiv drugs lopinavir and ritonavir 3 lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferon beta and 4 the antimalarial drugs chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine table 1b coronavirus being a rna virus retroviral drugs could possibly have an effect on treatment however cqhcq which was successful as an antimalarial is currently being considered as a part of treatment strategy against covid-19 colson et al2020 cq has also been shown to possess anti-hiv activity through post-transcriptional inhibition of gp120 present on the viral envelope or inhibition of tat-mediated transactivation jiang et al1996 savarino et al2001 moreover chloroquine can also increase the ph of endosomes mauthe et al2018 since coronavirus do not encode for gp120 or tat protein and low ph is essential for uncoating of the virus inside the host cell it is more likely that chloroquine stops viral spread by blocking the process of uncoating and release of nucleic acid however the current data from various small and non-randomized trials show only limited effects of cqhcq or hcq-azithromycin combination on treatment for covid-19 since cqhcq is known to cause toxic effects and unprescribed use has led to human deaths large-scale randomized trials like the solidarity project will be able to convincingly prove the effectiveness of cqhcq as a drug against covid-19 recently it has been shown that combination of lopinavir-ritonavir causes adverse effects on covid-19-infected adults and no benefits are observed cao et al2020 therefore drugs should be used with caution until their mechanisms are well understood and their efficacy is well established it is also known with viruses that mutate at high frequencies give rise to different strains thereby easily gaining resistance to drugs thus in-depth analysis in animal models is required to study their mechanism of action and the ability of the virus to gain resistance against these drugs
further animal testing will also be important to measure absorbance of the drug in the body its dissociation chemistry its metabolomics and the mechanism of drug clearance in principle drugs only help in the treatment of humans once they contract the disease but for long-term protection against the disease vaccines have to be developed to avoid such a global pandemic vaccines will be able to mount an immune response against the virus by generating neutralizing antibodies that would protect humans when again infected with sars-cov-2 and thus avoid another outbreak of such a virulent virus as the key 12 amino acid residues present in ace2 of humans are conserved in ace2 of macaques as well melin et al2020 macaques are a closer model system to humans and hence the choice for animal studies for vaccine testing of covid-19 the studies with macaques have shown that they do get infected with pulmonary infiltrates as observed in radiographs with high viral loads in swabs of nose and throat and shedding in the upper and lower respiratory tract munster et al2020 rockx et al2020 taken together the disease symptoms in rhesus macaques matches with the milder symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection in humans further serum analysis demonstrate an increase in chemokine levels of il1ra il10 il15 mcp-1 il6 and decrease in tgf levels on days 1 and 3 post-infection but with no statistical significance munster et al2020 sars-cov-2 is known to affect older people as compared to young ones similarly it is also observed in macaques that older ones show higher viral loads in nose and throat along with prolonged viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of old animals rockx et al 2020 thus rhesus macaques can be a promising animal model for challenge studies and studying the efficacy of vaccines as immune responses in monkeys are similar to humans this will further allow us to understand how monkeys challenge coronavirus and protect themselves ferrets are model organisms for influenza virus and have similar lung morphology as humans and can actually cough and sneeze supporting their use as an animal model for sars-cov-2 cameron et al2012 enkirch and von messling 2015 a team of virologists led by ss vasan from australia has already shown that these animals are susceptible to coronavirus callaway 2020 but the virus only causes an increase in body temperature and other symptoms that are the hallmark for sars-cov-2 do not develop and the virus cannot replicate to high levels but interestingly the infected ferrets can spread the virus with high transmission rates even to adjacent cages through direct contact or aerosols kim et al2020 since most of the countries are now under community transmission stage ferrets will act as a valuable animal model to study the transmission of the sars-cov-2 compared with the logistics cost and ethical regulations in using monkeys and ferrets laboratory-bred mice always remain a convenient choice as a disease model however coronavirus do not infect mice and rats as 11 of the 29 amino acids in mice and 13 of 29 amino acids in rats differ in the binding region of ace2 compared to humans chan et al2020 in order to solve this problem perlman laboratory developed humanized mouse models for sars where they incorporated human ace2 in mice mccray et al2007 the humanized ace2 mice are successfully infected by sars and develop lethal brain disease making it an obvious choice to test infection with sars-cov-2 as well however due to lack of funding and high cost of maintenance of this mice colony they discontinued breeding of mice in their facility and submitted the sperms of hace2 mice to jackson laboratory but these mice are now high in demand and jackson laboratory is facing a huge pressure to meet these demands however recent results from china have shown that hace2 mice do support sars-cov-2 infection where they reduce weight by 20 and virus replication occur in lungs moreover infected hace2 mice also suffer from interstitial pneumonia where bronchioles are filled with periodic acid schiff pas positive exudation or detached bronchial epithelium but are unable to transmit the disease also the infiltrates are enriched in macrophages t-lymphocytes and b-lymphocytes the authors also confirmed that the mice use hace2 for entry and fulfill kochs postulates indicating that these mice are successful disease model for sars-cov-2 bao et al2020 these animals support sars infection and show maximum similarity to human ace2 where only 4 amino acids out of 29 are different in the critical binding region of ace2 making them a testable model for sars-cov-2 infection upon infection of sars-cov-2 syrian hamsters demonstrate weight loss by 11 along with high viral load in nasal turbinate lungs and trachea further the lethality rate in hamsters is 5 and exudative inflammation with hemorrhage and necrosis of alveolae damage is visible during the initial infection period the inflammation of intestinal mucosal epithelium that is the causative agent of diarrohea along with myocardial degeneration is consistent with the pathogenesis observed in humans importantly syrian hamsters show similar immune responses as that of humans where ifn- and pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced at day 2 post-infection followed by the decrease of type ii interferon and il6 and increase of tgf- at day 7 post-infection for an animal to be successful as a model system and perform challenge studies is also dependent on its ability to transmit the pathogen consistent with this syrian hamsters are able to transmit the disease to nave hamsters upon challenge with sars-cov-2 chan et al2020 taken all the data together as syrian hamsters show pathogenesis immune responses similar to humans and are capable of transmission this strengthens their use as one of the most testable models for vaccine studies thus there are many promising animal models for testing the vaccine candidates for sars-cov-2 but still extensive studies are required to confirm their efficiency as an appropriate model for covid-19 in order to fight coronavirus infection and win the race against time moderna a biotechnological company in collaboration with national institute of allergy and infectious disease niaid usa has already begun phase i clinical trial with experimental vaccine mrna-1273 rna vaccine testing begins 2020 who 2020b their argument for directly going for phase i clinical trial is that the mrna-1273 raised a good antibody response after immunization in mice and a lack of disease model for coronavirus cansino biologics from china has also developed a replication-defective adenovirus expressing spike protein of sars-cov-2 as a vaccine candidate for covid-19 who 2020b beijing institute of biological productswuhan institute of biological products and sinovac are using inactivated method while inovio pharmaceuticals is using a dna-based vaccine approach similarly in order to fast-track vaccine development all of them have skipped animal trials and are currently performing phase i trials the phase i clinical trials will test the safety and toxicity of their vaccine target in humans and in a way help in protecting humans from sars-cov-2 although this looks promising for fast-tracking vaccine development there is division among the scientific community about bypassing animal models before phase i clinical trials in addition agencies like peta are against using animals for research purposes the question remains can vaccine research do without an animal model in the history of mankind it has been clear that viral pandemics have been common in affecting millions of people the problem is due to its ability to multiply inside the host and produce high numbers by infecting a single cell accompanied by its stability in non-living surfaces which allows them to spread very fast that is why virus pandemics are global with high transmission rates thus to control viruses extreme steps are often needed therefore in the absence of disease model backed by their antibody responses in mice niaid and cansino biologics moved ahead with phase i clinical trials after bypassing animal model studies for vaccines different biotechnological companies are looking forward to come up with a vaccine in around a year to a year and a half thus the decision by the fda to bypass animal trials is taken positively by entrepreneurs according to them flexibility of laws by the fda could avoid delays in treating as observed in the case of ganciclovir although ganciclovir is successful in treating patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related cytomegalovirus retinitis due to lack of animal studies it did not get approval by fda and was delayed by 4 years van norman 2019 besides overcoming the time frame in which a vaccine can enter the market it is also important to note that results from animal studies may not translate to humans both in terms of toxicity and challenge studies isuprel a treatment for asthma was rendered safe in rats guinea pigs dogs and monkeys but still led to deaths in humans with far less dosages in great britain in another instance to treat human autoimmune disease a monoclonal antibody tgn1412 after going through animal models was processed for phase i trials the introduction of tgn1412 led to critical illness within minutes along with long-term complications in phase i volunteers van norman 2019 however tgn1412 is now restored for rheumatoid arthritis after developing better assays for studying immune responses and lowering the dosage of this monoclonal antibody brown 2018 further strengthening the fact that studies with animals may not always translate to use in humans in contrast chemicals that are generally toxic in animal studies may be safe in humans penicillin fatal to guinea pigs would have failed animal studies but due to lack of regulations to perform animal studies at that time it came into use and is presently a successful drug similarly aspirin is toxic to rhesus monkeys and paracetamol is toxic to dogs and cats van norman 2019 thus these studies indicate that animal studies do not predict the outcomes to humans although they share a lot of genomic similarities the final response to disease will also depend on the epigenome and environmental differences even with the transgenic humanized models that mimic the human system we must remember that often genes do not work alone in such complex higher-order organisms although bypassing animal models can save time effort and money but it is not possible to perform safety and challenge studies for a disease in humans also animal studies provide the foundation to study disease further it is difficult to study the progression of disease in humans but it is easy in an animal model as they can be sacrificed for histopathology in order to follow the course of infection although cell lines can also be used to study the infection process animal models provide the advantage of studying the viral multiplication with respect to symptoms and physiology of an organism thus it becomes really important for a newly originated coronavirus to be studied in an animal model further studying animal models will also provide detailed information about the potential reservoirs of sars-cov-2 in an organism another problem faced by vaccine efforts against viral diseases especially viruses having rna as the genetic material is that repair mechanisms do not work on rna and thus lot of mutations are accumulated in their rna this phenomenon is known as antigenic drift and is the reason that influenza shots are needed before every seasonal flu infection thus sars-cov-2-possessing rna genome is also prone to antigenic drift hence animal models of coronavirus will help in understanding the selection pressure and antigenic drift and evolution of the virus once a vaccine is administered one of the major disadvantages of bypassing animal models is that it has been observed in case of viral infections that sometimes the administration of vaccines enhances the susceptibility of the subject to the disease this phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement or antigen sin and is common for vaccine candidates of hivaids virus and dengue virus once the subject is immunized with the antigen it mounts an immune response against the antigen but when the vaccinated individual is infected again with the virus having a different serotype the pre-existing antibodies are not able to neutralize the virus the formation of antibodyvirus complex helps in attachment to fc receptor on circulating monocytes resulting in the efficient infection of monocytes by the virus halstead 2002 thus instead of protecting the subject it leads to higher complications and death of the subject in case of infection by the pathogen huisman et al2009 therefore the biotech companies that have bypassed animal models should note that antibody-dependent enhancement is also observed with feline coronavirus fcov the immunization of mice with spike s protein of this virus mounts an overall high antibody response but neutralizing antibody levels are low however challenge of these cats results in enhanced susceptibility to infection along with death of cats huisman et al2009 this phenomenon is especially relevant to proteins that are prone to antigenic drift such as the s protein and sars and mers known to be capable of this phenomena liu et al2019 houser et al2017 as s protein is the major vaccine target of sars-cov-2 studies in animal model are really required before establishing it as a vaccine candidate in this global emergency the entire scientific community is attempting effective treatment and prevention of the disease to shorten the time and for the larger interest of humanity some routine yet essetial processes like animal trials are bypassed in the process of development of vaccine and drug development while options like drug repurposing are already adapted with varying degrees of success effective and targeted drugs and vaccines for the sars-cov-2 infection are still awaited moreover agencies like who and fda have already given a green signal for clinical trials of vaccines bypassing the regular process of animal trials hence it is important to access the positive and negative effects of the same choosing a suitable animal model is one of the main concerns for animal testing as the animal should mimic the response and effects to be generated after introduction of the drugvaccine to humans importantly some animal models such as the rhesus macaque ferrets mice and syrian hamster are proving to be successful for challenge by the sars-cov-2 with one or other similar symptoms as humans however a successful animal trial is not the only indicator of the success of any drugvaccine due to physiological barriers hence the decision of bypassing the animal model needs to be taken with utmost caution further saving time should not cost a large number of human lives as a failure of the drugvaccine could have devastating consequences  harnessing the power of novel animal-free test methods for the development of covid-19 drugs and vaccines francois busquet thomas hartung giorgia pallocca costanza rovida marcel leist   the spread of the covid-19 pandemic is seriously challenging the scientific community the quest is not only to find suitable vaccines andor drugs but to do it as fast as possible unlike many other diseases there is not just a medical need but also increasing pressure from key economic and political decision-makers the president of the european commission ec ursula von der leyen for example voiced hopes that a vaccine would be available by autumn 2020 wheaton 2020 in light of these and similar remarks it is worth looking at the tools and the regulatory mechanisms that may allow us to overcome this unprecedented health crisis as viral infections are the prototypic species-specific diseases they make animal testing challenging even without such time pressures their duration and costs especially when genetically modified strains susceptible to the disease need to be bred do not support such ambitious goals while modern bioengineered human multiple organ models lend themselves to antiviral drug development some countries have already started human clinical trials after only minimal safety testing in animals for example at the national institutes of health nih roberts 2020 boodman 2020 the ema has provided updates on treatments and vaccines under development against covid-19 in its last briefing 1 with anticipated timelines for market entry not before 2021 and 2 an outline for the way forward to facilitate market access and authorization ema 2020a exceptional funding efforts were also made available via the publicprivate partnership of the innovative medicines initiative imi httpsbitly3adrbup for boosting development of therapeutics and diagnostics to tackle current and future coronavirus outbreaks imi 2020 ec research and innovation 2020 here we will explore how nam can accelerate such developments drug and vaccine development do not differ in principle but in detail meigs et al 2018 they go through the same steps of pre-clinical and clinical development acceptance and post-market surveillance vaccine developments tend to be longer 818 years vs 812 years for drug trials the clinical trials are often larger and longer as risk populations need to be vaccinated for often rare events due to the nature of biologicals which are often produced by fermenting or types of cell culture vaccines frequently need batch release controls as public health measures vaccines face even higher pricing pressures all of this makes the development of vaccines less attractive for pharma and indeed there are only a few major pharma companies engaging in their development to support vaccine development governmental players and nonprofit foundations are co-funding rd and sometimes production interestingly more than 80 of global vaccine producers are european while more than 40 of vaccine consumption is in the us meigs et al 2018 altogether drug discovery rd differs from many other scientific disciplines and understanding its major components helps us appreciate how new tools can be used to accelerate the process models also called test systems are essential for the rd process traditional models are based on experimental animals novel approaches are animal-free and use tissue cultures or computational techniques a third type of test model must not be forgotten however as it can complement the others healthy or diseased humans the use of such tools in rd programs need to answer four entirely different questions therefore they are used in four very different testing strategies with each of the approaches having its own particular models and providing specific opportunities for the use of nam the scopes of the four approaches are1 efficacy this is what usually comes to mind when we think of drugs or vaccines even if the principles of efficacy and action are clear eg preventing viral replication or blocking virus entry into a cell and also when the particular molecular target is known eg the viral rna polymerase or docking receptor fig 1 finding a drug candidate that interacts with the target and also fulfills some other features essential to make it a drug eg being taken up by the body and being transported to its target site is a tedious and highly resource-consuming process2 safety an entirely different set of models and tests is used to evaluate whether a drug is well-tolerated and without adverse side-effects ie toxicity for instance it needs to be assured that it does not block important functions of the human body or attack important structures within human cells or organs3 quality once a safe and efficacious vaccine or drug has been found it needs to be produced at high and more importantly constant quality the testing program differs fundamentally from safety and efficacy as it needs to be applied to each lot of vaccine or drug to control for impurities and contaminants4 target discovery last in this list but first in the rd process is a testing program designed to yield useful drug targets again different models and strategies are required to find for example the key steps of virus-host cell interaction or to identify processes in human cells that could be used as a target to decrease hyper-inflammation as some of these targets may be known from other diseases or research they may provide one of the fastest ways to find suitable drugs a strategy called re-purposing a typical example may be glycosylation inhibitors fig 1 which were developed for various neurological diseases but may also be considered for viral infections park 2019 parsons et al 2019 tortorici et al 2019 and could be tested quickly with modern nam via metabolic glycoengineering kranaster et al 2020 for all four approaches covid-19 research can now benefit from the investments made into development of nam over the past 20 years from a european perspective one of the two key developments has been the establishment of the european center for the validation of alternative methods eurl-ecvam within the ec own research infrastructure the joint research center jrc this was followed by the creation of a network of european reference laboratories eu-netval coordinated by eurl-ecvam the second major push for the development of nam came from substantial funding of this research by the ec comprising up to 50 m year for the last 15 years since the framework program 6 fp6 this also includes the imi funding one current project is eu-toxrisk which develops animal-free safety testing approaches with a budget of 30 m  daneshian et al 2016 graepel et al 2019 several national funding programs have also contributed substantially to the development of nam particularly in the netherlands germany and the uk legislation in the eu such as the ban of animal testing for cosmetics has been a strong incentive for industry to launch their own and very successful research programs on nam safety and quality control beilmann et al 2019 in the us the national academy of sciences nas 2007 report on the future of toxicity testing in the twenty-first century nrc 2007 leist et al 2008 2014 krewski et al 2010 2020 was pivotal triggering a chain of events culminating with roadmaps from major agencies epa fda to reduce and ultimately abandon animal testing collins et al 2008 tice et al 2013 bouhifd et al 2015 fda 2017 thomas et al 2018 epa 2019 a second notable report from a committee of the nas addressed drug efficacy for countermeasures to terrorism biological weapons nrc 2011 hartung and zurlo 2012 here a clear recommendation was given to focus solely on nam for reasons of speed and predictivity in parallel to these highly visible government activities industry moved from largely animal-based efficacy testing in the 1980s to predominantly 90 animal-free efficacy research methods today the same is true for academia and especially for industry-driven research on target discovery busquet et al 2020 here cell culture-based methods combined with modern molecular biology and stem cell technology play a major role but the use of computational research in silico models has recently increased as well pinero et al 2018 vamathevan et al 2019 in parallel with an increasing awareness of shortcomings of animal models olson et al 2000 hartung and leist 2008 leist and hartung 2013 the use of nam for these four testing programs is detailed below what is special about sars-2-cov-19 covid-19 first we have no animal disease model it seems to be most closely related to coronaviruses in asian bats and reptiles but these do not lend themselves as lab animals and do not show as far as we know the pathology found in humans the typical reflex when there is no animal model is to suggest using non-human primates nhp or even great apes this has not helped us with hiv or hepatitis c as shown by the us national academy of sciences nas 2011 research with great apes the other common response is to breed or genetically modify lab animals such as mice to render them susceptible as was done for the earlier sars virus mccray et al 2007 however this misses the most obvious opportunity human microphysiological systems mps that have become available over the last decade due to stem cell technology and bioengineering alepee et al 2014 marx et al 2016 2020 ewart et al 2018 we have shown earlier how viral infections can be studied in human brainspheres mini-brains abreu et al 2018 for zika and dengue as well as with others including sars-2-covid-19 to be published shortly others are also doing similar research in various organs such as the european organovir education network httpsorganovircom many groups building on these models will now leverage them for covid-19 rd an important finding based on organoids was published by a research group in vienna that focused on soluble viral receptors sace2 as therapy monteil et al 2020 there are however limitations on research done under biosafety level 3 guidelines for this virus with sophisticated systems of pumps sensors microscopes and difficult-to-sterilize equipment specific consideration should thus be given to the design of simple and robust modelstypically more so organoids than organ-on-chip systems for respiratory tissue commercial offers currently exist from epithelix and mattek gordon et al 2015 it seems however that the life-threatening course of covid-19 occurs through a cytokine storm with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failures these forms of septic shock have been especially resistant to drug identification killing drug companies sepsis programs as septic patients in the clinic it is rather unlikely that the multi-organ failures in covid-19 once the disease has developed represent a different situation the cochrane study register for covid-19 listed on 19 april 2020 a total of 1684 studies launched with 637 of them being interventional and 781 aimed at treatment and management httpscovid-19cochraneorg this however has to be understood proportionally in light of about 55000 clinical trials listed in 2019 by the world health organization who httpsbitly2y2tzqs still the speed of getting these started is impressive this shows that drug repurposing is mainly occurring this should not be surprising as drugbank lists 13543 drugs available 11388 small molecules 2155 biologicals of which 4002 are approved httpswwwdrugbankcastats this rich portfolio which has typically already undergone some safety testing allows it to move quickly ahead initially the focus is entirely on nam cellular infectivity can for instance be tested on cell cultures vero cells or organoids and molecular viral targets like the polymerase are initially tested in recombinant form biochemical assays both methods allow high throughput thousands of samples and provide much more robust and exacting data than any animal experiment could deliver more complex questions concern whether a potential drug would reach its target tissue and whether it would also act in a complex disease setting inflammation altered ph or in a variety of cell types moreover here combinations of complex in vitro models and of in silico approaches physiology-based pharmacokinetic pbk modelling are well established and routinely used in drug industry and academia considering that a share of repurposing drug candidates comes from hiv drug research there is now ample opportunity to test failed or discarded substances as well as supportive therapies the first results with established aids therapies however were disappointing httpsbitly3cmmsxe the who summarized the limited evidence so far httpsbitly2s6nirf but discussions and hopes continue murphy 2020 fig 1 in the case of hiv treatments ultimately became successful when combining originally four now three different treatments known as haart highly active antiretroviral therapy however our understanding of hiv differs from covid-19 in two critical aspects the extent of immune escape and persistence in the body still it might be necessary to combine treatments which is always a challenge for drug development approval and practical patient care nam may be used to identify the most effective combination of targets synergy and to find the most beneficial combination of drugs concentration ratios before such efforts are carried out in patients already more than 115 vaccines for covid-19 are under development thanh et al 2020 as most organoids and mps are devoid of an immune component they lend themselves less as a substitute though the addition of immune cells is becoming more common the addition of antibodies or serum of vaccinated animals or recovered humans to these models to test their efficacy instead of infecting the animals is an opportunity here a most promising development is artificial lymph nodes as reported first by suematsu and watanabe 2004 giese and marx 2014 summarized the progress in developing and optimizing a 3d human artificial lymph node model to mimic the interface between the innate and adaptive immune response in vitro giese et al 2006 see also cupedo et al 2012 such models have shown merit for the evaluation of the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines drake et al 2012 they certainly represent a prime non-animal method for covid-19 vaccine development while vaccine development usually targets active vaccination ie exposure of humans to relevant antigens followed by an active immune response passive vaccinations can also be envisaged fig 1 in this process the antibodies against viral antigens are produced by biotechnology methods and then injected this is best known for emergency vaccines for tetanus a variant of this approach is the isolation of antibodies from the serum of covid-19 survivors for use in patients jhsph 2020 casadevall and pirofski 2020 the traditional old-fashioned way of antibody generation uses animal models nowadays monoclonal antibodies can be produced entirely animal-free by molecular biology techniques eg phage display cosson and hartley 2016 gray et al 2016 almagro et al 2019 zuang et al 2019 for the use of animals there are also limitations due to pronounced species-specific differences in pathogenesis with antigen recognition in immune reactivity of non-lymphoid and lymphoid tissues and in the systemic orchestration of immunity at the organism level the first successful attempt on rhesus macaques was just confirmed on april 19th 2020 gao et al 2020 however concerns have been raised about this approach due to the fact that monkeys do not develop the most severe symptoms that sars-cov-2 causes in humans cohen 2020 therefore a fast transition from initial trials in vitro to the next step in humans is often taken in covid-19 research in the us an ind investigational new drug application to the fda food and drug administration starts with the clinical phase describing the manufacturing and testing processes laboratory reports and the proposed study as well as approval by the institutional review board at the institution where the clinical trial will be conducted the fda has 30 days to approve the application clinical studies with human subjects can then start similar to those in clinical drug developmentphase i vaccine trials typically 2080 adults may be non-blinded to assess safety type and extent of the immune responsephase ii vaccine trials typically several hundred individuals often groups at risk of acquiring the disease these trials are randomized and well-controlled and include a placebo group to study safety immunogenicity proposed doses schedule of immunizations and method of deliveryphase iii vaccine trials involving thousands to tens of thousands of people these are randomized and double-blind studies against a placebo to assess safety rare side effects efficacy prevention of disease prevention of infection with the pathogen or production of antibodies or other types of immune responses related to the pathogenapproval and licensure submission of a biologics license application to the fda then fda will inspect the factory and approve the labeling of the vaccinepost-licensure monitoring of vaccines includes phase iv trials the vaccine adverse event reporting system voluntary established by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and fda in 1990 and the vaccine safety datalink a collection of linked databases containing information from large medical groups established by cdc in 1990 it is difficult to imagine how such a process could be shortened to a year or 18 months as has been recently suggested by policymakers nam have been described in thousands of articles in the past there have been large successes in some toxicological areas but also gaps to be filled basketter et al 2012 leist et al 2014 these approaches have contributed to limit animal use in toxicology but much less in biomedical research daneshian et al 2015 busquet et al 2020 the use of nam is not just an animal welfare issue it is an issue of timeor more precisely time to market in a worldwide pandemic speed of drug development carries enormous weight a traditional full safety package based on animals includes long-time chronic dosing up to two years followed by lengthy histopathology evaluations however shortcuts seem possible to understand applicability for covid-19 exact testing needs must be reviewed depending on the type of use duration of treatment application methods use in pregnancy and other susceptible populations the safety data package for initial human use is rather light the speed with which more than 500 clinical trials have begun for covid-19 shows that shortcuts have been taken and may generate discussions on what might be possible more generally for common practices after the pandemic bruckner 2020 in the case of covid-19 the dosing time for a drug is very short often 2 weeks or less and in many cases pregnancies ie reproductive and developmental toxicity issues can be excluded what is needed in this situation 1 the drug should not be acutely toxic 2 it should not trigger cancer and 3 it should not interfere with other drugs concerning 1 the situation for nam is very favorable accepted methods are available for most acute and topical toxicities also acute systemic toxicity may be predicted possibly in combination with a limited number of animal experiments hamm et al 2017 strickland et al 2018 concerning 2 one needs to distinguish genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogenicity genotoxicity is the most successful area for nam and has been addressed for decades in drug development the available methods are very fast days and highly sensitive corvi and madia 2017 corvi et al 2019 non-genotoxic carcinogenicity is harder to predict from animals or nam and it shows pronounced species differences hernandez et al 2009 one fundamental fact is that non-genotoxic carcinogens require usually long exposure times thus the short treatment of covid-19 minimizes this issue moreover nam have been developed to identify typical mechanisms contributing to non-genotoxic carcinogenicity eg nuclear receptor activation hernandez et al 2009 jacobs et al 2016 the cmr carcinogenicity mutagenicity reproductive toxicity endpoints are thus not typically critical to ensure minimum safety requirements before entering clinical trials at this stage in the specific context of covid-19 and as mentioned above drug repurposing is currently the focus these requirements are usually waived since treatment is less than 6 months no data are particularly needed only a request for full contraception with pregnancy tests every month to cover fertility under clinical trials what is needed is a repeated dose test but maximally of one-month length it would be a great opportunity to complete such a data set with mps since some of them do cover up to 28 days and are adapted to dose-repetition mps are not qualified however and therefore difficult to use in a regulatory context although there are examples of platforms ready to be used for vaccine preclinical testing sanchez-schmitz et al 2018 the recently published ema regulatory strategy 2025 reports one reason for hesitancy may be concerns on the part of developers as well as industry that use of such new approach methodologies nams will not be acceptable to regulators and will thus stall approvals other possible reasons for the limited use of nams include a lack of knowledge regarding the existence or the exact functioning of such models lack of model validation or high costs associated with their implementation ema 2020b as mentioned above since the focus currently is on drug repurposing most of the submission proposals are rich in safety information already but considerations for the very ill patient group and the impact of other treatments applied at the same time are critical as long as there is no standard of care proper control is difficult to define concerning 3 excellent nam are available to test drug-drug interactions at the level of a transporter and drug-metabolizing enzymes this is well-established by drug discovery companies and therefore such methods allow a quick transition to further testing in humans a major question for deciding on test methods nam vs animal is can we prevent harm from trial participants and in the end patients olson et al 2000 showed quite impressively the limits of predicting human adverse effects with animal testing more recently tamaki et al 2013 studied 1256 adverse drug reactions after the administration of 142 drugs approved in japan from 2001 to 2010 only about half of them were predicted by pre-clinical animal data even less predictivity was found by bailey et al 2014 2015 for 2366 drugs two industry groups howevermonticello et al 2017 and clark and steger-hartmann 2018had more positive results it should be noted that the problem does not end with clinical trials of 578 discontinued and withdrawn drugs in europe and the us almost half were discontinued due to toxicity siramshetty et al 2016 in many countries governmental quality control of human vaccines is a long-established tradition in the us on july 1 1902 the us congress passed an act to regulate the sale of viruses serums toxins and analogous products later referred to as the biologics control act this was the first modern federal legislation to control the quality of drugs in part as a response to 1901 contamination events in st louis and camden involving smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin httpsbitly3conhkl the act created the hygienic laboratory of the us public health service to oversee the manufacture of biological drugs which eventually became the national institutes of health vaccine approval in the us is responsibility of the fda but also after licensure the agency continues to monitor the production of vaccines including inspecting facilities and reviewing the manufacturers tests of lots of vaccines for potency safety and purity the fda has the right to conduct testing of manufacturers vaccines in 1994 in europe the so-called official control authority batch release network ocabr was implemented shortly after the establishment of the european union today official medicinal control laboratories omcls are part of the european ocabr network in many european countries omcls experimentally test every batch of human vaccines before they enter

diseases the role of vaccination and treatment p raja sekhara rao m naresh kumar   infectious diseases spread through media such as air water direct contact or carriers such as insects flies and mosquitoes 2 36 the dynamics may well be understood by modeling causes or carriers of the disease it is not possible all the time to control the media or carriers involved in spread of the infection and sometimes it may even be beyond determination many a time we may not even recognize the presence of an infection until it becomes predominant mathematical modeling is a tool that has been popularly employed in prevention and control of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 1 human immunodeficiency virus infectionacquired immune deficiency syndrome hivaids 4 h5n1 avian flu 37 and h1n1 swine flu 35 also they have been useful in studying some of the drug resistant strains of malaria 12 tuberculosis 5 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa 17 and marine bacteriophage infection 3 simple deterministic models are based on dividing the population into compartments such as susceptible exposed infected and recovered the susceptible-infective si model is useful in understanding diseases such as feline infectious peritonitis fip 26 as the host remain infected till they die the susceptible-infective-susceptible sis model is employed in studying infections such as gonorrhea 31 as there is a possibility of host becoming susceptible to infection once again the susceptible-infective-recovered sir model is employed to understand diseases such as syphilis 33 wherein immunity lasts for a limited period before waning such that the individual is once again susceptible dynamics of such systems are generally studied from two perspectives i stability of disease-free equilibrium and ii stability of endemic equilibrium in the former case conditions under which pathogens suffer extinction leaving individuals as susceptible are studied whereas in the later conditions in which infective and susceptible populations coexist are established interactions among populations in compartments such as the susceptible x and infected y is the key to understand the rate at which the infection can spread in the population models with bilinear interaction among populations xy tend to disease free equilibrium or endemic equilibrium 7

13 16 34 44 45 46 52 for further understanding dynamics of infectious diseases it is observed that solutions of periodic nature do exist even without periodic forcing term in the model the existence of periodic solutions are usually attributed to the presence of time delays in the system even in case of bilinear incidence delays do exist in disease transmission known as the latency period of infection from inception to an identifiable state for some interesting studies on infectious disease models readers are referred to 8 14 24 15 19 23 25 28 29 47 49 51 on the other hand fluctuations in populations may also be attributed to changes in environment especially in open systems these perturbations are influenced by the environment and may be treated as noise in the system dynamic models of competing species under the influence of a noise are extensively studied in 6 9 30 48 predictive models based on both clinical incidence data pertaining to infectious diseases and epidemics in general are discussed in 40 41 42 in the earlier studies on infectious disease models the identification of basic reproduction number gave an idea on the stability of the system either in terms of disease free environment or disease prevalence the reproduction number represents the number of secondary cases that are caused by a primary case when introduced into a wholly susceptible population also it is observed that if reproduction number is less than unity the disease free equilibrium is stable otherwise the disease prevails 16 when the nature of interaction is not known or the basic reproduction number is more than unity one needs to find ways to restrict the disease to a minimum manageable level if the disease free environment cannot be provided when it comes to the control of a disease vaccination or preventive strategies could be a good choice during the early stages of the disease provided the population is not large enough emergence of vaccine resistant strains is one of the drawbacks of frequent or long term vaccination when massive vaccination is not possible the second stage of defensive mechanism could be medical treatment this adds a new sub category of population called recovered class representing the population recovered by treatment basing on the above observations we consider the following three compartmental system in the present paper1xa-bfxy-dx-cvxzyb1fxt-yt-rpy-d1yzrpyt--zwherein xtyt and zt denote susceptible infected and recovered by treatment populations at any time t respectively ddt denotes the time derivative of a function a0 is the growth rate of susceptible population f denotes the non-linear incidence or infection function showing how susceptibles x are converted into infected yb0 denotes the rate of contact or interaction of infected with susceptible and d is the rate of removal of such susceptible individuals from the system who are naturally immune to the infection and in no way get infected vx is the vaccination function depends on susceptible population c0 is the rate of successful vaccination and 0b1b is the rate of conversion of susceptible into infected in case b1b we may expect the infection to be at its helm and spreading 100 if b1b we may infer that the disease is not that effective or the missing xs are no more susceptible and may be removed from the system the time delay 0 implies that x when gets in contact with y takes time  to become infected and is called the temporary immunity parameter the parameter d10 is the removaldeath rate of the infected population-either not at all treated or inadequately treated or beyond the treatment it may also be viewed as the rate at which infected population is kept in a quarantine away from susceptible population avoiding any sort of contact between infected and exposed py is the recovery by treatment function of the infected r0 denotes the rate of treatment and also the recovery rate however the infected by a treatment procedure may recover after a time gap  the parameter 0 is the rate at which a recovered non-vaccinated individual may be re-exposed to infection and become susceptible again this case arises when the individual appears to be recovered by treatment but is prone to infection again the basic interactions among various populations are shown in fig 1
 we assume the following conditions on the infection functioni

f0y0yiii
fx00xthe first condition non-negativity is a minimum requirement for any function representing biological systems and for dynamics to make sense the second condition arises out of the situation when there are no susceptible ie y has no more influence on them and the third condition is required to create a disease-free environment necessity for such condition is described in section 2 in addition a non-negativity condition is to be satisfied by p as it represents the recovery by treatment function thus we assume py0y with strict inequality holding for y0 as we are interested in studying the influence of treatment on spread of disease in the absence of infected population we have p00 as no treatment effort is required depending on the reproduction number of an epidemic and its availability we need to initiate vaccination the following are the probable cases i a uniform constant supply vxk ii proportional to susceptible population vxx linear iii sub-linear vxxkx or vxtanhx have a saturation limit and iv vx may be a periodic function when the infection is fluctuating season-dependent or cyclic however in case of a new infectious disease system may not be ready with vaccines to prevent its spread the recent case being the spread of ebola 18 thus a time gap is required to start the vaccination procedure until a vaccine is invented and supplied so we may have vxt0t for 0tt1 and vvxt0tt1 a delay is also warranted in this section which we shall discuss in the final section a basic motivation for this study stems from observations in 44 that vaccination alone is not sufficient to contain disease effectively and treatment plays an important role in the disease management we shall analyze the model 1 keeping in view the following concerns which are important in handling infectious disease1the influence of treatment or recovery rate r2influence of vaccination effort v3combined effect of vaccination and treatment4how to destabilize equilibrium xyz when y0  or can we make y0
 the present paper aims to provide answers to the above questions by organizing its content as follows in section 2 the possible equilibria are determined for the model eqs 1 in section 3 local stability properties of the system are discussed in section 31 the behavior of delay-free system is discussed influence of time delay 0 on the stability of the delay-free system is studied in section 32 while the influence of delay in recovery 0 alone is studied in section 33 bounds for these delays conditions for change in the direction of stability are also discussed in section 34 the general case of delays 0 and 0 is discussed in section 4 global stability results are derived for a special case in which both the delays are present examples and simulation results are presented in section 5 while conclusions and scope for future study are deferred to section 6 and section 7 respectively equilibria are the constant solutions of the system a popular way to understand the system is to study the behavior of its equilibria for 2 we look for two possibilities i existence of an equilibrium of the type x00 called disease-free equilibrium whose stability implies that the infection has little influence and ii a stable positive equilibrium xyz called endemic equilibrium which denotes the disease prevalence unless specifically stated xyz denotes either of these equilibria throughout the subsequent study the equilibria xyz of 2 should satisfy3bfxycvxdx-zab1fxy-d1y-rpy0rpyz
 we hypothesize that if 0vad holds then there shall exist a point x such that it satisfies the condition cvxa-dx to further illustrate our hypothesis we considered a real-time dataset pertaining to sars 27 and fitted a logistic curve of the form vxc1aexp-bx to the number of reported sars cases x in a given time interval we estimated parameters of the logistic curve from data as c206b01542 and a102 the inflection point of the logistic curve give by lnabc2 is the point 30103 shown in fig 2
at which the curve switches from an increasing rate of growth to a decreasing rate clearly suggesting the existence of a disease-free equilibrium point x00 whose stability implies a disease-free environment the logistic curve and the line passing through the disease-free equilibrium point x is shown in fig 2 this provides a mechanism to design the vaccination v methods for containing the disease linearizing the system 2 around the equilibrium xyz we getxyz-bfx-cvx-d-bfy0b1fy-d1-rpy000-xyz000b1fxyx000rpy0xy0or4xyzab0c000-xyz000d000e0xy0where a-bfx-cvx-db-bfycb1fy-d1-rpy

 we shall first consider the case when there are no delays in contracting the disease 0 and in recovery 0 the eq 6 reduces to3l2l1mnm1n10the elementary algebra says that if i l0l1m0 and ii nm1n10 hold all the roots of the above equation have negative real parts thus we have the theorem 31 which needs no prooftheorem 31
for
00
 the system
2
is locally asymptotically stable provided that the parameters satisfy
l0l1m0
and
nm1n10


remark 31in particular if d0c0 hold and when vx0fx0 we have a0 then the characteristic eq 6 reduces to3l2mn0which is delay free clearly all its coefficients are non-negative and there is no possibility of a root with positive real part thus the equilibrium xyz is stable when d0c0 and a0 thus we need to explore possibilities of finding a disease-free equilibrium at which these conditions hold - implying the possibility of disease-free environment the choice of parameters selection of vaccination function identification of infection function and recovery may render this possible
 we may further infer the following1in case the system has both a disease free equilibrium e0 and an endemic equilibrium e1 and if conditions of theorem 31 hold at e0 then we may say that the disease has no influence2if e0 is either unstable at least one of the roots of the above equation has a positive real part or does not exist at all then we check for the stability of the endemic equilibrium e13if e1 is stable we have to explore the possibilities of destabilizing it by increasing i vaccination efforts ii treatment rate or by iii delay in process of infection4in case e1 is unstable but the solutions are exhibiting the dominance of the disease or the system has no e1 we need to study the behavior of solutions in a way to handle the infected population such as finding an 0t0 such that yt for ttwe shall provide some answers to these towards the end of this article we shall now study the influence of time delays on the system first we start with a delay in incubation but no delay in the recovery of treated to understand the influence of the time delay in converting the exposed population to infected only we allow 0 in eq 6 we get83l2ml1m1n1e-n0equations of the type 8 are well studied in literature eg 8 10 11 letting a0n2-m1n12a1m2-2ln-l12 and a2l2-2m a straight forward application of theorem 41 of 8 yields the theorem 32theorem 32

 notice that theorem 32 or theorem 41 of 8 ensures the preservation of stability instability but does not specify the values of lengths of delay for which this holds the following result helps us in estimating delay in such cases we need the following result 20 as utilized in 43 for our studylemma 1theorem 1 20

 we shall now study the influence of time delay only in recovery on the stability of the system we wish to understand clearly whether the time delays  and  influence independently or are they introduced out of mathematical curiosity to be specific if  has no influence on the system better we ignore it and proceed with  only the following cases may arise1if any of the following conditions15il22l1ml1m22lnm1nm12n12iil22l1ml1m22lnm1nm12n12iiil22l1ml1m22lnm1nm12n12ivl22l1ml1m22lnm1nm12n12hold a change of sign indicates that 13 has one 20 yielding two possibilities for  for these values of  we have16t2-l1mnm1-n1-l2

proof of theorem 35the conditions for preservation of stability or instability are given by rfi0 and ifi0 at any 0 at 0 equivalently if we can show that 00 then the stabilityinstability is preserved without loss of generality let 0 be the smallest positive root of rfi0 since n1cosn1l1sinl1 and m1cosm1 for any positive  we have l2-nn1l1m1 from rficonsider l2-l1-nn1m10 this has clearly two roots and the bigger one is given by l1l124lnn1m12l then clearly 0 now from 18 we have 0 is implied if6l2-2m4m2-2ln-l122n2n12-m122n-l22m-2holds ie ifn-l2-12m-2-12l1202-n12m122holdsthe left hand side is positive quantity and the inequality clearly holds if 02n12-m122l12 holds since 0 this inequality is satisfied provided 19 holds thus 00 and hence no change of stability instability occursagain from 18 we observe that 00 if n22nn12m12 holds and 0 for large  and therefore 0 has a real positive solution let  denote smallest such root now 18 may be written as20mcosnsinlwhere m2n-l2n2m-3l6l2-2m4m2-2ln-l122n2n12-m12 and  for the value of  so obtained we have from 20 1tan-1m-3n-l2 the proof is now complete  
 we consider an important special case of 2 in which fxyxy the simple interaction term we further assume that pyy and vxx the recovery and the vaccination are linear then 2 takes the form21xa-bxy-dx-cxzyb1xt-y-ry-d1yzryt--zfor which the equilibrium points are given by the solutions of22bxydxcx-zab1xy-ry-d1y0r1y-z0clearly acd00 is always a solution of 22 and is a disease-free equilibrium of 21 if y0 then from 22 xd1rb1ya-cdxbx-rb1a-cdd1rbd1rb-b1 and zryrb1a-cdd1rbd1rb-b1 giving rise to a positive equilibrium solution of 21 provided that bxra-cdxbx-r0 or simply if23d1rb1acdholds since b1brbd1rb1x we have bx-r0 hence 23 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a positive endemic equilibrium for 21 in case xrbd1rb1 entire yz plane becomes the equilibria now assuming xyz is a positive equilibrium of 21 we formulate the theorem 41 astheorem 41
the positive equilibrium solution
xyz
of

proof of theorem 41using 22 in 21 we rewrite 21 as24x-byx-x-bxy-y-cdx-xz-zyb1xt--xyzryt--y-z-znow consider the functionvxyzx-xlogy-logyz-z

 we shall now provide a result for the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium suppose that xtd1rb1 for all t now solving the second equation of 21 as a linear equation in y we getyty0eb1x-d1-rt0for sufficiently large t using this in the third equation of 21 we have for large tztz0e-t0then the first equation of 21 for sufficiently large t becomesxta-cdxtwhose solution isxtacdx0e-cdtthus we formulate the theorem 42 astheorem 42

remark 41comparing the parametric conditions of theorem 41 theorem 42 we may notice that the existence of a positive equilibrium destabilizes the disease-free equilibrium and vice versa
 we shall now present some examples to illustrate the results as well as understand the influence of vaccination and treatment efforts consider the system25x10-xy-2xzyxt-y-2yzyt--zobtained by letting bcdd1b1r1 and a10 clearly 266 is a positive equilibrium of 25 it is easy to see that for 00 266 of 25 is stable by virtue of theorem 31 for these values of parameters we have a756b1488c500d84 all are positive and eq 12 becomes 756t31488t2500t840 and has no solution for t0 thus the positive equilibrium of the system 25 remains stable for any length of delay 0 when 0 again the conditions of 15 are satisfied and hence by theorem 34 00 have no influence on the stability also it may be noticed that the parametric conditions of theorem 41 are satisfied here and hence 266 is globally asymptotically stable by virtue of theorem 41 showing that the infection is widely prevalent at the same time conditions of theorem 42 are violated hence no possibility of a disease-free environment these dynamics may be observed in fig 3
 consider the system26x10-xy-2xzyxt-y-5yz4yt--zwherein all the parameters are same as in 25 except that r4 here this example studies the influence of a higher treatment rate of the effected people than in earlier example clearly xd1rb15ya-cdxbx-r0z0 thus 500 is an equilibrium solution of 26 the characteristic eq 5 further reduces to f33220 for which the roots are 0-352 this clearly shows that 26 is stable and behaves as a delay free system this is further supported by the observation that the conditions of theorem 42 for the global stability of 500 are satisfied and thus the disease has no influence dynamics of the system 26 are shown in fig 4
 consider the system27x10-xy-4xzyxt-y-2yzy-zwe now study the influence of choosing higher amount of vaccination ie we set the parameter c3 in the example 51 clearly xd1rb12ya-cdxbx-r2z2 applying theorem 31 we get stability of the delay-free system now 10 takes the form gt42t3-46t2-117t-80 this equation has a positive solution for t t2325approx further 23-t16t0 yields 02125 for these values we have 2tan-1t43204 as gt0 for t2 there is no further change of stability after 43204 thus 222 remains unstable for 43204 since a0-40 the instability of 222 prevails for  as per theorem 32 again the condition n22nn12m12 of theorem 35 is satisfied also indicating a change in stability of the delay free system in general case the behavior of solutions of 27 for various lengths of delay are shown in fig 5 fig 5 fig 5
c for 4 damped oscillations are observed as shown in fig 6a
 whereas for 56789 periodic solutions are observed in the simulations as may be seen from fig 6 fig 6f respectively thus simulations support theoretical predictions consider the system28x10-2xy-4xzy2xt-y-5yz4yt--zwe have chosen r4c3b2b12dd11 here we shall study the influence of high recovery rate and vaccination rate together when the infection rate is doubled when compared to earlier examples clearly xascdd1rb125ya-cdxbx-r0z0 thus 2500 is an equilibrium solution of 28 as in example 52 the characteristic equation is f33240 for which both the non zero roots certainly have negative real parts thus the disease-free equilibrium is locally stable in the subsequent examples we choose non-linear functions for fv andor p consider the system29x10-2xxy-xzy2xt-xt-y-4yz3yt--zwherein r3cd1b2b1d11 and 1 and non-linearity in infection only clearly this system has 2002110213021 as equilibrium which is locally stable by virtue of theorem 34 consider the system30x10-3xx2y-x-x2zy3xt-xt-2y-2yzyt--zwith non-linearities both in infection and vaccination the parameters chosen are r3c1d1b3b1d11 and 1 clearly this system has only a disease-free equilibrium given by 41-1200 which is locally asymptotically stable for all delays  and  we shall now introduce a non-linear recovery function in our model consider the system31x15-3xx2y-x-xx2zy3xt-xt-2y-y-y1yzyt-1yt--zwherein a15b3b1c1d1d11
r1 and 1 clearly this system has only a disease-free equilibrium given by 57-3400 which is locally asymptotically stable for all delays  and  as may be seen in fig 7
 the system 25 in example 51 provides a situation where disease-free equilibrium 500 and an endemic equilibrium 266 do exist however conditions are conducive for both local and global stability of 266 this indicates the prevalence of infection irrespective of a time delay and provide no scope for disease-free environment in example 52 we have raised the treatment rate from r1 in 25 to r4 in 26 all other parameters and functional relations are kept as they are in 25 in this case only a disease-free equilibrium 500 exists and there is no possibility of an endemic equilibrium theory says that 500 is asymptotically stable both locally and globally creating an eventual infection-free environment from this we notice that as more and more infected are treated the possibility of infected contacting the susceptible comes down and spread of disease considerably reduced and more susceptible x5 remain in the system as compared to x2 in the example 51 in order to understand the influence of vaccination effort on the system in example 51 we raised the vaccination parameter from c1 in system 25 to c3 in system 27 example 53 all other parameters are kept as they are in example 51 the system possesses two equilibria 2500 and 222 when compared to the situation in example 51 the equilibrium values of infected and recovered populations are considerably reduced from y6z to y2z may be due to increased vaccination efforts for small values of time delays the disease equilibrium 222 is stable but as delay in incubation increases the equilibrium becomes unstable as predicted by the theory wild fluctuations in populations are noticed for delay parameter 4 which may be seen in figs 6f this indicates that time delay in incubation has an influence on the system even under enhanced vaccination in example 54 system 28 though the rate of conversion of susceptible into infected that is b1 has been doubled from b11 in 25 to b12 in 28 we have stability of disease free equilibrium 2500 under the influence of higher vaccination and treatment c3r4 in 28 compared to c1r1 of 25 the nonlinear function for infection chosen in example 55 see system 29 provides no scope for the existence of a disease free equilibrium and infection prevails in all cases similarly nonlinear functions of vaccination infection and treatment are considered in 56 57 in both these cases the corresponding disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable independent of time delaysremark 51for the systems in 52 54 56 57 we notice that only a disease-free equilibrium exists further d0c0 and a0 at this equilibrium and for the choice of functions made as we have noticed in remark 31 the system is thus behaving like a delay-free system and the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable while 51 53 55 provide a disease environment
 in this paper we proposed a mathematical model describing the dynamics of a population consisting of susceptible infected and recovered by treatment categories existence of equilibria and their local stability are studied in detail an attempt is made to understand the influence of vaccination and treatment on the populations in the presence of time delays in infection recovery results on global stability are also established for a special case of the proposed model situations where the effect of time delays on the stability of the equilibria is null and void are identified in this special case it is important and interesting to further explore this view point for more general cases in 2 it is observed that the vaccination threshold rate is admissible beyond which the infection gets eradicated but 51 53 illustrate that vaccination alone cannot eradicate infection but it is the treatment rate that is playing a key role in controlling the disease when the system is influenced by time delays the present study raises some basic questions such as1in example 53 it is noticed that the equilibrium 222 is locally stable as long as the time delay in infection 4 thereafter this equilibrium becomes unstable as predicted by the theory see results in sections 3 4 at the same time simulations show that for 4 the system is behaving very wild and large fluctuations are observed in infected and recovered populations this situation is more vulnerable than having a stable endemic equilibrium where the situation may not be much beyond control thus existence of a stable endemic equilibrium may sometimes be a better choice further the behavior of the system under the simultaneous influence of time delays general case section 34 needs to be investigated in detail for commensurate delays study in section 34 may provide an estimate but for other types of delays more explicit estimates are required however we need to analyze such situations further2most of the mathematical studies on biological models concentrate on the stability of equilibria known or identifiable solutions of the system consider the following system32x10-3xy-2xzy3xt-y-5yz2yt--zthis has both disease free 500 and endemic 53209209 equilibria but neither theorem 42 nor theorem 41 holds for this case also system 29 in example 55 allows no possibility for existence of a disease free equilibrium and hence no scope for disease free environment comments made in section 21 are aimed at such situations in such cases we have to study the ways of controlling the infected populations rather than the stability of the system this raises the following questions how to control y can we find a small 0 such that yt for some tt can we create an inactive state a zone of no activation for the spreading of the disease that means can we identify and keep the infected people in a quarantine at least till vaccination is effective or treatment available is sufficient to meet the requirements this would be the point of contention in our future exposition
 it is observed in 40 that for diseases like chagas the effort of vaccination is not adequate to control the disease and treatment is recommended in both acute and chronic stages of diseases system 2 through examples 51 illustrates such cases our examples conclude that when the treatment rate is high a disease-free environment is created stability of 266 - example 51 to stability of 500 - example 52 in the presence of improved vaccination effort alone the infected and hence recovered populations are lowered stability of 266 - example 51 to stability of 222 - example 53 under the influence of better vaccination in addition to high treatment rate we notice a considerable decrease in susceptible population due to increased rate of infection stability of 500 - example 52 to stability of 2500 - example 54 it would be interesting to see how far our model explains the dynamics of chagas disease on the whole our common expectations on the model really come true and this prompts us to analyze this model further with regard to its applicability for understanding various infectious diseases - this would be our scope of future study we need to present simpler conditions on parameters and provide results for global asymptotic stability for general infection functions fxy also global stability analysis of the model with general interaction vaccination and recovery functions is in the offing infection rate treatment rate and vaccination are the three important parameters that essentially decide the dynamics of the spread of a disease an effort has to be made for estimation of these parameters in order to decide the measures of control of disease our investigation on these lines will be made open soon we shall now propose some modifications to 1 taking into consideration some realistic phenomena we present the following cases as open research problems that would form a part of our further research1we have assumed the growth rate of susceptible population a in 1 as a fixed constant this assumption holds good when the susceptible population receives input from a large society and the disease visits for a limited period during which the reproduction of susceptible infected andor recovered population is not significant however in case of chronic diseases such as aids chagas etc offspring of all three populations may make sizeable contribution to the system thus we may consider33xauxyz-bfxy-dx-cvxzyb1fxt-yt-rpy-d1yzrpyt--zhere auxyz denotes the growth function of susceptible population2vaccination well before an attack by the disease is rare may be it is possible in a well prepared society but in most of the cases vaccine is not readily available and a delay in its preparation or supply is natural this may be viewed in two directionsa vaccine takes time 0 to develop immunity so that susceptible population vaccinated at time t- are immune at time t hence such population may be removed from the system thus we have34xa-bfxy-dx-cvt-zyb1fxt-yt-rpy-d1yzrpyt--znotice that we have taken vxtvt- in 1 for this caseb vaccination effort being carried out at time t depends on a previous estimation of population that is we choose vxtvxt- in 1 we have35xa-bfxy-dx-cvxt-zyb1fxt-yt-rpy-d1yzrpyt--z

4though mathematical models can describe many plausible realistic phenomena their usefulness is acceptable only if they stand the test on the real time data thus it would be interesting to test the results of this article with available real time data so that necessary modifications or improvement of 1 may be taken up suitably5consider the influence of sudden environmental changes or other measures taken up to control the spread of disease may be described as noise in the system introducing such term in 1 we have37xa-bfxy-dx-cvxzyb1fxt-yt-rpy-d1y-tyzrpyt--zhere ty0 for all ty may be understood as the rate at which infected population is decreasing owing to changes in environment that are non-conducive for infection or measures taken up to keep the infected away from the system isolation or measures taken up by society for controlling the spread of the disease of course a ty0 condition says that the situation is encouraging for growth of infected population

corri levine b liana medina kevin melody joan geisbert b karla fenton a thomas geisbert w robert cross w   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged in wuhan china in late 2019 and rapidly swept the globe as of may 16 2020 over 44 million confirmed cases and 302000 deaths have been reported worldwide 1 the covid-19 crisis has inflicted an immense toll on human health causing profound socioeconomic effects that will linger for years to come vaccines and treatments against sars-cov-2 could drastically reduce covid-19 transmission saving lives and brightening prospects for economic recovery no licensed countermeasures currently exist although a number of clinical trials are underway while clinical testing is a good predictor of preventative and drug efficacy caution is warranted with this approach due to the potential for disease enhancement vaccine candidates against sars-cov-1 including inactivated whole-virus recombinant dna subunit virus-like particle and live virus vector-based vaccines induced an immunopathology following immunization and experimental infection of mice ferrets and nonhuman primates nhps suggesting hypersensitivity to virus components 25 given the strong genetic similarity of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 6 an appropriate surrogate for human covid-19 is needed to safely evaluate prophylactics a careful assessment in animal models could reveal possible immune complications elicited by vaccines and therapies prior to their release to the public moreover animal models could help shed light on important aspects of the disease in ways that are not easily addressed or feasible in humans such as how the virus spreads and interacts with the host immune system an ideal covid-19 animal model would replicate all facets of human disease several animal species including mice hamsters ferrets and nhps were found to support sars-cov-2 replication and displayed varying degrees of non-lethal illness when the virus was delivered into the respiratory tract of these animals 713 while each of these models has utility in the study of covid-19 nhps have the closest physiological resemblance to humans allowing a better comparison of host responses to infection this genetic similarity has also contributed to the increased availability of reagents to perform in-depth analyses of the immune response recently the first studies evaluating the pathogenic potential of sars-cov-2 in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques were performed rhesus macaques developed pneumonia and clinical signs whereas disease in cynomolgus macaques was fairly mild indicating the former appears to better reflect more severe cases of covid-19 1012 these results suggest certain nhp species may serve as better models than others for coronavirus infections for sars the disease caused by sars-cov-1 african green monkeys agms were found to support the highest level of viral replication followed by cynomolgus macaques and rhesus macaques when all three species were challenged in parallel 14 only agms had notable replication in the lower respiratory tract following sars-cov-1 inoculation necropsy of these animals indicated focal interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and edema in the lung consistent with human sars as sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 share the same putative host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 15 16 we reasoned that agms might serve as a useful model for covid-19 here we infected agms with a low passage isolate of sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2inmi1-isolate2020italy and evaluated their potential as a model for covid-19 sars-cov-2inmi1-isolate2020italy was isolated from the first clinical case in italy 17 and is the first v clade virus gisaid to be experimentally inoculated into nhps we demonstrate agms mimic several aspects of human disease including a high degree of viral replication and severe pulmonary lesions this model can be used to conduct pathogenesis studies and to screen potential vaccines and therapeutics we challenged six adult agms with 50  105 pfu of the italy isolate of sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2inmi1-isolate2020italy by combined intratracheal it and intranasal in routes dose divided equally a cohort of three animals was euthanized at 5 dpi while the remaining three animals were held indefinitely blood from all animals was sampled on days 0 2 3 4 and 5 and continuing with days 7 9 12 15 and 21 for animals held past 5 dpi no overt clinical signs of disease were observable in any of the animals other than decreased appetite compared to baseline 0 days post-infection dpi in 56 animals and a brief period of elevated body temperature suggestive of fever in two of three animals at 3 dpi supplementary figure 1 a biphasic increase in partial o2 pressures were noted in two animals over the course of the study but no overt changes in partial co2 pressures in any animals were noted figure 1-ab transient shifts in leukocyte populations and mild thrombocytopenia were observed in all animals most prominently during days 27 post-infection supplementary table 1 figure 1-cdef markers for renal and hepatic function mostly remained unchanged  2-fold increases in alt ast alp however crp a marker of acute systemic inflammation was elevated two to seven-fold in all animals 25 dpi table 1 figure 1-ghij thoracic radiographs were taken on 1 2 3 4 5 dpi and were shown to be inconclusive supplementary figure 2 gross examination at necropsy of three agms at 5 dpi revealed varying degrees of pulmonary consolidation with hyperemia in all monkeys figure 2 lesions were multifocal to locally extensive within each lobe the most severe lesions were located in the dorsal aspects of the lower lung lobes in all animals a board-certified veterinary pathologist approximated lesion severity for each lung lobe supplementary table 2 small intestines in all monkeys were segmentally flaccid and distended with gas and yellow liquid contents mild lymphoid enlargement was noted in one of the three monkeys there were no other significant gross lesions histologically all three agms at 5 dpi developed varying degrees of multifocal pulmonary lesions in the most severely affected monkey histologic features of pneumonia include acute inflammation centered on terminal bronchioles and numerous multinucleated giant cells with irregularly distributed nuclei continuous with the terminal bronchiolitis was evidence of diffuse alveolar damage dad with hyaline membrane formation type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage occasionally small fibrous tissue proliferations were noted within the terminal airways reminiscent of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia boop-like lesions interstitial pneumonia was noted in the lesser affected regions of the lung along with congestion and increased numbers of alveolar macrophages in the less affected monkeys pulmonary lesions lack acute inflammation within the terminal bronchioles however interstitial pneumonia is present and in one monkey multinucleated giant cells with irregularly distributed nuclei were prominently displayed within bronchioles colocalization of sars antigen with pulmonary lesions were demonstrated with antibodies against sars n protein positive immunohistochemical labeling was noted diffusely within the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages respiratory epithelium type i pneumocytes and type ii pneumocytes one animal had only positive immunolabeling in respiratory epithelium genomic sars-cov2 rna was detected by in situ hybridization in pneumocytes and associated with the alveolar macrophages within acute inflammation centered on terminal bronchioles figure 3 we quantified viral load from mucosal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid collected on procedure days by rt-qpcr and plaque titration figure 4 all animals had detectable quantities of vrna and infectious virus from nasal secretions beginning at 2 dpi with viral titers ranging from 24 log pfuml figure 4-ab both viral rna vrna and infectious virus were detected from oral swabs from only three animals agm-2 agm-5 agm-6 3 dpi and persisted in agm-5 up to 7 dpi figure 4-cd infectious virus was only detectable from the rectal swab of a single animal agm-3 35 dpi however vrna was also detected from agm-4 and agm-5 figure 4-ef both vrna and infectious virus was present in bal fluid from all animals beginning at 3 dpi figure 4-gh neither vrna nor infectious virus was detected by rt-qpcr of rna from whole blood or plaque titration of plasma from any animal indicating a lack of circulating cell-associated or free virus in the peripheral blood data not shown similar to human cases of covid-19 systemic concentrations of a number of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were elevated following agm infection serum levels of pro-inflammatory il-8 ip-10 il-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 peaked at 2 dpi corresponding to subsequent recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils in the blood figure 1-de figure 5-cdef increased secretion of il-6 ifn-beta and il-10was also evident at this time point figure 5-agh notably il-6 is thought to predict respiratory failure in human covid-19 cases and may serve as an effective immunological biomarker 18 as il-6 is a main regulator of acute phase fibrinogen synthesis and elevated fibrinogen and other coagulation abnormalities are thought to correlate with disease severity in hospitalized patients 19 20 we also measured levels of this clotting factor fibrinogen levels surged in 4 of 6 monkeys indicating potential coagulation abnormalities in these animals figure 5-b this increase in circulating fibrinogen aligns with our gross pathology findings of substantial hemorrhage in the lung of monkeys euthanized at 5 dpi collectively these results indicate the host response to sars-cov-2 infection in agms parallels that of humans four animals seroconverted against sars-cov-2 including all three animals held past 5 dpi with the earliest detection of anti-sars-cov-2 igg occurring at 5 dpi in agm-3 agm-4 and agm-6 figure 6-a igg titers peaked at 15 dpi with agm-6 exhibiting low titers at 15 and 21 dpi compared to agm-4 and agm-5 neutralizing titers 50 plaque reduction values ranged from 18132 were evident beginning at day 5 in one animal and all three animals followed to the study endpoint figure 6 bcde the emergence of sars-cov-2 and its astonishingly rapid evolution from localized outbreak to pandemic threat has emphasized the importance of coronaviruses with regards to human health globally particularly of those clustering with lineage b betacoronaviruses accordingly a necessity exists for the development of animal models for sars-cov-2 which recapitulate the covid-19 disease phenotype observed in humans with regard to nhps efforts to do so have been made using both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques 1113 21 with rhesus macaques more closely exhibiting the symptoms of covid-19 disease in humans given that agms have shown utility as disease models for a number of respiratory pathogens ie nipah 22 sars-cov-1 14 we investigated their suitability as a model for sars-cov-2 infection agms challenged with an isolate of sars-cov-2 from italy did not develop overt debilitating clinical illness however changes in leukocyte subpopulations thrombocytes and serum markers of acute inflammatory processes indicated a systemic response to infection using surgically implanted temperature data loggers we were able to detect elevated body temperatures in two animals 3 dpi indicative of fever moreover all animals held past 5 dpi seroconverted with two animals achieving high igg titers 16400 the third animal held to 21 dpi never had an anti-sars-cov-2 igg titer above 1200 suggesting a dampened humoral response in this animal and that immune arms other than humoral immunity may be important during sars-cov-2 infection additionally the potential for re-infection in humans with sars-cov-2 has been speculated but the risk factors or actual incidence are unknown however antibody titers to endemic human coronaviruses eg hcov-229e are reported to gradually wane and re-infection with the homologous virus has been reported 23 24 an important aspect of the agm model for sars-cov-2 infection is the development of pronounced viral pneumonia all agms in our study exhibited pulmonary consolidation with hemorrhage varying in severity between animals and lung lobes we performed thoracic radiographs on all six sars-cov-2-infected agms however the radiographs while consistent with work on sars-cov-2-infected macaques recently published by others 11 12 21 did not reflect the degree of lesions and hemorrhage of the lungs seen at necropsy it is our opinion that the radiographs from our study as well as those from the other covid-19 nhp studies do not convincingly demonstrate sars-cov-2-induced disease specifically opacities and changes observed in radiographs could be nonspecific and due to atelectasis poor inspiratory effort and bals collection procedures important to this discussion the current recommendation in humans is to not even use radiography for the primary diagnosis of covid-19 notably a recent study of 636 ambulatory patients with covid-19 did not detect any abnormalities in chest x rays of almost 60 of the cases 25 the use of computed tomography ct scanning or even plesmography techniques may be more informative for detailed pulmonary investigations using animal models there was evidence of gastrointestinal involvement in the sars-cov-2-infected agms which has been reported in human cases 23 as the putative sar-cov-2 entry receptor ace-2 is expressed in the epithelium of the ileum and colon 26 however while all animals in our study exhibited abnormalities within the small intestine we did not observe signs of gastrointestinal distress during the study course with the possible exception of decreased appetite in most animals our data show that infection of agms with sars-cov-2 results in the release of inflammatory mediators with similar immune signatures as human cases several groups reported that levels of il-6 il-8 and il-10 correlate with disease severity in human patients 27 28 in this study we observed increased serum levels of these interleukins as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines elevated in human cases moreover we detected a rise in fibrinogen in a majority of monkeys another prominent finding in human covid-10 cases fibrinogen is implicated in thrombosis and vascular injury suggesting this discovery warrants further investigation together these results indicate the agm model can be used to study the host response to covid-19 the heterologous response of agms along with the ability to collect tissues and longitudinal samples permits a detailed study of pathogenesis and immunity to covid-19 the virus sars-cov-2inmi1-isolate2020italy employed was isolated on january 30 2020 from the sputum of the first

comprehensive review of animal models for coronaviruses sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov ashutosh singh rahul singh soloman phulen sarma gitika batra rupa joshi hardeep kaur amit sharma raj ajay prakash bikash medhi   in the past two decades two outbreaks of coronaviruses covs in asian subcontinent and the middle east increased the chances of such outbreak in the near future the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov outbreak at the end of 2002 november in china in which 8098 confirmed cases were reported with 774 total deaths 96 ksiazek et al2003 who 2002 another coronavirus ie middle east respiratory syndrome mers occurred in 2012 with a fatality rate of around 35 who 2019 bermingham et al2012 recently a new coronavirus called as novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 outbreak in december 2019 in china there is an emergence of global health threats and the situation became worse at the global level rodriguez-morales et al2020 the world health organization who termed the syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus as covid-19 on 11th feb 2020 gralinski and menachery 2020 coronaviruses fall in coronaviridae family and subfamily coronavirinae the members of which infect a broad range of hosts producing symptoms and diseases of wide spectrum from a flu like to severe acute respiratory infection sari the sars-cov-2 is considered to be one of the seven members of the cov family that infect humans zhu et al2020 similar to other coronaviruses the transmission of sars-cov-2 among humans occurs through droplets direct contact any physical objects and aerosols who 2020a liu et al2020 owing to the rapid transmission sars-cov-2 epidemic has become a global public health challenge on march 11 covid-19 outbreak was declared as a pandemic by who cucinotta and vanelli 2020 by june 10 more than 7 million people have been globally affected with nearly 408025 fatalities who 2020b due to the high morbidity and mortality rate of coronaviruses infection there is an unmet need for therapeutic strategies to treat these diseases sarma et al2020 currently there are no recommended therapeutic drugs or vaccine for coronaviruses this emphasizes the surge for a suitable animal model to explore the pathogenesis and evaluation of countermeasures for the disease with the outbreak of the coronaviruses numerous animal models were developed in the past gralinski and baric 2015 the current review highlighted the animal models of coronaviruses summarized the strength and weaknesses of the existing animal models along with their key features sars-cov-2 was recently recognized as a novel coronavirus causing the symptoms from mild to critical type sari munster et al used sars-cov-2 infected rhesus macaques to study the pathogenesis of covid-19 they observed high viral titers in nose swabs throat swabs and also lung lesions at varying degrees in all animals table 1 this model recapitulates covid-19 symptoms and can be used further to elucidate the therapy for sars-cov-2 infection munster et al2020 rockx et al compared the pathogenesis of sars and mers with covid-19 by inoculating cynomolgus macaques with virus infection rockx et al2020 the virus samples were taken from the throat and nose the diffuse alveolar damage was reported the results of the study thus demonstrated that the infection with sars-cov-2 in non-human primates induced signs that resemble covid-19 like disease and the severity of virus infection lies in between the mers and sars mahase 2020 yu et al studied the association of virus infection with age the viral strain was inoculated in rhesus macaques of 35 years old and 15 years old through intra-tracheal route the clinical signs for instance viral replication and histopathological changes were analyzed replication of virus was more in lungs and nasopharyngeal swabs of old rhesus macaque as compared to young rhesus macaque after infection old rhesus macaques also observed to have diffuse severe interstitial pneumonia yu et al2020 in a comparative study three species of non-human primates were infected with sars-cov-2 rhesus macaque macaca fascicularis and common marmoset severe gross lesions and histopathological changes in the vital organs of all animals were observed the study found that the rhesus macaque model was more susceptible to sars-cov-2 as compared to macaca fascicularis and common marmoset lu et al2020 woolsey et al determined that african green monkeys supported a high level of sars-cov-2 replication and developed a respiratory tract related illnesses that might be more substantial than reported for other non-human primate species like cynomolgus and rhesus macaques the study also reported high viral loads in feces and in mucosal samples of all monkeys after 15 days post-infection dpi woolsey et al2020 table 1 the inoculation of balbc mice with mouse-adapted sars-cov-2 at passage 6 macsp6 significantly affected all groups of mice irrespective of their ages the infection resulted in moderate pneumonia and inflammation a study reported higher viral load in lungs along with significant histopathological changes like denatured trachea inflammation in pulmonary alveoli detection of viral antigen in the trachea bronchiole in type ii pneumocytes there was a significant elevation of inflammatory chemokine and cytokines in sera and lung macrophages similar to clinical symptoms gu et al2020 dinnon et al constructed a recombinant virus sars-cov-2 ma that could replicate in both upper as well as lower airways of all groups of balbc mice irrespective of their ages the results showed that there was more severe infection in aged mice in comparison to young mice dinnon et al2020 a study has been done based on the human ace2 hace2 transgenic mice to investigate the pathogenesis of covid-19 infected mice reported weight loss and increased viral titer in lungs and histopathological changes revealed the presence of interstitial pneumonia the mice model seems to be promising for the evaluation of therapeutic measures for covid-19 bao et al2020 one of the studies examined the infectivity and pathological changes in sars-cov-2 infected transgenic hace2 mice which was developed using lung ciliated epithelial cell-specific hfh4foxj1 promoter 81 the model showed a partial simulation of the human covid-19 the significant decrease in body weight interstitial pneumonia and fatality along with the involvement of other organs like heart brain and eye depicted its similarity to the human counterpart the study also showed protection on reinfection in the survived mice jiang et al2020 table 1 sun sh et al developed the hace2 mouse model using crisprcas9 knock in technology to study the sars-cov-2 infection and compared it with the wild type c57bl6 mice model there was high viral titer in brain lungs and trachea of hace2 mice than wild type mice sars-cov-2 infection in hace2 mice associated with increased cytokine levels and interstitial pneumonia with no mortality moreover intragastric inoculation of the sars-cov-2 infection altered significant pathological changes in lungs when compared to wild type mice sun et al2020b sun j et al developed a transgenic mice model by delivery of human ace2 exogenously with a replication deficient adenovirus ad5-hace2 the inoculation of mice with sars-cov-2 infection linked to high viral load in lungs along with weight loss and pneumonia the role of type-1 interferon signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 stat1 signaling is vital in viral clearance of virus and infection further the study concluded the beneficial role of using human convalescent plasma and two antiviral agents polyinosinic polycytidylic acid and remdesivir sun j et al2020a hassan et al developed hace2 transduced mice and infected these mice with sars-cov-2 the study observed significant weight loss high viral load in lungs and severe lung pathology in infected mice hassan et al2020 chan et al observed significant binding of the novel coronavirus spike with the ace2 receptor of the syrian hamster by in silico study table 1 the viral load significantly increased in the hamster which leads to diffuse alveolar damage in the initial stage and extensive apoptosis in the later phase of infection chan et al2020 the clinical and histopathological observations from sars-cov-2 hamster model closely resemble to the clinical condition the airway involvement is evident from nasal turbinate to the trachea and pulmonary alveoli associated with changes of inflammation cellular viral n protein expression and high viral load during the first week the disease progressed with increasing respiratory rate decreasing activity and progressive weight loss and was found to be most severe by 6 dpi which is similar to the disease course of covid-19 patients huang et al2020 sia et al evaluated the transmission and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection in the golden syrian hamster model the animal groups infected with sars-cov-2 showed significant weight loss and viral replication in the respiratory tract viral load was high on 2 dpi and rapid clearance was observed on 7 dpi which could be attributed to the presence of cd3 positive t-lymphocytes the involvement of olfactory sensory neurons simulates the anosmia in covid-19 cases the transmission of sars-cov-2 to nave hamsters by aerosols can be helpful for further studies sia et al2020 table 1 kim et al used ferrets to study the sars-cov-2 infection and its transmission the study reported that the ferrets were more susceptible to infection and transmission of the virus from one ferret to naive ferrets by direct or indirect physical contact they showed that infected ferrets exhibited more replication of the virus in the upper respiratory tract and it recapitulates covid-19 human conditions and can be further used to evaluate the countermeasures for the disease kim et al2020 table 1 for the development of sars-cov infection model many species like old and new world primates were used there was significant infection observed in cynomolgus fouchier et al2003 and rhesus macaques rowe et al2004 common marmosets greenough et al2005 and african green monkeys mcauliffe et al2004 when the virus was inoculated within respiratory tract in those primates however in the case of squirrel monkeys and mustached tamarins investigators were not able to induce infection roberts et al2008 subbarao and roberts 2006 there was significantly high viral replication in cynomolgus rhesus and african green monkeys mcauliffe et al2004 while in marmosets diarrhea pneumonitis fever watery stool and hepatitis were observed greenough et al2005 investigators have variable findings as a number of factors may affect the results including age and animal source dose route of administration of infection and inoculation of the virus and their history of the environment subbarao and roberts 2006 however results in out-bred species are not consistent because of biological variability therefore it is important to carry large sample sizes for the study to find out the meaningful conclusions table 2 there were different mice models used for the study of infection when balbc mice were infected intranasally there was an increase in viral titer in the lungs but no sign of morbidity or mortality was noticed after 2 to 3 dpi virus replication significantly increased in the respiratory tract but started decreasing at day 5 dpi subbarao et al2004 this showed that young balbc mice failed to exhibit clinical signs of disease but permitted viral replication on the other hand a study showed that one-year-old balbc mice exhibited critical infection as compared to younger mice after sars-cov infection vogel et al2007 histopathological findings such as bronchiolitis diffuse alveolar damage and patchy interstitial pneumonitis were observed in balbc mice model of sars-cov it was also observed that old age balbc mice were more prone to this disease as similar to the clinical symptoms observed in elderly people in the 2003 sars outbreak one of the studies suggested that 129s mice infected with sars-cov exhibited virus replication and self-limited bronchiolitis 129s mice strain also reported mild weight loss and pneumonitis after sars-cov infection while on the other side stat 1 -- mice in the 129s background observed sustained replication of the virus and histopathological changes which were mimicking the humans disease however vaccine studies are limited where targeted mice have immune defects hogan et al2004 frieman et al2010 moreover c57bl6 mice were also used as a sars-cov model virus isolates administered intranasal into c57bl6 mice showed high replication in the respiratory tract of mice with a peak on the 3rd day and clearance on the 9 dpi the study observed the presence of transient systemic infection in the lungs which ultimately affects the brain glass et al2004 table 2 another model used to study the sars-cov infection is a golden syrian hamster there was a significantly high titer of viruses in the lungs along with interstitial pneumonitis roberts et al2005 because of the clinical signs like pulmonary histopathology and high virus load the hamster can be used as a model for the study of therapeutics immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis it was observed that viruses got cleared off by 7dpi table 2 various studies showed that domestic cats and ferrets are prone to sars-cov infection because virus replication as well as specific antibodies were found in both the species after indicating drowsiness and epiphysitis 16 to 21 dpi ferrets died martina et al2003 however with domestic cats no further study has been conducted after the inoculation of infection via intranasal route the replication of the virus in the lungs and histological changes like pneumonitis were reported ter meulen et al2004 table 2 adney et al studied the pathology and transmission of mers-cov among dromedary camels the animals displayed slight increases in body temperature and rhinorrhea a large quantity of nasal shedding of the virus is suggestive of an animal-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission which may occur through droplets or direct contact mers-cov mainly affects the upper respiratory tract and mimics mild clinical signs since in clinical settings the disease shows severe pathology so camel as a model to study therapeutics is not suitable adney et al2014 table 3 mers-cov is classified under biosafety level 3 which poses difficulty in using camels for infection study alpaca belonging to the camelidae family provides an alternative to camels crameri et al used alpaca as a prospective substitute to a camel for mers-cov vaccine testing crameri et al2016 on exposure to mers-cov the study observed dissimilarity between the immune response of two species however the pathogenesis of infection in alpaca is unknown table 3 de wit et al used rhesus macaques to develop the mers model there was high viral load of mers-cov in the lower respiratory tract the viral strain mainly affected type i and ii pneumocytes that formed the architecture of the alveolar space since high expression of mers-cov was present in the lungs therefore there was limited virus shedding there was no viral replication in the kidney the study concluded that renal failure in humans might be associated with hypoxia but not with viral dissemination due to its transitory nature this model of rhesus macaques was not found to be exactly mimicking the critical clinical cases de wit et al2013a similarly yao et al observed a mild increase in temperature in rhesus monkeys there was no virus detected in the upper respiratory tract significant pneumonia was observed with no systemic dissemination of the virus the study concluded only lower respiratory infection with no extra-pulmonary effect yao et al2014 human exposure to mers-cov leads to severe respiratory disease which might result in fatality and it is not easy to attain the same fatality rate in non-human primate models cockrell et al used an infectious clone of novel mers-cov icmers-0 to induce mers in the rhesus macaque the clone strain was found to have higher pathogenicity in comparison to its wild type mers-cov peaked at 3 to 5 dpi and resolved to 30 dpi the respiratory disease was found to be placid and brief which resolves by day 30 dpi the model mimics only mild infection of mers in humans cockrell et al2018 in most of the cases fatality is associated with comorbidities in mers affected patients hui et al2014 saad et al2014 and severity is linked to the immunocompromised state in order to study the immune response and disease severity prescott et al used the immunosuppressive drugs to down-regulate the immunity of rhesus macaques the immunosuppressive state was found to be associated with a high titer of mers-cov but not supported by the pathology in lung tissues inflammatory cells significantly decreased in immunocompromised animals when evaluated histopathologically this in turn shows the effect of the immune status of an individual on the shedding of the viral load this study depicted the importance of considering the immune response along with using therapy to control infection in clinical settings prescott et al2018 table 3 marmosets are more prone to mers-cov infection than the rhesus macaques and it might be suitable to screen therapeutic strategies for the disease in marmoset johnson et al2015 falzarano et al2014 the study by falzarano et al displayed an increase in severity following exposure to mers-cov in marmoset than rhesus macaque the titer was almost 1000 times greater in marmoset than in rhesus macaque the infection persisted for a longer duration as compared in rhesus macaque and need euthanasia in fact there was a systemic dissemination of the virus but there was no viral dissemination in the kidney the study observed that the marmoset model recapitulates more closely to human mers falzarano et al2014 johnson et al used two clones of mers-cov ie mers-cov-jordan-n32012 and mers-cov-emc2012 the inoculation of mers-cov into common marmosets resulted in mild to moderate clinical presentation of the disease which might be due to the manipulations of the marmoset to a certain extent johnson et al2015 table 3 pigs are naturally permissive to the mers-cov infection de wit et al2017 vergara-alert et al used hcovemc2012 to infect yorkshire landrace pigs the study observed no animal-to-animal transmission though rna dissemination of the virus was significantly high thus this model cannot be used to study therapeutic strategies as it does not depict the true clinical condition vergara-alert et al2017 table 3 houser et al studied the effect of re-infection in the rabbits the model supported the replication of mers-cov-emc2012 virus the model displayed asymptomatic infection which is not associated with any significant clinical sign the model is not suitable for preclinical screening of therapeutics or vaccines for mers houser et al2017 table 3 mice are easily available cost-effective easy to handle and suitable for initial screening of drug therapies and vaccines since mice are not susceptible to mers-cov infection de wit et al2013b coleman et al2014 therefore zhao et al developed a mouse model for mers using a recombinant adenovirus that expresses humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 hdpp4 receptor zhao et al2014 the study concluded significant weight loss and virus dissemination in the respiratory tract further interstitial pneumonia was observed in the mice the transient hdpp4 expression mild respiratory system involvement with no fatality are the drawbacks of the model zhao et al2014 though the previous study used an adenovirus vector to develop the dpp4 receptor in mice vulnerable to mers-cov infection it did not mimic more closely to the clinical conditions agrawal et al used tissue-specific and inducible promoters to derive humanized dpp4 transgenic mice on exposure to mers-cov the model showed high susceptibility to the virus agrawal et al2015 briefly the transgenic model depicted progressive pneumonia with fatality agrawal et al developed a hcd26dpp4 transgenic mice and the receptors were distributed throughout the body which was not physiologically relevant agrawal et al2015 pascal et al used veloci gene technology to rapidly develop a new humanized model the model showed active viral replication in the respiratory tract without cerebral infection pascal et al2015 tao et al observed constant inflammatory infiltrates in both brain and lungs in humanized cd26 hcd26dpp4 mice the high viral titer was observed in the lungs and in the brain of mice on exposure to mers-cov infection the pathological examination found gross and microscopic inflammation which was not restricted to lungs but a sign of systemic dissemination along with fatality in 46 dpi tao et al2015 tao et al showed acute severe infection which hampers the opportunity to fully understand the pathogenesis zhao et al developed a mouse model that exhibits the codon-optimized- hdpp4 receptor which on exposure to viral strain showed severe disease pathology in lungs which further affected the brain and kidney the severe infection and aberrant immune response lead to mortality the exact mechanism of the severity of the disease model requires further evaluation zhao et al2015 cockrell et al used crisprcas9 technology to genetically alter a non-permissive host receptor the model showed severe respiratory distress and fatality response to mers-cov this was further supported by plethysmography that showed decreased pulmonary function which might be due to the inflammation in pneumocytes and airway epithelial cells the viral titers were not detected in the brain thereby nullifying any confounding factors which could lead to fatality cockrell et al2016 li et al developed transgenic mice and inoculated with mouse adapted mers-cov mersma viral strain which caused weight loss infection in airway epithelia pneumocytes and macrophages though the model was rapid to develop required no prior sensitization the pathological changes were exclusively associated with the species-adapted mutations of the mersma clone this hinders the model to fully mimic clinical conditions li et al2017 fan et al used crisprcas9 gene-editing technology to develop a knock-in-model of mice the study displayed a high level of expression of hdpp4 in the respiratory tract and to a lesser extent in the brain there is a clear site of infection along with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in the lungs there is also the dissemination of viruses into the central nervous system cns the study observed high repeatability and the safety of the model fan et al2018 iwata-yoshikawa et al developed a transgenic mouse model using the endogenous promoter the hdpp4 mice model showed a high viral titer in the lower respiratory tract acute multifocal interstitial pneumonia was observed at 7 dpi the viral titer was also observed in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues there was an age-associated immune response to exposure to the viral strain the model expressed mild infection pathology moreover after the infection this model had not shown any signs of lesions in the brain and kidney iwata-yoshikawa et al2019 table 3 
the coronaviruses pathology is associated with the involvement of severe acute respiratory infection sari and immune deregulation thus it is requisite to perform a study using an assay system that must involve all the cell signalling and thus using animal model is an unparallel approachthere are some animal models that recapitulate mild to moderate pathology however the clinical condition is related to high mortality and morbidity therefore animal models which mimic critical pathologies are much closer to clinical conditionsthe novel coronavirus covid-19 pathology is linked to viral respiratory infection hyper-immune response and coagulopathy lin et al2020 connors and levy 2020 therefore to understand the mechanism or to evaluate therapeutic countermeasures the animal models should involve all these interplays in a single model since with the advent of technology transgenic mice are the significant tool but the transgenic mice lack the coagulopathy component which is indispensable in order to understand the complete mechanism and to evaluate the countermeasuresfurther validation of the animal model is crucial the error in the animal experimental study narrows the chances of the potential drugs or repurposing or repositioning drugs or vaccines to translate successfully to clinics and moreover it is a wastage of resources thus it is the need of the hour to validate the animal model using different criteria for instance face construct and predictive validity denayer et al2014

zheng qing dai qiangmin sun yunzhang hu changwen ke hongqi liu xiaozhong peng  covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 infection has recently been announced as a pandemic all over the world plenty of diagnostic preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since december 2019 however animal models particularly non-human primate models are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines in this study two families of non-human primates old world monkeys 12 macaca mulatta 6 macaca fascicularis and new world monkeys 6 callithrix jacchus were experimentally inoculated with sars-cov-2 clinical signs were recorded samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding viremia and histopathological examination increased body temperature was observed in 100 1212 m mulatta 333 26 m fascicularis and none 06 of c jacchus post inoculation of sars-cov-2 all of m mulatta and m fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs throat swabs anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys viral shedding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation from necropsied m mulatta and m fascicularis tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung weasand bronchus and spleen no viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied c jacchus severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung heart and stomach of sars-cov-2 infected animals in summary we have established a nhp model for covid-19 which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines and investigate viral pathogenesis m mulatta is the most susceptible to sars-cov2 infection followed by m fascicularis and c jacchus m mulatta is the most susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection as compared to m fascicularis and c jacchus  the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 infection was firstly reported in wuhan hubei china in december 2019 1  about one month this severe disease attracted international attentions and declared as a public health emergency of international concern pheic on january 30 2020 within 4 months covid-19 unexpectedly spread to 195 countries and regions led to more than 1 million confirmed cases in the world and was defined as a pandemic disease it is believed to be the second largest infectious disease since 1918 flu 2  clinicians and scientists have been globally collaborating to investigate this disease and its pathogen such as diagnosis prevention and treatment of covid-19 3  genome and structure of sars-cov-2 4  however there are still many critical questions remaining which are hard to be answered in clinic studies for example how do sars-cov-2 transmit what is viral pathogenesis what about vaccines and drugs against sars-cov-2 therefore animal models are urgently expected to be established for this severe covid-19 although several models of covid-19 have recently been reported 5 6 7  including the non-human primate model none of model should be considered to be the best one depending on what questions we are going to answer with the animal models about 16 years ago the nonhuman primate models recapitulated several important aspects of sars 8 9 10 11  these models made great contributions to investigation of sars pathogenesis evaluation of antiviral drugs and vaccine 12  though covid-19 is different from sars in some aspects pathogens for these two diseases share some characters such as ace2 receptor here to establish the covid-19 model two families including 3 species of non-human primates which are widely used for animal models with their own advantages and disadvantages were experimentally infected with sars-cov-2 followed by comparisons of clinical symptoms hematology biochemical indexes immunology and histopathology among 3 species we found that both  given that host factors may be involved in viral pathogenesis we designed an experiment in the present study to investigate whether host genetics age and gender affect sars-cov-2 infection in non-human primates  figure 1  two families of non-human primates old world monkeys 12 m mulatta 6 m fascicularis and new world monkeys 6 c jacchus were chosen for this experiment after screening and randomly grouped based on species age and gender  figure 1  animals in large size 4 adults and 4 old m mulatta 6 m fascicularis were inoculated with 475x10 6 pfu of sars-cov-2 via 3 routines intratreachuslly 40ml intranasally 05ml and intra 025ml half dosage of the viruses was given to 4 young m mulatta via the same 3 routines 6 c jacchus were inoculated with 10x10 6 pfu intranasally animals were monitored daily and sampled at the indicated time points before and after viral inoculation  figure 1  increased body temperature bt above 38  was continuously observed in 100 1212 m mulatta 333 26 m fascicularis and none 06 of c jacchus post inoculation of sars-cov-2 bt of 712 m mulatta reached the first peak on day 4-6 post inoculation dpi and maintained above 38  for several days the highest bt was 409  during sars-cov-2 infection of m fascicularis their bt didnt change as much as those of m mulatta and duration of bt38  in m fascicularis was shorter than m mulatta figure 2a  on 0 and 10 dpi body weight bw of experimental animals c jacchus not determined was checked on electronic balance as compared to bw on day 0 nine out of 12 m mulatta showed the decreased bw with declined range of 588-2857 eighty-three percent 56 of m fascicularis lost bw by 217-1051 table 1  chest radiographs of infected animals m mulatta and m fascicularis not c jacchus due to their small size were recorded every other day post virus inoculation from the beginning of 10 dpi abnormalities at various degrees appeared in lungs of all m mulatta and m fascicularis the texture of the two lungs is increased and thickened and scattered in small patches  figure 2b  overview of the chest radiograph throughout this study showed that progressive pulmonary infiltration was noted in all m mulatta and m fascicularis supplemental figure 1  to know dynamics of viral replication and virus shedding samples of nasal swabs throat swabs anal swabs feces blood and tissues were collected at the indicated time points and sars-cov-2 genomes were quantitated by rt-qpcr swab samples collected on 2 dpi from m mulatta and m fascicularis showed surprisingly high levels of viral genome rna particularly in nasal swabs most of swab samples saw the second peaks of viral rna on 6-8 dpi in some swab samples from old world monkeys viral rna was still detectable on 14 dpi  figure 3a  less viral rna were detected in throat swabs figure 3d and figure 3e  under tem no viral particle was observed in the ultrathin sections of lungs and other tissues to determine the host response to sars-cov-2 infection we firstly however animals in this study were screened prior to experiments and supposed to be no severe complicationscomorbidities and relatively healthy with normal immunity this may explain that no matter age and gender within one species monkeys showed similar susceptibility and responses to sars- monitoring body temperature is one of critical steps to define covid-19 suspected patients which leads to the conclusion that fever is the most common in covid-19 patients counting for more than 85 of all inpatients 3 18 21  here all sars-cov-2 inoculated m mulatta had increased body temperature at some time points with a peak of 409  one-third of m fascicularis and c jacchus had a slightly elevated body temperature nevertheless this manifestation could not be defined as fever since we dont have the physiological body temperature of various species of monkeys as a reference the other important clinical feature of covid-19 is abnormal changes of chest radiograph from x-ray and ct 22  which is generally considered to be direct evidence for pneumonia ground glass opacities ggo were seen in 40-70-896 of covid-19 patients followed by consolidation 13-339 and other abnormal radiographs 18 21 23 24  in this study all animals c jacchus bloodserum 1 30  in samples from upper respiratory track nasal swabs had higher levels of viral rna than those in throat swabs 30  sars-cov-2 rna in nasal swabs was detectable at the onset of disease and peaked on day 2 post onset of disease after that it began to decline slowly and usually last for about 2 weeks 31  in the present study dynamics of virus shedding in the nhp was similar to that reported in covid-19 patients although some minor disparities existed due to differences between disease onset in patients and viral inoculation time in animals on day 2 post viral inoculation there was an unusual peak of viral genome rna in nasal swabs  figure 3a  we speculated that this may be the left-over of viral nucleic acid from viral inoculation but not from replicating viruses since it sharply declined on 4 dpi the real peak of detectable rna from replicating viruses should be from 6 dpi to 8 dpi in nasal swabs from infected animals in addition detectable viral rna in anal swabs and expression of ace2 in digestive tract of patients with covid-19 suggest that fecal-oral routine has a great potential risk in the transmission of sars-cov-2 32  in this study we noticed that high level of virus shedding via feces lasted for a long time in 4 monkeys of animal model  figure 3a  viral load in various tissues as an indicator of tropism correlates with viral pathogenesis lung is widely considered to be the target organ for sars-cov-2 replication since plenty of viruses are detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from covid-19 patients 30  at the earlier stage of our animal models we could detect sars-cov-2 viral genomic rna in lung and the other respiratory tissues  figure 3c  however sars-cov-2 rna became negative in lung after 10 dpi but was still detectable in weasand and bronchus it is possible that inflammatory environment of lung may push viruses out to other tissues appearance of viral rna in blood out of lung correlated with the severity covid-19 33  we could detect viral rna in blood samples from all of 24 monkeys although there were some differences of viral load and lasting time among individual animals however we couldnt find the correlation between blood viral rna and severity of disease  viral stock of sars-cov-2 was obtained from the center of diseases control guangdong province china viruses were amplified

and developing vaccines immunotherapeutics and therapeutics kuldeep dhama khan sharun ruchi tiwari maryam dadar yashpal malik singh karam singh pal wanpen chaicumpa   coronaviruses covs are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses of the family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae that infect a wide host range to produce diseases ranging from common cold to severefatal illnesses the novel virus was initially named 2019-ncov which was changed to sars-cov-2 by the coronavirus study group csg of international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv since it was found to be the sister virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov1 the ongoing coronavirus threat that emerged in china has rapidly spread to other countries and has been declared as a global health emergency by the world health organization who many nations are diverting their best efforts for the implementation of appropriate preventive and control strategies neither vaccines nor direct-acting antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of human and animal coronavirus infections2-4 many efforts have been directed to develop vaccines against human cov infections in recent decades but a limiting factor is the degree of cross-protection rendered by these vaccines due to their extensive sequence diversity5 various vaccines immunotherapeutics and drug options have been explored during the recent threats of zika ebola and nipah viruses6-8 as well as against previous covs including sars- and mers-covs359-12 these valuable options can be exploited for their potency efficacy and safety along with expediting other ongoing research2413-15 so as to discover valuable modalities for tackling the emerging covid-19 but as yet there is no effective vaccine or therapeutic for which intense efforts are ongoing most of the therapeutic options that are available for managing covid-19 are based on previous experiences in treating sars- and mers-cov a major reason for the lack of approved and commercially available vaccines or therapeutic agents against these covs might be the relative lack of interest among the pharmaceutical companies13 these are outbreak scenarios the demand for drugs or vaccines lasts only for a period while the outbreak lasts the number of affected people will also be a small proportion of the global drug and vaccine market so by the time a new drug or vaccine is developed there might not be any patients for clinical trials and also no meaningful market for newly discovered drugs according to who guidelines infected patients will receive supportive care including oxygen therapy fluid therapy and antibiotics for treating secondary bacterial infections the who also recommends the isolation of patients suspected or confirmed for covid-1916 the major therapeutic drugs that might be effective in managing covid-19 include remdesivir lopinavirritonavir alone or in combination with interferon- convalescent plasma and mabs17 nevertheless before utilizing these drugs for covid-19 pneumonia patients clinical efficacy and safety studies should be conducted this article describes advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter covid-19 while also discussing experiences with sars- and mers-covs which together could pave ways in the right direction to halt this emerging virus multiple strategies are adopted in the development of cov vaccines most of these target the surface-exposed spike s glycoprotein or s protein as the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies several s-protein-based strategies have been attempted for developing cov vaccines eg use of full-length s protein or s1-receptor-binding domain rbd and expression in virus-like particles vlp dna or viral vectors5918-21 the s protein molecule contains two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit has an rbd that interacts with its host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 whereas the s2 subunit mediates fusion between the virus and host cell membranes for releasing viral rna into the cytoplasm for replication19 hence s-protein-based vaccines should induce antibodies that block not only viral receptor binding but also virus genome uncoating it has been shown that the c-terminal domain of the s1 subunit of porcine deltacoronavirus constitutes the immunodominant region and the immune response to this region shows the most potent neutralizing effect22 the s protein has a major role in the induction of protective immunity during infection with sars-cov by eliciting neutralizing-antibodies and t-cell responses19 thus full-length or appropriate parts of the s glycoprotein are believed to be the most promising candidate cov vaccine composition it was also reported that neither the absence nor presence of the other structural proteins affects s protein immunogenicity or its binding to the ace2 receptor that is a critical initial step for virus to access into the host cell2324 due to the superior ability of rbd to induce neutralizing antibody both recombinant proteins that contain rbd and the recombinant vectors that encode rbd can be used for developing the effective sars-cov vaccines18 recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine expressing mers-cov s protein induces systemic igg secretory iga and lung-resident memory t-cell responses when administered intranasally into balbc mice and provide long-lasting neutralizing immunity to mers spike pseudotyped virus thereby suggesting that the vaccine may confer protection against mers-cov24 furthermore rabies virus rv as a viral vector as well as gram-positive enhancer matrix gem as a bacterial vector has been used to express mers-cov s protein the immune responses to these vaccine candidates were evaluated in balbc mice for cellular and humoral immune responses which showed that rv-based vaccine stimulates significantly higher levels of cellular immunity and earlier antibody responses in comparison to the gem particle vector12 the possibility of developing a universal cov vaccine was assessed based on the similarity in t-cell epitopes of sars- and mers-cov that confirmed the potential for cross-reactivity among covs25 sars-cov-2 shares high genetic similarity with the sars-cov26 such that vaccines developed for sars-cov may exhibit cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 the comparative evaluation performed on full-length s protein sequences of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov identified that the most variable residues were located in the s1 subunit of s protein the critical cov vaccine target27 these findings suggest that the specific neutralizing antibodies that are effective against the sars-cov might not be effective against the sars-cov-2 even though the s protein of sars-cov-2 has key mutations compared to the sars-cov they will still act as a viable target for vaccine development28 likewise the close similarity of sars-cov-2 to the sars-cov suggests that the receptor of sars-cov-2 might be the same as that of sars-cov receptor ace229 immuno-informatics approach can be used for the identification of epitopes for inclusion in covid-19 vaccine candidates recently immuno-informatics was used to identify significant cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl and b-cell epitopes in sars-cov-2 s protein the interactions between these epitopes and their corresponding mhc class i molecules were studied further by using molecular dynamics simulations and found that the ctl epitopes bind with mhc class i peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts thus indicating their potential for generating immune responses30 such epitopes may possess the ideal characteristics to become part of covid-19 vaccine candidates the nucleocapsid n protein as well as the potential b cell epitopes of the e protein of mers-cov has been suggested as probable immuno-protective targets that induce both t-cell and neutralizing antibody responses3132 reverse genetic strategies have been successfully used in live-attenuated vaccines to inactivate the exonuclease effects of non-structural protein 14 nsp14 or to delete the envelope protein in sars5 avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv is a chicken cov it was suggested that avian live virus ibv vaccine strain h might be useful for sars33 given that protection provided by strain h is based on neutralizing antibody production as well as other immune responses hence avian ibv vaccine may be considered another option for covid-19 after evaluating its safety in monkeys34 scientists of rocky mountain laboratories are collaborating with oxford university to develop a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored covid-19 vaccine candidate35 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi recently announced the initiation of three programs aimed to develop covid-19 vaccines by utilizing established vaccine platforms36 among the three programs two are continuations of previously initiated partnerships cepi collaborated with inovio in 2018 to developing dna vaccine candidates for mers 56 m funding the vaccine in development utilizes dna medicines platform for delivering synthetic genes into cells for translation into antigenic proteins which elicit t-cell and antibody responses cepi has collaborated with the university of queensland in 2019 to develop the molecular clamp vaccine platform against multiple viral pathogens including mers-cov 10 m funding the vaccine platform functions by synthesizing viral surface proteins that get attached to the host cells and clamp them into shape this facilitates easier recognition of antigens by the immune system36 other than these ongoing programs cepi has announced funding to moderna for comparing mrna therapeutics and vaccines they will design and manufacture an mrna vaccine in collaboration with the vaccine research center vrc of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid a part of the national institutes of health nih37 niaid-vrc scientists are developing a vaccine candidate expressing sars-cov-2 s protein in the mrna vaccine platform technology this vaccine is expected to undergo clinical testing in the coming months35 direct administration of monoclonal antibodies mabs may play an effective role in cov control as an intervention in exposed individuals it has been observed that patients recovering from sars display potent neutralizing antibody responses9 a clinical trial proposed the use of a set of mabs that functionally target specific domains in mers-cov s protein these mabs bind to six specific epitope groups interacting with the receptor binding membrane fusion and sialic acid-binding sites which represent the three important entry functions of mers-cov s protein2138 moreover passive immunization with poorly and potently neutralizing antibodies induces substantial protection in mice subjected to lethal mers-cov challenge thus use of these antibodies may represent a novel approach to increase humoral protection against emerging covs by targeting various s protein epitopes and functions the cross-neutralization capacity of sars-cov rbd-specific neutralizing mabs greatly depends on the similarity between their rbds this is why sars-cov rbd-specific antibodies can cross-neutralize sars-like sl covs ie bat-sl-cov strain wiv1 rbd that had 8 amino acid differences to sars-cov but not bat-sl-cov strain shc014 24 amino acid differences39 such cross-neutralizing sars-cov rbd-specific mabs can be evaluated for efficacy with sars-cov-2 this requires a comparative analysis of sars-cov-2 rbd with sars-cov so that suitable rbd-specific mabs can be identified and evaluated in clinical trials regeneron is trying to identify mabs specific and effective for covid-19 combination therapy with mabs and the drug remdesivir could be an ideal therapeutic option for covid-1940 further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy technology is available for making fully human antibodies such as human single-chain antibodies hu-scfvs or humanized-nanobodies single-domain antibodies sdab vhvhh that can traverse across the membrane of the virus-infected cells trans bodies and bind to or interfere with biological activities of replicating virus proteins which consequently leads to inhibition of virus replication examples include trans bodies to influenza virus hepatitis c virus ebola virus and dengue virus41 thus it is possible to generate trans bodies to cov intracellular proteins such as the papain-like proteases plpro cysteine-like protease 3clpro or other non-structural proteins nsps that are pivotal for cov replication and transcription for safe non-immunogenic broadly effective passive immunization of cov-exposed subjects and treatment of infected patients suitable animal models for evaluating vaccines for sars- and mers-cov are lacking or highly limited making the process of vaccine development highly challenging4243 development of an efficient animal model that mimics the clinical disease can inform on pathogenesis as well as to develop vaccines and therapeutics against these covs several animal models have been evaluated for sars- and mers covs including mouse guinea pigs hamsters ferrets rabbits rhesus macaques marmosets and cats4244-50 early effort was directed in developing animal models for sars-cov but the specificity of the virus to ace2 receptor of sars-cov was a major hindrance to such efforts later a sars-cov transgenic mouse model was developed by introducing hace2 gene into the mouse genome51 the first animal model used for developing a mers-cov vaccine was rhesus macaques infected animals showed clinical symptoms such as increased body temperature piloerection cough hunched posture and reduced food intake52 another frequently used animal model for mers-cov is the common marmoset wherein the virus caused lethal pneumonia53 humoral and cell-mediated immunity could be detected in both rhesus macaques and common marmoset following mers-cov immunization435253 roberts et al established golden syrian hamsters strain lvg as a model to assess vaccine protection to different sars-cov strains47 these hamsters are a potential model for studying cov pathology and pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy the attenuated nsp16 cov vaccine was studied in mice54 attempts to develop animal models for mers-cov such as mice hamsters and ferrets face limitations due to the inability of mers-cov to replicate in the respiratory tracts of these species small animals mice or hamsters resisting natural infection with mers-covs which are susceptible to sars-cov have been genetically modified to a more humanized structure eg hdpp4 human hdpp4-transduced and hdpp4-tg mice transgenic for expressing hdpp4 and ascertained for susceptibility to mers-cov infection55 alteration in the mouse genome using the crispr-cas9 gene-editing tool could make the animals susceptible to cov infection and virus replication56 genetic engineering was used in the generation of 288330 mers-cov mouse model which is being used for the evaluation of novel mers-cov vaccines and drugs57 compared to the large animal models small animals such as mice and rabbits are preferred due to lower cost ease of manipulation and readily available efficacy methods43 further studies are needed to recognize suitable models for emerging sars-cov-2 by identifying receptor affinity of sars-cov-2 and studying disease manifestations pathologiesviral pathogenesis associated with experimental inoculation of the virus in mice rats and other models as well as examining virus-specific immune responses and protection this would facilitate preclinical evaluations of candidate covid-19 vaccines and drugs several permissive cell lines to hcovs including monkey epithelial cell lines llc-mk2 and vero-b4 have been used in neutralization assays for assessing neutralization titers of antibody preparations goat lung cells alpaca kidney cells and dromedary umbilical cord cells have been found to be permissive for mers-cov58 sars-cov s protein has been found to mediate entry into hepatoma cell lines targeted by neutralizing antibodies in virus-infected patients59 advanced exvivo 3d tracheobronchial tissue mimicking epithelium of conductive airway has been used for human covs60 moreover vlps displaying sars-cov s protein were found competent for entry to permissive cells or transfected cells that overexpress virus receptors596162 sars-cov-2 isolation has been attempted in vero and the huh-7 cells human liver cancer cells63 pseudotyped virionsvlps encoding reporter systems such as gfp or luciferase can be used for quantification and evaluation of the effectiveness of mabs and drugs in inhibiting the cellular entry of covs64 assays using pseudotyped virionsvlps can be performed in bsl-2 facility since these do not use infectious virus a safety concern for passive immunization with antibodies is a possible antibody-dependent enhancement ade of virus replication antibodies with modified fc fragments or without fc fragment eg human single-chain antibodies scfv fab or fab2 are safe alternatives several mabs fully human or humanized that target both the s1-rbd and non-rbd as well as s2 domain of covs have been generated and tested in cell cultures for virus-neutralizing capability as well as in animal models for prophylactic and post-exposure efficacies65 these antibodies could be useful tools also in the development of vaccines therapeutic drugs and antiviral inhibitors data from animal cov vaccination suggest that systemic humoral or cell-mediated immune responses induced by parenteral administration may not be adequate to prevent respiratory tract infection66 because respiratory mucosa is the initial site in cov infection and transmission mucosal immunization such as using intranasal vaccine67 could be an effective strategy for prophylaxis by induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses the molecular mechanisms of mucosal and systemic immunological factors are different such that it is difficult to predict the surrogate marker for cov efficacy the best surrogate assays for protection as well as herd immunity toward different cov infections warrant detailed investigations the main measure in clinical management is focused on alleviating clinical symptoms and supportive care68-70 therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for covid-19 include molecules binding to the virus molecules or inhibitors that target specific enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription small-molecule inhibitors targeting helicase essential proteases or other proteins of the virus host cell protease inhibitors host cell endocytosis inhibitors sirna anti-sense rna and ribozyme neutralizing antibodies mabs targeting host receptor or interfere with s1 rbd antiviral peptide targeting s2 and natural products211 there is a long list of anti-cov agents mostly preclinical compounds yet to be evaluated as anti-covid-19 agents some of these agents are in phase iii trials for covid-19 including remdesivir oseltamivir asc09f hiv protease inhibitor lopinavir ritonavir darunavir and cobicistat71 many existing mers- andor sars-covs inhibitors can be screened for efficacy the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp sequence of sars-cov-2 has shown 96 identity to that of sars-cov a critical finding since drugs developed for sars-cov rdrp might show similar efficacy for sars-cov-2 rdrp28 s protein is considered the major target for designing cov antiviral therapies such as s protein inhibitors s cleavage inhibitors neutralizing antibodies rbdace2 blockers sirnas fusion core blockers and protease inhibitors19 all such therapeutic strategies have shown potential in vitro andor in vivo anti-cov activities comparatively even though in vitro studies performed with these agents have shown efficacy most of them lack sufficient support due to the lack of randomized animal or human trials hence of limited use for covid-19 hence the necessary support of extensive animal and human trials is required for such therapeutics to become useful the binding of covid-19 and ace2 affects the balance of reninangiotensin system ras potentially leading to exacerbation of severe pneumonia thus it is speculated that acei and angiotensin type-1 receptor at1r inhibitors might be able to reduce pulmonary inflammatory responses thereby reducing the mortality72 the guidance to covid-19 control might be based on existing measures for mers and sars with some further precautions due to the unknown nature of this new cov1473 the main treatments such as mechanical ventilation icu admission and symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe cases furthermore rna synthesis inhibitors like 3tc tdf remdesivir neuraminidase inhibitors peptide ek1 anti-inflammatory drugs abidol chinese traditional medicine such as lianhuaqingwen and shufengjiedu capsules could be the promising covid-19 treatments2 however further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for covid-19 a major limiting factor in the quest for identifying an ideal vaccine or therapeutic agent is time it may take months to even several years for researchers to develop produce standardize evaluate approve and commercialize therapeutic agents for covid-19 hence current efforts should be directed toward identifying and evaluating drugs and immunotherapeutics that have proven efficacy against viruses similar to covid-19 the time required for drug discovery programs to develop evaluate and obtain approval for a new potent anti-covid-19 agent could take more than 10 years4 in the present scenario the development of a new therapeutic agent for covid-19 is not a feasible option with regard to available time another option is to repurpose broadly acting antiviral drugs used for other viral infections such drugs have the advantage of easy availability known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties solubility stability side effects and also well-established dosing regimens4 repurposed drugs are potential therapeutic options managing cov infections repurposed drugs such as lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1 possess in vitro anti-mers-cov activity the in vivo study conducted in common marmosets non-human primate model showed that animals treated with lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1 had better outcomes than untreated animals74 the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-1 is being evaluated for mers in the miracle trial75 the same two protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir when combined with ribavirin were found to be associated with favorable clinical responses in sars patients indicating therapeutic efficacy10 as an early attempt to evaluate these repurposed drugs in covid-19 a controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and interferon- 2b therapy has been registered for hospitalized patients in china chictr200002930876 oral administration of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir has been used as an empirical drug for covid-19 suspected cases in china hospitals even though there is no evidence of its efficacy2 recently the in vitro antiviral efficacy of approved drugs such as ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat and chloroquine was compared with that of the two broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir and favipiravir for covid-19 among the evaluated drugs both remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling covid-19 in vitro63 the study also pointed out that the three nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin penciclovir and favipiravir may not have significant in vivo antiviral effects against covid-19 since higher concentrations were required to reduce the viral infection in vitro both remdesivir and chloroquine are being used for the treatment of other diseases and have a well-defined safety profile hence such drugs can be used for evaluating their efficacy in patients of novel cov infections achievements in the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents for sars- and mers-cov as well as recent ongoing progress for covid-19 will facilitate the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against this emerging virus however the present scenario of covid-19 warrants the need for implementing robust preventive and control measures due to the potential for nosocomial infections77 we need to rely exclusively on preventive measures since considerable time is required before efforts to develop a new vaccine or antiviral agent becomes fruitful researchers are searching for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and therapeutics for controlling the deadly covid-19 there are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for covid-19 hence we have to rely exclusively on enforcing strict preventive and control measures that minimize the risk of possible disease transmission results obtained from the recently conducted in vitro study against covid-19 are promising since the drugs remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling the infection direct clinical trials can be conducted among the patients infected with covid-19 since these drugs are being used for treating other diseases and have well-established safety profiles making the further evaluation of these drugs much easier s protein is considered a key viral antigen for developing cov vaccines as shown in several preclinical studies although research is in progress to improve prevention treatment and control of covid-19 the documented clinical data on different therapeutic approaches for covs are scarce further research should be directed toward the study of sars-cov-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication transmission and pathogenesis  title development of a coronavirus disease 2019 nonhuman primate model using airborne exposure

with sars-cov-2 aside from african green monkeys nonhuman primate models that replicate airborne transmission of sars-cov-2 have not been investigated a comprehensive and comparative evaluation of covid-19 in african green monkeys rhesus macaques and cynomolgus macaques following airborne exposure to sars-cov-2 was performed to define 5 parameters critical to disease progression and the extent to which they correlate with human covid-19 respiratory abnormalities and viral shedding were noted for all animals indicating successful infection cynomolgus macaques developed fever and thrombocytopenia was measured for african green monkeys and rhesus macaques type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia and alveolar fibrosis were more frequently observed in lung tissue from cynomolgus macaques and 10 african green monkeys the data indicate that in addition to african green monkeys macaques can be successfully infected by airborne sars-cov-2 providing viable macaque natural transmission models for medical countermeasure evaluation one sentence summary nonhuman primates develop covid-19 following airborne virus exposure 15 main text severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is responsible for an ongoing worldwide pandemic of mild to severe respiratory disease identified as coronavirus disease 2019  clinical signs for symptomatic patients have ranged from a mild disease characterized by fever cough andor increased respiratory rate to severe and sometimes fatal disease characterized by severe pneumonia respiratory failure sepsisseptic shock and 20 heart failure 1-4 early reports on transmission of sars-cov-2 suggested that human spread occurred primarily through respiratory droplets particles created by coughing and sneezing and direct 3 contact 2 5 6 7 8 9  however recent evidence indicates that airborne transmission may actually represent the most prevalent human infection route 10  this route relies on virus-laden particles that are less than 5m in size which can travel extended distances in the air to test and evaluate novel medical countermeasures against sars-cov-2 animal models that mimic a natural route of infection and recapitulate human disease are required to date countermeasure testing in 5 nonhuman primates has predominantly utilized combination models wherein high doses of virus in excess of 10 6 tcid50 are inoculated intratracheal itintranasal in or itinocularoral 11 12 13  although animals in these experiments develop some mild clinical signs of respiratory disease the routes of exposure are largely artificial in that they rely on direct contact inoculation rather than natural transmission herein we sought to assess nonhuman primate airborne 10 challenge models of sars-cov-2 airborne virus was generated using a collison nebulizer to produce a highly respirable target aerosol of 1 to 3m mass median aerodynamic diameter healthy sars-cov-2 serologically-nave african green monkeys agm n3 rhesus macaques rm n4 and cynomolgus macaques cm n4 were exposed to sars-cov-2 on study day 1 by the aerosol route the mean virus inhaled dose was 38410 4 sign was the development of fever defined as a reading that was 15c above baseline for a duration of greater than 2 hours by telemetry which was consistently noted for all cm between study days 2-3  figure 1  the maximum temperature change for cm was between 22-30c mean  25c although small transient temperature increases were noted for some agm and rm none met study-defined criteria 15c above baseline for a duration of greater than 2 hours to be called fever therefore fever was a finding exclusive to cm infected with airborne sars-cov-2 5 other common clinical findings for animals on study included increased respiratory sounds on auscultation and radiographic findings of increased lung opacity with or without the presence of infiltrates  figure 2  lung opacity was noted for all animals on study however lung infiltrates were more commonly noted for agm and cm generally radiographic findings were noted prior to audible lung sounds with radiographic findings commonly identified between 10 study days 3-11 and increased respiratory sounds noted between study days 5-9 disease severity based on clinical signs was graded using a scoring system that can be found in table s1 note this table was based on a table utilized by finch et al 14 and information contained within 15 with certain updates based on the covid-19 disease observed 20 in the primate species being evaluated in the present study average disease severity scores were as follows  figure s1  agm was 1100 range 8-16 rm was 975 range 8 9 10 11  and cm was 1400 range 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  the highest severity score on study was 19 cm 2 and the lowest severity score on study was 8 agm 3 and rm 4 complete blood counts and clinical chemistries  figure 3 and table s2  were performed on whole blood and serum respectively peak change from baseline defined as data from study day 1 is represented and table s2 depicts the parameters for which changes from baseline were 5 greater than or equal to 25 lymphocyte and neutrophil fluctuations were noted for most animals on study and were likely a result of the inflammatory response to infection agm and rm exhibited a decrease in platelet counts beginning on study days 3-5 that persisted through study days 15-18 nadirs were reached earlier in agm study day 5 and were more pronounced 40 compared to rm decreases may relate to lung injury and 10 subsequent sequestration evidence of inflammation and chronic lesions noted histologically further support this assessment increases in one or more liver-related enzyme activities were present for most animals with the most notable and consistent changes occurring for agms and cms for cms elevated levels appeared to correlate with the timing of the fever response with levels approximating 15 baseline by study day 7 a more protracted response was noted for agms with elevated levels noted between study days 5-11 unfortunately necropsy occurred 7-11 days after enzyme activities had returned to baseline so any corresponding histologic changes in the liver that might have suggested a cause for the elevations were no longer present increases in glucose concentration were noted in agm over study days 3-7 13 fold 20 and 15-18 16 fold a similar trend was noted for cms but the degree and consistency of the change was less pronounced these findings may relate to a corticosteroid or epinephrine response changes in glucose levels were not noted for rms 6 significant increases in monocytes measured on study day 5 were present only for agm a 57 fold and 44 fold increase from baseline was noted for agm 2 and agm 3 respectively although the physiological relevance of this finding is unclear at this time monocytosis was a consistent and exclusive finding for agm no other notable changes in clinical chemistry parameters were measured on this study 5 quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr was performed on oropharyngeal op nasopharyngeal np and rectal swabs to assess viral shedding  figure   4  and on whole blood to assess circulating viral load data not shown viral rna in most whole blood samples was not detected when detected it was on study day 11 was typically below the limit of quantification and was most often noted for agm viral rna in rectal 10 swabs when noted was measured on or after study day 7 this finding was most often noted for agm viral rna was detected for most animals by study

levels between swab types and groups were not observed with one exception cm for this group peak 15 levels in op swabs were 1-2 logs lower compared to op swab peak levels for other groups for the majority of the animals viral rna was no longer detected by study day 11 viral rna present for a few agm on study day 18 likely represented residual rna in the nasal cavity and not actively replicating virus viability of virus in op and np swabs was confirmed by plaque assay figure 4  viable 20 virus was not detected in any rectal swabs data not shown virus was detected for most animals by study day 3 in both swab types with peak levels typically detected on study day 3 peak levels in np swabs were between 216-483 log10 pfuml and peak levels in op swabs were between 271-445 log10

lungs the most common finding was discoloration of one or more lung lobes for agm and cm in two agm agms 1 and 2  diffuse red mottling of all lobes was noted and in cm 3 locally extensive red discoloration of all lobes was observed cm 2 also had multifocal red to gray discoloration of the right caudal lung lobe two animals had adhesions within the lungs andor thorax cavity agm 2 had thin clear adhesions that extended from the representative images for histology are shown in figure 5  with the exception of cm 1 all animals had some degree of inflammation and chronic lesions alveolar fibrosis type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia in one or more lung lobes the alveolar fibrosis and type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia indicate previous cellular damage either due to the viral infection 20 andor resulting inflammation and these findings were more frequently noted for agm and cm multinucleate cells likely attributed to viral infection were only noted for agms 2 and 3 multinucleate cells possibly related to viral infection were also found in the axillary lymph node 8 for agm 3 and the inguinal lymph node for cm 3 other histologic findings included the following inflammation in the nasal septumturbinates for agm 2 rm 1 and cms 2 and 3 lymphoid hyperplasia in lymph nodes mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue andor gut-associated lymphoid tissue nearly all animals representative images for ifa are shown in figure 5  consistently in comparison to 5 historical uninfected cynomolgus macaque lung tissues infiltration of inflammatory cells including cd68  macrophages ki67  proliferating cells cd45  leukocytes and cd3  t cells were multi-focally detected in alveolar septum of cm 2 due to the ongoing pandemic of covid-19 it is critical that relevant animal models that 10 recapitulate human disease characteristics are developed to facilitate immediate vaccine and treatment testing nonhuman primate models will be key to this testing as data generated will be combined with human clinical data to support rapid deployment of safe and efficacious countermeasures for human use herein we describe the evaluation of the first airborne sars-cov-2 model in macaques and compare the results to the previously-described airborne model 15 in agms 16 17  the development of macaque models is critical to advance countermeasure testing efforts although prior studies have highlighted the potential utility of agms for sars-cov-2 testing certain characteristics might make these nonhuman primates less than ideal candidates agms are generally wild-caught and imported for use on study the medical history for these animals is typically only available from the time of import in addition age can only be 20 approximated as actual birth dates for agms are generally unavailable finally wild-caught primates represent a diverse genetic population resulting in inconsistent cohorts which may include animals predisposed to developing more severe disease following viral infection for this reason agms are not typically chosen as gold-standard models of viral disease in contrast cms and rms have represented critical models for countermeasure development for various pathogens over many years this is because this population of animals is more uniform as they can be acquired from breeding colonies health and age information is generally available from the time of birth decreasing the likelihood of outliers based on genetic or medical background it 5 is for this reason that we sought to investigate airborne exposure with sars-cov-2 in macaque models the airborne model mimics a predicted natural transmission route 10 18 19 20 21  compared to other nonhuman primate models of covid-19 which rely on direct contact inoculation of mucosal and respiratory surfaces exposure of agm rm and cm to sars-cov-2 resulted in 10 disease similar to mild cases of human covid-19 increased lung sounds on auscultation in association with radiographic findings consistently confirmed the presence of mild to moderate respiratory disease for all animals on study and febrile illness was achieved for all cm cm developed a consistent disease with fever being a hallmark of disease exclusive to this group lung infiltrates visualized radiographically were also common for animals in this 15 group the clinical disease severity score for cm was 300 points higher than agm and 425 points higher than rm elevation of more than one liver-related enzyme and serum glucose were also consistently measured for cm overall there were sufficient objective criteria for this group that could be easily employed to evaluate efficacy in future countermeasure efforts cms have been investigated as a potential model for sars-cov-2 with variable disease 20 findings noted following either itin or itinocular inoculation 11 22  importantly fever which represents a prominent human disease sign and which was consistently noted for cm on the present study was not noted for any cms on these prior studies in addition many of the other clinical signs of disease observed in the present study for cm were not reported for the prior studies aside from infiltrates noted radiographically in only one of those studies therefore using an airborne transmission route we were able to generate a model of covid-19 in cm that was more representative of human disease compared to prior work utilizing this species the agm aerosol model of sars-cov-2 infection has been recently defined 16 17 5 23  in general findings in the present study were similar to those previously described there were two key hematologic findings that make this an attractive model thrombocytopenia and monocytosis thrombocytopenia has been noted during human disease 24 following itin inoculation 23 and following aerosol exposure of agm 17  and this finding was consistently noted for agm on this study similarly pronounced elevation of monocytes which far exceeded 10 levels for the other species was consistently noted for agm this finding has not been previously reported the physiological relevance is unknown at this time and warrants further investigation blair et al have been the only group thus far to describe acute respiratory distress syndrome in nonhuman primates following sars-cov-2 inoculation and this was observed in rm have been the most extensively used sars-cov-2 model species with the itin or itinocularoral rm models being the gold standards for use in countermeasure efficacy studies 11 12 13  clinical disease following airborne virus exposure was similar to that reported following itin or itinocularoral inoculation rm developed a mild respiratory disease characterized by increased respiratory noise on auscultation and changes in lung opacity radiographically similar 5 to agms thrombocytopenia was noted for animals in this group erythema around the eyes was a consistent and nearly exclusive finding for animals in this group however this is a relatively subjective measurement and may have been the result of ocular exposure during challenge the eyes were not covered during airborne challenge rectal bleeding was another reliable finding for rm however this finding was most likely related to repeated swabbing resulting in 10 irritation of the rectal tissue and not a sars-cov-2-specific finding nearly all animals on the present study had some degree of inflammation and chronic lesions in one or more lung lobes at time of necropsy and these findings were consistent with those previously reported for direct contact inoculation models 11-13 22 23  alveolar fibrosis and type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia indicative of previous cellular damage were more frequently 15 noted for agm and cm by study day 18 most clinical disease signs including radiographic findings had either completely resolved or were resolving and virus in lung tissue was below the limit of detection by ish therefore it may be important to investigate whether necropsy performed earlier in disease course could be beneficial to assessing the active disease state of primates infected by sars-cov-2 for countermeasure testing where delayed disease is a 20 possibility the decision to shorten the length of study would obviously also need to be balanced against the risk of missing delayed-onset disease elevation of serum glucose levels for agm and cm was noted on this study but to date this specific finding has not been described for human cases of covid-19 it has been suggested that patients with uncontrolled diabetes are at higher risk for developing life-threatening complications following sars-cov-2 infection however there have not been any published studies comparing covid-19 disease between diabetics and non-diabetics and information is 5 limited as to what role other comorbidities high blood pressure obesity heart disease may play in this observation in short there is no information currently available directly linking increased morbidity and mortality from covid-19 to hyperglycemia however it could be predicted virus-induced elevations in glucose levels could be catastrophic for a patient already predisposed to hyperglycemia as this physiological change could lead to diabetic ketoacidosis which alone is 10 life threatening but in combination with other comorbidities could certainly be fatal considering the elevated glucose finding for agm and cm infected with sars-cov-2 the role of hyperglycemia in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis should be further investigated data and materials availability all data is available in the main text or the supplementary materials a material transfer agreement would be required for the transfer of any specimens generated as part of this study materials and

hospital patients 507 patients with cold or flu symptoms sore throat or recent cough 21 control subjects without symptoms of upper respiratory infection measurements and main results after thorough history and physical examination the patients underwent nasopharyngeal aspiration and throat culture nasopharyngeal specimens were cultured for both bacteria and viruses antigens for influenza parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus were sought by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa serum antibodies to viral respiratory pathogens were determined group a beta-hemolytic streptococci grew from the throat specimens of 39 of the 507 patients 8 or 38 of 334 patients 11 who had clinical diagnoses of pharyngitis thirty-three cases of influenza a 20 cases of influenza b and seven cases of parainfluenza infections were diagnosed bacteria were cultured from the nasopharyngeal secretions of 284 patients 56 in contrast to pharyngeal culture commensal mixed flora were rarely found in nasopharyngeal culture nasopharyngeal culture of bacteria usually considered to be respiratory pathogens was significantly associated with the presence of leukocytes streptococcuspneumoniae odds ratio 60 95 confidence interval 26-142 moraxella catarrhalts odds ratio 129 95 confidence interval 31-795 and hemophtlus tnfluenzae odds ratio 30 95 confidence interval 12-74 were all associated with the presence of leukocytes in contrast nasopharyngeal culture of coagulase-negative staphylococci mixed flora and the documentation of a viral infection were not associated with the presence of leukocytes for none of 21 control subjects were pathogenic bacteria found conclusions these data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria may have a causal role in adult nasopharyngitis although further data are needed to confirm this hypothesis  tory infection such as acute bronchitis pneumonia sinusitis and otitis media are recognized to have a bacterial origin and warrant treatment with antibiotics nonetheless many practicing physicians prescribe antibiotics for uncomplicated upper respiratory infections 7 8 9 in adults investigations of the etiology of upper respiratory infection have not included bacterial culture of nasopharyngeal secretions instead researchers have focused on throat culture for group a streptococci viruses and mycoplasma and on nasopharyngeal sampling for viral detection and culture 3 5 10 in children however investigations of the etiology of upper respiratory infections have frequently included bacterial culture of nasopharyngeal secretions and bacterial nasopharyngitis is considered to be both a distinct entityt 1 12 and a contributing factor to complications such as otitis media and pneumonia 3 14 in a prospective case series of adult patients with upper respiratory infection we were surprised to find an increased number of leukocytes in nasopharyngeal secretions associated with the presence of bacteria considered to be pathogens only in the lower respiratory tract this suggests that bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract may occur in adults from march 1 1988  to february 28 1990  patients who presented to the walk-in medical clinic of the university hospital of geneva switzerland with complaints of cold or flu symptoms sore throat or recent cough were eligible for the study patients were excluded from the study if they

questionnaire history of exposure to schoolage and preschool children other sick people at home or at work cigarette use and relevant past medical problems was obtained the presence and duration of 667 symptoms such as fever headache rhinitis sore throat cough hoarseness myalgias arthralgias and photophobia were noted general physical status temperature pulse and results of physical examination of the oropharynx tympanic membranes sinuses and lungs were recorded repeat physical examination was performed at a follow-up visit two weeks later and total duration of symptoms and use of medications were noted aspiration of the nasopharynx was performed at the initial clinical visit by inserting a 5-mm soft plastic catheter from a lukens specimen container argyle sherwood medical tullamore ireland into the posterior nasopharynx and using simple wall suction to aspirate the secretions the secretions were then rinsed from the plastic catheter using 6 ml of sterile saline and processed within one hour in the laboratory the secretions and rinse solution were vortexed for one minute and were processed as outlined below a throat culture was also obtained by rubbing a culturette ii swab stick marion scientific kansas city mo firmly against the tonsilar fossa this was sent to the microbiology laboratory for analysis within six hours two hundred to four hundred microliters of the nasopharyngeal secretions were cytocentrifuged and stained with gram and giemsa stains all smears were analyzed by the same technician the nasopharyngeal secretions and the throat specimens were cultured on sheep blood agar chocolate agar colistin-nalidixic acid agar and thayer-martin agar for 48 hours for aerobic organisms anaerobic organisms were cultured on centers for

leukocytes but in the secretions of only seven of 218 patients 3 with fewer than ten leukocytes p 0001 results of nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal cultures are summarized in table 1  the most frequently cultured organisms from the nasopharynx were coagulase-negative staphylococci corynebacterium species streptococcus pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus hemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis only 9 of the patients grew mixed flora a mixture of light growth of corynebacteria streptococci neisseria species and anaerobes forty-four percent of the cultures were sterile in contrast the most frequently cultured organisms from the pharynx were hemophilus parainfluenzae group a streptococci h influenzae s pneumoniae enterobacteriaceae and s aureus only three cultures were sterile and 99 grew mixed flora growth of group a fl-hemolytic streptococci from the pharynx was considered to indicate streptococcal pharyngitis occurring in 38 of 334 11 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pharyngitis and in one of 173 06 patients without a clinical diagnosis of pharyngitis nine of the patients with pharyngitis and a positive pharyngeal culture also grew group a streptococci from the nasopharynx one patient with pharyngitis grew group a streptococci from the nasopharynx but not the pharynx the results of virologic studies of the 312 patients who had two serum specimens drawn are summarized in table 2  the most frequent pathogens documented  no infection with c pneumoniae was demonstrated by a fourfold rise in igg titer detected by complement fixation for the 312 patients with two serum specimens available in addition no infection was demonstrated by microimmunofluorescence to igg or igm antibodies for 55 patients tested at random the association of culture of bacteria from the nasopharynx streptococcal pharyngitis and viral infection influenza a influenza b parainfluenza with ten or more leukocytes per high-powered field in nasopharyngeal secretions is summarized in table 3  analysis was performed for 416 patients 54 patients for whom leukocytes were not counted and 37 patients who had already been treated with antibiotics were not included streptococcal pharyngitis and influenza a and b and parainfluenza infection were not associated with increased leukocytes in the nasopharyngeal secretions however s pneumoniae m catarrhahs h influenzae group a streptococci and  aureus were associated with ten or more leukocytes per high-powered field in nasopharyngeal secretions the number of colony-forming units of the organism isolated was independent of the number of leukocytes in nasopharyngeal secretions data not shown the difference in the numbers of leukocytes associated with bacterial and viral infections is more clearly illustrated in figure 1  an increased number of leukocytes was found in 73 of the patients with only bacteria cultured from the nasopharynx and in 62 of the patients with both bacteria cultured and virus detected from the nasopharynx in contrast only 37 of the patients with a viral infection and sterile nasopharyngeal secretions had ten or more leukocytes in nasopharyngeal secretions this is not statistically different from the results for patients with sterile nasopharyngeal secretion and no viral infection to examine the association of clinical parameters with ten or more leukocytes per high-powered field in the nasopharyngeal secretions we performed univarlate and multivariate analysis of all the clinical information obtained for the 416 patients who had not already received antibiotic treatment and for whom leukocytes were counted results are summarized in table 4  history of runny nose p  0002 and rhinitis on physical examination p  002 occurred significantly more frequently in patients with an increased number of leukocytes in the nasopharyngeal secretions there was no association with several clinical parameters that might alter the nasopharyngeal flora and therefore increase the number of leukocytes in nasopharyngeal secretions these include age history of tobacco abuse duration of illness prior to seeking medical attention history of sinusitis asthma or chronic bronchitis and clinical diagnosis of sinusitis or otitis media multivariate analysis did not change the interpretation of the data not shown of the nasopharyngeal aspirates of the 21 control subjects ten were sterile s aureus was cultured in two corynebacterium in seven and coagulase-negative staphylococci in five an increased number of leukocytes was seen in two 9 on direct examination in our study more than half of the patients with upper respiratory infections had an increased number of leukocytes in the nasopharyngeal secretions associated with the culture of s pneumoniae group a streptococci s aureus h influenzae and m catarrhalls from the nasopharynx an increased number of leukocytes was not associated with diagnosis of viral infection or with the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis these results raise the possibility of bacterial infection or superinfection of the nasopharynx bacterial nasopharyngitis univariate analysis of clinical signs and symptoms revealed that only rhinitis was associated with an increased number of leukocytes in the nasopharyngeal secretions on the other hand we did not detect any clinical parameter that might alter the nasopharyngeal flora andor the inflammatory reaction during upper respiratory infection in particular there was no association with a history or current diagnosis of sinusitis otitis media tobacco abuse or chronic respiratory infection methodologically there are a few factors that may have confounded the correlation of increased leukocytes with the culture of pathogens first the nasopharynx may not have been accurately sampled in all cases however 90 of specimens contained some sort of cellular material furthermore the presence of epithe- lial cells was inversely correlated with the recovery of leukocytes suggesting that the absence of leukocytes and bacteria was not due to a sampling error the presence of ciliated cells was strongly correlated with the presence of leukocytes it is possible that inflammation reflected as an increased number of leukocytes leads to sloughing of ciliated cells other problems with specimen collection and handling include difficulty in homogenizing nasopharyngeal secretions the specimens analyzed microscopically and cultured for bacteria and viruses may not have been comparable however if homogenization had been more uniform the association between bacteria and leukocytes would have become even stronger another difficulty is that differing amounts of nasopharyngeal secretions were aspirated and diluted with the same amount of saline resulting in variable concentrations of microorganisms and leukocytes in addition relatively few viral infections were diagnosed in our study almost all cases were diagnosed by serologic means precluding diagnosis in the 38 of patients who did not have a second serologic examination very few infections were diagnosed by antigen detection or by viral culture no rhinovirus or coronavirus infection was cultured at all however the rate of viral diagnosis in patients with two sera examined was 21 comparable to the rate of 25 obtained by huovinen et al in a recent study of patients with pharyngitis 5 in this study as in ours the bulk of the diagnoses were made by serologic means with very few made by antigen detection or culture the overall rate of viral diagnosis was well below the rate of 23 obtained by eggenberger 18 in a recent study of upper respiratory infections in children using only antigen detection at the same viral laboratory after a similar transport time antigen detection may be less successful in adults than in children for a couple of reasons the immune response of adults may be more swift and effective than that of children neutralizing the viral antigen and making diagnosis by this method more difficult furthermore adults may wait longer to seek medical attention than children do rendering the detection of viral antigen in nasopharyngeal secretions less likely most viral upper respiratory infections are felt to be caused by rhinovirus 1 2 because rhinovirus was not successfully cultured we cannot eliminate the possibility that this virus is associated with an increased number of leukocytes however this seems unlikely since none of the other viral infections was associated with a significant number of leukocytes chlamydia pneumoniae has recently gained recognition as a cause of respiratory tract infection especially of the lungs 9 2o in our study no infection with c pneumoniae was demonstrated this may be because patients with pneumonia were excluded in children purulent bacterial nasopharyngitis is recognized and has been studied extensively 1113 it is felt to be caused by 8-hemolytic streptococci h infuenzae and pneumococci and should be managed with antibiotics 12 hypothesizing the existence of bacterial nasopharyngitis in adults the most likely bacteria would be those that are not part of the normal nasopharyngeal flora and those that are known to cause infection in the lower respiratory tract jousimies-somer et al compared the nasal swab cultures of 183 healthy military recruits with those of 18 5 military recruits who had acute maxillary sinusitis 21 the culture of s pneumoniae increased from 1 to 25 and that of h influenzae increased from 4 to 61 between the healthy military recruits and the recruits with sinusitis in contrast the culture of corynebacteria decreased from 43 to 19 and the culture ofs aureusdecreased from 36 to 18 the cultures of coagulase-negative staphylococci and m catarrhalis remained about the same in both groups studied in our study potentially pathogenic bacteria were not cultured for any of the control subjects on the other hand it is possible that the presence of pathogenic bacteria and increased leukocytes in the nasopharnx may be secondary to colonization of already inflamed nasal mucosa rather than the pathogenic bacteria causing inflammation and an increased number of leukocytes in the nasopharynx it is also possible that certain bacteria such as s aureus may have been introduced into the nasopharyngeal aspirate as the sampling catheter passed through the anterior nares our data suggest that s pneumoniae m catarrhalls and h influenzae may be a cause of bacterial infection in the nasopharynx whereas s aureus is only weakly associated with the presence of leukocytes group a streptococci have been shown to be pathogenic in the nasopharynx of young children tl but have so far not been cultured in adults more investigation is required to determine whether the presence of bacteria and leukocytes in the nasopharynx in adults really means bacterial nasopharyngitis if it exists recognition and treatment would be important bacteria in the nasopharynx may lead to descending infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia antibiotic treatment could shorten the duration of upper respiratory infections caused or exacerbated by bacteria and possibly prevent more serious lower respiratory tract infections although many physicians already treat adults who have uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections with antibiotics only a controlled prospective study using placebo and antibiotics could resolve the issue  title simulation of the clinical and pathological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in golden syrian hamster model implications for disease

resembles covid-19 with low mortality is lacking methods molecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 of common laboratory mammals and the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of sars-cov-2 suggested that the golden syrian hamster is an option virus challenge contact transmission and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology viral load and titre chemokinecytokine assay and neutralising antibody titre results the syrian hamster could be consistently infected by sars-cov-2 maximal

conclusions besides satisfying the kochs postulates this readily available hamster model is an important tool for studying transmission pathogenesis treatment and vaccination against sars-cov-2  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is causing a looming pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  1 this newly emerged coronavirus belongs to the genus betacoronavirus which also includes the highly pathogenic sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 2 phylogenetic analysis suggested that all three coronaviruses have likely originated from bats 3 sars-cov-2 was first identified in patients with atypical pneumonia geographically linked to a wet market with wild animal trade in wuhan china the virus is highly transmissible among humans with clusters occurring among close contacts in family church community cruise ship nursing home and hospital settings 2 4 5 6 7 within just three months 100000 cases of covid-19 with 3000 deaths have been reported globally in 100 countriesterritories 8 as readily available and suitable experimental animal models are lacking the major route of transmission is speculated to be through respiratory droplets direct or indirect contact with other infectious bodily fluids such as saliva faeces tears and blood recent data showed that the clinical severity of covid-19 ranges widely from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease in children covid-19 is usually asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic 2 9 the majority of immunocompetent adult covid-19 patients present with fever respiratory symptoms and radiological ground-glass lung opacities 10 in severe cases especially among elderly and immunocompromised patients besides respiratory failure extrapulmonary manifestations such as diarrhoea confusion hepatic and renal dysfunction lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and elevated inflammatory biomarkers have also been reported 10 small animal models that recapitulate the clinical and pathological features of covid-19 in human are essential tools for studying the pathogenesis transmission antiviral treatments and vaccines for this emerging global health threat based on the recent identification 6 of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the cell entry receptor of sars-cov-2 a transgenic human ace2 mouse model was preliminarily reported 11 however the expression of human ace2 in these transgenic mice is not physiological and these mice are not readily available a rhesus macaque model was also reported but expertise and biosafety level-3 facilities to handle non-human primates are scarce 11 in this study we established a readily available small animal model for covid-19 using golden syrian hamster mesocricetus auratus our in silico structural analysis predicted that the hamster ace2 can bind with sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain rbd at high binding affinity the clinical features viral kinetics histopathological changes and immune responses in

complexes of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were then minimized with rosetta 7 relax application 14 ace2-spike interface binding energy was calculated by interfaceanalyzer within rosetta interface binding energies of other species were calculated by introducing mutations to the interface according to the amino acid differences with rosetta protein-protein g protocol amino acid residues of ace2 within

with each cage containing one nave hamster as close contact five virus-challenged and five contact hamsters were sacrificed for viral load and histopathological studies at 4dpi and 4 days

corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication as the binding affinity of ace2 to sars-cov-2 surface spike glycoprotein may be dictated by the amino acid composition at the binding interface structural analysis was performed which predicted 29 amino acid residues at the ace2 interface that may interact with the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein rbdfigure1a1b comparison of the 29 amino acid residues alignment between human and other mammalian species revealed that the rhesus macaque ace2 is 100 identical to human ace2 at the interface region syrian hamster and common marmoset ace2 proteins are also highly similar to human ace2 each with 3-4 mutations at the interface the table   s2  notably sars-cov-2 spike exhibited higher binding affinity with ace2 than did sars-cov spike this might be attributed to the more compact interacting interface with more hydrogen bonds formed between sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein rbd and ace2 figure 1c to investigate the tissue tropism of sars-cov-2 in syrian hamsters we performed viral load studies on the upper respiratory tractnasal turbinate lower respiratory

copy-actin were detected at 2dpi and peaked at 4dpi then progressively reduced to undetectable levels at 7dpi in most samples the nasal turbinate epithelium was intact with submucosal infiltration and blood vessel  to study the transmissibility among close contacts we housed sars-cov  the clinical and histopathological findings from this sars-cov-2 hamster model closely resemble the manifestations of upper and lower respiratory tract infection in humans the airway involvement is evident from nasal turbinate to trachea and pulmonary alveoli associated with changes of inflammation cellular viral n protein expression and high viral load during the first week the disease progressed with increasing respiratory rate decreasing activity and progressive weight loss and was most severe by 6dpi which is similar to the disease course of covid-19 patients 20 histopathology showed progression from the initial phase of exudative inflammation to diffuse alveolar damage with haemorrhage and necrosis and finally the proliferative phase after one week our findings were in agreement with the human autopsy findings except that our model also demonstrated extensive tissue apoptosis 21 none of the challenged or contact hamsters died as 5 of human infections are lethal 10 as for extrapulmonary manifestations though diarrhoea is not clinically evident in challenged hamsters histopathology showed intestinal mucosal inflammation epithelial necrosis and viral n protein expression in enterocytes this finding corroborates with the clinical manifestation of diarrhoea in only 20-101 of covid-19 patients despite that up to 53 of their stool samples are rt-pcr positive 7 22 23 myocardial degenerative changes were noted both in our infected hamster and patient autopsy despite the absence of viral antigen detection in the tissues which is also consistent with the occasional report of heart failure in covid-19 patients 22 lymphoid atrophy and apoptosis in spleen were observed which correlate with the frequent clinical finding of lymphopenia832 10 the lymphoid necrosis is largely related to the marked activation of innate immune response in infected hamsters with high levels of fermenters that eat their own faeces a feeding behaviour called coprophagy to recover nutrients digested in the hind-gut but unabsorbed 29 thus faecal-oral route of transmission could not be excluded in this model as well as in human readily available small animal models that resemble the clinical and pathological features of human covid-19 are urgently needed to study pathogenesis antiviral treatment and vaccination the external subdomain of the spike glycoprotein rbd of sars-cov-2 shares only 40 amino acid identity with sars-cov but this new virus still utilizes ace2 as the cell entry receptor which are abundantly found in epithelial linings of human and animals 3 30 our molecular docking and computation showed that the rbd of sars-cov-2 binds well with not only the ace2 of human and macaques but also with that of syrian hamsters moreover hamster was demonstrated to be a good model for studying respiratory viruses including sars-cov influenza virus and adenovirus 3132 unlike our hamster model for sars-cov-2 it is also notable that weight loss or intestinal involvement were absent in the hamster model infected by the 2003 sars-cov 31 more importantly the viral load in the nasal turbinate7-log10tcid50gram of sars-cov-2-infected hamsters was consistently about 1-log higher than that of their lung55-6-log10tcid50gram at 2dpi 4dpi and 7dpi whereas the viral load in the nasal turbinate of the 2003 sars-cov-infected hamsters were generally similar or lower than 18 that of the lung 31 this might help to explain why sars-cov-2 is more transmissible as the upper respiratory tract involvement by the virus is no less than that of the lower respiratory tract whereas sars-cov predominantly infects the lower respiratory tract our study had a number of limitations first the virus inocula used in this study and the previous report of 2003 sars-cov hamster model were different which might contribute to the differences in findings second we tested the mrna but not protein expression of the hamsters chemokinecytokine profiles as enzyme-immunoassay for hamster chemokinescytokines were unavailable finally we focused our sequencing on the surface spike gene which is essential for virus-host cell entry complete genome sequencing may reveal additional adaptive mutations in other genome regions nevertheless unlike non-human primates and ace2-transgenic mice this hamster model is readily available physiological and highly resembles covid-19 thus it would be an important platform for studying the pathogenesis transmission treatments and vaccines for covid-19

4 months were studied 41 had diarrhea comprising 8 of 16 infants resident at outset and 33 of 149 newly admitted infants two to eight new cases occurred per week 26 cases were considered nosocomial two infants each had two periods of diarrhea and one had three for a total of 45 diarrhea episodes eighty-one room contacts of infants with diarrhea remained asymptomatic and specimens from 74 were available for examination a putative stool pathogen was identified in 31 of 45 case episodes 69 and in 31 of 74 42 asymptomatic room contacts table i  bacterial pathogens were isolated from seven infants four of whom coincidentally carried a virus concurrent infection with two agents occurred in 10 patients and with three agents in two without evidence of an agentagent pattern viruses six morphologic classes of virus-like particles were present in stools from 28 of 45 episodes of diarrhea  patients with pathogens situated either side of a walk-through corridor diarrhea was defined as an increase in the usual daily stool frequency by two or more and excessive water loss in stool when symptoms began more than 24 hours after admission to hospital the infections were considered to be nosocomial stool specimens were obtained from resident infants on the first or second day of the study and from newly admitted patients as soon as available after admission to the study ward when possible specimens were obtained from infants with diarrhea at daily intervals for the first three days of their illness and at varia ble intervals for up to four days after diarrhea had ceased specimens were also obtained from asymptomatic room contacts of infants with diarrhea usually on the first and fourth days following the onset of symptoms in the index case specimens were not obtained from medical or nursing staff virus identification stool was suspended in phosphatebuffered saline at 10 w iv and stored at -20c specimens were subsequently thawed clarified by lowspeed centrifugation 3000 g for 10 minutes and 2 ml aliquots concentrated by ultracentrifugation 100000 g for 1 hour the pellet was resuspended in a drop of 1 ammonium acetate solution and examined using a philips 201 or 300 electronmicroscope virus-like particles were sought in at least 5 grid squares and classified as described by flewett and by middleton et al specimens containing adenovirus particles were inoculated into tissue cultures ofhep-2 and human embryonic lung cells cytopathogenic effect was confirmed by a second passage and adenovirus isolates were typed by neutralization tests specimens from room contacts of adenovirus positive infants with diarrhea were cultured in the same way specimens containing picorna-parvovirus particles were inoculated onto primary rhesus monkey kidney cells and isolates identified by cytopathogenic effect on second passage and electronmicroscopic appearance particles were classified as polioviruses or non-polio enteroviruses by neutralization tests bacterial identification all specimens were examined for salmonella and shigella by conventional methods and for enteropathogenic serotypes of escherichia coli by slide agglutination using a battery of 16

with their presumed index source ta ble 11 eight of 24 virus positive asymptomatic room contacts showed similar concordance with the exception of one asymptomatic acquisition of rotavirus viral concordance between infants with diarrhea and their room contacts was limited to minirotavirus and calicivirus concordance between asymptomatic infants excreting virus and their respective room contacts was also limited to minirotavirus which was found in three of 15 contacts none of whom developed diarrhea correlation of symptoms with virus acqu isition was variable  to of 17 infants with

contacts remained asymptomatic and had negative stool examinations one had diarrhea associated with picorna-parvovirus bacteria two serotypes of enteropathogenic e coli were identified in specimens from four infants with diarrhea three of whom coincidentally carried a virus these and two other enteropathogenic serotypes were also identified as the only pathogen in seven of 74 asymptomatic contacts there was no evidence of spread of these enteropathogenic serot ypes in the infants studied and complete serot yping of 55 isolates of e coli from 35 infants with diarrhea also failed to show an epidemiologic pattern in this symptomatic population  none of th e commonly recognized enterotoxigenic serotypes was idenrifled also none of these same 55 isolates of e coli was invasive evidenced by negative sereny tests  stools from one infant with diarrhea were consis tently positive for a strain of e coli ok h4 producing heat stable and labile enterotoxins the same specimens contained aden ovirus tissue culture negative isolates of e coli obtained from parents and two siblings were enterotoxin negative and none was found to carry e coli 0 kh4 salmonella typhimurium and y enterocolitica were the only pathogens identified in one index patient each  neither elise was nosocomial and transmission to room contacts did not occur most studies of nosocomial gastroenteritis have concerned epidemics of diarrhea in closed patient populations often attributed to single agents this study differs in the open nature of the population the ward continued to accept new patients throughout while attempting to discharge transfer or cohort those with diarrhea no infant with a history of recent loose stools was accepted into the ward about half of the new patients had acute respiratory disease respiratory isolation priorities led to frequent room changes and may in part explain the high incidence of nosocomial diarrhea and acquisition of viruses by one third of asymptomatic infants studied it does not however explain the variety of virus particles identified it seems likely that once the large and varied reservoir of pathogens had been established the continued admission of new patients and their rapid turnover permitted survival of individual agents at a low level of endemicity infants were not followed after discharge from hospital and our data are probably a low estimate of the prevalence of nosocomial diarrhea and communicability of viruses in the study population almost half of the instances of diarrhea were associated with either minirotavirus or calicivirus in stool their claim as true viruses and potential pathogens is su pported by the temporal ass ociation of fecal carriage and presence of diarrhea and evidence of communicability from infant to infant in one sequence lateral transmission of calicivirus could be traced through a chain of seven infants in another exceptional instance an infant had intractable diarrhea for several weeks the course of which was punctuated by two periods of vomiting associated with fecal shedding of minirotavirus and calicivirus respectively two other infants had separate attacks of diarrhea and vomiting associated with minirotavirus and calicivirus seven of 12 infants without diarrhea but with miniro- table i had repeated vomiting coincident with the presence of virus in the stool and two others had loose stools without an increase in daily frequency vomiting was as frequent an association as diarrhea in patients found to carry these viruses table  iii  vomiting is also a prominent feature of rotavirus gastroenteritis but low-grade fever was present in only three of 20 infants with diarrhea associated with minirotavirus and calicivirus we have been unsuccessful in attempts to cultivate minirotavirus and calicivirus using human fetal intestinal organ culture human embryonic kidney cells monkey kidney eells human embryonic lung and hep-7 cell lines  adenovirus was a relatively common finding in stool examined by electronmicroscopy but poor correlation with symptoms and its occurrence with other agents obscure its significance communicability was not demonstrated by either electronmicroscopy or tissue culture methods culture using hep-2 cells was successful in six of eight specimens from infants with diarrhea and has been sustained with five isolates iden tified as adenovirus types 2 two isolates and 7 three isolates rotavirus played a smaller role than expected and transmission could only be presumed in one asymptomatic room contact this may reflect the bias of small numbers for there is no doubt that rota virus can assert its presence in an open infant ward seasonal variations seem to affect identification rates of enteritis-associated viruses in a similar manner picoma-parvoviruses particles appeared to be a random finding in stool and were not shown to be communicable enteroviruses were identified in five of eight specimens examined by tissue culture two of which were identified as polioviruses the yield of bacterial pathogens in this study was meagre and the data are largely negative classical enteropathogenic serotypes of e coli occurred sporadically and three of four affected infants with diarrhea carried a virus in the same specimen sequential specimens from one infant with diarrhea contained an enterotoxinproducing strain of e coli but the same specimen contained an adenovirus screening of five lactosefermenting organisms from more than 400 infants with diarrhea seen at this hospital 1975 1976  has yielded only one other enterotoxin producing strain ofe coli 06h 16 in an infant who acquired diarrhea in pakistan unpublished data we found that multiple putative pathogens were operating concurrently and independently in the study population approximately half of the cases of diarrhea were associated with either minirotavirus or calicivirus whose standing as etiologic agents is strengthened by the data presented community-based epidemiologic studies serology and virus culture win be necessary to substantiate the pathogenic role of these viruses  covid-19 and veterinarians for one health zoonotic- and reverse-zoonotic transmissions han yoo sang dongwan yoo   clusters of pneumonia with unknown etiology were detected in wuhan china in december 2019 and shortly after a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified as the causative agent the virus spread rapidly to other parts of china and many other countries despite tremendous efforts to contain the disease the world health organization declared the spread as a global pandemic referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of may 15 2020 216 countries and territories have reported nearly 45 million confirmed covid-19 cases and 300000 related deaths httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019 and those numbers continue to increase as veterinarian researchers we have been following the development of covid-19 in order to identify 1 zoonotic transmission from animal to human 2 potential risks to animals 3 intra- and inter-species dissemination between animals 4 possible reverse-zoonotic transmission from human to animal and 5 animal models that are crucial for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs sars-cov-2 initiates infection via the binding of its spike s protein to a specific cellular receptor the human receptor for sars-cov-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 a bat coronavirus bat-cov ratg13 has been isolated from yunnan china and its whole genomic sequence is 96 identical to that of sars-cov-2 another coronavirus was recently isolated from malayan pangolins and the whole genomic sequence of the pangolin coronavirus pangolin-cov is 9102 and 9055 identical to that of sars-cov-2 and bat-cov-ratg13 respectively 1 although the bat-cov-ratg13 sequence is closest to that of sars-cov-2 96 similarity the receptor-binding domain of the pangolin-cov s protein is more similar to that of sars-cov-2 than that of bat-cov-ratg13 five key amino acids essential for binding to the human receptor are identical between pangolin-cov and sars-cov-2 but four of the five residues are mutated in bat-cov-ratg13 indicating that bat-cov-ratg13 may not efficiently infect humans 2 these findings suggest that sars-cov-2 may have evolved from pangolin-cov and adapted to humans via natural selection fig 1 further studies are needed to substantiate that pangolins are an intermediate host cats and dogs are often in close contact with humans and thus it is important to determine their susceptibility to sars-cov-2 covid-19 has been reported in two dogs in hong kong dogs that live with covid-19 patients have become infected and tested positive one of the dogs developed specific antibodies against sars-cov-2 and seroconverted indicating an active infection canine cases of covid-19 were also reported in the netherlands and the us https6abccomcoronavirus-dogs-dog-update6134707 a family in north carolina experienced mild covid-19 symptoms and their pug also showed mild symptoms with inappetence all three family members tested sars-cov-2 positive and the virus was detected in the dog the family owned two dogs and a cat but only one dog tested positive in the netherlands four house pets tested covid-19 positive a covid-19 patient owned a dog and three cats and the dog was suffering severe breathing problems this bulldog tested sars-cov-2 positive and was euthanized due to the illness the three cats also developed specific antibodies for sars-cov-2 all four animals appeared to have contracted the virus from their covid-19 owner in contrast to dogs cats appear to be highly susceptible to the virus in belgium a cat living with its covid-19 owner became clinically ill exhibiting respiratory problems accompanied by diarrhea and vomiting the specific viral sequence of sars-cov-2 was detected in the feces and gastric vomitus of the cat and that sequence was identical to that of the cat owner indicating the occurrence of reverse-zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2 from human to animal in wuhan 102 cats were tested and 15 of them were seroconverted indicating sars-cov-2 exposure of cats from either people or other cats 3 an additional case of covid-19 in cats was reported in hong kong this cat did not show any clinical signs but oral nasal and fecal samples tested positive in the us sars-cov-2 positive cats have been reported in two separate areas in the state of new york 4 a veterinarian tested one cat after it exhibited mild respiratory symptoms the cat was sars-cov-2 positive but no one in the household was positive this cat may have contracted the coronavirus outside of the household from a person with covid-19 in another case a cat with respiratory symptoms and living with a covid-19 patient tested positive these data clearly show that cats are susceptible to sars-cov-2 and may contract covid-19 fig 1 a controlled experiment was conducted to support the observations showing that cats are susceptible to covid-19 5 the results of that experiment showed that cats are highly susceptible to sars-cov with the viral sequence detected in on the nasal turbinates soft palate tonsils and small intestine the infections led to massive lesions in their nasal passages trachea and lungs indicating efficient replication of the virus in cats interestingly kittens and adolescent cats were especially vulnerable to covid-19 notably the coronavirus spread from infected cats to uninfected cats via respiratory droplets feline cases of covid-19 have additionally been reported in spain france and germany httpswwwoieintscientific-expertisespecific-information-and-recommendationsquestions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus it is logical to speculate that secondary transmission may occur from covid-19 animals to humans despite no direct evidence showing whether transmission from cats to humans can occur fig 1 owning a pet cat is commonplace thus the possible transmission of sars-cov between owners and cats or between cats for example in a veterinary hospital setting is of concern experimental infections under varying conditions wide-ranging surveillance using specific diagnostic tests and collection of epidemiological data will help elucidate the role of companion animals in the spread of covid-19 among wildlife lions and tigers are susceptible to sars-cov-2 four tigers and two lions at the bronx zoo in new york city developed clinical symptoms associated with respiratory illness and testing confirmed they were sars-cov-2 positive 6 the big cats had been exposed to a zookeeper who was covid-19 positive and actively shedding the virus indicating occurrences of reverse-zoonotic transmission fig 1 susceptibility to covid-19 has been evaluated in laboratory animals companion animals and farm animals in attempts to identify animal models of sars-cov-2 infection upon infection susceptible animals may not show symptoms or even if they do exhibit clinical signs their symptoms may not match those of covid-19 in humans thus the establishment of an appropriate animal model is crucial among laboratory animals ferrets golden syrian hamsters and monkeys have been shown to be susceptible to sars-cov-2 and they develop clinical symptoms 7 ferrets are a good model for human influenza particularly as they can sneeze spreading the virus in the air sars-cov-2 infects ferrets but fatalities have not been observed 8 the virus was detected in ferret nasal washes saliva urine and feces and airborne transmission was observed however viral replication in other organs was undetectable and did not lead to symptoms other than an increase in body temperature a monkey-based study was conducted using four rhesus macaques 9 these old-world monkeys were successfully infected and viral replication occurred in the nose pharynx lung and gut the infections caused weight loss and a moderate level of interstitial pneumonia with lesions and lymphocyte infiltration occurring in the lung which were confirmed by he staining and immunohistochemical analysis this monkey study also showed the presence of an antibody response against the virus using this monkey model the efficacy of remdesivir an antiviral drug was examined 10 recovery in remdesivir-treated animals was significantly better than that in control animals only one of six treated animals had mild breathing difficulty whereas all animals in the control group showed breathing difficulty in treated monkeys the viral load in the lungs was significantly lower and lung damage was significantly milder than those in the control animals regardless of the animal model used a significant challenge in such studies is that the experimental infection must be performed in a biosafety level 3 facility the high susceptibility of the felidae family lions tigers jaguars leopards cougars and cheetahs and in particular monkeys to covid-19 implies a potential for outbreaks in great apes chimpanzees gorillas orangutans in zoos animal-holding facilities primate research centers and national wildlife parks risk assessments are needed to prepare for the conservation and protection of such animals among farm animals minks at two breeding farms in the netherlands showed various symptoms including respiratory illness and were found to have been infected with sars-cov-2 the minks were likely to have contracted the virus from farm staff and the mink farms were subsequently placed under quarantine httpswwwoieintscientific-expertisespecific-information-and-recommendationsquestions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus a subsequent study suggested that an infection took place from minks to humans and cats played a role in the spread of the virus between farms implicating possible occurrence of interspecies transmission cat to mink and secondary zoonotic transmission mink to human of sars-cov-2 fig 1 in experimental infections pigs chickens and ducks remained sars-cov-2 negative and did not develop any clinical signs 5 viral sequences were not detected in any swabs collected from virus-inoculated animals and the animals remained seronegative for two weeks post-infection therefore pigs chickens and ducks seem not to be susceptible to sars-cov-2 regardless a wider range of farm animal species needs to be examined to assess the risks of sars-cov-2 infection and to identify possible impacts of covid-19 on the agricultural and food supply industries a combination of ecological disturbances landscape changes human behaviors and public health factors contributes to the frequency of contacts between humans and wildlife and such contacts pose a risk of exposure to transboundary animal viruses 11 moreover viruses can easily mutate switch hosts and adapt to a new host for the control of infectious diseases in animal populations veterinarians typically apply 1 biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of viruses to populations 2 surveillance via diagnostic testing to identify infected animals 3 removal of infected animals from uninfected populations and 4 vaccination for long-term control by promoting immunity these approaches have proven to be effective and successful in many countries when used to contain some transboundary epizootics foot-and-mouth disease african swine fever and newcastle disease to name a few in this period within the covid-19 pandemic societies and human behaviors are quickly changing and to accommodate these changes the traditional roles of veterinarians should evolve accordingly veterinarians should have significant roles in maintaining healthy ecosystems and protecting animals and humans from emerging and transboundary infections such roles should be based on the one health framework the application of which can reduce economic impacts on the livestock industry and food supply  title sars-cov-2

dose pulmonary lesions were detectable by petct in the acute phase and subsequently resolved all agms exhibited prolonged shedding of infectious virus from oral nasal conjunctival and rectal mucosal surfaces viral rna vrna remained detectable throughout both the respiratory and gi tissues at necropsy in the absence of replication-competent virus these results show multiple routes are involved in viral shedding and that shedding occurs over a protracted period of time in subclinical animals both of which will greatly impact sars-cov-2 transmission from covid-19 patients healthy male agms 35 years of age were infected with passage 3 p3 of a human isolate of sars-cov-2 from munich germany table s1  11  four animals were infected using a small particle aerosol designated a1-a4 and two were infected by a multi-route mucosal exposure designated m1 m2 involving administration of virus into the oral nasal and ocular mucosal surfaces and intratracheal instillation using a bronchoscope aerosol inhaled exposure doses ranged from 37-42 log10 pfu of virus due to the standard 2 log loss of virus after nebulization multi-route mucosal exposures were 64 log10 pfu after infection animals were anesthetized for blood draws mucosal swabs plethysmography and chest radiography at regular intervals postinfection clinical disease was mild in all six animals fig s1a  respiratory function revealed a transient decrease in the volume of air inhaled or tidal volume at 7 dpi fig s1b  while other parameters including frequency and expiratory time were within normal limits in the two mucosally infected agm and in one aerosol infected agm there were several short spikes of fever maximum deviation 24-34 c  during the course of infection fig s2  for these three animals the average significant elevation in temperature was less than 1 c for either route of 4 infection suggesting an overall low-grade fever the other three aerosol-infected agms a1-a3 developed mild hypothermia response around 5-7 dpi that persisted for most of the remainder of the study fig s2  complete blood counts cbc revealed a transient decrease in lymphocytes and platelets and an increase in neutrophils fig s1  this is also seen in human covid-19 patients 12 13  blood chemistry analysis demonstrated decreases in amylase and blood urea nitrogen bun and no elevation in liver enzyme levels fig s3  tracts virus isolations and q-rt-pcr analysis were performed for oral rectal nasal and conjunctival swab samples obtained over the course of the infection sars-cov-2 isolations were confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-spike antibody fig 1a  syncytia were present in vitro isolations particularly at the later time points eg 21 dpi replicating virus was detected in all nasal and oral swabs from all animals on 2 and 4 dpi fig 1b  on 2 dpi 56 rectal swabs and 26 ocular swabs were positive for infectious virus all swabs were broadly negative from all animals at 11 dpi however there was a resurgence in the presence of replication competent virus on 14 and 21 dpi in samples from the respiratory and gi tracts  fig 1a and b  q-rt-pcr results confirmed the virus isolation results with a peak in vrna detection in oral nasal and conjunctival swabs between 2-7 dpi and a second spike in rectal samples 21 dpi fig 1c-f  there was consistent detection of vrna through 28 dpi although at the stage infectious virus was not isolated from either swabs or necropsy tissues molecular imaging using positron emission tomography pet with the radiotracer 18 f-fdg provides a sensitive measurement of metabolic activity within specific anatomical compartments when co-registered with computed tomography ct petct can provide detailed anatomic structure overlaid with areas of high metabolic activity revealed by the tracer fdg-based petct has been used in nhps for measurement of lung granulomas caused by infection with mycobacteria tuberculosis 14-19 to determine whether lung infection with sars-cov-2 could be visualized using fdg-mediated petct or ct alone imaging was performed preinfection 4 dpi and 11 dpi for most animals to quantify overall disease burden in the lungs at the various time points a disease-associated total lung fdg activity level was calculated to 5 measure the total lung inflammation analysis of the maximum suvs in thoracic lymph nodes lns was also conducted both mucosally-infected animals and one of the aerosol animals a4 had significant lung inflammation at 4 dpi based on fdg uptake these lesions resolved by 11 dpi fig 2a  the lns in these three animals also showed the highest fdg uptake at 4 dpi while all 6 agm had substantial fdg uptake in the lns at either 4 or 11 dpi fig 2b  overall the extent of disease fig 2d  these areas resolved by day 11 but a new focal area of disease was present that day cyan arrow fig 2d  chest radiographs were taken on all longitudinal sampling days only animal m1 had detectable radiographic abnormalities with mild non-specific infiltrates present in the left lower lobe at 2 and 4 dpi that were resolving by 7 dpi fig s6  in order to evaluate the kinetics of seroconversion serial plasma samples from each sars-cov-2 infected agm were assayed for antibodies against the sars-cov-2 spike protein receptor binding domain rbd using an indirect elisa fig 3a  all animals generated both igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 notably there was simultaneous seroconversion of both igm and igg this contradicts the classic immunology paradigm of igm proceeding igg in response to antigen exposure however this mirrors precisely what occurs in covid-19 patients 20-23 further validating the utility of this agm model all animals seroconverted in the second week post exposure and those that were exposed via the mucosal route had higher overall titers than those that received the virus via the aerosol route this could reflect the fact that mucosal infected animals received a higher challenge dose than aerosol infected animals neutralization of sars-cov-2 was measured in matched samples using a plaque-reduction neutralization-80 test prnt80 fig 3b  neutralizing 6 antibodies were present in samples collected 7-11 dpi there were no differences in kinetics or activity between the two exposure routes demonstrating that higher dose received during multiroute mucosal infection neither affected the onset nor strength of the humoral immune response pbmc were isolated from whole blood and stained for flow cytometry using either a myeloid or lymphoid panel table s2  figs s7s8 the proportions of proliferating ki-67 cd4 and cd8 t cells increased transiently between 2-11 dpi in most animals fig s9  unlike in the aerosol infection there were sustained increases in proliferating cd8 t cells in the mucosally-infected animals fig s9d which is similar to what occurs in human covid-19 patients 12 13  nk cell frequencies varied over the course of the experiment as did the mean fluorescence intensity mfi of cd16 on nk cells with no clear pattern emerging fig s9ef  this is relevant since covid-19 patients with severe but not moderate disease demonstrated decreased cd16 mfi on nk cells 12  most notably an increased frequency of cd20 lo b cells was noted in all animals in the second week of infection accompanied by increased expression of ki-67 in these cells which is consisted with a plasmablast phenotype fig s9hi  in comparison cd20 hi b cells saw no increase in ki-67 an nhp-specific multiplex cytokine and chemokine assay was used to measure the levels of with the appearance of virus specific antibodies fig 3  necropsy upon euthanasia of each animal at 28 dpi 35 dpi for a1 and a2 full necropsies were performed and tissues were tested by qrt-pcr for levels of vrna fig 4  vrna was widespread throughout the upper and lower respiratory tracts including the soft palate and nasal turbinates the overall levels of vrna detected were comparable between the two exposure routes and doses indicating that the 100-fold higher infectious dose that the mucosally infected animals received did not translate into higher levels of tissue vrna at necropsy more vrna was detected 7 along the entire gastrointestinal gi tract compared to the lower and upper respiratory tracts highlighting differential tropism of sars-cov-2 vrna was detected in 56 olfactory bulbs but was largely absent from the cortex and cerebellum of most animals the heart liver spleen and kidney were largely devoid of vrna virus isolation attempts on lung and gastrointestinal tissue obtained at necropsy were unsuccessful residual histopathology detected at necropsy since the agms were euthanized at 28 or 35 dpi tissue specimens for acute histopathology were not obtained however lung samples and lymph nodes from animals known to be positive by petct were taken at necropsy and examined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist importantly even 4-5 weeks after infection several animals demonstrated multiple pulmonary foci of interstitial infiltration and expansion by either lymphocytic or mixed inflammatory infiltrates fig 5  while not a specific diagnostic finding this is a common pathological effect of many pneumotropic viruses and is also consistent with the convalescent stage of a respiratory infection interestingly multiple syncytiated cells were observed in the germinal follicles of peyers patches from two animals fig 5b  given the frequent propensity of coronaviruses including sars-cov-1 to lead to fused cells in vitro our observation that isolated virus from the agms form syncytia in vero-e6 cells fig 1a  and the observation of multinucleated syncytial cells in human cases of disease 24 25  this finding is likely a viral cytopathic effect moreover the peyers patches from 5 out of 6 agms contained some of the highest levels of vrna fig 4  discussion agms were used as a non-human primate model for sars-cov-1 infection after the 2003 epidemic compared to rhesus macaques agms supported enhanced sars-cov-1 virus replication and developed more severe lung pathology 10 26  they are also an excellent species to model other respiratory diseases such as pneumonic plague and human parainfluenza virus 7 9  in this study covid-19 disease in young agms was mild reflecting what frequently occurs in young healthy humans infected with sars-cov-2 27 28  low-grade fever was observed and respiratory symptoms were limited to a transient decrease in tidal volume advanced imaging using a metabolic pet probe permitted visualization of pulmonary lesions undetectable by other modalities such as standard chest radiographs petct is used clinically in managing covid-19 patients and is effective at visualizing lesions in asymptomatic patients 29 30  it is notable that 8 the three agm a4 m1 m2 that had the most febrile responses also had the highest level of inflammation in the lungs and lymph nodes as detected by petct petct imaging was also performed in crab-eating macaques infected intra-tracheally with sars-cov-2 31  disease in the macaques was mildsubclinical and petct scans showed areas of pneumonia and consolidation that were fdg avid the importance of these studies lies in demonstrating that petct imaging can be used to bridge human animal data particularly with respect to determining reductions in disease burden following vaccination or therapeutic interventions a key finding here was that virus isolations followed by immunofluorescence confirmation demonstrated unequivocally that infectious virus was shed from the respiratory and gi early followed by a recrudescence around 14-21 dpi the majority of in vivo sars-cov-2 studies use vrna detection as a surrogate for infectious virus the biphasic shedding pattern was unexpected and highlights the need to study longer term infection in animal models vrna was still detectable at substantial levels throughout the entire gi tract at 4-5 weeks after infection and gi titers were 10-100-fold higher than what was found throughout the upper and lower respiratory tracts this demonstrates the tropism of sars-cov-2 for intestinal tissues and the importance of gi replication in the viral pathogenesis transmission of sars-cov-1 through fecal matter contributed to super-spreader events during the 2003 outbreak 32 33  and the mechanism underlying this remains largely unexplored for sars-cov-2 vrna and infectious virus has been detected in feces of covid-19 patients with or without gi symptoms 34 35 36  the agm model will allow an understanding of how sars-cov-2 is shed from the gi tract and potentially transmitted via feces in a recent study with cynomolgus macaques sars-cov-2 infection was mild to subclinical even in aged animals shedding of vrna from mucosal surfaces was limited to early time points and vrna at necropsy was largely limited to respiratory tissues 1 a preprint study in rhesus macaques showed transient clinical disease marked by brief fever right after infection transient weight loss mild respiratory depression and pulmonary infiltrates by chest radiograph 2  upon necropsy vrna was found primarily in the lungs and upper respiratory tract and not in the gi tract another preprint study in rhesus macaques found similar limited disease with shedding of vrna and infiltrates by chest radiograph 3 the current consensus regardless of nhp species or viral isolates is that infection with sars-cov-2 leads to mild or subclinical infection with shedding of virus from the respiratory 9 tract severe disease or lethality has been rarely seen after either mucosal or aerosol exposure one distinguishing feature of the agm model appears to be tropism of virus for tissues throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract as we found here including substantial shedding of infectious virus a key finding from this study was the repeated isolation of infectious virus over time from mucosal swabs including the rectum this is critically important for the fundamental understanding of both covid-19 disease and person-to-person transmission 37 38  the animals used here were all male and all 35 years of age age range is 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 years in captivity making them young and around the age of sexual maturity future studies should consider using older animals andor those directly imported from st kitts particularly relevant to the covid-19 pandemic is that agm from the west indies spontaneously develop hypertension without dietary intervention or inbreeding 39  moreover they naturally develop type ii diabetes and atherosclerosis making them an excellent species to study pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 under conditions representative of the comorbidities associated with severe covid-19 in humans 40 41  increasing age genetic variability and spontaneous hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease may lead to more severe outcomes in agms when infected with sars-cov-2 and thus may more accurately reflect the variation seen in the human population in summary we comprehensively evaluated the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 in the agm model our study suggests that agms are excellent models for many aspects of covid-19 in humans 1 young healthy agms may represent subclinical or mild human disease 2 consistent shedding of infectious virus from respiratory and gi tracts in the absence of overt disease allows   animal model prescreening pre-exposure to sars-cov-2 impacts responses in the nhp model keersten ricks m andrew herbert s jeffrey

return to normalcy requires rapid development of countermeasures with animal models serving as a critical tool in testing vaccines and therapeutics animal disease status and potential covid-19 exposure prior to study execution may severely bias efficacy testing we developed a toolbox of immunological and molecular tests to monitor countermeasure impact on disease outcome and evaluate prechallenge covid-19 status assay application showed critical necessity for animal prescreening specifically real-time pcr results documented pre-exposure of an african green monkey prior to sars-cov-2 challenge with sequence confirmation as a community-acquired exposure longitudinal monitoring of nasopharyngeal swabs and serum showed pre-exposure impacted both viral disease course and resulting immunological response this study demonstrates utility in a comprehensive pre-screening strategy for animal models which captured the first documented case of community-acquired non-human primate infection  one sentence summary pre-exposure to sars-cov-2 affects biomarker responses in animal models highlighting a need for robust pre-screening protocols prior to medical countermeasure studies main text longstanding awareness of coronavirus as an infectious disease from the seasonalcold to the smaller outbreak clusters of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars1 and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers informed the infectious disease and public health community of the potential for the current outbreak 1 2 3 4  one-health efforts led by multiorganizational teams such as predict highlighted a wide range of novel coronaviruses circulating in animal reservoirs and the human-environmental interface as possible outbreak candidates 5 6  previous ebola virus outbreaks in west africa and drc invigorated discussions on pandemic preparedness and rapid response to disease x however the globe faced a stark reality in late 2019 with the ongoing sars-cov-2 pandemic exposing critical gaps in the ability to respond 7 8  researchers are moving at a rapid pace to fill these gaps with development of diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics 9 10  for these efforts to succeed and impact the spread of the virus there is the critical need for well-characterized assays to identify the virus assess the immune response post-exposure and determine efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics 11  despite extensive research and animal modeling post-sars-cov-1 and mers outbreaks as well as the rapid rate of research on sars-cov-2 little is known regarding longevity of immune protection vaccine efficacy or reinfection potential for this new coronavirus 12 13 14 15 16 17  globally vaccine and therapeutic groups are addressing the need for a better understanding of pathogenesis and appropriate animal models by tackling specific questions such as non-human primate species selection potential for viral reinfection and virus detection and immunological profiling 18 19 20 21 22  specifically haagmans etal found no clinical signs of disease in a cynomolgus macaque challenge model but noticed viral secretions in the nose and throat of challenged monkeys with disease severity to be between that of sars1 and mers 23  in a rhesus macaque reinfection model by qin etal nhps challenged post-recovery did not exhibit any evidence of re-infection with sars-cov-2 24  in addition many groups are detecting virus and subsequent immune response in asymptomatic mild and severe covid patients 25 26 27  data from these studies suggest a differential response in both the species selected to initial sars-cov-2 versus a reinfection models this also impacts the diagnostic context where unanswered questions regarding concordance between immunological data and correlates of protection inhibit efforts for instituting immunity passports 28  diagnostic assay development and validation efforts focus on diagnosis and post-exposure screening of the human population however application of a diagnostic toolbox across animal models is essential for therapeutic and vaccine efforts for a complete understanding of disease progression and treatment efficacy 29 30  diagnostic and animal model assays generally parse into two bins based on target biomolecule nucleic acid or protein diagnostics both types of assays in a qualitative and quantitative context inform animal model and countermeasure development table s1  for instance real-time pcr is used for both pathogen detection qualitative and determining viral load quantitative pathogen-specific igm and igg antibody immunological assays characterize the infectionspecific host response and diagnostically are commonly used to screen for recent or previous pathogen exposure critical to the countermeasure development is the understanding of the protective response generated through exposure characterizing this immune response using microneutralization and prnt assays adds specificity and qualitative data to immune response coupled with existing animal model data animals used for covid-19 model and countermeasure development should be screened for current and previous exposure to the study organism given the significant impact previous exposure can have on the study results high transmissibility and prevalence of this novel coronavirus presents a unique challenge to animal model developers pre-screening animals for past exposure against most emerging infectious diseases such as viral hemorrhagic fevers and other lesser-known arthropod borne viruses often only requires a simple elisa in these nhp cohorts the risk of prior exposure or having cross-reactive antibodies against the challenge agent is low here we demonstrate the need for a fully developed molecular and immunological toolbox prior to animal challenge when considering animal models against a disease agent of pandemic potential we present an integrated assay development approach pcr sequencing immunoassays and neutralization assays for a sars-cov-2 species selection study in the prescreen application of this toolbox  an african green agm non-human primate nhp showed evidence for previous exposure to sars-cov-2 prior to challenge with the institute stock fig 1  additionally use of this integrated screening approach post-challenge showed the immunological and viral load were significantly impacted by this pre-exposure across longitudinal assessments results immunoassay development we took a multi-pronged assay developmentimplementation approach in order to mitigate risk prior to animal model development by producing in-house assays as well as integrating a commercial eua approved elisa kit commercial sources and academic collaborators provided sars-cov-2 recombinants to develop a multiplex bead-based immunoassay on the magpix platform our previous efforts used this method to qualitatively detect both igm and igg response against glycoprotein and nucleoprotein targets in animal models such as cchfv rvfv and veev thus simplifying platform selection assay optimization and matrix testing as we could leverage our successes in utilizing this platform for longitudinal biomarker assessment in serum 31 32  the newly developed multiplex magpix assay targeted full trimeric spike protein s1 subunit receptor-binding domain nucleoprotein and sars1 spike protein  fig s1  we ordered the sars-cov-2 s1 igg elisa kit from euroimmun to run in parallel to our in-house magpix multiplex as there was substantial validation data for the assay a nt e real-time rt-pcr development we optimized two real-time qualitative rt-pcr assays qn2 and gp these assays used different reagents than the center for disease control cdc emergency use authorization eua reagents due to supply shortages thus establishing an independent supply chain from human eua testing the two assays showed similar performance when tested against serially diluted sars-cov-2 nucleic acid with a slight increase in sensitivity with the qn2 assay compared to the gp assay fig s2a and 2b  we observed no cross-reactivity across a 103-organism exclusivity panel including eight different coronaviruses clinical matrices contain inhibitors that can negatively impact nucleic acid extraction and realtime pcr performance matrix testing with the more sensitive qn2 assays showed similar performance in both pbs and np swab matrix at higher virus concentrations however the lod was lower in less complex pbs matrix  fig s2c  sixty replicate extractions with singlet qn2 testing resulted in all replicates testing positive at a virus concentration of 0614 pfuml  fig   s2d  leveraging past successes developing microneutralization assays we optimized a rapid highthroughput method for evaluating therapeutic countermeasures against live sars-cov-2 virus screening of four commercially available antibodies identified a sars-cov-1 np-specific cross-reactive antibody capable of detecting sars-cov-2 infected cells in an immunofluorescence-based assay ifa evaluation of mean fluorescent intensity of this serially diluted antibody on uninfected and sars-cov-2 infected cells determined the optimal immunostaining concentration peak intensity began to decrease near 14500 dilution of primary antibody resulting in a 15000 dilution of primary antibody for all subsequent immunostaining  fig s3a  vero-e6 cells were equally if not more permissive for sars-cov-2 infection compared to vero-76 cells inoculated with an equivalent multiplicity of infection moi fig   s3b  at 24 hours percent infection ranged from 30 at moi 06 to less than 2 at moi 0007 with standard deviation between 06 and 24  fig s3c  by 48 hours mois between 06 and 0022 resulted about 60 infection with standard deviations between 17 and 27 percent infection at moi 0007 resulted in about 40 infection and standard deviation of 85 the primary focus for this effort was developing an assay to evaluate virus entry inhibition therefore we opted for a 24 hour assay in order to limit rounds of virus replication across several independent experiments with sars-cov-2mt0208801 at an moi of 04 percentage of infected cells within assays were consistent with intra-assay coefficient of variance cov ranging from 49 to 68 and 27 to 95 based on the viral stock used fig s3d  similarly mean percent infection was also consistent for independent stocks mean  432 and mean  57 with inter-assay cov of 156 and 142 respectively fig s 3e  data compiled from independent experiments with cells infected with sars-cov-2 at an moi of 02 or 008 showed intra-assay variability across replicate wells was more consistent at moi 02 as compared to with moi 008 fig s3f   based on these results we performed all subsequent experiments at 24-hour assay and an moi 02 pre-study nhp baseline screening prior to the study start we screened serum from 12 total nhps 4 agm 4 rm 4 cm against the euroimmun elisa covid magpix multiplex nt and prnt study coordinators took pre-bleed samples between 23 and 17 days pre-challenge all pre-bleed serum samples were negative by immunoassay and plaque reduction neutralization test prnt assays table s2  as part of re-iterative prescreening for covid study coordinators also took pre-study np swabs from these nhps 11 days pre-challenge fig 1 surprisingly the left nare np swab of one agm tested positive by the qn2 assay and subsequently by the gp assay table s3  sequencing of the extracted nucleic acid material showed 95 coverage to the sars-cov-2 reference genome and found to be in a separate clade than the usamriid challenge stock material institution stocks are based on the wa1 mt0208801 however the agm swab was phylogenetically closer to isolates that have been circulating in the us and europe fig s4  the study team swabbed all nhps again including the positive agm immediately prior to challenge the left nare np swab was positive with both assays and almost half of the right nare np replicates tested positive with the gp assay no other nhp in the study was pcr positive by np swab prior to study start fig 1  longitudinal assessment of immune response and viral load we screened all time points postchallenge by elisa magpix and pcr assays all nhps showed no igg response on day 1 post-challenge pc with the exception of the previously exposed agm o7608 fig s5a-c  measurable igg response in the euroimmun elisa started at day 11 pc and increased through to terminal bleed interestingly the previously exposed agm igg response plateaued at day 7 pc however we observed an anamnestic response at day 11 pc fig 2a  further analysis of this immune response using the covid igm and igg magpix multiplex immunoassay at all days pc showed specific igm signal only to sars2 glycoprotein antigens as these assays yielded no measurable signal for the sars1 spike or the sars2 nucleoprotein fig 2b fig s6  igm signal was detectable above baseline for the average of each nhp species by day 9 for the agm and rm and day 7 for the cm for all three glycoprotein derivatives igg signal was also detectable above baseline at day 9 for agm and rm and day 7 for cm fig s7  the magpix immunoassay showed higher relative sensitivity than the euroimmun elisa kit with detection of igg signal in the nhps 2-4 days sooner based on this assay there was no observed restimulation in the igm response of the pre-exposed agm post-challenge as noted for igg  fig   2b  igg response from the pre-exposed agm was statistically significant from the 15 other nhps at the day of challenge however there was no statistical difference serologically between that agm and the rest of the cohort at terminal bleed  fig s8  in screening the np swabs by pcr the cohorts had detectable nucleic acid starting at d3 through d9-11 with one nhp in each species cohort having detectable nucleic acid by np swab on the day of termination fig   s5d-f  notably o7608 had measurable nucleic acid on d1 through terminal bleed at lower relative levels of viral load exhibited by other members of the cohort post challenge fig 2c  serum samples were screened by commercial euroimmun sars-cov-2 s1 igg elisa kit or magpix multiplex for igm the direct elisa kit measures igg response against the s1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein the analogous s1 igm assay from the magpix multiplex is shown in panel b the neutralizing activity of serum collected at time of challenge and at the termination of the  he or study day 18 post-challenge by prnt nearly all animals showed no neutralizing activity at time of challenge with prnt80 titers less than 120  fig s9  the sole exception being the previously exposed agm o7608 which had a prnt titer of 1160 in contrast assessment by microneutralization assay demonstrated neutralizing activity of serum collected at time of challenge in all agm serum samples with calculated half-maximal inhibitory concentration ic 50  from 1212 to 11274 fig 3 table s4  in agreement with elisa and prnt data previously exposed agm o7608 had the highest pre-challenge ic 50  neutralizing activity of rm and cm pre-challenge serum was similar to that of human negative control serum fig s10  on day 18 post-challenge prnt80 titers increased to between 1160 and 12560 fig s9  likewise microneutralization assay ic 50 increased 5-95 fold the greatest fold difference occurring in rm and cms table s4  neutralizing titer in previously exposed agm o7608 remained largely unchanged between time of challenge and day 18 in both assays the fold-change in log ic50 microneutralization response in the average agm cohort was noticeably higher than that of the pre-exposed agm fig 3  harmony software and percent inhibition calculated relative to untreated cells the fold-change in the logic50 of the pre-exposed agm was relatively elevated in comparison to that of the average agm response mapping of all assay results showed the pre-exposure impact on neutralization and other relevant diagnostic targets fig 4  these data showed the dramatic increase from d1 to d18 in all diagnostic targets rt-pcr igm and igg and neutralization prnt and microneutralization across the entire cohort with the exception of the pre-infected cohort nhp o7608 in nhp o7608 we observed a generally static level of neutralization igg titers rose over the course of the study while interestingly igm levels dropped fig 4 fig s11  comparison of agm o7608 to average nhp response for each screening assay the pre-exposed agm generally had no consistent fold-change from d1 gray bars to d18 black bars whereas there was measurable positive fold-change for each assay for the average nhp cohort a key element to a modern societys fortune in weathering disease outbreaks and especially pandemics such as covid-19 is its ability to coordinate an effective scientific and societal response the earliest recorded pandemic the athenian plague of 430 bc killed more ng the nt all n p of for 18 nd nd re than 25 of the population of athens during the peloponnesian war and was theorized to have been caused by typhoid fever 33  in a more devastating fashion 1918 spanish flu spread all over the world in the middle of world war i killing more than 50 million and infecting more than 25 of the worlds population common to post-pandemic society after each event were the associated advancements made in public health response and infectious disease research 8 34 35  to mitigate the devastating effects of disease spread and rising mortality rates there must be rapid response toward isolating the disease causing agent diagnosing affected patients treating those infected managing further spread of the disease and preventing future outbreaks 36  rapid development of animal models is critical to response efforts in order to understand disease pathogenesis and serve as a platform for testing medical countermeasures the high transmissibility rate of covid-19 and the dire need for medical countermeasures necessitates rapid initiation of animal studies to develop disease models for vaccine and therapeutic testing 37  additionally workflow and ppe considerations must be taken to mitigate pre-exposure risk of nhp colonies to fomites or other potentially infectious exposure routes pre-infection of the nhp in question occurred in spite of enhanced absl3 usamriid nhp handling procedures and represent a personal protective equipment ppe stance above and beyond what is currently being applied at other premier institutes previous sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 research shows distinct differences in host nhp response to challenge based on whether the animal is nave or was pre-exposed to the virus 24  therefore we initiated the first documented thorough pre-screening strategy prior to a species selection study to ensure the nhps had no previous exposure markers to do so required development of a covid-19 diagnostic toolbox comprised of elisa pcr multiplex igmigg immunoassay and neutralization assays to establish a full pre-challenge baseline and capture of post-challenge image of the sars-cov-2 animal model applying these tools in a prescreening context we discovered one of the agm nhps had been previously exposed to sars-cov-2 with a community-acquired infection the first documented case of community acquired nhp infection root cause analysis has not been undertaken however sequencing confirmed this was a different strain than the isolate used for challenge with sequence data showing this isolate to be of european and not asian descent because this strain was not the a derivative of the challenge stock this demonstrated potential for contamination of a nave nhp cohort from the environment even when extraordinary preventive measures are taken to mitigate such risks coupled with high transmissibility of the virus itself the discovery of transmission from the community to an nhp has serious implications for future vaccine and therapeutic developmental efforts all labs moving forward in sars-cov-2 countermeasure testing should consider prescreening respective animal cohorts and implement measures to minimize the unintentional community to cohort virus transfer ultimately responsibility of reporting community acquired nhp infections resides with united states department of agriculture usda reporting and better understanding of the breadth of community-acquired infection within nhp colonies will further demonstrate the impact and necessity for pre-screen cohorts prior to study initiation analysis of the pre-exposed agm to the cohort average post-challenge showed an inversion for all of the diagnostic markers fig 4  detectable nucleic acid was present in the np swab of o7608 on d1 in addition to the presence of anti-sars-cov-2 igg igm and neutralizing antibodies interestingly the relative level of viral load was present but consistently lower than the rest of the cohort and did not show marked increase across longitudinal evaluations additionally igg and igm response in o7608 were elevated on d1 relative to the baseline signal of the other nhps igg appeared to be re-stimulated on d11 in concordance with the rest of the cohort however igm response slowly declined over the course of the study fig 2  lastly all of the nhps had a net positive fold change in neutralizing antibody response from d1 to d18 while o7608 had no significant net change fig 3  these data show the critical nature of a rapid but rational pre-screening response as the risk for not pre-screening prior to animal studies is evidenced in the alterations in these responses in pre-infected nhp together with the discovery of the pre-exposed nhp this research raises questions regarding a larger discussion on the necessity of pre-screening in a mid-pandemic research community implications for re-infection models identification of true correlates of protection and protective quality of future vaccines these data clearly show that sars-cov-2 pre-exposure will have dramatic impact on any evaluation for vaccine or therapeutic efficacy and protective response due to countermeasure treatment longitudinal data for covid-19 diagnostic markers could be impactful for currently implemented diagnostic algorithms the human screening for prior infection and potential for successful vaccine efforts 38  igg and igm co-induction seen here parallels current research in human cohorts with a non-phasic general increase in both immunoglobulins 39 40  igm is typically an early response indicator of the bodys adaptive immune response in the first week post-infection however this response appears to be delayed for closely monitored sars-cov-2 infections generally increase in igg titers reflect neutralizing activity a potential indicator of protection thus giving some measure of confidence in establishing immunity passports for populations that seroconvert however recent studies showed not all those infected yield a productive or detectable immunological response 28  additionally evidence from the preinfected nhp for both an anamnestic immunologic response and gross symptoms of productive sars-cov-2 infection suggest future vaccine efforts may have issues in producing durable protective immunity a sars-cov-2 reinfection model will need further investigation to establish whether data shown here gives evidence for a vaccine production design more similar to classic vaccination schedules or if it will require periodic updates similar to flu in general further investigation will be required to establish what impact re-infection will have on covid-19 diagnostic and countermeasures covid-19 is not the first pandemic nor will be the last this generation will experience beyond the implications for prescreening animals prior to study there are lessons in pandemic response that can be learned in time-to-product maturity and how we prioritize research efforts prioritizing assay development meets critical aspects for both diagnostic and countermeasure development needs there will always be a need to develop diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics in rapid response efforts however neglecting to clarify the relationships between diagnostic windows and matrices therapeutic targets and toxicity and vaccines and correlates of protection will only delay resolution of the covid-19 crisis to facilitate this resolution we openly invite collaboration and can share more detailed protocols and development processes to stand-up these assays in other

public health emergency it has been reported in 190 countries with 4310786 confirmed cases and 290455 deaths as of 12 th may 2020 walker and colleagues from the world health organization collaborating centre for infectious disease modelling predicted that in the absence of mitigation strategies the virus would infect seven billion people and account for 40 million deaths this year alone 1 efforts to shield the elderly 60 reduction in social contacts and interrupt transmission 40 reduction in social contacts for the wider population have reduced this number but further deaths are still expected 1 there is an urgent need for solutions in the absence of a vaccination or effective treatment there is growing interest in repurposing existing drugs for mitigation in particular drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system ras have been highlighted as potential candidates for further investigation 2 3 this is because the sars-cov-2 virus utilises angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors within the ras for entry into lung alveolar epithelial cells 4 ace2 has previously been shown to correlate with susceptibility to the sars-cov-1 virus and the spike s glycoprotein of this new virus binds to ace2 with even higher affinity 5 6 theoretically altered ace2 activity could therefore lead to a greater susceptibility to sars-cov-2 it could also cause greater severity of the infection 7 previous studies suggest that dysregulation of ace2 activity in the lungs could promote early neutrophil infiltration and subsequent uncontrolled activation of the ras system 8 in mice models acute lung injury was observed in response to sars-cov-1 spike protein so it is plausible that similar responses will be observed with sars-cov-2 9 this is particularly problematic in organs containing high ace2 such as the lungs as it may contribute to cytokine release syndrome cytokine storm and the subsequent respiratory failure that has been observed in those who have died from the disease 7 many prescribed drugs in common use are known to mediate effects through the ras pathway over 45 million of these prescriptions were issued in the uk last year alone and of these 15 million were for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ace-i and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs acting through the ras pathway these drugs may impact ace2 regulation but their role in the covid-19 pandemic is not clear given the number of people that are potentially on these drugs it has caused substantial public concern and clinical uncertainty about continuation or cessation of prescribed medications during the pandemic accordingly we reviewed all existing evidence on routinely prescribed uk drugs that might alter ace2 regulation understanding the drug effects on ace2 given its role in covid-19 disease could help reassure clinicians and the public in these uncertain times or direct research on drugs that might attenuate or exacerbate transmission our review was conducted in accordance with preferred reporting for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines and our protocol was submitted for open-access publication prior to commencing our study in press we have also made it

screened 3360 after removing duplicates following title and abstract screening 233 studies were screened by full text we included 112 studies in the final review the flow of studies is shown in a prisma diagram in figure 1 including the reasons for study exclusion at each stage table 2 shows the characteristics of the included studies these originated from 17 different countries with the most common being china n 36 the usa n 22 and japan n18 there were 10 studies in humans 7 in-vitro and 3 in-vivo  table 3  and 102 in animal models 13 invitro and 89 in-vivo animal models included rats n94 mice n7 and canines n1 the sample sizes for in-vivo animal models ranged from 6 to 117 for in-vivo human studies table  3  sample sizes ranged from 8 to 375 but were not always reported participants were predominantly male and white with hypertension or diabetes although the condition was not always stated most models examined ace2 receptors in the heart or kidneys only 5 of the 112 included

examined in 5 studies 3 reported upregulation 1 reported downregulation and 1 reported no effects for calcium channel blockers 2 out of the 3 studies reported upregulation of ace2 levels and these were both in-vivo rodent models the third study was an in-vitro human model that showed downregulation of ace2 with a calcium channel blocker there were 3 studies on aldosterone antagonists all reporting increases in renal ace2 levels within rat models several diabetes drugs were evaluated and found to increase ace2 for insulin 6 out of 8 studies reported upregulation of ace2 in mice and rat models for thiazolidinediones 5 out of 7 studies reported upregulation 6 micerate models and 1 of cerebral human cells in-vitro for glp-1 agonists both included studies reported increases in ace2 similarly for the one study examining dpp4 inhibitors it also reported an increase in ace2 the only study measuring the effect of sglt2 inhibitors reported a decrease in ace2 figure 2 shows the risk of bias across the studies using the syrcles risk of bias tool in general studies lacked blind allocation and outcome assessor blinding they also frequently omitted information needed to make a thorough judgement on the risk of bias to our knowledge this is the most comprehensive review of drugs prescribed in the uk that could act on ace2 receptors and thus potentially affect covid-19 disease the ace2 receptor is reported to be an essential contributor to sars-cov-2 entry into the nasopharynx and lungs and the subsequent inflammation that leads to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome 12 13 our review examined drugs across human and animal models and we found a number of studies reporting upregulation of ace2 levels in response to ace-i n22 arbs n55 insulin n8 thiazolidinedione n7 aldosterone agonists n3 statins n5 oestrogens n5 calcium channel-blockers n3 glp-1 agonists n2 and nsaids n2 however these drugs were poorly studied in vivo within the lungs or nasopharynx of humans where they are likely to matter most in influencing severity of outcomes of covid-19 disease we observed that the most frequent drugs to upregulate ace2 are also those prescribed in people with diabetes or cardiovascular disease mortality rates from covid-19 have been high in this group 12 14 15 16 notably these are also conditions with a high prevalence amongst black asian and minority ethnic bame groups who have had disproportionally high mortality rates from covid-19 disease 17 to date much of this evidence has been limited to clinical commentaries or case reports larger cohorts are emerging but have not yet adequately considered a range of potential confounders including co-morbidities age sex deprivation or household numbers which might be more important than prescribed medication in the spread susceptibility and severity of the disease for example in a cohort of 191 people who were infected with the virus in wuhan 87 of those who died had coronary heart disease and 47 had diabetes 18 these conditions are associated with an increased risk of death but were not considered as covariates in the analysis irrespective of ace2 people with diabetes are more susceptible to worse infection as the low-grade chronic inflammation and hyperglycaemia associated with the condition results in impaired immune responses with lower il-1 il-6 tnf-a and delayed mobilisation of immune cells in response to pathogens 19 this comorbidity like many other confounders are highly relevant when examining the risk of death with covid-19 disease  cc-by-nc 40

posted may 26 2020  httpsdoiorg101101202005 1920106856 doi medrxiv preprint this lack of adequate adjustment for existing conditions is highlighted by sommerstein and colleagues in their editorial on ace-i and arbs in covid-19 15 they also propose that existing co-morbidities such as heart failure may be independently linked to sars-cov-2 transmission and severity and the subsequent poor pulmonary outcomes that are observed in these patients indeed in mice models arterial hypertension atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes have been shown to upregulate ace2 levels irrespective of medications 2021 moreover ace2 levels have been shown to be higher in men and with increasing age 22 most of the published data on deaths in covid-19 disease report that males of increasing age are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes 12 23 our review has also highlighted the variable ace2 levels in different parts of the body with most of the existing literature focussing on renal and cardiac levels responses to drugs may vary depending on cell type and location although the lung ace2 is important to covid-19 it is unclear if overall covid-19 mortality might be attenuated by cardiovascular ace-2 activity levels we also observed variations in ace2 levels with drug exposure duration which was relatively short amongst included studies in our review it is uncertain how dysregulation might continue after starting or stopping these medications it is also unclear how the observed effects amongst included studies would translate in-vivo in humans and what the net effect on receptor access to the covid-19 virus is access to the receptor by the virus may be competitively inhibited by the presence of drugs which also attach to the receptor so whether upregulation is the key factor in practice is unclear this is particularly challenging to understand as we found a paucity of data demonstrating the effect of prescribed drugs on ace2 in the lungs or nasopharynx where the sars-cov-2 virus appears to enact its pathogenic effects our results therefore do not provide convincing evidence on the role of any currently prescribed uk drugs acting through ace2 regulation that could affect covid-19 disease finally we found a disproportionate number of studies reporting upregulation or positive effects of drugs on ace2 compared to studies reporting no effect or downregulation this may reflect a publication bias that is well-established in the literature especially amongst animal models 2425 we carried out a comprehensive and systematic search of the literature to our knowledge this is the first review on the subject we did not include language restrictions but non-english language studies in the international literature might not have been indexed in the databases we searched given the rate of new publications on covid-19 it is also possible that our search and results may not be up to date owing to the limited research on this novel virus it was necessary to be as inclusive as possible and we therefore considered both animal and human models to look for any drugs acting through ace2 with potential to affect covid-19 outcomes while this inclusive approach may offer insights the heterogeneity across models makes it hard to interpret findings or translate them directly to patients although we were robust in our methodological approach to this review we were also aware of the urgency to report our findings in the current pandemic we therefore did not contact authors for more information about their studies beyond what was published we observed frequent omission of information that would have allowed us to carry out a more detailed quality assessment had we pursued this information the quality assessment of included papers may well have been higher we reviewed the evidence on routinely prescribed drugs in the uk that could up or downregulate ace2 and thus potentially affect covid-19 disease our review indicates that currently prescribed drugs

graham s samantha martin d deborah molrine c stanley perlman philip picard-fraser a andrew pollard j chuan qin kanta subbarao jakob cramer p   since the identification of a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 as the cause of pneumonia in patients from wuhan china a pandemic has erupted resulting in enormous health care social and economic disruption to our global society 1 as of may 17 2020 there have been 4708415 cases and 314950 deaths worldwide 2 in rapid response to the pandemic academic and industry scientists from around the world have initiated efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics for disease prevention and patient management the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi a global partnership between public private philanthropic and civil organizations is funding work to develop sars-cov-2 vaccines using a variety of technology platforms several vaccine candidates are already in phase 1 studies with others likely to enter the clinic in the next few months 3 one of the challenges facing rapid vaccine development for sars-cov-2 is the need to adequately assure the safety of these vaccines one such safety concern is disease enhancement syndrome that occurred in the 1960s with inactivated rsv and measles vaccines vaccine-mediated disease enhancement is characterized by a vaccine that results in increased disease severity if the subject is later infected by the natural virus during early trials with inactivated rsv vaccine the vaccine did not prevent infection 80 of those infected required hospitalization and two children died 4 lung pathology in patients showed an unexpected inflammatory response with both neutrophils and eosinophils evidence of immune complex formation and complement activation in small airways 5 scientists later learned that the vaccine caused a similar disease enhancement in animals characterized by immunopathology and a t helper cell type 2 th2 biased response and antibody responses with poor neutralizing activity 6 7 8 since that time the animal models have been relied upon to predict safety for new rsv vaccines that are developed of note the pathogenesis of rsv disease enhancement is distinct from antibody disease enhancement ade which occurs for macrophage tropic viruses demonstrated most notably for dengue in humans and the coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus in cats and is directly caused by non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies leading to more efficient viral uptake via fc receptor binding 9 since pathology consistent with the rsv vaccine enhanced disease and perhaps ade has been demonstrated for some sars-cov-1 vaccine candidates in animal models there is also a concern that a similar syndrome could occur in humans immunized with sars-cov-2 candidate vaccines therefore cepi and the brighton collaboration safety platform for emergency vaccines speac convened a scientific working meeting httpsbrightoncollaborationusbrighton-collaboration-cepi-covid-19-web-conference on march 12 and 13 2020 of experts in the field of vaccine immunology and coronaviruses to discuss current knowledge that could form the basis for the assessment of the risk of enhanced disease during sars-cov-2 vaccine development this consensus report presents considerations for vaccine developers and can serve as a guide for the development and testing of vaccine candidates to avoid these safety concerns ultimately the door to clinical trials is controlled by regulators in the context of the riskbenefit for the entire dataset provided by developers and within the local trial context dr kanta subbarao director of the who collaborating centre for reference and research on influenza and professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at the university of melbourne and dr stanley perlman professor in the departments of microbiology and immunology and pediatrics at the university of iowa both reviewed their work and that of others in animal models developed for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov the lessons from these models can inform the development priorities for useful sars-cov-2 animal models to address both efficacy and safety in inbred mouse strains sars-cov-1 replicates efficiently in the respiratory tract and can cause pneumonitis but clinical signs and pneumonia were only observed in old balbc mice 10 subsequent passage of sars-cov-1 through mouse lungs resulted in the isolation of virus that caused severe disease in both young and old mice 11 12 this virus was used in many subsequent studies ferret models of sars-cov-1 also demonstrate virus replication in respiratory tracts with induction of a neutralizing antibody response but also demonstrated little evidence of clinical disease 13 hamsters in contrast to mice and ferrets demonstrate high levels of viral replication develop pneumonitis and can be shown to have clinical signs of disease 14 following the identification of human ace2 as the receptor for sars-cov-1 transgenic murine models expressing human ace2 receptor hace2 were developed and shown to develop mild pulmonary disease of note these mice also developed lethal viral encephalitis attributed to viral spread through the olfactory nerve despite the relative scarcity of hace2 expression in the brain which may have relevance to sars-cov-2 disease 15 efficacy of several sars-cov-1 vaccines was evaluated in these models with spike s protein based vaccines demonstrating neutralizing antibody and protection against pulmonary replication of the challenge virus in mice and hamsters 16 for dna vaccine studies it was shown that candidate vaccines encoding the s protein conferred antibody mediated protection from challenge in mice and that vaccines encoding the n protein induced humoral and cellular immunity 17 18 for vectored vaccines expressing sars-cov-1 proteins it was shown that viral proteins were expressed in mice ferrets and hamsters in these studies neutralizing antibodies were elicited by bhpiv3 vsv rabies mva and adeno viruses expressing s protein that protected against sars-cov-1 replication in lungs of challenged animals however one mva vaccine expressing the s-protein did not protect against infection 16 in contrast to sars-cov-1 inbred mice were found to be resistant to mers-cov thus infection was studied by creating models that expressed the mers receptor human dpp4 hdpp4 ad5-hdpp4 transduced mice could be infected with mers virus but infection was associated with minimal clinical disease except in immunocompromised mice that developed weight loss after infection of note hdpp4-transgenic mice developed lethal viral encephalitis with concurrent inflammatory changes on histopathological examination of the lung similar to hace2-tg mice with sars-cov-1 subsequently investigators developed mice knocked-in for expression of hdpp4 and after virus passage in these mice identified mouse-adapted mers strains that caused more severe disease and increased histopathology with more pulmonary edema than those infected with the original mers strain 19 importantly mice without functional t cells such as rag1-- and tcr alpha-- had delayed viral clearance whereas mice that could not produce antibodies mumt mice did not show delay in clearance similar models were developed by crisprcas9 mutagenesis of two residues in the mouse ace2 molecule followed by mouse adaptation with serial passage leading to an ards model of lethal infection 20 21 taken together this evidence supports the notion that t cells are important in viral clearance for mers 22 non-human primate nhp models have also been established for both sars-cov-1 and mers-cov there was evidence of upper respiratory and lower respiratory tract sars-cov-1 replication in african green monkeys to a greater extent than in cynomolgus macaques and least in rhesus macaques with little evidence of clinical disease in all three species 23 of note consistent with findings in older humans and mice increased pathology has been documented in aged cynomolgus macaques with sars-cov-1 wild type infection 24 there is some controversy on the disease severity in the mers models with different groups seeing different levels of pathology this has not been resolved 25 26 both vaccine efficacy and safety have been studied in animal models with many sars-cov-1 candidate vaccines the group of experts discussed how the vaccine models were utilized to characterize the response of specific vaccines and to examine both disease enhancement and antibody dependent enhancement ade signals there is evidence for disease enhancement in vaccinated animals after challenge with live virus in multiple studies with sarscov-1 vaccine candidates as summarized in table 1
 we are limiting our comments in this report to data in animal models and not discussing in vitro data except to mention that there is some evidence of ade in human primary monocytes 27 28 different animal models exhibit different pulmonary pathology but generally characterized by cellular infiltrates including eosinophils in this summary we provide an overview of the consensus opinion on vaccine related outcomes in animal models that were of concern for risk of disease enhancement and could guide assessments of sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates in murine models evidence for vaccine related disease enhancement has been demonstrated for inactivated whole vaccine with and without alum vectored vaccine expressing n protein but not seen with vectored vaccine expressing s protein in same report a replicon particle platform expressing s protein and a vectored vaccine expressing s proteins in general the pathology described included pulmonary infiltrates often with eosinophils observed th2 dominant responses were documented in some reports by expression of th2 driven cytokines 29 30 31 32 33 in a ferret model hepatitis was demonstrated in animals vaccinated with a recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing s protein and then challenged with virus 34 although questions have been raised about this study 35 of note mouse models have also shown evidence of enhanced disease for inactivated and recombinant adenovirus 5-based mers-cov vaccine 36 37 non-human primate models have also produced evidence of enhanced disease after sars-cov-1 vaccine immunization chinese macaques immunized with a modified vaccinia virus expressing s protein then challenged with sars-cov-1 did not develop clinical disease but histopathology showed lung injury this injury was characterized by decreased wound healing and increased pro-inflammatory macrophages expressing il-6 il-8 and ccl2 38 this report also demonstrated that passively administered anti-s antibody was associated with lung pathology after challenge with the live virus although the mechanism may not be through fc receptor and thus not classic ade of note a second report similarly demonstrates the effect with certain anti-s antibody preparations and without fc involvement 39 40 the relevance of these reports remains unclear as there are multiple studies with administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to different models that did not induce disease enhancement other investigators have reported absence of disease enhancement in both hamsters and monkeys immunized with a whole inactivated vaccine although these models differed in a number of ways most notably by the use of bpl -propiolactone instead of formalin for inactivation of the virus 41 42 finally we note that there has not be an agreed upon positive control applied in these animal studies and thus interpretations are hamperedba animal models with sars-cov-2 are being rapidly developed by multiple research groups dr qin chuan professor and director of the institute of laboratory animal science comparative medicine center of the peking union medical college presented data on sars-cov-2 infection in both transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models human ace2 transgenic mice hace2 tg aged 4-6 weeks and 6-11 months of age were studied and hace2 expression was observed in lung heart kidney and intestinal tissues following intranasal inoculation with sars-cov-2 weight loss was observed and viral rna was detected in the lungs as well as in the intestine 43 gross pathology demonstrated swollen and enlarged lungs with moderate interstitial pneumonia histological studies documented an accumulation of inflammatory cells including monocytes and lymphocytes in alveolar interstitium with thickening of alveolar walls sars-cov-2 s protein was detected by ihc in alveolar macrophages and epithelia 43

 nhp were also infected with sars-cov-2 with 3 rhesus macaques aged 3-4 years inoculated intratracheally and although no fever was observed weight loss and asthenia were seen on multiple days viral rna was detected from nasal and throat swabs and to a lesser degree in anal specimens peaking on days 3 to 7 and lasting until day 11 post infection one animal was euthanized on day 7 for necropsy and viral rna was detected in multiple organs including cns skeletal muscle and heart for the two surviving rhesus macaques positive neutralization titers were documented by day 11 post infection there was radiographic evidence of multiple ground glass opacities in the lungs on days 3 5 and 7 post infection microscopically the lung lesions represented an acute interstitial pneumonia characterized by mild to moderate thickening of alveolar septum increased number of macrophages degeneration of pneumocytes and an inflammatory cell infiltration presence of viral antigen was confirmed predominately in alveolar monocytes and macrophages 44 analysis of blood samples showed a decline in counts of total white blood cells lymphocytes and monocytes with no observed changes in percentages a decrease in both cd3cd4 and cd3 cd8 t-cell counts was observed importantly these hematological findings are similar to those seen in sars-cov-2 infected patients this model could serve as a critical tool for detailed studies of pathogenesis and the evaluation of intervention strategies including vaccines of note following the meeting another group has confirmed sars-cov-2 infection in rhesus macaques with viral antigen detected in type i and type ii pneumocytes and diffuse pulmonary alveolar damage noted 45 experts agreed that these models and others under development should be utilized to evaluate vaccine candidates for any evidence of disease enhancement as specified in later sections design of safe and effective covid-19 vaccines can be informed by knowledge of previous coronavirus vaccine development activities and shared elements of viral pathogenesis for non-coronaviruses such as rsv specific epitope targets for potent neutralizing antibody platforms for inducing both neutralizing antibody and effective t cell responses and adjuvants for improving immunogenicity were presented at the conference we review first the structure and function of the major target of covid-19 vaccines spike s glycoprotein ralph baric phd professor in the department of epidemiology at the university of north carolina chapel hill school of medicine presented a review of the structure and function of coronavirus cov s glycoprotein highlighting priorities for the development of vaccine and immune therapeutics there is a long history of emerging covs with acceleration of cross-species movement and emergence of highly pathological strains in the last 16 years including sars-cov-1 mers-cov and sars-cov-2 and this trend is likely to increase in the future phylogenetic relationships within covs have been established and group 2b includes sars-cov-1 and sars-like covs including sars-cov-2 btcov wiv1 and btcov shc014 similarly group 2c are mers-like covs which are also poised for human emergence within group 2b known sars-like covs are divided into high or low pre-epidemic potential high risk features include use of ace2 for cell entry growth in primary human airway cells causing ards causing age-related disease severity and escape from existing immune therapeutics drivers of cov evolution include the high mutation rate of the rna-dependent rna polymerase paired with the regulated fidelity complex covs also demonstrate high rates of rna recombination as during mixed infection up to 25 of progeny are recombinant and modular evolution allows covs to swap whole genes or portions of key proteins between strains the s protein itself which regulates host range tissue tropism and transmissibility can tolerate a high mutation rate while retaining its function the organization of the sars-cov-2 genome has been elucidated and sars-cov-2 like sars-cov-1 has been shown to use hace2 for cell entry group 2b viruses have fourteen contact interfaces between their s protein and ace2 variation across the interface sites can facilitate orthologous species ace2 receptor usage since as few as seven interface sites are needed for entry the prefusion structure of the s glycoprotein has three major antigenic domains receptor binding domain rbd n terminal domain ntd and s2 epitopes on sars-cov-1 rbd have been identified as targets for neutralizing antibodies analyzing the variations and conserved regions in the s protein of group 2b sars-like covs shows conserved sites on the s2 region that could be targeted in broad-based therapeutics against multiple covs dr baric stressed that there is a large reservoir of sars-like and mers-like covs poised for emergence in humans two priorities are immediate vaccine candidates specific for sars-cov-2 and development of broad-based vaccines protective against antigenically distinct covs destined to emerge in the future key priorities for the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccine include characterization the sars-cov-2 neutralizing epitope map identification of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing epitopes identification of putative enhancing epitopes that might potentiate disease in vivo identification of key t cell epitopes across outbred populations and determination of correlates of protective immunity barney graham md phd deputy director of the nih vaccine research center presented data on the immunogenicity and neutralizing efficacy of truncated spike s antigens with a focus on sars-cov-2 class i fusion proteins such as s protein are common among enveloped viruses including rsv parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses and have been successfully stabilized in their pre-fusion conformations this approach has been shown to preserve neutralization-sensitive epitopes avoid antibodies that are non-neutralizing and improve expression in transfected cells thus aiding in manufacturing and immunogenicity of gene-based vectors the s proteins of sars-cov-1 and mers-cov have both been successfully stabilized by introducing two proline residues to the top of the central helix preventing heptad assembly and stabilizing the s2 region and the entire s protein as a result figure 1
 46 the sars-cov-2 s protein structure was solved shortly after its emergence and shows similar structure and mobility as the sars-cov-1 s 47 the timing from first knowledge of sars-cov-2 to the beginning of the phase 1 study was a remarkable sixty-five days the advantages of mrna vaccines include ability to create a highly precise type of protein to elicit the correct antibodies to elicit t cell responses that are th1 predominant and the rapidity of manufacturing of course disadvantages include the novel nature of both mrna and dna vaccines without any licensed vaccine with either technology to date and lack of experience for mass production therefore multiple platforms for sars-cov-2 are under development that mitigate against some of the potential disadvantages of nucleic acid vaccines although mrna and dna vaccines elicit t cell responses without adjuvants adjuvants may be important for subunit and whole cell inactivated vaccines to increase their immunogenicity and drive an immune response that could limit the risk of disease enhancement multiple sars-cov-2 vaccines are in development including vectored vaccines whole cell inactivated vaccines and recombinant protein vaccines the experts discussed how the choice of adjuvants will be important for both efficacy and safety with these platforms dr arnaud didierlaurent from the centre of vaccinology at the university of geneva presented background on the effects of different adjuvants on animal and human immune responses several adjuvants are now being used in commercial vaccines or are in clinical development 48 oil-in-water emulsions such as mf59 or as03 have been shown to increase the breadth of the antibody repertoire binding affinity and affinity maturation when compared to unadjuvanted vaccines 49 50 in human studies with influenza vaccines h5n1 vaccine adjuvanted with mf59 squalene-based emulsion increased the levels of h5-specific antibody for subclasses igg1 and igg3 and the binding to fcr2 but not to fcr3 when compared to alum adjuvanted vaccines this demonstrates that the use of an adjuvant can skew the functionality profile of antigen-specific antibodies with the potential to activate different innate effectors based on their fcr expression 51 use of squalene-based emulsion vaccines for influenza have also been shown to increase cd4 t cell response frequencies and cross-reactivity even if pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies are present prior to immunization such adjuvants could activate nave b cells and promote the adaptability of memory b cells 52 53 54 55 in addition to antibodies adjuvants can promote cellular responses human malaria challenge studies provided early evidence that the choice of adjuvantscombined with the malaria antigen rtss was critical in achieving optimal protection and highlighted the importance of cellular response 56 more recently studies with hepatitis b surface antigen hbs vaccine adjuvanted with as01 as03 as04 or alum showed that vaccines formulated with as01 and as03 induced the highest antibody levels while as01 promoted best hbs-specific cd4 t cell response 57 these differences were associated with the magnitude of the initial inflammatory response triggered by the different adjuvanted formulations 57 58 interestingly although the level of cd4 t cell response was lower in the alum group compared to the as01 group both adjuvants led to similar memory subset profiles and cytokine production profiles polyfunctionality and neither induced th2 cytokines nor a cd8 induced response upon peptide restimulation this indicates that use of alum may not necessarily lead to th2 skewing in humans recently a number of systems biology studies have revealed that specific early signatures eg interferon-dependent pathways induced by adjuvanted vaccines are often associated with protective responses 59 but the impact of these early signals on functional features of antibodies and the quality of t cell response is not well established yet although adjuvant selection is best performed in early clinical studies animal models could be useful is determining immune profile of adjuvanted vaccines nhp models are well-established to assess immune responses to vaccination and elicit immune responses in closer parallel to humans than mice for example in non-human primates adjuvant choice affects antibody half-life antibody glycosylation and antibody binding to fcrs indicating effects on both antibody quality and function like what is observed in humans 60 when adeno-based vectored vaccines are given to humans or nhps both groups develop similar antibody function profiles additionally nhps and humans tend to show similarities in terms of ranking of adjuvants and innate immune pathways triggered by adjuvants overall nhps could be utilized to evaluate covid-19 vaccine candidates with and without adjuvants and guide in the selection of vaccines that elicit desired attributes that could reduce the risk of vaccine-mediated enhanced disease given the unprecedented demand for an effective vaccine the use of adjuvants may be critical for subunit vaccines in providing antigen-dose sparing increased immunogenicity breadth and duration of response potentially eliciting cross-protection against new cov strains and minimizing the risk of enhanced disease following the presentations attendees participated in discussion of the suggested consensus statements and all attendees were asked to comment on the draft statements available online these comments were reviewed and discussed again on the second day of the meeting and resulted in the summary consensus statement that follows 
murine models for assessment of vaccine-related disease enhancement
sars-cov-2 has a low affinity for murine ace2 receptor and murine models will require the use of hace2 transgenic mice preferably with a knock-in approach preliminary data indicate the possibility of infecting hace2 transgenic mice with demonstration of viral replication and mild lung lesions mouse adaptation of sars-cov-2 as done with sars-cov-1 will likely be required to obtain a virus that causes more severe disease in mice models that develop acute lung injury with some lethality and that mimic the human condition will be important for evaluating vaccine safetyprevious studies from sars-cov-1 and mers-cov indicated that some vaccines especially those using whole inactivated virus could enhance the disease induced in mice challenged with sars-cov-1 or mers-cov the lung lesions were highly inflammatory with a dominance of eosinophil infiltration and occurred in animals despite presence of a neutralizing antibody response and reduced challenge virus replication in the lungs such studies have not yet been completed for sars-cov2in mice this immunopathology was considered a consequence of a dominant th2 type response to the vaccine antigens it was not seen after including adjuvants eg cpg in the vaccine or other vaccine formulations known to drive immune responses towards th1 the timing of challenge after vaccination may be critical it would be of major interest to explore the outcome following challenge at later timepoints when antibodies are significantly decayingone should be aware of the potential confounding effect of cell-culture excipients in the vaccine and challenge strain material it is known that impurities such as fetal calf serum in the preclinical vaccine preparation may induce eosinophil influx in any mouse model if the challenge strain also contains the same excipientsin these models characterization of the immune response to the candidate vaccine eg igg isotypes th2 markers may have some predictive valueother small animal models which can be infected by sars-cov-2 can be considered eg ferret hamster development of small animal models of severe disease will also inform studies of vaccine-enhanced disease
 
non-human primate models for assessment of vaccine-mediated enhanced disease
non-human primates nhp are of primary interest in view of their ace2 homology with hace2 preliminary studies indicate the possibility of inducing some covid-19 lung pathological features after infection without clinical signs in rhesus macaques african green monkeys may be more susceptible to covid-19 but the model suffers from some limitations eg access genetic polymorphismprevious studies with sars candidate vaccines have suggested a risk of enhanced pathology in nhps after viral challenge eosinophilic infiltrates were not prominent the mechanism is still incompletely defined but there is evidence for a role of non-neutralizing antibodies non- or incompletely neutralizing antibodies may contribute toothe formation of pathogenic immune complexes andofc-mediated viral capture by monocytesmacrophages that may favor excessive t-cell activation and inflammation
enhanced pathology was seen following passive transfer of igg from immunized nhps
 
general considerations on animal models
although existing animal models of covid-19 imperfectly reproduce the human disease they appear useful for assessing the risk of disease enhancement vaccine responses are closer to human responses in nhps than in mice therefore it is likely that data obtained from nhp studies are more significant however there is an urgent need to standardize the nhp model read-out of disease enhancement timing of challenge age and to include appropriate controls ie a vaccine that induces enhanced pathology and disease and a sufficient number of animals to be confident of findings in outbred species it is important to control for potential co-infection including with other coronaviruses in all non-spf modelspotential markers of safety in these animal models could includeothe relative levels of neutralizing vs non-neutralizing antibodiesoantibody affinityot-cell response profileoquantitative virology in the upper and lower respiratory tractocharacterization of lung histopathology with immunohistochemistry for viral antigen and immune cell markerspassive transfer in nhps of human antibodies generated during phase 1 trials followed by viral challenge could be considered to assess the risk of disease enhancementchallenge of immunized animals with a closely related heterologous cov strains may assess the risk of enhancement during future outbreaksin case of disease enhancement in-depth studies in animal models may give some indications on the mechanism of immunopathology they can inform human trial designers on the critical immunological risk markers to be monitored in phase 1 trialsbased on previous experience with sars and other viral diseases it may be useful to evaluate the risk of disease enhancement for covid-19 vaccines particularly those including whole virions or n protein in an established nhp model before advanced clinical development
 
during the vaccine design session the group of experts suggested that consideration should be given to the following
caution should be observed when developing vaccines to avoid inducing predominant th2 responses and non-neutralizing antibodiesvaccines inducing strong neutralizing antibodies predominant th1 responses and balanced cd4cd8 and polyfunctional t cell responses are less likely to induce immunopathologygiven what will be the unprecedented demand for an effective vaccine the use of adjuvants may be critical for sub-unit vaccines in providing increased immunogenicity breadth of response dose sparing duration of response potentially cross-protection against new cov strains and possibly minimize the risk of enhanced disease preference should be given to th1-driving adjuvants with an established safety profile in humansunderstanding of the role of cross-reacting antibodies from prior coronavirus infections may have on natural disease caused by sars-cov-2 or influence the risk of enhanced disease following vaccination may inform vaccine designdata are needed on whether antibody waning could increase the risk of enhanced disease on exposure to virus in the long term
 
it was the opinion of the experts that animal data to support clinical development could address
post-vaccination neutralizing antibody responses and t cell analysis to demonstrate a th1 responsepost-vaccination challenge data from nhps with careful evaluation for immunopathology and quantitative virology in the animalssmall animal data may also provide important supporting evidence of safety and hamster ferret and mouse models are likely to be available for developerswhere possible immunopathology experiments with a positive control eg formalin inactivated alum-adjuvanted sars-cov-1 or sars-cov-2 vaccine and a mock-immunized negative control will provide best guidance it was felt that it will be important to establish broadly accepted endpoints and scoring systems to allow comparison of various vaccine candidates who is working on this issuefor vaccine constructs likely to induce a predominant th2 response the group felt that animal studies should be considered before entering human phase 1 trials in more than one animal species including nhps where possible it was noted that the absence of a th2 response does not eliminate the risk of enhanced diseasefor vaccine constructs which are already known to induce neutralizing antibody and th1 responses it was the consensus of the group that while phase 1 studies are cautiously proceeding with careful review of safety data animal studies run in parallel could provide useful information for the further clinical developmentsuggestive data in animal models should not by default prevent clinical development of vaccine candidates potential risk should be thoroughly evaluated by developers and regulators on a vaccine product-specific basis

 
regarding phase 1 clinical trials it was the opinion of the experts that
since not all studies that have begun or are about to begin will prescreen to determine preimmunization serostatus of participants although this shall be determined retrospectively appropriate baseline blood specimens should be obtained and stored because the virus is spreading rapidly such specimens will allow assessment of the immune response in both seronegative and seropositive persons as both are likely to be vaccinatedlevel of neutralizing antibodies and determination of the relative ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies will be important to assess the potential risk of enhanced disease also detection of initial priming that includes cd8 t cells andor a cd4 th1 biased response is likely to mitigate the risk of disease enhancement determination of memory responses will be useful particularly if sars-cov-2 continues to circulateconsideration should be given to the use of post-vaccination sera from vaccinees which could be used for antibody transfer studies in animals to look for enhanced disease and for evidence of cross-protection against other coronavirusesmonitoring for enhanced disease in immunized participants may require longer follow-up than is usual in phase 1 trials but need not delay phase 2 trialsinvestigators on the call requested frequent updating with both preclinical and evolving clinical data that are being developed by the different academic and industrial developers to help in decision-making about the various vaccine clinical trials creation of a central information hub was encouraged for this purposeparticipants on the call expressed the need for standardization of protocols data collection forms critical assays including reagents and biobanking of samples from initial clinical trials to allow future re-assay once standards are agreed to and enable comparison of results across trials
 
concluding remarks
the group of experts considers that the demonstration of some disease enhancement with any candidate vaccine after viral challenge in animal models should not necessarily represent a no-go signal for deciding whether to progress into early trials in clinical development of a covid-19 vaccinecontinuous monitoring of this risk during clinical trials in an epidemic context will be neededeach observed effect should be discussed by the developers with their regulators who will ultimately define the actual requirements for clinical studies

zhongde wang jacob glanville jay hooper w  animal models recapitulating human covid-19 disease especially with severe disease are urgently needed to understand pathogenesis and evaluate candidate vaccines and therapeutics 20 here we develop novel severe disease animal models for covid-19 involving disruption of adaptive immunity in syrian hamsters cyclophosphamide cyp immunosuppressed or rag2 knockout ko hamsters were exposed to sars-cov-2 by the respiratory route both the cyptreated and rag2 ko hamsters developed clinical signs of disease that were more severe than in immunocompetent hamsters notably weight loss viral loads and fatality rag2 ko only 25 disease was prolonged in transiently immunosuppressed hamsters and uniformly lethal in rag2 ko hamsters we evaluated the protective efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and found that pretreatment even in immunosuppressed animals limited infection our results suggest that functional b andor t cells are not only important for the clearance of sars-cov-2 but also play an early role in protection from acute disease 30 an antibody targeting the spike protein of sars-cov-2 limits infection in immunosuppressed syrian hamster models 35   the ongoing pandemic has led to the search for animal models faithfully recapitulating salient features of human coronavirus disease covid-19 for pathogenesis studies and evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics 1  early reports indicated that syrian hamsters whose ace2 is highly homologous to its human ortholog were highly susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection but 5 did not develop severe disease 2 3 in 2008 administration of cyclophosphamide cyp an alkylating agent that suppresses b and t cell function was used to develop a severe disease model for sars-cov in syrian hamsters 4  we reasoned that a similar approach might allow the development of a severe disease model for sars-cov-2 moreover clinical findings of lymphopenia associated with covid-19 5 and its prominence in severe cases 6 7 suggested 10 an immunosuppressed animal model of covid-19 might more accurately model some aspects of human disease here we used cyp-treated and rag2 ko hamsters to investigate how transient disruption or ablation of the adaptive immune response affects sars-cov-2 infection in addition we used the immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hamster models to evaluate whether pre-exposure to virus through previous infection or neutralizing antibodies 15 were sufficient to limit or prevent disease wild-type hamsters are susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection and develop weight loss of approximately 10 6 days post-infection dpi following a 100000 plaque forming units pfu 20 intranasal challenge dose 2 we confirmed this using both a 10000 and 100000 pfu dose fig s1a  the maximum weight loss of each hamster was plotted for both a 10000 and 100000 pfu challenge dose demonstrating the high variability of wild-type hamsters in responses to virus infection with coefficients of variation of 57 and 48 respectively fig  s1b  these hamsters developed a robust neutralizing antibody responses as measured by plaque 25 reduction neutralization test prnt80 and virus genome was cleared 11 dpi as measured by pharyngeal swab real time rt-pcr fig s1cd  in our first experiment manipulating the adaptive immune response we immunosuppressed hamsters using cyp cyp-tx beginning -3 dpi suppression of lymphocytes was confirmed by hematology analysis just prior to challenge fig 1a  on day 0 groups of 10 hamsters were 30 exposed to 100 1000 or 10000 pfu of sars-cov-2 by the intranasal route disease progression was monitored by weight loss fig 1b and detection of viral rna in pharyngeal swab using rt-pcr fig 1c  weight loss was remarkably similar between all sars-cov-2 exposed groups regardless of dose with drastic weight loss beginning 6 dpi weight loss remained significant relative to starting weight through 35 dpi table s1  in contrast mock 35 pbs challenged hamsters treated with cyp steadily gained weight with a few exceptions fig  s1c  specifically one cage of four mock challenged hamsters showed evidence of weight loss 9-12 dpi fig s2  these same animals were the only mock challenged hamsters that were positive in the sars-cov-2 pharyngeal swab rt-pcr analysis starting 9 dpi fig 1c and fig  s1c  40 all of the sars-cov-2 challenged hamsters had detectable viral rna in pharyngeal swabs at the first time point assayed 3 dpi and remained consistent 10 3 -10 5 molecules of n2 per 100ng rna through the duration of cyp treatment fig 1c  after the last cyp treatment on 21 dpi most of the hamsters continued to lose weight and several hamsters began to exhibit signs of a wasting disease ie cachexia and extreme weight loss requiring euthanasia fig 1bd  then approximately 7 days after cessation of cyp the remaining hamsters started gaining weight and viral rna levels in pharyngeal swabs dropped below 10 3 molecules of n per 100 ng rna fig  1c  viral rna was detected in lung tissue from a subset of hamsters collected13 dpi the day of euthanasia of moribund animals 14-34 dpi or euthanasia 35 dpi end of study fig 1e  5 there was a statistically significant reduction in lung viral burden comparing 35 dpi to 13 dpi lung homogenates serum collected from surviving hamsters 35 dpi was assayed for neutralizing antibodies fig 1f  six of the ten infected hamsters that survived in the cyp immunosuppression experiment never developed detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies interestingly the four hamsters that did develop neutralizing antibodies after cyp treatment 10 cessation rebounded more rapidly as measured by weight gain fig s3  together these data indicate that cyp treatment allowed a persistent infection that was reversed in most animals when cyp treatment was stopped and the adaptive immune response allowed to recover a second experiment was conducted to determine if a 3-day interval of cyp treatment might lead to even more dramatic weight loss than the 4-day interval the last day of cyp treatment was 9 15 dpi rather than 21 dpi comparing the weights of ten hamsters treated with cyp at 3-day versus 4-day intervals revealed almost identical kinetics of weight loss fig s4a  the cessation of cyp treatment9 dpi allowed more rapid recovery from weight loss cyp treatment at 3-day intervals increased the amount of viral rna detected by pharyngeal swab rt-pcr by approximately 1 order of magnitude relative to the 4-day interval between 3 and 7 dpi fig   20   s4b  the apparent increase level of virus did not result in increased weight loss or lethality based on these findings we decided to use a 1000 pfu intranasal dose and cyp at a 4-day interval stopping 9 dpi for future antibody passive transfer experiments rag2 ko hamsters deficient in recombination activation gene 2 do not produce functional t or b cells 8 whereas cyp treatment allowed transient and partial immunosuppression the rag2 ko hamsters allowed us to evaluate the outcome of sars-cov-2 infection in the absence of functional lymphocytes rag2 ko hamsters were exposed to 10000 pfu sars-cov-2 by the intranasal route the rag2 ko hamsters showed significant weight loss starting 3 dpi  fig 2a  30 and the infection was uniformly lethal with a median day-to-death of 6 days p00025 log-rank test fig 2b  viral rna detected from pharyngeal swabs trended to be higher than the cyptreated hamsters but not statistically significant fig 2c  the 10000 pfu and pbs mock groups from the cyp experiment shown in fig 1 were included in fig 2a -c for comparison organs from the rag2 ko animals that succumbed or met euthanasia criteria were 35 homogenized and evaluated for viral rna by rt-pcr viral rna was present at the highest levels in the lung and trachea lower levels of viral rna were also detected in extrapulmonary organs including the heart liver spleen intestine brain and kidney fig 2d  fig 1 were euthanized 13 dpi lungs and nasal turbinates were formalin-fixed paraffin embedded and evaluated by histopathology and in situ hybridization ish fig 3 fig s5  lung tissue from necropsied animals demonstrated focally extensive areas consolidation of pulmonary parenchyma admixed with dense aggregates of inflammatory cells fig 3a  the bronchial lumina are multi-focally lined by hyperplastic respiratory epithelium fig 3b  and sars-cov-2 genomic rna was frequently detected in alveolar pneumocytes alveolar infiltrates and 5 bronchiolar epithelial cells by ish fig 3c  at 14 dpi immunocompetent hamsters infected with sars-cov-2 exhibited only mild congestion and inflammatory infiltration indicating recovery from viral challenge 2 supporting the hypothesis that cyp administration to disrupt adaptive immunity exacerbates and prolongs disease in hamsters lung tissue collected at the time of death of sars-cov-2-infected rag2 ko hamsters contain 10 areas of hemorrhage and inflammation expanding the interstitium and connective tissue surrounding bronchi and arteries fig 3d  as seen in the cyp-treated hamsters the bronchial lumina of rag2 ko hamsters is lined with multiple layers of infected epithelial and club cells containing infiltrates of lymphocytes presumably nonfunctional heterophils and macrophages  fig 3e gh there is hemorrhage within alveolar lumen and consolidation with septal 15 congestion also as observed in cyp-treated hamsters sars-cov-2 genomic rna and viral antigen were frequently detected in alveolar pneumocytes fig 3i  alveolar infiltrates and bronchiolar epithelial cells fig 3f  together these data indicate that the absence of functional b and t cells in rag2 ko hamsters allows increased pathology and lethality from sars-cov-2 infection 20 electron microscopy studies were performed on lung sections of sars-cov-2 infected cyptreated hamsters with varying lung viral loads fig 1  the lungs lack a typical morphology wherein distinct alveolar inter-alveolar septum with capillaries type i and type ii pneumocytes are clearly evident the animal with the least viral load 10 6 molecules of n2 per 100ng rna sars-cov-2 is reported to range in diameter from 50-160nm with surface spikes measuring approximately 20nm 9-13 the low and high viral load samples show compartmentalized 30 vacuoles with round virus-like structure and vesicles with irregular shaped structures resembling multi-vesicular bodies  fig 3j-l  the more electron dense vesicles are suggestive of mature virus particles whereas the less electron dense particles are likely immature virions in addition to cytoplasmic vacuoles these tissue show swollen rough endoplasmic reticulum rer fig 3l  swollen rer appears as a result of cellular stress andor increased viral protein synthesis 35 immuno-gold labeling is necessary to confirm the presence of virus particles tracheas from the same sars-cov-2 infected cyp-treated hamsters with varying lung viral loads were analyzed by electron microscopy these tracheas also exhibit disruption of the epithelial layer trachea from the animal with the lowest lung viral load 10 6 molecules of n2 per 100ng rna showed mostly intact ciliated cells on the surface fig 4a  these cells show nine previously infected immunocompetent hamsters from two separate experiments were retained for a re-challenge with sars-cov-2 our goal was to determine if prior infection elicited protective immunity to ensure that these hamsters had cleared infectious virus after the 5 initial challenge hamsters were treated with 3 doses of cyp and weights monitored for 14 days fig 5a  if the animals were persistently infected we predicted that hamsters would experience onset of disease as measured by rapid weight loss and positive pharyngeal swab rt-pcr following cyp administration no significant weight loss was detected and swabs were negative for viral rna fig 5a  all nine animals were positive for neutralizing antibodies prior to the 10 re-challenge fig 5b  the nine previously exposed hamsters and seven nave hamsters were challenged with 100000 pfu sars-cov-2 weights were monitored daily and pharyngeal swabs were collected every other day for viral rna rt-pcr control animals lost weight as predicted whereas the previously exposed animals were protected from significant weight loss pharyngeal swab rt-pcr indicated a statistically significant reduction in viral rna detected in 15 re-challenged animals compared to nave animals fig 5c table s3  in addition viral load in lung homogenates from animals euthanized at the end of the study indicated a statistically significant p00164 unpaired t test reduction in viral rna level in the re-challenged animals fig 5d  these data indicate that immunocompetent hamsters recovered from prior exposure to the sars-cov-2 does not result in persistent infection but instead elicits protective immunity 20 a human monoclonal antibody mab targeting the spike protein of sars-cov-2 was evaluated in a passive transfer experiment using immunosuppressed hamster thirty mgkg of centi-f1 mab ic50 391 ngml prnt801280 a control igg normal mab or pbs were 25 administered -1 dpi on day 0 the immunosuppressed animals were challenged with 1000 pfu sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibody levels in sera at the time of challenge were measured by prnt80 fig 6a  detectable levels ranging from 80 to 640 were found in the centi-f1 mab group disease progression was monitored by weight change fig 6b and pharyngeal swab rt-pcr fig 6c  hamsters administered the normal mab or pbs exhibited significant weight loss 30 starting 5 dpi and ultimately had group weights drop to 86 and 91 respectively table s4  hamsters treated with centi-f1 mab maintained over 100 of their day 0 weight to the conclusion of the experiment 13 dpi table s4  virus rna was detected in pharyngeal swabs in all groups but trending lower in centi-f1 mab-treated animals on day 11 p01038 unpaired t test  table s4  similarly lung tissue collected 13 dpi end of study indicate comparable levels 35 of viral rna detected fig 6d  but significantly reduced infectious virus in centi-f1 mabtreated animals p00002 unpaired t test fig 6e  these findings demonstrate that a sars-cov-2 mab can limit infection in immunosuppressed animals it has been postulated that both innate immune hyperactivity and adaptive immune dysfunction result in increased sars-cov-2 dissemination and drives severe disease 14  in order to develop a small animal model of severe disease evaluate the role of adaptive immunity and replicate the covid-19 lymphopenia observed in human disease we treated hamsters with cyp in this immunosuppressed model we observe more drastic weight loss high levels of virus in the lung and viral persistence that did not begin to resolve until cyp treatment was stopped fig 1  histopathologic findings in the lungs of cyp-treated hamsters also demonstrate the prolonged pathology and ongoing repair through hyperplastic changes of the bronchial epithelium and type 5 ii pneumocytes that were not observed in the sampled rag2 ko hamsters these data demonstrate the critical role b and t cells play in resolution of disease and describe an animal model for severe covid-19 disease that can be used for rigorous testing of medical countermeasures the recent development of immune function ko hamsters combined with syrian hamster 10 susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection allows investigation of the role of a specific immune functions in covid-19 pathogenesis and protection thus far stat2 ko hamsters have been used to demonstrate that type i interferon plays a role in restricting viral dissemination and promoting lung pathology in sars-cov-2 infected animals 15 herein we found unexpectedly that sars-cov-2 challenge resulted in a uniform lethality in the rag2 ko 15 hamsters it is interesting that onset of disease as measured by weight loss was more rapid by 3 days in the rag2 ko animals than immunocompetent or even transiently immunosuppressed hamsters receiving the same challenge dose this indicates that the absence of functional b cells andor t cells exacerbates pathogenesis at a very early stage within a day or two after exposure to virus the importance of t cells in viral clearance has been noted for other coronaviruses 20 sars-cov 16 and mers 17  in fact depletion of cd3 t cells correlates with severity and adverse outcomes 18  there have been anecdotal accounts suggesting that immunity generated from an initial sars-cov-2 infection in humans may not be protective against a subsequent infection recent studies using nonhuman primates indicated prior infection results in protective immunity 19 here we 25 show that the immune response from an initial sars-cov-2 infection including a robust neutralizing antibody response is protective against re-challenge we detected reduced levels of viral genome in pharyngeal swabs and lungs however despite circulating neutralizing antibody available at the time of challenge virus genome was still detected seven days after re-challenge viral genome in pharyngeal swabs on day 5 following re-challenge and in lung tissue on day 7 30 could indicate that asymptomatic reinfection is possible prolonged viral shedding has been observed in human covid-19 cases with detectable neutralizing antibody titers 20 alternatively the genome detected in the swabs could be input virus that is slowly being cleared from the respiratory system currently convalescent plasma is an option to treat severe cases of covid-19 21 another 35 antibody-based options include manufactured polyclonal or mabs that represent avenues to prevent or treat sars-cov-2 infections as a standardized product several groups have reported in vitro characterization of anti-sars-cov-2 neutralizing mabs and a number of antibodies have been shown to protect in small animal models including syrian hamsters 22 23  here pre-treatment with mab centi-f1 resulted in weight maintenance through the experiment 40 trending lower levels of viral genome detected in pharyngeal swabs and lung tissues and most importantly reduced levels of infectious virus detected in the lung the lack of reduced viral rna detected by rt-pcr in the passive transfer experiment of f01-mab treated animals highlights a potential confounding factor in determining the efficacy of mab treatment it is possible that the centi-f1 mab was not able to clear genomic rna but were able to prevent the shedding of infectious virus in addition to determining infectious viral loads by plaque assay rt-pcr to detect subgenomic rna indicative of a productive infection would help differentiate the persistence of input virus from productive infection our results expand on the earlier findings that the syrian hamster model is a suitable small animal model of covid-19 2 transient and reversible immunosuppression using cyp can be 5 used to increase the severity and duration of the disease state advantages of the cyp model are that the wild type hamsters are readily available and would produce a normal immune response to vaccination one disadvantage is that disruption of lymphocytes could confound the evaluation of therapeutics that target components of the immune response or vaccines that require rapid mobilization of the adaptive response for evaluation of those types of medical countermeasures the wild type hamster would be preferred this is the first report that sars-cov-2 is lethal in rag2 ko hamsters for practical purposes uniformly lethal models allow fewer numbers of animals to detect significant levels of protection facilitating rapid screening of candidate therapeutics rag2 ko hamsters would not be suitable for the use in active vaccine studies but could be used for antibody passive transfer studies for example passive transfer of 15 immune serum from nonhuman primate or human vaccine studies could be an approach to investigate mechanisms of protection overall our hamster sars-cov-2 models with severe diseases clinically relevant to those of covid-19 patients provide a platform for

pathogenic coronavirus cov infections are wellestablished sources of previous epidemics in humans ie severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sarscov and middle east respiratory syndrome cov merscov the novel cov named sarscov2 which shares a highly homological sequence with sarscov is responsible for the current covid19 outbreak with more than 2 million patients diagnosed and over 146 000 deaths which exceeds by far the total of sars and mers in 2002 and 2012 respectively 1 2 3 despite the short duration of the current pandemic outbreak several neurological and neuroradiological phenotypes have been reported 4 5 requiring urgent investigation into the mechanisms and etiology underlying the interplay between sarscov2 and the central nervous system cns a translational neuroscience approach is mandatory to explore the possible cns involvement in cov infections accelerate scientific knowledge transfer to the clinical frontline and test new diseaseoriented treatments indeed both clinical features of the previous cov epidemics sars and mers and lessons from animal models used in the study of sars and mers constitute valuable tools to understand the viral pathogenesis in the host and to characterize mechanisms of viral access and dissemination in the cns meanwhile several laboratories are rushing to study sarscov2 in a number of different animals including primates mice rats hamsters and ferrets 6 here we will provide a neurological perspective by analysing the main features of these models and point out relevant similarities and specificities in comparison to sarscov2 a comprehensive systematic search of medline scopus web of science and httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports was performed in 2002 the outbreak of sars in guangdong province china led to the discovery of sarscov a highly pathogenic cov as the causative pathogen of the epidemic 7 although the virus is primarily a respiratory pathogen there are reports of neurological manifestations such as epileptic seizures and encephalitis that may suggest a cns involvement of the infection 8 9 table 1 complementing these reports postmortem neuropathological studies have detected the sarscov n protein and rna polymerase gene fragment in neurons of infected patients and pathological changes such as brain tissue edema and vasculitis of cerebral veins 10 compelling evidence demonstrates that sarscov attaches to the cell membrane by binding to human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 hace2 now also known to be the sarscov2 functional receptor 11 human tissue studies have shown an abundant presence of these receptors not only in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine but also in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied including the brain 12 based on a transgenic mouse expressing hace2 it was possible to show that angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 is also expressed at neuronal level namely in the cytoplasm of cell bodies 13 distinctive properties in the structure of mouse ace2 as compared with hace2 proteins significantly reduce the virus tropism for mouse tissues hence in order to overcome this speciesrelated difference a transgenic model has been generated in which a vector carrying a hace2coding sequence was introduced in wildtype mice under control of the human cytokeratin 18 k18 promoter 14 notably when k18hace2 transgenic mice were infected with sarscov the infection would start in the respiratory epithelium and rapidly spread to the alveoli more importantly neuroinvasive routes were later explored using the same model by monitoring the kinetic profile of viral antigen 15 strikingly the authors showed that the viral spread started in the olfactory bulb and progressively invaded subcortical and cortical regions such a transneuronal hypothesis could not apply for other infected regions such as those brainstem nuclei that are not directly connected to the olfactory bulb the authors raise the possibility that once the virus is established in the brain it might spread along specific neurotransmitter pathways or via nonneuronal routes blood or virchowrobin spaces 15 overall their results showed that in this model sarscov primarily entered the brain via the olfactory nerve alternatively other authors theorize that cov can primarily use a hematogenous route to penetrate the cns using dendritic or white blood cells as reservoirs 16 this presumption is based on pathological studies that have shown that monocytes and macrophages can be infected by sarscov 17 and on cellline studies that revealed that dendritic cells regulators of immune responses can be infected and impaired by this virus 18 table 1 multiple animal models have been explored in the context of sars including nonhuman primates hamsters ferrets and mice table 2 a comprehensive descriptive review of all suitable models is beyond the scope of this review and we refer the reader to a number of excellent reviews 19 20 21 it can be inferred that there is no single ideal animal model for sars although the evidence collected so far has significantly contributed to advancing the field in particular it is well established that models range from those in which only virus replication is observed young balbc b6 mice to those in which replication is accompanied by minimal signs and histopathology such as nonhuman primates ferrets and hamsters 19 curiously old immunodeficient balbc mice exhibit a clinical syndrome supporting age as a risk factor for more severe clinical phenotypes 19 transgenic k18hace2 mice infected with sarscov develop a severe pulmonary phenotype starting in the respiratory epithelium with rapid alveolar dysfunction 14 in this model there is a massive infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes in the lungs promoting a release of proinflammatory cytokines not only at pulmonary level but also in the brain in a relatively short time frame within 5 days k18hace2 mice develop a severe phenotype that includes a lethargiclike state suggesting cns involvement in followup studies in the same mouse strain k18hace2 15 the authors demonstrated an extensive involvement of the transgenic mouse brain sarscov produced a widespread infection involving vital brainstem nuclei such as dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nucleus tractus solitarii and area postrema this model also raised questions as to the cause of neuronal destruction and death in these animals 15 as there was no pathological evidence of inflammation the authors considered the possibility of apoptosis as the cause of neuronal death although this was not confirmed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase tdt dutp nickend labeling tunelpositive cells were not detected it was proposed that a dysregulated cytokine response could be the cause of death in these animals at day 4 postinfection infected k18hace2 mice had an upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin il1 tumor necrosis factor alpha and il6 the authors also propose a possible direct involvement of the dorsal vagal complex a vital region of the brain that plays an important role in orchestrating cardiorespiratory function in fact animals intracranially inoculated with lowdose virus exhibited limited viral spreading but succumbed rapidly 15 overall these data show the relevance of the transgenic approach in converting the mouse response to infection from mild to severe leading to cns involvement additional key findings emerging from these different sars models include i the fundamental role of innate immunity in the response to sarscov infection ii the different severity observed in young versus old balbc mice underlies the age dependency in the clinical manifestations and iii different kinetics of viral infection faster clearance in animals 22 23 currently merscov is still a relevant threat for populations in the middle east with a high lethality close to 35 2 patients exhibit predominantly pulmonary clinical involvement in contrast to fewer patients presenting neurological manifestations such as coma ataxia focal motor deficits and peripheral nerve symptoms 24 25 unfortunately there are no published data regarding human neuropathological findings table 1 the merscov exvivo models supported the clinical tropism for the pulmonary tract by showing that the virus can replicate in human lung cultures in bronchial bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells 26 this cell line susceptibility study also revealed that although presenting a lower viral expression and no cytopathic effects mers can infect human neuronal lines dipeptidyl peptidase4 dpp4 also known as cd26 was identified as a functional receptor for merscov dpp4 is generally expressed in human bronchiolar epithelial cells and bronchial lung tissue 27 it can also be found in the intravascular portion of vascular endothelial cells and in the cerebrospinal fluid 28 after identification of dpp4 as a functional receptor which is expressed in the airway epithelia of rodents it was expected that rodents would have been vulnerable to infection this turned out to be wrong as the human binding domain differs from that of rodents 29 this limitation was overcome by developing mice expressing human dpp4 that exhibited high susceptibility to infection and displayed the features of human disease 30 including a lethargic state and showing high mortality and extrapulmonary involvement table 2 the authors detected a severe lung infection but brain invasion was not seen until day 4 of infection suggesting substantially different kinetics of merscov infection in the lung and brain 30 a different animal model using human dpp4 transgenic mice studied the differences in viral replication in animals infected by a clinical aerosol transmission simulator compared with intranasal instillationinoculated mice 31 they found that the disease onset lung lesion and viral replication progression were slower in the merscov aerosolinfected mice than in the merscov instillationinoculated mice furthermore after aerosol infection they detected high viral loads after 39 days in the lungs versus 79 days in the brain again although both lungs and brain are infected the timing is different with a later infection of the brain 31 such different kinetics could suggest a hematogenous route of infection indeed neuroinvasive routes were not explored in either of these models in addition similarly to sarscov merscov has been shown to replicate in human dendritic cells and macrophages which would support the hematogenous hypothesis 32 a number of models have been developed and discussed in detailed review articles 33 34 table 2 in a nonhuman primate model of mers de wit and colleagues inoculated rhesus macaques with merscov which primarily affected the epithelium of the lower respiratory tract giving rise to a mildtomoderate interstitial pneumonia 35 this model was able to replicate virus shedding and replication in tissues as well as gene expression and cytokine and chemokine profiles however despite the mild clinical syndrome no neurological signs and symptoms were reported thus the selflimiting nature of merscov infection as transient patterns at various levels of the model suggests that this model does not fully resemble the lethal infection observed in humans 35 it is of note that when macaques were immunocompromised by immunosuppressive agents the merscov replicated to significantly higher titers and disseminated in other organs cns not examined surprisingly histopathological alterations were reduced in the immunosuppressed animals 36 together these data suggest a prominent role of the host response in the manifestation of the disease the macaque model allowed the testing of a number of potential drugs as novel therapeutics remdesivir an antiviral agent used also for covid19 was able to preventtreat the histological and radiological signatures of the disease 37 in studies using transgenic mice expressing human dpp4 it was possible to induce features of human disease in the animals 30 from the studied cells pneumocytes brain microglia astrocytes and neuronal cells all presented high titers of virus with regard to pathology whereas infected mice presented an extensive pulmonary inflammatory infiltrate the only findings in the brain were a mild perivascular cuffing 30 however in a different study using human dpp4 transgenic mice a few days after the appearance of pulmonary lesions pathological changes were documented in the brain with dilatation and congestion of the cerebral vessels and few areas of cellular necrosis in the cerebral cortex hippocampus and thalamus 31 as in sarscov2 merscov infection was also shown to induce a profound acute inflammatory response within the lungs and brain of hcd26 tg mice with upregulation of multiple genes related to the inflammatory response 30 covid19 is the most recent and dramatic pandemic caused by sarscov2 registered lethality varies between european countries ranging from 15 in germany to over 10 in italy 1 as in sars and mers pulmonary clinical involvement is most prominent however more recently neurological phenotypes involving central and peripheral nervous system have emerged and are being increasingly recognized ie anosmia ageusia necrohemorrhagic encephalitis and guillainbarr syndrome 4 5 38 so far there are no published human neuropathological findings table 1 the sarscov2 ultrastructure was recently characterized by highresolution cryoelectron microscopy 39 remarkably cov spike glycoprotein by which the virus binds the cell membrane binds ace2 with a higher affinity compared with sarscov in addition most of the available antibodies to sarscov targeting acebinding domain were unable to bind the sarscov2 spike protein indicating that binding sites differ between sarscov and sarscov2 such a finding indicates the urgent need for generating specific antibodies for sarscov2 binding domain but might also explain the distinct pathogenic properties of sarscov2 40 in addition to ace2 receptor sarscov2 uses the serine protease type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 for spike protein priming 41 42 very recently in a preliminary report brann et  al took advantage of bulk mouse whole olfactory mucosa wom rna sequence data derived from macaque marmoset and human and found in both mouse and human datasets that olfactory sensory neurons do not express two key genes involved in cov2 entry ie ace2 and tmprss2 43 in contrast olfactory epithelial support cells and stem cells express both of these genes as do cells in the nasal respiratory epithelium taken together these findings suggest possible mechanisms through which cov2 infection could lead to anosmia or other forms of olfactory dysfunction moreover these findings may question the olfactory bulb as an entry route for covs into the cns 43 to our knowledge no study has evaluated so far any type of pathway targeted at the cns or peripheral structures several laboratories worldwide are accelerating attempts to develop a suitable animal model for covid19 experimental infection with sarscov2 in these models provides basic information to address a number of fundamental questions regarding its pathogenicity the interaction with the different hosts and hopefully establishing the criteria for prevention and care in line with observations in sars models nonhuman primates and wildtype mice infected with sarscov2 exhibit a relatively mild clinical disease in spite of the evidence that quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtqpcr revealed a massive infection of the respiratory tract 44 45 table 2 rhesus macaques infected with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from an affected patient developed a histopathologically confirmed interstitial pneumonia associated with a widespread presence of sarscov2 in the respiratory tract clinical signs were mild and no viral rna was detectable by means of rtqpcr in the blood of the primates during the whole course of infection 14 days 44 these findings demonstrate the causal relationship between sarscov2 and interstitial pneumonia reminiscent of covid19 moreover and consistent with observations in sars models bao et  al 45 used the hace2 transgenic mice and infected them with sarscov2 inducing interstitial pneumonia with typical histopathological elements and accordingly viral antigens were found in airway epithelia these lines of experimental evidence are relevant as they demonstrate the causal relationship between sarscov2 and pulmonary involvement but unlike in sars models nervous system involvement was not documented in these experiments however it is unclear if brain tissue was systematically assessed and the most susceptible brain regions explored for direct or indirect viral presence overall the pathogenicity of sarscov2 is lower as compared with sarscov in mice indeed as discussed above hace2 transgenic mice infected with sarscov exhibited widespread organ damage whereas sarscov2 at least in this model was confined to lungs indicating a differential pathogenicity 45 these studies reveal important commonalities between sarscov2 and sarscov infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention in fact very recently a tmprss2 inhibitor approved for clinical use camostat mesylate was tested and blocked sarscov2 entry into lung cells 42 finally the same authors were able to show that the sera from convalescent patients with sars crossneutralized sars2spikedriven entry 42 if the same effect occurred in preclinical models then we would be closer to both a preventive and a diseaseoriented treatment 
major routes of cns infection i spread via olfactory bulb andor ii synapseconnected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways andor iii hematogenic via brain endothelial ace2 receptorsmajor pathogenic pathways for cns involvement i direct viral pathogenicity andor ii immunemediated pathogenicity targeting brain tissue andor iii inflammatory involvement of brain blood vessels andor iv intravascular coagulation secondary to the systemic inflammatory response as a mayor cause of thrombosis hemorrhage and strokehost individual susceptibility factors that underlie the variable severity of the disease in human patients however a relevant issue is also represented by gender the clinical observation of a specific involvement of males might suggest a specific protective estrogenic effect
 unravelling these points could clarify if cns contributes to respiratory failure in patients with covid19 15 46 and may provide a rationale to preventive and therapeutic strategies for major neurological events such as stroke encephalitis or other reported complications established exvivo and animal models of cov infection may help to dissect pathogenicity infective routes and nervous system targets of covs if we manage to mimic the pathological hallmarks of covid19 we may have the tools to test treatment efficacy and evaluate the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics among limitations the following emerge as of primary importance
neurological subtle clinical phenotypes are not easily reproducible in animal modelsneurological severe phenotypes are dependent on using specific transgenic approaches to enhance virulence which limit direct translation to humansseverity of the clinical features does not always parallel either the viral replication level or the histopathological findings hinting at indirect disease mechanisms such as inflammation and prothrombotic states that have not been attained in the present modelsinnate animal characteristics seem to influence viral infection kinetics leading to faster virus clearance
 the ongoing outbreak of sarscov2 confirms that human covs are primarily respiratory pathogens and koch postulates have already been fulfilled in this regard 45 previous reports suggest that sarscov and merscov can occasionally cause clinically relevant cns infections in fact animal models suggest invasiveness of these viruses through the cns either via the olfactory bulb or through blood dissemination of infected and activated monocytes passing through a permeable bloodbrain barrier as a consequence of the systemic inflammatory response with regard to the pathogenesis of immunemediated cns pathology data derive broadly from mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strains a betacov genetically related to human covoc43 47 briefly three mechanisms of immunemediated cns lesions can be recognized i an excessive host response to the infection can occur resulting in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that causes a multiple organ dysfunction including cns the main pathogenic mechanism in this case includes tissue dysoxia due to intravascular coagulation and dysfunction of the microcirculation homeostasis ii direct viral infection of immune cells including macrophages microglia and astrocytes in the cns may activate glial cells that locally produce proinflammatory cytokines including il6 tumor necrosis factor alpha il1 and il12 48 moreover activated immune cells may contribute to tissue damage by producing toxic agents recruiting and activating further immune cells and inducing apoptosis immunemediated events either through tcells or by means of other cytokine and chemokine pathways may also eventually lead to demyelination iii an autoimmune reaction is generated by an adaptive immune response directed against host epitopes or proteins either misrecognized by pathogendirected antibodies or expressed by damaged tissues and previously cryptic to the adaptive immune system 49 50 in order to speed up clinically useful discoveries it would be desirable to follow some indications such as i to build a systematic consecutive prospective registry including epidemiological data in patients with covid19 with attention to neurological manifestation to fully understand if sarscov2 infections can cause cns involvement and to what extent ii to measure sarscov2 rna in the cerebrospinal fluid of symptomatic vs asymptomatic patients and iii to perform autoptic investigations of patients with covid19 in order to find and characterize virus distribution across tissues cerebral blood vessels endothelia glia and neurons and neuropathological consequences such as antibodybased neuroinflammatory responses in gray and white matter vasculitis neuroglial death or apoptosis and ischaemic or hemorrhagic events taking into account the fact that other covs are prone to infecting neurons in animal models as well as in humans 16 50 we must keep an open mind regarding medium to longterm sequelae and consequences of the acute infection therefore despite immunemediated control of acute infection being attained hostmediated immune regulatory mechanisms may fail to clear the virus potentially leading to chronic infections and hence impact chronic neurological diseases such as parkinsons disease and multiple sclerosis 51 as well as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 52 this calls for longterm patient followup in the clinics and also exploring the effect of sarscov2 in mouse models of neurodegenerative disorders to anticipate the occurrence of chronic sarscov2 cns infection the authors declare no financial or other conflicts of interest that relate to the research covered in this article  vaccines for sars-cov-2 lessons from other coronavirus strains eriko padron-regalado   

 coronaviruses are a group of viruses that belong to the family coronaviridae 1 2 these are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry their genome size is relatively large for rna viruses between 27 and 34 kb 3 coronaviruses infect mammals and birds causing varied symptoms such as respiratory tract disease and diarrhea in humans coronavirus infections have been shown to be potentially lethal this is the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronaviruses in 20022003 the world experienced what would become the first of a series of lethal coronavirus infections the disease denominated severe acute respiratory syndrome sars would be characterized by high fever eventually developing into shortness of breath and pneumonia 4 originating in southern china the disease later would cause 8096 cases resulting in 774 deaths in 26 countries 5 despite efforts from the scientific community no vaccine became commercially available and sars cases ceased to be reported from 2004 4 in september 2012 the world experienced the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus originated in saudi arabia the infectious disease is characterized by mild respiratory symptoms but these could develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome and death 6 the disease has affected 27 countries resulting in 2494 cases and 858 deaths 7 mers cases are still being reported but no major outbreak has been declared since 2015 8 as in the case of sars no commercial vaccine is available for mers reasons for the lack of commercial and effective vaccines for sars and mers are varied in the case of mers it is likely that the vaccine development was delayed because of the scarcity of suitable and cost-effective small animal models during pre-clinical experimentation in addition it is probable that a vaccine has not been delivered because of the low interest in investing in a vaccine for a disease that has produced relatively low and geographically centralized cases compared with other more global and persistent infectious diseases such as influenza hiv and tuberculosis this last factor might have also contributed to the lack of a vaccine for sars in the sense that it was considered pointless to continue investing in a vaccine for a disease whose cases ceased to be reported in 2004 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a current pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the first cases were reported from wuhan china in december 2019 9 10 according to the world health organization who the disease has been reported in 213 countries and territories as of april 11 2020 with evidence of ongoing local transmission 11 according to the same organization there are 1669595 confirmed cases and 106138 deaths associated with the disease symptoms of covid-19 are mild and include fever cough and shortness of breath nevertheless the disease might progress into severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure predominantly in elders and people with other underlying diseases 9 12 although no vaccines are commercially available for sars and mers past and current vaccine development efforts against these diseases might be of high value for the development of an effective vaccine for covid-19 the present review aims to describe these efforts furthermore we describe the possible implications of creating an effective vaccine against covid-19 taking as a starting point results obtained from other clinically relevant coronavirus strains we focused our review on active immunization approaches as this offers the possibility of a longer-term prevention for these diseases this article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors after the sars epidemic in 20022003 several laboratories around the world started to conduct vaccine development studies for preventing the disease the majority of the subunit vaccines vaccines based on a specific protein constituting the virus 13 targeted the spike s glycoprotein of the virus sars-cov uses this glycoprotein to bind and enter the host cells 14 therefore a vaccine that induces strong immune responses against this protein will have a significant effect on the deterrence of virus entry to the host cells during natural infection vaccines based on a live-attenuated or inactivated virus recombinant viral vectors dna virus-like particles vlps and soluble proteins were studied mainly in pre-clinical studies live-attenuated and inactivated viruses are based on the use of the whole sars-cov as a vaccine the virus has been rendered non-replicating and infectivity has been greatly reduced by means of deleting components of the virus genome or by using physical or chemical methods 15 in the case of recombinant viral vectors viruses different from the sars-cov that are capable of host cell infection have been genetically engineered to express components of the sars-cov 16 vlps are non-infectious multiprotein structures formed from viral proteins that self-assemble into virus-like structures 17 table 1 summarizes these vaccines and the outcome from pre-clinical and clinical studies to our knowledge only vaccines based on an inactivated sars virus dna and soluble proteins based on the sars s glycoprotein reached a clinical stage phase i 1820 it is desired in the field of vaccine development to know for certain if a vaccine can provide protection from virus infection and clinical signs this is usually performed by exposing challenging vaccinated individuals and animal models to the virus in question due to the virulence of the sars coronavirus challenge studies in humans were not performed therefore the protective efficacy of the vaccines was not assessed several vaccines have been developed for mers coronavirus since its emergence in 2012 as in the case of the sars vaccines most of the subunit vaccines for mers are based on the s glycoprotein vaccines based on inactivated and live attenuated viruses recombinant viral vectors nanoparticles conglomerate of antigenic proteins of nano size 57 dna and soluble proteins have been developed and tested predominantly in animal models fig 1 table 2 to our knowledge only a dna-based vaccine has already been tested in clinical trials phase i 58 with other vaccines such as mva modified vaccinia virus ankara and adenoviruses being currently under study at that clinical stage 59 60 vaccines for covid-19 are in pre-clinical development and no clinical stage has been completed because of the recent emergence of the disease as of april 13 2020 several entities from the globe have declared their intentions to develop a vaccine for covid-19 according to the who 41 candidate vaccines are being developed for covid-19 as of march 13 2020 93 information about the nature of these vaccines under development is publicly scarce table 3 summarizes these current development efforts with information supplemented from other public sources as of march 13 2020 only one vaccine has started clinical trials phase i this vaccine is being developed by moderna usa and it uses an mrna-based vaccine expressing the sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein 94 the development of effective vaccines for sars and mers was slowed down by the lack of suitable animal models for testing these vaccines even though animal models develop immunologic responses to sars and mers coronaviruses these animals show limited viral replication and clinical manifestations of disease fever cough runny nose shortness of breath viremia pneumonia usually not leading to death 95 this has produced certain limitations for evaluating protection conferred by the vaccines several studies addressed the issue of the lack of a suitable animal model by using transgenic animal models that rendered these animals more permissive to coronavirus infection by these means the animal models allowed systemic virus replication and the analysis of more severe and clinically relevant symptoms of the sars and mers diseases 31 43 68 69 76 96 for example transgenic mice were created to express the human cell receptor of sars-cov human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 this allowed the enhancement of infection sensitivity and the evaluation of protection from lethal doses of the virus 31 other approaches involved the use of mouse-adapted coronavirus strains that could replicate and induce health conditions that resemble human infection eg severe pneumonia viremia leading to death 3032 47 transgenic mouse models for sars and mers are now commercially available non-human primates have also been used for testing protection in coronavirus vaccination in the case of mers rhesus macaques allow virus replication but they do not seem to develop severe clinical symptoms increased respiratory rate fever cough 97 98 common marmosets have been shown to display severe symptoms of disease leading to death 99 100 but information about their use in active vaccination experiments is scarce in the case of sars the virus shows varied lung pathologies and limited clinical symptoms in cynomolgus macaques and african green monkeys 101 102 this symptomatology although limited has allowed analyzing the conferring of protection from vaccine candidates it is generally accepted that neutralizing antibodies against the sars and mers s glycoproteins play a predominant role in the protection against these coronaviruses 103 104 neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that bind and neutralize virus infection of host cells 105 vaccinated animals and passive immunization approaches focusing on the mers and sars s glycoproteins induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies that correlated with protection 39 43 45 49 53 106 107 nevertheless it is still in doubt whether adaptive t cell responses another arm of the immune system can also play a role in conferring protection with few studies addressing this issue as an example a group of researchers demonstrated that specific cd4 and cd8 t cell peptides against sars-cov could be exploited to provide protection in mice 37 108 109 another study pointed out that the protection against sars-cov in mice induced by a dna vaccine was due only to antibody responses depletion of cd4cd8 t cells and adoptive t cell transfer did not have an effect on protection 45 in mers vaccination efficacy in non-human primates has been correlated to the induction of cd8 t cell responses in addition to neutralizing antibodies when using dna-based vaccines 78 it is then likely that protection induced by vaccination might be dependent on different factors such as the selected vaccination platform antigens animal models and routes of vaccination few animal experiments have addressed the question of whether a certain vaccination regimen could induce long-term protection in the case of sars viral vectors and protein-based vaccines employing the s glycoprotein have shown a certain level of protection from infection in at least 75 of mice after 412 months of vaccination 34 35 49 in the case of mers protein-based vaccines and a combination of dna and protein-based vaccines have been shown to induce a certain level of long-term protection in mice and macaques 78 79 in general these studies focus on the induction of persistent neutralizing antibodies during vaccination while the contribution of t-cell responses is not frequently addressed exposure to sars and mers coronaviruses can also shed light on the possible mechanisms of protection in humans rapid and strong neutralizing antibody responses are highly correlated to the severity of the disease and the recovery of the patient nevertheless t cell responses might also play a role in the elimination of the virus during infection therefore also likely supporting the recovery of the patient 110114 from these studies the induction of both arms of the immune response is likely necessary for the effective elimination of the virus and recovery from the disease in vaccine development it is ideal that a vaccine provides long-term protection whether long-term protection can be achieved by means of vaccination or exposure to coronaviruses is under debate and more information is needed in this regard for sars-cov memory t cells but not b cells could be detected 6 years after infection in human survivors 115 nevertheless a certain level of neutralizing antibodies can be tracked until 24 months after infection opening the possibility of a certain level of protection during this time frame due to this humoral response 116 in the case of mers little is known about the generation of memory b cells but neutralizing antibodies are known to persist for 34 months 117 in the case of memory t cells cd4 and cd8 t cell responses have been detected 24 months after infection 114 other human coronaviruses can offer some clues about the induction of long-term protection in the cases of human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 these respiratory viruses do not cause long-lived protection as challenge experiments suggest even when antibody responses are detected in the long run 118 119 studies about the safety of vaccines against sars and mers are relatively scarce there is a concern about the induction of antigen-dependent enhancement ade and other adverse effects derived from vaccination or natural re-exposure ade is a phenomenon that occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies against proteins of a virus enhance virus entry to host cells also enhancing virus infectivity 120 ade has been already observed in cats vaccinated against a species-specific coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus 121 in the case of sars antibody-dependent enhancement and other adverse effects induced by vaccination in animal models have raised some concern it has been found that certain vaccine platforms expressing the sars s glycoprotein or using a whole inactivated virus induced lung immunopathology and hepatitis after challenge in some animal models 23 29 38 40 furthermore mers coronavirus vaccination has been shown to induce pulmonary infiltration after challenge in mice when using an inactivated mers-cov vaccine 66 of note some sars-cov-infected animal models are not protected from mers-cov and vice versa and they might develop adverse effects after secondary infection 96 122 other studies concerning passive antibody transfer in mice and non-human primate experimentation have not found evidence of ade or pathologic effects 22 26 33 39 55 123 124 the induction of ade using the s glycoprotein has been tackled by using truncated versions of the same protein it is believed that the use of the receptor-binding domain rbd or the s1 subunit of the s glycoprotein can lead to the induction of neutralizing antibodies while avoiding ade the idea is to focus the induction of antibodies to relevant s regions for efficient virus neutralization and by doing so to avoid the induction of potential non-neutralizing antibodies targeting other regions of the s protein even though there seems to be little direct evidence proving this idea vaccines based on these regions have already been tested allowing the induction of high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a certain level of protection in small animals and non-human primates 49 50 56 78 the use of adjuvants has also been considered for avoiding the potential undesired effects of coronavirus vaccination adjuvants are substances that potentiate and modify the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of the vaccines 125 a group of researchers found that by using a chemical adjuvant a delta inulin-based polysaccharide lung immunopathology previously observed in mice after sars challenge experiments were no longer observed 126 it was hypothesized that the adjuvant helped to avoid an exacerbated th2-polarized response after challenge causative of the adverse effects this is a case where an adjuvant not only enhanced vaccine-induced protection but also helped to minimize adverse effects due to coronavirus vaccination experiments directly comparing vaccine platforms and approaches for coronaviruses are scarce a group of scientists discovered that at a certain dose dna and mva-based vaccines encoding the s glycoprotein of mers develop similar levels of neutralizing antibodies 106 in another study vaccines based on heterologous prime-boost vaccination dna followed by protein-based vaccination induced higher neutralizing antibody titers and protection than homologous prime-boost vaccination approaches this is in mice and non-human primates 127 nevertheless a different number of immunizations were performed using different subunits of the s glycoprotein therefore it is difficult to determine whether a given vaccine platform would be more immunogenic and protective than others solely on terms of the vaccine platform used this information could potentially lead to the selection of ideal vaccine platforms for coronaviruses although inactivated viruses dna and viral vector-based vaccines have been tested for sars and mers coronavirus in clinical trials other vaccine platforms are yet to be tested an mrna-based vaccine a relatively recent technology is being tested for covid-19 in phase i clinical trials 128 with other companies starting clinical trials soon as of april 11 of the year of this publication 129 due to the relatively new emergence of such vaccine platforms their performance with coronavirus diseases is still to be known different routes of vaccination could also help in the development of effective vaccines for coronaviruses considering that sars and mers-cov are respiratory viruses inducing memory responses in the respiratory tract would be advantageous a group of researchers has found that inducing cellular and antibody responses in the respiratory tract by means of intranasal vaccination might induce higher protection levels in mice 37 43 even though targeting the spike glycoprotein in vaccine development could be ideal for inducing neutralizing antibodies the selection of other antigens might also offer some advantages for example the nucleocapsid n protein is more conserved between sars and mers coronavirus strains 130 in addition the n protein induces long-lived memory t-cells in humans 131 peptides derived from this protein have been shown to induce cross-protection against sars and mers in mouse experiments 37 therefore the n protein could serve as a potentially viable alternative to provide cross-protective and long-term t-cell immunity against coronaviruses the vaccine development efforts for coronavirus strains such as sars and mers can help to direct the vaccine development efforts for covid-19 the development of highly effective and safe vaccines for covid-19 should consider aspects such as the possibility of ade and other adverse effects previously observed with sars and mers even though these features have only been seen in some animal models and vaccination regimens the possibility is still there to be considered for covid-19 in addition these vaccine development efforts should address the possibility of the short-term immunogenicity derived from neutralizing antibodies as also previously observed for sars and mers-cov after natural infection the possibility of exploiting t cell responses for coronavirus vaccination should also be considered along with b cell responses these responses have been shown to be persistent and protective in animal models furthermore there is evidence of long-term persistence in humans strategies such as adjuvantation tailoring of the s glycoprotein different routes of vaccination and the use of unexplored vaccine platforms for enhancing immunogenicity and preventing potential undesired effects should also be considered it is worth mentioning that employing the n protein of the coronavirus for vaccination could have several benefits as previously mentioned there is the potential of providing long-term cross-protection when employing this antigen of note the evidence of short-term immunogenicity and protection in coronavirus-exposed individuals does not mean that an effective vaccine is not possible vaccines for other now eradicated diseases that lack naturally acquired immunity prove this point eg smallpox the emergence of covid-19 should also serve for elevating our comprehension and expertise in the abatement of pathogenic microorganisms of global health importance  twenty-five years of progress in understanding major infectious diseases of dairy cattle george poppensiek c robert kahrs f   in the past 25 yr there have been major contributions to knowledge about infectious processes and immune responses in dairy cattle the most troublesome of which exclusive of mastitis which is given special attention elsewhere in this series of anniversary manuscripts appear to be those afflicting mucous membranes of the respiratory alimentary and genital tracts many of them manifest similar signs of illness so that differential diagnosis is difficult many are caused by viruses against which therapeutic agents are ineffective and against which immunoglobulin is not always available at the site of attack despite these deficiencies unfolding knowledge about molecular characteristics of viruses and immune systems has clairified much of the mystery about infectious diseases and body responses to invading microorganisms this paper deals with selected infectious diseases that have tested the cutting edge of scientific inquiry during the past quarter century they are arranged alphabetically to avoid illusion that one is more important than another related diseases are introduced within the discussion of the major title omissions may concern readers who may feel that certain diseases have been overlooked those included were compiled after querying colleagues in the united states and requesting that they assign priority ratings to diseases they judged of major importance represented here then are those regarded as being contemporary problems with advanced but incomplete knowledge in the past quarter century bluetongue virus has emerged as a ubiquitous infectious agent of major importance in international commerce of the cattle industry and in commercial distribution of bovine semen bluetongue is a noncontagious infectious viral disease of ruminants especially sheep but to less extent goats and cattle the virus is transmitted by insect vectors particularly gnats of the culicoides genus in sheep the disease is characterized by fever emaciation oral lesions lameness and a substantial death rate with heaviest losses in lambs in cattle the infection usually is nonclinical resulting in a persistent silent infection and a virus-shedding carrier state occasionally cattle sicken however and develop erosions in the mouth encrustations and excoriations on the muzzle nasal discharge laminitis and acute dermatitis of a patchy nature involving the flanks groin perineum udder and teats necrosis of the skin in the interdigital spaces has been observed these signs occur in a number of other diseases the so-called mucosal diseases and differential diagnosis may be difficult in utero transmission occurs in cattle and can result in abortion hydranencephaly congenital malformations and immunotolerant calves further the virus can produce pathologic changes in the reproductive tracts of bulls such changes include focal degeneration of the seminiferous tubules with inflammation and hemorrhage in the colliculus seminalis while of relatively minor importance to dairy cattle per se fear of bluetongue infection causes restrictions in international commerce it has been suspected that cattle may be the reservoir of virus serving as the source of infection for sheep especially in areas where culicoides gnats abound 24  twenty serotypes of bluetongue virus are known in addition cattle can be infected with several closely related viruses including the viruses of epizootic hemorrhagic disease of deer and ibaraki disease agents which cause similar disease in wild ruminants resulting in diagnostic difficulties ibaraki virus was isolated first in the ibaraki prefecture japan from the blood of a 10-yr-old cow it is a bluetongue-like virus producing lesions in cattle that resemble bluetongue in sheep but the virus has little pathogenicity for sheep antibody against ibaraki virus commonly is found in cattle in all regions of the united states except the northwestern states 23  there appears to be no antigenic relationship between bluetongue virus and ibaraki virus but ibaraki virus and two types of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus ehdv in deer are related serologicalty a common complement-fixing antigen is shared by the two ehdv serotypes and bluetongue virus serotypes 42  the significance of ibaraki virus disease of cattle in the united states is unknown but judging from its ulcerative effects on japanese cattle and the wide distribution of antibody against the virus in cattle in the united states concern must be expressed in the last quarter century a new chapter has been added to the study of virus-induced lesions on the teats of dairy cattle in 1966 martin et al 35 reported that bovine ulcerative mammillitis is caused by a herpesvirus in 1970 yedloutschnig et al 59 identified the disease in the united states it has been established recently that the disease has global distribution the disease is known as bovine ulcerative mammillitis as well as bovine herpes mammillitis it can be manifested in two forms in a milking herd in one form from which the name of the disease was derived ulcerative lesions appear on the teats and less frequently on the udders of affected milking cows the virus usually causes gross swelling of the teat wall within 48 h the skin over the affected areas becomes soft and sloughs revealing an irregularly shaped painful deeply ulcerated area which heals slowly healing accompanied by the formation of brown scabs healing usually occurs within a week after skin lesions appear the scabs begin to shed after about 2 wk lymph gland swelling occurs and mastitis follows in approximately 22 of the cases the causative herpesvirus probably is transmitted mechanically by milkers and milking machines or by biting flies 24  this form of the disease must be differentiated from paravaccinia or pseudocowpox another affliction of the teats and sometimes mouths of calves which is a slow-healing nonulcerative virus disease manifested by vesicle formation the second manifestation of this disease is the appearance of multiple nodules in the skin and this is known as dermopathic bovine herpesvirus disease the nodules appear as pronounced circular raised areas in the skin over the entire body the nodules are deep and undergo tissue destruction with the formation of superficial scabs that ultimately fall off tufts of hair are cast off in the desquamation leaving ulcerated lesions that resemble lumpy skin disease a severe poxvirus infection indigenous to parts of africa but currently exotic to the united states in the past 25 yr a group of viral infections affecting the mucous membranes of the bovine alimentary tract has been studied extensively these have gained a prominent place among the dairy cattle diseases because of their debilitating effects when necrosis ulcers or erosions are observed in the oral mucosa of cattle the differential diagnosis should include bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease bvd-md malignant catarrhal fever papular stomatitis rinderpest bluetongue the vesicular diseases and ingestion of caustic substances bovine viral diarrbea-mucosal disease bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease was described initially in 1946 49 as an epizootic diarrhea of cattle today it is known that bvd-md virus is a togavirus that causes multiple clinical and pathologic manifestations 29  the detection of serum antibody in much of the worlds cattle population suggests that inapparent infection is common after natural infection serum antibody frequently persists for the lifetime of the animal the classic clinical syndrome occurs sporadically and is characterized by elevated temperature leukopenia diarrhea lacrimation nasal discharge and erosions of the oral mucous membranes most cases occur in cattle aged 6 to 24 mo and many of these die survivors may develop a chronic debilitating disease characterized by weight loss intermittent diarrhea inefficient feed utilization and erosions of the oral mucosa occasionally lameness occurs due to laminitis necrotic interdigital dermatitis or ulcerative coronitis in some epizootics bvd-md is regarded as a respiratory disease because nasal discharge cough and rapid respirations are prominent clinical signs 28  cattle infected during pregnancy can have normal pregnancies however abortions or malformed calves may be seen even if the inciting infection is mild or inapparent bovine malignant catarrhal fever mcf resembles bvd-md in that crusting of the muzzle and oral erosion and necrosis occur it usually can be differentiated by a severe panophthalmia with corneal opacities prominent enlarged superficial lymph nodes stertorous labored breathing and nervous behavioral changes all of which are characteristic of mcf when these signs are observed they usually are associated with fatal encephalitis the disease seems to occur when cattle contact sheep or wild ruminants the nature of the virus causing mcf in africa is known but studies are still underway to determine the cause of the disease in north america papular stomatitis a mild poxvirus infection usually occurring in calves causes raised or flat lesions in the oral mucosa these lesions frequently contain characteristic streaks of various shades of brown and have irregular edges which helps to distinguish them from bvd-md or mcf erosions only rarely are papular stomatitis lesions manifested as punched-out depressions in the mucosa papular stomatitis infections usually are inapparent the lesions are noticed only if the oral mucosa is examined occasionally however overwhelming infection is manifested by clinical signs rinderpest enzootic in africa and in parts of asia is exotic to the united states in this acute devastating disease of cattle and other ruminants ulcerative lesions identical to bvd-md are found except that they usually are more severe introduction of rinderpest virus into the highly susceptible bovine populations in heretofore rinderpest-free areas presumably will result in high clinical attack rates high case fatality rates rapid transmissibility between animals and herds and a disease problem likely to be devastatingly more drastic than that of enzootic bvd-md rinderpt always must be considered when diagnosing bvd-md because variations in virulence of rinderpest strains are known a mild rinderpest strain easily can be misdiagnosed as bvd-md permitting considerable dissemination of the virus before the disease is diagnosed vesicular stomatitis virus causes vesicles on the oral mucous membranes teats and the coronary bands in the feet of cattle these are indistinguishable from the lesions of foot-andmouth disease the vesicles rupture rapidly and as healing or secondary bacterial invasion occurs the lesions may resemble the erosions of bvd-md especially if the epithelial flaps the sole remnants of the vesicles have been completely desquamated vesicular stomatitis virus is probably insect-borne the disease is enzootic in the southern united states occasionally however it appears in the northern united states or canada during summer months continued studies are needed to understand the epidemiological nuances of this disease especially since it is caused by a rhabdovirus rhabdoviruses frequently have wide host spectra bovine bluetongue infection occasionally results in a clinical syndrome similar to bvd-md with necrosis of the oral mucosa crusting of the muzzle and lameness in clinical bovine bluetongue diffuse necrosis of the oral mucosa particularly the dental pad can serve as a differentiating feature when contrasted with the usually discrete erosions of bvd-md bluetongue occasionally is manifested also as drying cracking and exfoliation of the skin pityriasis suggestive of photosensitization -a finding rarely associated with bvd-md 29  when skin lesions occur in bvd-md it is said that they resemble moist eczema diarrhea frequently a feature of bvd-md mcf and rinderpest is not always a consistent sign profuse intractable diarrhea in cattle also is seen in salmonellosis and johnes disease salmonellosis can be differentiated from mucosal disease by its lack of the latters characteristic oral lesions and by isolation of salmonella organisms from feces or tissues of infected animals acute arsenic poisoning and poisoning with organophosphate insecticides also cause diarrhea and this must be noted in differential diagnosis when epizootics of bvd-md sometimes are misdiagnosed as one of the more common respiratory diseases such as shipping fever or infectious bovine rhinotracheitis ibr the diagnosis usually is based on elevated rectal temperature nasal discharge increased respiratory rate and cough the so-called respiratory form of bvd-md usually is not accompanied by pneumonia however unless there is superimposed infection when bvd-md is manifested as a respiratory disorder careful examination of the oral mucosa gums tongue and hard palate of ill animals and apparendy healthy herdmates sometimes reveals oral erosions if oral erosions are found in catde and if there is a leukopenia a diagnosis of bvd-md is appropriate in differential diagnosis the nasal mucosa must be examined closely for evidence of white fibrinous plaques found in ibr there is a strong immunologic relationship between the hog cholera virus and the agent causing bovine virus diarrhea because of that studies were instituted to determine if bvd-md virus could be used to immunize swine against hog cholera such immunity could be induced if unattenuated live bvd-md virus were used however it was learned subsequently that bvd-md virus occurs naturally in some swine herds and great concern has been expressed that such infected swine if virus-shedders would serve as sources of infection to susceptible cattle that method of vaccinating hogs against cholera no longer is advised a modified-live virus vaccine has been developed however and now is available from commercial firms for the vaccination of cattle against bvd-md 23 while it is recognized that bvd-md modified living vaccines are quite effective and relatively safe for most cattle under field conditions there have been reports indicating that in some cattle this vaccine may be a predisposing factor or possibly the primary cause of severe reactions in some animals such adverse reactions which usually involve low morbidity and high mortality are not clearly understood the use of vaccine in pregnant cows is ill-advised because the virus does cause abortions and is responsible for congenital abnormalities 23  in consideration of these reactions bvd-md vaccine is recommended only where previous or anticipated disease problems are of sufficient magnitude to warrant the risk during the past 25 yr it became painfully obvious that with the national trend toward larger dairy herds with increases in cattle density the probabilities of introducing brucellosis and the persistence of brucellosis were becoming greater the trend also led to higher prevalence in some areas and indeed greater difficulty in eliminating the disease further the trend has led to recognition of the probability that the disease might not be eliminated by conventional test and slaughter methods this new awareness has reactivated an interest in brucellosis research renewed enthusiasm has been engendered for scientific explorations in a disease that has serious public health and economic importance to the cattle industries bovine brucellosis is primarily a disease of sexually mature cattle in which the inciting organism usually brucella abortus circulates systemically for variable periods of time after invading the body it is believed that invasion is most commonly by ingestion and that the source of infection usually is in discharges of an infected cow 47  however other methods of transmission have been reported including inhalation the organism localizes and multiplies in the reticuloendothelial tissues such as the spleen and lymph nodes further it has a predilection for reproductive organs including the udder uterus and testicle epididymis and seminal vesicles and less frequently other structures such as bones and joints the most dramatic clinical manifestation of brucellosis and usually the only sign of infection is abortion resulting from placentitis 14  brucella abortus is an intracellular parasite it multiplies especially abundantly in the placenta where there is a high concentration of erythritol placental lesions result in fetal anoxia and death usually in the last trimester of pregnancy in initial infections in the female localization in the udder and supramammary lymph nodes is most common and more permanent than other sites after parturition or abortion vaginal excretion of the organism continued for the first 15 days then diminished and became intermittent 47  the morphological features of the genus brucella are remarkably consistent but the organism shows limited activity in the conventional biochemical tests used for identification it is recognized however that organisms identified as members of the genus brucelta possess a range of properties that can be clustered into species or biotypes but clearly defined boundaries between species do not exist in all cases for convenience of identification it is recommended that strains should be classified into species by the preferred natural host sensitivity to brucella phages and oxidative metabolic profiles 44  nearly all brucellosis in cattle is caused by ingestion of and subsequent infection by one of the biotypes of brucella abortus brucella endotoxins possess many structural and biological properties common to the lipopolysaccharide endotoxins of enterobacterial pathogens 33  the initial reaction to endotoxin shock is sensitized vascular damage there is fever release of histamine and catecholamines and intravascular clotting repeated insults by endotoxin may result in tolerance to further vascular damage 32  however exposure stimulates cell-mediated immunity in addition to humoral antibody production histiocytic granulomas appear to be manifestations of cell-mediated immunity in chronic brucellosis brucella agglutinins developed in response to endotoxin antigen will crossreact with some salmonella pasteurella yersinia and leptospira genera 47 complicating diagnosis in an evaluation of brucellosis research by a committee serving the national research council national academy of sciences sanford s elberg chairman and six other preeminent committee members stated that there are few aspects of brucellosis so unexplored as its epidemiology when one views the volumes of literature which have been amassed on vaccination procedures serologic tests shedding of the organism and pathogenesis it is appalling to see the limited number of studies relating to routes of transmission relative importance of various sources survival of the organism means of transmission within and between herds the characteristics of high-risk herds management practices to reduce transmission and the dynamics of herd immunity the danger of accepting field observations as truths is well illustrated in brucellosis by the history of the questions concerning the role of the bull in the transmission of the etiologic agent 18  nicoletti 47 has commented that it is accepted widely that sexually immature cattle are quite resistant to exposure to b abortus and that susceptibility increases with sexual development and pregnancy calves may acquire infection in utero or by ingestion of contaminated milk a small but important percentage of heifer calves infected in early life are negative to serologic tests and abort or have an infected calf during the first pregnancy these are referred to as latent infections latent infections are difficult to diagnose early in the course of the disease and may present serious problems in the elimination of brucellosis from cattle herds 47  in brucellosis the term incubation period usually implies that period between exposure to infection and the time at which clinical or serological evidence indicates that infection has occurred that period varies considerably and is affected by several factors such as gestation exposure dose age vaccination and other unknown host-resistant influences the variable incubation period and the difficulties of diagnosing infection until after transmission are among the most serious technical problems in unraveling the epidemiologic patterns of brucellosis 47  for many years diagnosis was based upon isolating the organism from infected tissues or secretions or by employing agglutination tests on serums from cattle under surveillance serious limitations were found in the agglutination test it was often ineffective in detecting chronic infections and could be influenced seriously by vaccines or other antigens subsequently a battery of other serologic methods was developed including the ring test card test rose bengal test complement-fixation rivanol and mercaptoethanol tests for humorai antibody and recently the lymphocyte stimulation test has been evaluated for evidence of cellmediated immunity 47  varied sensitivity and specificity among these have made it obvious that no single test is entirely reliable in the diagnosis of brucellosis but in wisely selected combination they are highly effective strain 19 vaccine remains the most widely used immunogenic agent for the control of bovine brucellosis in more than five decades of research on this strain there has been no proved change in virulence or immunogenicity 47  it rarely causes permanent infection in vaccinated cattle especially when administered in calfhood there is no apparent pathogenicity for human beings except when it is injected a reduced dose proposed by nicoletti 47 and administered subcutaneously has enhanced the practicability of the use of the vaccine regardless of age of cattle major progress in the understanding of calf diarrhea has resulted from the isolation and characterization in the late 1960s of a reo-like virus now called rotavirus and of a coronavirus in the early 1970s these accomplishments resulted largely from the efforts of mebus and coworkers at the nebraska agricultural experiment station rotavirus in recent years the importance of rotaviruses in the ubiquitous and troublesome diarrheal diseases in calves has become well established and as for some bacterial diarrheal diseases rotaviruses have the propensity to infect more than one species of animal so that human bovine porcine and equine strains possibly may produce diarrhea in neonatal calves 24  although rotaviral infection may occur at all ages including adult cattle it is in neonates that the disease is often most severe and frequently fatal the disease in calves usually becomes apparent between 3 days and 15 wk after birth it is likely that the disease heretofore known as pneumoenteritis in calves and piglets is primarily a rotaviral disease in pneumoenteritis diarrhea usually precedes pneumonia occurring between 1 and 10 days of age in calves on a total milk diet feces in rotavirus infection usually are brilliant yellow to white in color not always putrid and resemble those of classic milk scours in other calves however feces may be watery brown gray or light green and tinged with fresh blood and mucus the color appears to be dietary dependent if the diarrhea is prolonged dehydration becomes apparent and the calf may die within 4 to 7 days after onset showing a significant loss of body weight severely ill calves have recovered after administration of glucose and saline mixtures substituted for milk continued feeding of milk is harmful and probably accounts for the severity of epizootics in calves maintained in cowcalf operations inclement weather may complicate an outbreak many calves have developed severe pneumonia after the onset of diarrhea especially when they were exposed to inclement weather severely affected animals may die 2 or 3 wk later 24  the pathogenesis of rotavirus infection in calves is similar to that for transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs the virus infects villous epithelium in the intestine immature enterocytes which migrate from the crypts to the tip of the villus fail to differentiate fully in their migration this failure appears to be the major factor which produces an ultimate electrolyte transport disorientation for sodium ions resulting in fluid and electrolyte loss manifested by diarrhea 24  resistance to rotavirus disease appears to be mediated by local immunity at the epithelial surface of the small intestine 55  unfortunately the passive protection afforded by colostrum has limited value calves are protected when they are fed colostrum with rotavirus antibody of high content but that colostrum must be fed continuously in the likelihood of constant exposure to virus 24  the duration of immunity is not known and the period of persistence of virus in the feces after illness also is unknown the effectiveness of cell-mediated immunity apparently has an influence on the persistence of virus which is shed in the feces it is likely that immunity is only partial and not long-lasting therefore adults can become infected from infected neonates since the incidence of the disease is extremely high and since reinfection may occur it is likely that the disease is perpetuated through persistence of virus within an animal species also there is a possibility that interspecies infection may be important in transmission of the infectious agent in control of this disease despite the limitations cited the feeding of colostrum to newborn calves is extremely important the colostrum must contain reasonably high antibodies to the rotavirus and it must be fed every day during the crucial neonatal age period in which rotavirus infection is a threat if it is to be effective an attenuated bovine-derived strain of rotavirus has been used for production of a vaccine the vaccine currently is given to dayold calves although there is some question about the efficacy of this new vaccine it seems to show effectiveness when used in herds with serious rotavirus diarrheal problems 24  virus also has been isolated from dairy calves with neonataldiarrhea 39  the coronavirus and the rotavirus both affect the absorptive epithelium of the gut both cause similar clinical syndromes and contribute significantly to calf morbidity and mortality both viruses are studied with similar technologic methods and both are combined in a commercially available modified live virus vaccine they are therefore frequently discussed together even though they have slightly different pathogenic mechanisms and different virologic characteristics coronavirus infection cannot be distinguished clinically from other causes of diarrhea in newborn calves a laboratory diagnosis can be made by finding the virus in feces by immunofluorescent microscopy or electron microscopy prevention of coronavirus-induced diarrhea is complex it requires hygienic calving conditions assurance that each calf receives colostrum and sanitary rearing practices where a specific diagnosis has been established use of the modified live virus in pregnant cattle and newborn calves may be of value the two most common bacterial enteric diseases of young cattle especially calves marked by severe diarrhea dehydration and high death loss are colibacillosis and salmonellosis colibacillosis is associated with infection by escbericbia coli a ubiquitous organism found normally in the lower bowel of all warm-blooded animals it is found abundantly in carnivora and omnivora but sparsely in horses and cattle and may or may not be pathogenic its pathogenic propensity is regulated by plasmid-mediated determinants that in addition to providing filamentous surface antigens on the organism that facilitate adhesion to the epithelium of the intestine and thence colonization and proliferation cause the organism to produce a path opotentiating diarrhea-inducing enterotoxin or sometimes a neurotoxin which also is vasotoxic and produces enterotoxemic systemic disease 13  a third toxin which is produced by all coliform bacteria rarely causing diarrhea is endotoxin e coli endotoxin is responsible for systemic colibacillosis in immunoglobulin-deficient calves this occurs even in calves that ingest but do not absorb protective quantities of colostral antibody 19 41  although the alimentary tract is usually the portal of entry signs of nonenterotoxemic systemic colibacillosis in calves may or may not be accompanied by diarrhea or alimentary tract injury it is important to emphasize that ordinarily endotoxin does not cause fluid loss from the intestine usually manifestations of endotoxin injury are associated with hyperthermia lethargy complement activation neutrophil degranulation and various toxic effects on the vascular system that may culminate in irreversible fatal shock signs include fever depression vomiting trembling edema increased respiration and some hemorrhage 41  the vasotoxic neurotoxin elaborated by some varieties of escbericbia coii produces enterotoxemic colibacillosis as in edema disease of swine brain hemorrhages in calves are believed to be induced by the same bloodvessel-damaging neurotoxin the most common and most troublesome of the toxins of e coli is enterotoxin and the disease it induces is enteropathic enterotoxic colibacillosis so-called white scours or calf scours enterotoxic colibacillosis is the only form of colibacillosis which is truly an enteric disease it occurs in the young adults are spared 41 calves exposed to enteropathic enterotoxic e coli during the 1st day of life most likely will develop disease whereas those exposed to the same organism 2 days later may not show signs of illness there is a gradient with the anterior small intestine being highly sensitive to enterotoxin and the posterior small intestine being relatively resistant as with cholera in man enterotoxininduced secretion in the small intestine of calves takes place across an intact unaltered mucosa except for the discharge of goblet-cell mucus enterotoxic colibacillosis produces a profuse watery dehydrating diarrhea not by hyperperistalsis whip-lashing of the gut but by biophysical directional alternation of water and electrolyte flow in the intestinal membranes it has been baffling that in enterotoxic colibacillosis the organism adheres to villus not crypt epithelium yet it is the crypt epithelium that contains numerous secretory granules responsible for the diarrhea it is believed that the enterotoxin mimics or stimulates the release of villus hormones including prostaglandins which regulate adenylcyclase and the intestinal secretory process and secretion of water and electrolytes 41  when such secretion by the small intestine exceeds colonic absorption diarrhea occurs losses of water sodium and carbonate result in dehydration metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia acidosis leads to decreased intracellular potassium and then increased extracellular potassium this effects cardiac arrhythmias and then myocardial failure the immediate cause of death in most cases death frequently occurs in less than 24 h in the most acute form of white scours the calf shows weakness appears sleepy and soon dies without other signs in the usual form however the calf shows a severe diarrhea the fecal material often being full of gas bubbles and whitish in color because of lack of bile some animals may die after a few days in more protracted cases lameness may appear because of acute inflammation of one or more joints in such joints the capsule is distended with a cloudy fluid in which there are myriads of colon bacilli these animals almost always eventually die 24  in controlling calf scours it is essential to emphasize that colostrum and good management to prevent environmental stress are equally important colostrum containing immunoglobulin will interfere with the adherence and colonization of the enterotoxic coliforms on the intestinal villi the success of vaccination of cows to prevent diarrheal disease in calves appears to depend upon preparation of an antigen vaccine to stimulate formation of appropriate multivalent anticapsular immunoglobulins not antitoxin because the common enterotoxin is not immunogenic 24  morgan et al 43 vaccinated brood sows with purified somatic pili from clones of piliation phase enterotoxigenic escbericbia coli and protected neonatal suckling pigs against diarrheal disease caused by enterotoxigenic e coli strains that possessed the same pili the practicality of such a vaccine is diminished by the heterogeneity of pathogenic strains unless ways are devised to produce polyvalent immunoglobulin by genetic or hapten linkage of pilus immunogenic determinants if that can be accomplished for pigs it most likely will have benefit for calves foot rot remains a troublesome and enigmatic disease in cattle although careful and difficult research continues to chip away at its elusive nature the anaerobic fusobacteria which produce copious amounts of butyric acid and bacteroides species which produce copious volumes of isovaleric and isobutyric acids 24  have been isolated from cases of foot rot in cattle and studied extensively by berg 4 and others including thorley et al in great britain 56  the disease in cattle frequently has been associated with fusobacterium necropborurn but also associated with bacteroides melaninogenicus 4 and bacteroides nodosus 56  these organisms have little or no capacity to invade normal epithelium but under anaerobic conditions they readily enter and multiply in tissues damaged by injury or infection caused by other organisms 24  in all species of animals suffering from foot rot or liver abscesses associated with f necropborurn and pyogenic bacteria the typical lesion is necrosis and it has a putrid odor the genesis of the lesion in cattle is not understood completely it is more thoroughly known in sheep the early lesions of foot rot in cattle are similar to those of sheep that is swelling and moistness in the interdigital cleft in sheep but not in cattle inflammation of the sensitive laminae of the hoof occurs often underrunning the sole the most important bacterium in foot rot of sheep is bacteroides nodosus the disease is initiated by the penetration of b nodusus into the epidermis damaged by injury 54  this is accompanied or followed by invasion of the same site by f necropborum which extends the tissue damage creating new invasion sites for b nodosus 5  perhaps the genesis of the foot lesion in cattle parallels that of foot rot in sheep treponema penortba may be a pathopotentiator pus-producing bacteria like corynebacterium pyogenes are secondary invaders but they operate in synergy with the primary invaders to produce tissue destruction and sometimes abscess formation f necropborurn facilitates the establishment and growth of c pyogenes in the tissues by the phagocyteinhibiting and leucocyte-destroying action of its exotoxin 48  c pyogenes produces a macromolecular substance that stimulates the growth and invasiveness of f necropborurn particularly by removing oxygen from the tissue site under microbial attack whether a liberation of exotoxin is activated by phage as for some species of corynebacteria is currently unknown 48  attempts to vaccinate animals with formolized bacterial cell preparations and with culture filtrates of f necropborum have not been successful although it appears that most animals develop antibody as they age and are exposed to the organism 24 it is not clear that this antibody is protective against the disease however some prophylactic agents like broadspectrum antibiotics are effective in preventing f necropborum-associated liver abscesses in cattle such agents may have potential in preventing or treating bovine infectious pododermatitis twenty five years ago this disease had been newly described 8 29 and during the intervening period elaboration of the many fcets of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis has resolved many perplexing questions infectious bovine rhinotracheitis ibr is the name given to the respiratory form of a herpesvirus infection that also sometimes is manifested by a genital syndrome called infectious pustular vulvovaginitis ipv or coital exanthema close confinement of feedlot cattle and cattle in large dairy herds provides favorable conditions for the rapid transmission of the virus 51 sometimes the disease appears simply as a granular conjunctivitis occasionally by meningoencephalitis especially in calves under 6 mo of age frequently the infection is manifested solely by abortions abortion can be a sequel either to respiratory infection by ibr virus or to injection of modified live ibr vaccine abortion usually is not a sequel to ipv the ibr virus like other herpesviruses may be latent therefore being shed intermittently from infected animals for long periods following recovery from clinical disease latent infection was activated by the use of corticosteroids in studies reported by sheffy and rodman in 1973 52  the respiratory form of ibr infection probably is the most significant and economically important form of the disease in feedlots but for dairy cattle abortion may be more costly an outbreak may be mild with numerous subclinical cases or it may be fulminating it is not unusual to find cattle in an infected herd that appear bright and yet have markedly elevated body temperature 20  there may be noticeable decrease in feed consumption and signs of upper respiratory infection the affected animals exhibit rapid rhythmic and sometimes dyspneic breathing inappetence elevated temperature coughing nasal discharge foamy salivation catarrhal conjunctivitis and loss of weight the course of disease usually runs between 7 and 10 days the muzzle and nasal mucosa become inflammed giving rise to the term red nose occasionally respiratory signs are not evident conjunctivitis with ocular discharges which initially are clear but later infrequently become mucopurulent and sometimes with centripetally originating corneal opacities may appear as principal manifestations of infection such infection may be misdiagnosed as pinkeye a high percentage of cattle with classic pinkeye caused not by a virus but by moraxella boris bacterium have corneal opacities originating in the center of the cornea and spreading centrifugally the diagnosis of ibr-associated conjunctivitis should be considered if opacities in a herd are few and appear to originate at the corneoscleral junction 29  another disease wherein corneal opacities occur frequently and originate at the corneoscleral junction is malignant catarrhal fever mcf that disease too is associated with dyspnea due to profuse accumulation of tenacious mucopurulent exudate in the nasal passages and to some extent the trachea and bronchi partial blockage of these airways may result in the forced open-mouthed breathing seen in ibr and mcf white pustules frequently appear and coalesce in the respiratory ocular and reproductive tract mucous membranes when these lesions appear in all these loci they are sufficiently distinctive for ibr to suggest that the disease in question is in fact ibr in the nasal passages however similar lesions may occur in mcf following natural ibr virus infection or vaccination with modified live virus 1br vaccines cell-mediated and humoral components of the immune system are activated the humoral response usually measured by serum neutralization tests has served traditionally as an indicator of prior infection and as an indirect measure of resistance evidence now suggests that a crucial role in resistance and recovery from early ibr involves locally deployed elements of the cell-mediated immune system thus detection of neutralizing antibody in serum probably is not an accurate indicator of immunity but may be used until methods of measuring cell-mediated immunity to ibr come into common use 29  the ibr can be controlled by maintaining protective antibody in a herd and by reducing the number of susceptible animals to a minimum this can be accomplished by helping cattle acquire both passive and active immunity at an early age the calf receives ibr antibody from cotostrum within the first 24 h after birth the quantity that a calf receives depends upon the dams serum antibody and the amount of colostrum ingested because the dam transfers ibr antibody to her offspring comparable to that in her own serum some workers suggest maintaining a protective antibody titer in the brood stock this can be accomplished by booster vaccinations 3 to 4 wk prior to breeding or by vaccinating in the last trimester of pregnancy with vaccines approved for pregnant cattle colostral antibody may persist as long as 4 mo and may prevent an antibody response to vaccine given during that period therefore calves vaccinated before 6 mo of age should be revaccinated after that age vaccination may provide immunity for longer than 2 yr 51  as an additional protective measure all additions to a herd should be isolated and observed carefully for signs of illness every day for 30 days today live modified combined vaccines against ibr bovine virus diarrhea-mucosal disease and parainfluenza-3 are available and are compatibly effective when administered at 5 to 7 mo of age to calves that have had colostrum immediately after birth and earlier to calves deprived of colostrum the first ibr vaccines were modified live virus products developed to be used intramuscularly these had the disadvantage of causing abortion in 1969 intranasal-administered modified live-virus ibr vaccine was introduced and has gained widespread acceptance unlike vaccines for intramuscular injection the intranasal vaccines usually are safe for use in pregnant cattle among the advantages ascribed to the intranasal vaccines are rapid protection attributed to interferon production and rapid induction of secretory antibody at mucosal surfaces 29  intranasal vaccines are believed to induce production of humoral antibody at titers comparable with those of intramuscular vaccines the intranasal vaccine can be administered to cattle of the same ages as applied to use of the intramuscular vaccine it has been suggested that intranasal-administered vaccine may override low colostrum-acquired maternal immunity resulting in successful vaccination of some calves that do have colostrum-acquired antibody if calves less than 6 mo old are vaccinated booster doses are recommended for animals to be retained for long-term purposes especially as breeding animals inactivated ibr vaccine has been available from time to time in combination with bacterin containing organisms of the pasteurella genus and inactivated myxovirus parainfluenza-3 the latter two agents have been associated with the shipping fever complex there is controversy regarding the efficacy of inactivated vaccine for these respiratory illnesses however as in the case with many other inactivated vaccines the initial vaccination procedure should be repeated and annual booster doses are recommended advantages of inactivated vaccine are that it eliminates the risk of postvaccination abortion associated with live-virus vaccine and avoids unfavorable postvaccination reactions except anaphylaxis also with inactivated vaccine there is no shedding of vaccine virus and seeding of populations otherwise not exposed in addition it eliminates concern that the vaccine virus itself may establish a latent infection that could be reactivated at a later date although research on ibr continues the past quarter century has seen it emerge from an undescribed disease to a well understood and well controlled infection johnes disease is a chronic granulomatous enteritis of ruminants caused by an acid-fast bacterium mycobacteriurn paratuberculosis johne and frothingham first described this disease in 1895 in germany 23  they cited an unusual case of tuberculosis in a cow wherein they found acid-fast bacteria which they thought to be either avian or bovine tubercle bacilli 9  in 1906 bang in denmark recognized it as an infection distinct from tuberculosis and suggested that it be named bovine pseudotuberculosis or paratuberculosis 9  paratuberculosis has been recognized in the united states for about 75 yr and concern has been expressed that it is increasing in incidence the disease is characterized by progressive emaciation and in cattle by a recurrent diarrhea there is thickening corrugation and convolution of the mucosa of the distal end of the small intestine the granulomatous enteritis that occurs is expressed by infection-damaged malfunctioning short club-shaped intestinal villi that assume wart-like configurations diagnosis has been extremely difficult for a variety of reasons clinical disease usually occurs only in a small number of infected animals infected animals that shed the organisms can be inapparent silent carriers showing no evidence of disease fecal culture isolation techniques to recover the organism require 2 to 3 mo for completion because the organism grows extremely slowly in laboratory media further these techniques detect only a small number of infected animals heretofore immunologic tests including the complementfixation test and the agar gel immunodiffusion test used prior to the development of the lymphocyte transformation test that employs phytohemagglutinin as mitogen and purified protein derivative from the organism as antigen have lacked specificity or sensitivity 9  the difficuh t in diagnosis has been compounded by the fact that humoral and cell-mediated immunologic status of infected animals varies with the stage of the disease however the availability and assessment of the lymphocyte transformation test as described by buergelt 9  offers encouraging potential for the diagnosis and ultimate eradication of this troublesome disease the test provides an in vitro evaluation of cell-mediated immunity and offers a fairly sensitive method to assess the extent of disease in populations of cattle under surveillance to complicate the diagnosis there is a close antigenic crossreactivity between mycobacteriurn aviurn the cause of avian tuberculosis and mycobacteriurn paratuberculosis however these two infections may be differentiated by the lymphocyte transformation test provided appropriate purified protein-derivative antigens from each of these agents are used in parallel on a given serum specimen 9  paradoxically even with the hopefully effective lymphocyte transformation test a humoral mitogen-suppressor substance has been found in serum fractions containing immunoglobulins lggl and igg2 notwithstanding the difficulties in serologic interpretations the lymphocyte transformation test shows promise of being useful in the diagnosis of subclinical and clinical cases of johnes disease and may provide an overall impression of the extent of exposure to m paratuberculosis within a herd nonruminant hosts may serve as reservoirs from which the organism may be shed to infect cattle 9  although johnes disease has been historically considered a disease that involves the lower end of the small intestine the ileocaecal valve and the adjacent lymph nodes the organism has been isolated also from the liver blood udder uterus ovaries milk urine feces and fetus therefore there is evidence that the disease is transmitted not only by fecal contamination but also by milk and by transplacental infection of the fetus 9  a typical clinical case of johnes disease is characterized by intermittent or continuous chronic diarrhea in young animals especially in 2 or 3-yr-old lactating females the disease most often occurs in the early part of the first or second lactation feces are soft and watery and are passed without straining diarrhea may decrease in severity during late pregnancy only to reappear more severely after parturition valuable high-producing animals may be affected suddenly milk production decreases and the haircoat may become rough or loss of hair occurs the appetite remains good there is no fever usually only one or two animals show evidence of disease in a herd at the time of initial observation after a course of weeks to months with unresponsiveness to treatment the disease terminates in death of those animals showing severe dehydration emaciation and weakness decreased absorption of amino acids associated with increased protein leakage results in a negative nitrogen balance with the clinical manifestations of a wasting disease although m paratuberculosis has been cultured from pharyngeal lymph nodes tonsils bronchial lymph nodes spleen lungs kidney reproductive tract mammary gland and placenta gross and microscopic lesions usually are absent in these organs lymphatic and hematogenic spread through the thoracic and portal venous circulation respectively begins early in the disease process however the organisms do not seem to multiply to any extent or give rise to distinct lesions except in the intestine and its adjacent lymph nodes the spread is assumed to occur passively by way of circulating macrophages in the liver these bacteria-laden macrophages may become trapped in sinusoids and in conjunction with lymphocytes and possibly antibody they may give rise to multiple small granulomas 9 merkal 40 introduced recent immunologic concepts to the understanding of the pathogenesis of johnes disease he postulated that an antigen-antibody reaction in the infected intestine causes the release of histamine in an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction resulting in mediation of diarrhea delayed hypersensitivity also a phenomenon in this disease involving specific antigens from the organisms and specifically sensitized lympbocytes causes the release of cytotoxins and pyrogens that mediate emaciation and anemia attention has been called in early literature to the similarity between leprosy and paratuberculosis 9  both diseases are caused by acid-fast organisms that are difficult to culture and are characterized by long and slow growth periods of organisms in culture the granulomatous inflammatory response in both diseases is similar despite involvement of different organ systems the microscopic lesions are dominated by epithelioid and langhans giant cells in advanced leprosy the typical inflammatory cells have been termed leprosy cells enlarged maerophages with vacuolated frothy cytoplasma resulting from the accumulation of lipid substances and bacillary debris although such cells are not identified clearly in johnes disease vacuolation of cytoplasm and lipid degeneration of epithelioid cells has been noticed 9 with clumping distortion and dissolution of bacilli within these cells in the adjacent draining lymph nodes large areas of lymphoid cells within the paracortical zone have been replaced by granulomatous inflammatory infiltrates in both diseases 9  the similarity in the histopathologic findings of leprosy and of paratuberculosis have attracted pathologists studying paratuberculosis to the adaptation of ridley and joplings morphologic classification of leprosy for paratuberculosis hence the inclination among some pathologists to refer to johnes disease on cellular morphologic grounds as bovine leprosy 9  vaccination of cattle with heat-killed or live attenuated organisms has been used with some claims of success in france and england where vaccination is practiced one dose for a 1-wk-old calf is recommended 9  but it generally is agreed that the vaccine does not confer absolute immunity and some animals vaccinated with the live attenuated cultures have excreted the organisms a major problem in using vaccines of this nature against jobnes disease in addition to their questionable reliability is that vaccinated animals become sensitized and react to mammalian tuberculin when tested for tuberculosis further the immunologic significance of antibody in johnes disease and its relationship to the infectious agent remain unsolved doubts have been raised about the protective nature of antibody in chronic progressive infectious diseases in such diseases it is thought that antibody may protect the etiologic agent rather than the host 9  there is evidence that such antibody abrogates effective cellular immunity and actually enhances dissemination of lesions in some chronic infectious diseases the mechanism of enhancement of disease by antibody should be suspect when a disease normally controlled by cellular immunity suddenly undergoes rapid dissemination of lesions such as is seen classically in miliary tuberculosis 9  one must examine this question critically in johnes disease does this occur in those clinical cases of johnes disease resulting in diarrhea emaciation and death as distinguished from the infected animals that show inapparent infection if so the value of vaccination needs critical reevaluation in that evaluation however one must be sensitive to experience with other vaccines in similar modes for example the appearance of miliary tuberculosis in young children is rare after bcg vaccination 15  the bcg is a strain of originally virulent m boris attenuated by calmette and guerin by serial passage on inhibitory media it is assumed that the effectiveness of the vaccine is dependent upon development of humoral antibody due to the lack of adequate or effective vaccines or effective drugs for treatment control of johnes disease in infected herds is achieved best by strongly enforced management procedures which include prompt isolation and culling of infected animals and their offspring as determined by serologic 9 or culturing 45 methods segregating calf-rearing quarters and good hygienic procedures the past quarter-century has brought remarkable progress in an understanding of bovine malignant lymphoma particulary the identification of a virus as the cause of some such tumors in cattle this progressive and ultimately fatal disease of cattle also is known as bovine lymphosarcoma bovine lymphomatosis or bovine leukosis in clinically apparent cases it is manifested by enlargement of lymph glands the glandular enlargements in malignant lymphoma of cattle may be preceded by hematologic change usually a persistent lymphocytosis many european workers believe that cattle may develop these hematologic changes without tumor formation 24  some cattle in herds afflicted with this disease show enlarged and firm superficial lymph nodes generally the disease in these animals progresses rapidly emaciation develops and death usually occurs in animals that show signs of illness sporadic cases appear in calves or endemics appear in adults the incidence being highest in animals from 5 to 8 yr of age calves under 6 mo of age showing the sporadic form usually present generalized enlargement of lymph nodes and nodular or diffuse lesions of the spleen liver kidneys or bone marrow this is called the neonatal multicentric form animals between 6 mo and 2 yr of age may show enlargement of limited groups of lymph nodes usually with involvement of the thymus gland also in that age group the skin may show multiple tumors these are referred to as the thymic and skin forms respectively and these conditions appear to be unrelated to bovine leukemia virus 24  in animals over 2 yr of age the multicentric form of malignant lymphoma usually is observed sometimes an eyeball may protrude because of tumor formation in the orbit chronic bloating occurs in some because of enlargement of thoracic nodes that interfere with normal eructation abomasal lesions may lead to digestive disturbances or abomasal ulceration lameness and paralysis may occur because of pressure on parts of the spinal cord or peripheral nerves from tumors lymphocytic infiltration of some of the internal organs may be seen in some cases with pronounced increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes hence the term lymphocytosis or leukemia 24  there is evidence that b-lymphocytes are the target cells for bovine leukemia virus blv infection the b-cells are lymphocytes from which immunoglobulin-producing plasma ceils are derived also it is now clear that the agent is a c-type virus an oncogenic rna virus in the subfamily oncornavirus the c-type particles are budding forms at cell membranes also observed as free particles in intercellular spaces particles with central nucleoids are designated c-type the b-type particles by way of contrast have acentric nucleoids in laboratory diagnosis phytomitogen is used in buffy coat cultures of leucocytes from cattle with persistent lymphocytosis or lymphosarcoma to enhance the appearance of c-type particles in the cell cultures by this technique c-type particles heretofore demonstrated in cattle with persistent lymphocytosis and lymphosarcoma also have been found in normal cattle 24  perhaps this indicates inapparent silent infection which in the absence of antibody will skew the epidemiologic evidence of distribution of the infection in the national cattle population nonetheless in the united states there is evidence that the disease is becoming more prevalent with high and low incidence areas 23  evidence is emerging that blv is responsible for producing several forms of natural disease 24 but not all bovine lymphosarcomas have been associated with blv sero-epidemi61ogic evidence indicates that the virus in cattle is transmitted horizontally by contact as well as vertically and it also is transmitted similarly in experiments with sheep and goats 24 25  further blv replicates in monolayers of bovine embryonic spleen cells fetal lamb spleen and human diploid embryonic cells with the production of syncytia 23  this observation and the fact that blv will produce lymphomatosis when inoculated into a variety of species ie sheep goats and subhuman primates 25 37  and the finding of blv in cows milk 17 have prompted careful studies on the human risk from exposure to blv a seroepidemiologic study was conducted by donham et al 16 in an attempt to identify antibody against the bovine leukemia virus in people exposed to cattle with lymphosarcoma farm families farm employees and veterinarians in contact with dairy herds having documented cases of lymphosarcoma were tested for precipitating antibody to the blv using the agar-gel immunodiffusion test the cattle also were tested by serologic procedures further information was collected from the farm families regarding consumption of unpasteurized milk from their dairy herds twenty-one dairy herds with documented cases of lymphosarcoma were identified a total of 846 cows from these herds were bled and 33 showed positive serologic tests no positive serums were found in the 45 dairy farmers family members and farm employees associated with the herds with lymphosarcoma consumption of raw milk was reported by 77 of the farm group in addition 83 veterinarians 30 leukemia patients and 200 control human serums were tested and found negative for antibody to the blv 16  although 77 of the farm people in this group consumed raw milk and showed no seropositive evidence of infection it is still advisable for people to drink pasteurized milk inasmuch as it has been demonstrated that flash pasteurization inactivates the virus in milk 23  special attention is called to the studies of 12 neonatal chimpanzees removed from their mothers at birth nursed separately and fed either unpasteurized blv-containing milk or a prepared infant formula hematologic changes were noted at days 119 and 200 in two animals fed blv-containing milk the animals died at 33 and 46 wk respectively the bone marrow peripheral blood and other autopsy findings for both animals were indistinguishable from leukemia and were consistent with the di-guglielmo syndrome erythroleukemia 37  however neither the bovine lymphosarcoma virus nor blv antibody was in these animals whether the disease developed as a direct result of blv ingestion remains a moot question since none of the other chimpanzees developed illness nor antibody 1 in a symposium on bovine leukosis sponsored by the united states department of agriculture in may 1979 glyn g caldwell reported the results of public health serologic studies and concluded that adequate serologic tests which are sensitive and specific have failed to demonstrate infection in humans despite close contact or raw-milk ingestion from blv-infected herds consequently blv does not appear to represent a public health hazard for humans 10  further studies are needed before we understand fully the epidemiologic patterns of blv and the details of its association with the variety of lymphoid tumors affecting dairy cattle unlike the emerging enteric viral diseases satmonellosis has plagued dairymen for years the past 25 yr however have brought considerable understanding to this ubiquitous enterobacterial disease diarrhea severe dehydration prostration and death characterize salmonellosis in young cattle especially calves nevertheless once established in young animals in a herd adult animals tend to become infected this appears more commonly today than 10 yr ago 20  at that time it was restricted primarily to young animals 20  salmonellosis is usually an enteric disease sometimes though it becomes systemic involving organs and tissues other than the intestine especially the joints most clinical cases in calves are due to salmonella typbimuriurn west of the rocky mountains however some cases in calves and adults are due to salmonella dublin 8 cattle that contract s dublin infection continue after recovery to excrete some of the bacteria in their feces for many years about 30 to 40 remain shedders during their lifetimes because the organism colonizes the gall bladder and liver in contrast in the more ubiquitous s typbimurium infection of cattle which is indistinguishable clinically from s dublin disease recovered cattle remain carriers and shedders for only a month or two because s typbimurium does not colonize the gall bladder or liver in mammalian species except perhaps rodents notwithstanding these facts it is possible to eliminate one of these infections from a herd while virtually impossible to eliminate the other elimination of host-adapted s dublin can be accomplished by identifying and discarding reservoir carrier animals through culturing fecal specimens this cannot be done in nonhost-adapted s typbimurium infection because of the ubiquitous distribution of that bacterium among many animal species which can contaminate the farm environment although outbreaks of s typbimurium infection in cattle may originate from other cattle there are usually opportunities for crossinfection from other species of livestock especially swine wild rodents or poultry however in great britain there are specific phage types and clones peculiar to cattle alone 58  these can be eliminated from a herd this emphasizes the importance of phage-typing all isolates of salmonellae from dairy herds 458 the detection of salmonellae in a calf shipped from one locality to another does not necessarily indicate infection at the origin calves showing clinical evidence of salmonellosis are often those which have come from a clean source hut which apparently have encountered the organism for the first time while in transit acute salmonellosis in adult cattle while by no means as common as in calves occasionally can be very troublesome 30  abortion is a common feature of adult infection 30  diarrhea and dehydration in the adult usually are severe when they do occur colonization of the latter part of the small intestine and colon is a necessary first step in pathogenesis of enteric salmonellosis the normal intestinal flora may block access to attachment sites on the mucosal cells needed by the salmonellas also indigenous fusiform bacteria that lie in the mucous layer coating the epithelium of the large intestine normally inhibit growth of salmonellas by producing volatile organic acids which are toxic for the salmonella organisms 24  factors such as antibiotic therapy and diet and water deprivation that disrupt the normal colonic flora or otherwise stress cattle greatly increase the hosts susceptibility to enteric and septicemic salmonellosis 24  clinical salmonellosis must be regarded as having a multifactorial cause after invading intestinal epithelial cells salmonellas cause net secretion of water and electrolytes possibly by means of lipopolysaccharide in the bacterial endotoxin causing inflammatory release of prostaglandins that in turn activate adenylcyclase 24  this enzyme acts upon secretory granules in the crypt cells to stimulate water and electrolyte secretion bacterial endotoxin also effects elevated body temperature damage to capillary endothelium resulting in hemorrhage thrombocytopenia depletion of liver glycogen with prolonged hypoglycemia and shock shock often induces severe circulatory collapse resulting in sudden death relapses are certainly an important practical problem in salmonellosis but a number of these are believed to be from physical tissue damage from treatment rather than from first-order resurgence of infection there is widespread agreement that celtmediated immunity is more important than humoral immunity in resistance to salmonellosis humoral antibody contributes primarily to bacterial clearance 24  chemically inactivated vaccines bacterins have been prepared for immunoprophylaxis against salmonella species with varying and ofttimes questionable effectiveness in assessing effectiveness intracellularly-located organisms are not affected by humoral antibody the body must depend upon effectiveness of cell-mediated immunity the effectiveness of macrophages which are activated by sensitized lymphocytes to phagocytize and kill the tissue-invading salmonellas live vaccines prepared from avirulent cultures ofs typbimurium and s dublin are used widely in europe they promote cell-mediated immunity 58  macrophages also release a cloning-inhibiting factor a lymphokine that like the secretory immunoglobulin iga blocks adherence and thus prevents colonization multiplication and cloning of the organisms on the intestinal epithelium salmonella anatum during the past decade there has been a noticeable appearance and increase in incidence of salmonella anatum infection in cattle 6 7  vying only with s dublin for second place in order of frequency 24  next to s typbimurium it is the most widely distributed salmonella type 24  the source of infection appears to be mostly wild birds that contaminate pastures and hayfields with droppings containing the organisms 37  however the organism has a wide distribution among a great variety of birds and mammals so feedstuff and water in addition to pasture or hayfield may be contaminated in infected lactating cows there is a marked reduction in milk production associated with protracted illness 20 37  salmonellosis and antimicrobial resistance another problem relating to enteric bacteria has appeared during the past decade increasing resistance among members of the enterobacteriaceae to antimicrobial agents has been noted throughout the world 46  particular interest has focused on salmonella species 46  the antimicrobial resistance patterns and presence of plasmid-bearing resistance factors in isolates from human and animal sources have been studied considerable anxiety has been expressed about the use of antibiotics in animal feeds as journal of dairy science vol 64 no 6 1981 growth promoters and prophylactics as this practice has been suspected to be a major factor in the increased antimicrobial resistance no effective method for assessing the magnitude of risk to the welfare of man has been devised opinions about the degree of risk are highly polarized the increase in resistance has not been sustained in at least one instance an abrupt decline in ampicillin resistance of salmonella typbimurium in humans was reported in new york in the late 1970s in contrast to an increasing frequency of resistant isolates from upstate new york calves over a similar time 12  the sudden unanticipated drop in antibiotic resistance reported in this singular but noteworthy urban experience introduces new and unanswered questions as to why a population of s typhimurium suddenly should lose its ampicillin resistance 12  it is possible that plasmid coded protein on the salmonella cell surface is antigenic to the host animal thus resulting in immunoglobulin against the ampicillin-resistant strain and an emerging population immunity 58  genetic control mechanisms will continue to be studied but the role of the gut flora in support of or antagonism toward survival of r-factor-bearing strains versus antibiotic-sensitive strains and clone-preference effectors needs review the life-span benefits of incorporating antibiotics in feeds as growth stimulants are not understood fully because it is not known how the antibiotics act at the molecular level as growth promoters considerable practical evidence of the prophylactic benefits of antibiotics in feed or water does exist nonetheless it is not always certain that diseases against which protection is claimed actually exist in all areas where antibiotics are being used as prophylactic feed additives improved surveillance and monitoring methods are needed further the need for better understanding of the ecologic impact of different r-factor incompatibility groups in enteric genera such as escbericbia and salmonella 58 is of fundamental importance sideropbores since serum and tissue extracts contain all nutrients essential to bacterial growth it is assumed that all materials required by the pathogen are available for its utilization this is not so the potentiality of various pathogens to survive in an animal depends upon their ability to obtain sufficient iron for active metabolism 31  all microorganisms with the possible exception of lactic acid bacteria require iron iron is used in the cytochrome system for energy production lactic acid bacilli do not use that system they derive energy from the glycolytic system the same is true for anaerobes although anaerobes may utilize both pathways although iron is one of the most prevalent of the earths elements in aerobic environments the amount of free iron available for assimilation by microorganisms is restricted due to the proclivity of ferric iron to form large insoluble aggregates at neutral or alkaline ph to acquire necessary iron from these aggregates most aerobic microorganisms have evolved specialized iron-solubilizing and transporting ligands chelating agents which have been termed siderophores a pathogen does not have to contend with the insolubility of ferric iron but must obtain iron from its host although the amount of iron in host fluids is more than adequate for microbial growth the iron-binding proteins transferrin and ferritin in the serum and lactoferrin in secretions sequester essentially all the iron in these environments the most likely mechanism whereby a bacterial pathogen successfully competes with these iron-binding proteins is via siderophore production enterochelin or enterobactin is a siderophore produced by salmonella typbimurium and possibly other enteric bacteria it antagonizes the iron-restricting mechanisms of the host and therefore is a virulence factor for s one of the most effective defense mechanisms a host might develop against iron-dependent parasites would be the production of antibody to siderophores perhaps anti-siderophore vaccines for animals might reduce the risk to man of antibiotic-resistant enterobacterial pathogens if the vaccinal antigens were rendered siderophore-specific for predetermined genera not the entire aerobic microflora the ubiquity of salmonellas suggests that they will be a problem for dairymen for some time in fact as long as dairy cows and calves are subjected to stressful environments hemorrage is not a prominent feature of the bovine respiratory disease which has borne the name hemorrhagic septicemia or shipping fever for many years the name evolved from habit rather than from a description of major lesions all septicemias show some evidence of hemorrhagic lesions many of which however are far iess than those which characterize the extensive hemorrhagic diatheses in 1880 louis pasteur described the organisn that caused cholera in fowls a disease characterized by enteritis with submucous and subserous hemorrhages and vascular congestionsurely a hemorrhagic disease later it was learned that pasteurs fowl cholera bacillus was indistinguishable from the organism of rabbit septicemia and of swine plague two other hemorrhagic diseases wherein isolations of this common generic organism had been made in 1886 hueppa in germany grouped the organism under one name bacterium septicemiae hemorrhagicae the hemorrhagic septicemia bacillus even in that neophytic era of microbiology it was reported that bacterium septicemiae hemorrbagicae was isolated from cases of pneumonia and sometimes septicemia of cattle while hemorrhage is a common lesion of septicemia only occasionally has that lesion been identified with bovine pneumonia in view of the primitive status of microbiology of that day no assurance can be given that the hemorrhagic lesions were in fact attributable to the organism isolated bacterium septicemiae hemorrhagicae subsequently was renamed the genus pasteurella was proposed and the species name of the animal from which the organism was isolated was assigned according to a classification scheme proposed also in 1886 by another german scientist flugge pasteurellosis was a name proposed shortly thereafter for a group of diseases in which pasteurella species were associated the fact that pasteurellosis in cattle is identified as a respiratory syndrome particularly in groups of confined young cattle exposed to crowded stressful conditions associated with shipping and not a hemorrhagic diathesis like fowl cholera was not sufficient cause to disassociate the firmly established synonym hemorrhagic septicemia from the disease and so it has remained even to this day pasteurellosis shipping fever in cattle attributed to pasteurella rnultocida is characterized by a bronchopneumonia with thickened pulmonic septae and moderate amounts of fibrin on the lung surface this is in contrast to the pneumonia attributed to pasteurella hemolytica where the amount of fibrin is much greater and the lesions represent a true fibrinous pleuropneumonia 24  affected animals show elevated temperatures difficulty in breathing pulmonary rries diarrhea pulmonary and subcutaneous edema and in advanced cases cyanosis of mucous membranes due to oxygen deficit brought about by the diminished area of functional lung parenchyma it is likely that primary infections by viruses like parainfluenza-3 virus ibr respiratory syncytial viruses bvd-md virus or others or by mycoplasmas can predispose to secondary invasion by pasteurellas through damaging the protective mucociliary clearance mechanisms in the trachea and bronchi and by impairing alveolar macrophage function there seems to be a marked tendency toward seasonal incidence of pasteurellosis that corresponds to activity of respiratory virus and mycoplasma infections particularly in the fall and winter the local inflammatory effect produced by viruses such as parainfluenza-3 or ibr leads to increased fluidity of the mucus coating with consequent sneezing and coughing these inevitably form endogenous aerosols in the respiratory passages that can result in the downward vortical carriage of bacteria from upper parts of the tract during inspiration 24  researchers the riddles of pathogenesis and immunoprophylaxis remain elusive and therefore speculative however in many areas of the country practicing veterinarians are becoming increasingly alarmed at the frequency of intractable and often fatal shipping fever cases from which antibiotic-resistant pasteurellas are being recovered 20 23  the pathopotentiators are unknown a search for virulent clones among nonpathogenic oropharyngeal commensals continues perhaps the behavior of another oropharyngeal commensal may shed some light on the mechanism of pathogenesis corynebacterium dipbtberiae a normal inhabitant of the oropharynx is harmless until it is attacked by phage then it releases a deadly exotoxin which produces serious disease in its host if phage is not a likely incriminating pathopotentiator perhaps the role of plasmids extrachromasomal genetic elements bearing pathogenic potentiators should be explored there appears to be some evidence that the number of pasteurellae resistant to one or more antibiotics is increasing 48  therefore the search for an effective immunogen becomes increasingly important live-culture vaccines for cattle are under study following earlier experience with live pasteurella multocida for use in poultry 24 the results of which have been encouraging but for relatively short duration studies of serological relationship between strains of pasteurella multocida by shigidi and mustafa in kartoum sudan 53 confirmed observations that there is considerable serologic heterogeneity of strains of p multocida heterogeneity of somatic antigen may be responsible for irregular results in the current system of vaccination against pasteurellosis even though indirect evidence indicates that immunogenicity of p multocida might be primarily but not completely dependent upon the capsule antigen as long as cattle are exposed to stress shipping fever or pulmonic pasteurellosis will be a problem knowledge obtained in the last quarter century has brought us partially closer to an understanding of the disease winter dysentery is an acute highly contagious catarrhal hemorrhagic enteritis of cattle characterized by a brief explosive attack of diarrhea occurrence of abdominal pain with the profuse watery sometimes bloody diarrhea identifies the disease as dysentery in the northern united states it occurs usually in housed cattle during winter and results in a moderate to marked drop in milk production in infected herds the attack rate may reach 100 but fatalities are rare the causative agent is unknown but is suspected to be a virus 11 34  in 1931 jones and little 26 described the disease and attributed its cause to a new species of bacterium vibrio jejuni subsequently renamed campylobacter jejuni in 1957 macpherson in canada challenged the vibrionic cause when he reproduced the disease with filtered fecal material and suggested that it is caused by a virus 34  there followed a period of some diagnostic confusion in differentiating winter dysentery infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bovine viral diarrhea-mucosal disease in the 1950 until roberts 50 characterized winter dysentery after a 3-yr study of 25 outbreaks and kahrs 27  employing serologic methods compared winter dysentery bvd-md and ibr he found winter dysentery was unrelated to these other infections roberts 50 reported that the incidence of the disease peaks every 10 yr suggesting that immunity develops in herds in a given area holding the disease in abeyance until susceptible herd replacements ultimately make up the milking herd permitting the disease to cycle again winter dysentery seems to affect young dairy cows most frequently those that are lactating pregnant or have recently calved usually are affected most severely milking cows often are first affected followed several days later by younger stock 11  changes in feed and weather often are suspected as predisposing factors other stress factors that might increase the incidence or severity of the disease include poor nutrition parturition stressful stabling and respiratory disease in confined animals the disease is not seen in cattle on pasture in the united states 11  but apparently it has been observed in cattle on pasture in australia 23  winter dysentery is not manifested by a noteworthy change in body temperature when elevated temperature does occur it usually precedes the onset of diarrhea by 24 to 48 h 11 and is accompanied by cough by the time diarrhea is apparent body temperature usually is normal the onset of diarrhea may be preceded by dullness depression decreased milk production slight to marked inappetance extreme thirst cough nasolacrimal discharge and excessive salivation with drooling abdominal pain is manifested by kicking at the abdomen and lying down and getting up at frequent intervals rumen atony is observed sometimes also there is loss of condition dehydration weakness tottering gait and occasionally recumbency with reluctance or inability to get up probably the two most common signs preceding the onset of diarrhea are a nasolacrimal discharge and a dry harsh hacking or moist cough 11  diarrhea strikes suddenly swiftly and copiously but is of short duration it often is characterized as explosive or projectile because of the considerable velocity with which intestinal contents are released another characteristic feature of this disease is a moderate to severe decrease in milk production animals that recently have calved seem to be most affected 11  in individual animals winter dysentery may last for a few hours but more often it lasts for a few days but less than a week in an infected herd the duration ranges between 3 and 4 wk with 2 wk most commonly cited 11  whether substantial immunity develops to winter dysentery is not known macpherson hypothesized that young calves are not susceptible because of maternal antibody acquired in colostrum or perhaps freedom from stress 34  he felt susceptibility was greater in 1 to 3-yr-old animals when passive maternal antibody protection has disappeared and physiologic stresses are mounting the sudden onset of diarrhea in adult cattle merits consideration of several diseases in the differential diagnosis among these are bvd-md dietetic gastroenteritis coccidiosis parasitosis salmonellosis johnes disease and rinderpest no effective vaccine is available for this disease and it is likely that such will not be available until the precise cause is determined it may be a distinct disease caused by a single infectious agent or a syndrome many treatments have been advocated but their merits have been questioned 50  abundant drinking water should be available for affected animals fox has suggested intravenous blood tranfusions for gaunt recumbent animals supported by gruels of high nutritional value given by mouth 21  winter dysentery has been known for 50 yr but because its cause has remained elusive it is still an enigma needing intensive study opinions may vary about the relative economic importance of these diseases arguments point to the need for an effective urgent system of reporting and analyzing morbidity and mortality data in dairy herds so that predictors and estimators can be provided on an immediate feedback continuous-flow basis in that way incidence and prevalence can be assessed in the population at risk predisposing factors hopefully will be made visible patterns of disease movement can be foretold and monitored and management more wisely attained the technology of microbiology and immunology if it advances as rapidly in the next quarter century as in the one past undoubtedly will answer many questions raised in this chronicle  reflecting on the safety zoo developing an integrated pandemics barrier model using early lessons from the covid-19 pandemic paul lindhout genserik reniers   people thinking about safety use quite a few animals as representations of safety concepts in addition to paper tigers dekker2014 dinosaurs cohen 2005 black swans taleb 2007 dragons elahi 2011 and elephants srivatsa 2018 michelle wucker 2016 introduced gray rhinos in  what by now could be called  the safety zoo michele wucker 2017 herself issued a reader discussion guide to complement her 2016 book about the gray rhino wucker 2016 in her 2017 discussion questions yet more animals appear all most welcome in the safety zoo nathan jaye 2017 interviews michele wucker on october 23 2017 asking her about black swans in safety science those stand for the combination of unlikely factors suddenly creating a big problem wucker explains that the gray rhino is staring you in the face ready to cause havoc youd better find out why you are not responding and use the opportunity to act while you still can then jaye continues asking about the elephant in the room wucker replies with an explanation about how difficult it can be to even see a nearby group of very large elephants in their natural habitat jaye and wucker then engage in a discussion about china and  among other things  about recurring influenza viruses comparing them with recurring gray rhinos not reacting to a charging rhino is the worst thing to do even when you are frightened prone to freezing on the spot or are scared to make a wrong choice later schleicher 2020 p4 writes that the gray rhino is a perfect complement to the black swan concept it is about engaging more thoroughly with reality recognizing obvious threats and our own biases and working to overcome them these animal-concepts all address safety problems we do not seem to handle very well we deem these problems as unknown ignore them accept their risk regard them as unlikely and we just dont act on them even when we really should and actually could and yes an ostrich bird springs to mind    some of us feel that mankind - living in the anthropocene era crutzen 2004 as a result of natural selection - is now in command of the planet but how vulnerable are we between a hot and violent earth beneath us and cold outer space surrounding us from above how bad could things actually get 
wucker 2017 speculates about planetary scale gray rhinos referring to some of the catastrophic dangers we can do little about one would be a magnetic storm coming from the sun wiping out the electrical part of our society similar to the carrington event in 1859 cliver 2005 another one which manifested itself before is the extinction of dinosaurs after the successive yucatan and shiva asteroid impacts 65 million years ago lerbekmo 2014 the prevention of such disasters is currently beyond our capabilities nature may throw earthquakes volcanic eruptions enormous firestorms and tsunamis at us in the wake of such impact mitigation would for the most part also be beyond our possibilities however as we are continuously watching every earth approaching rock we can see and are experimenting with ways to change their direction in case they pose a threat we are not at our wits end when it comes to future development of preventive means some preparation would be possible though like the global tsunami warning system demonstrates bernard  titov 2015 if an asteroid impact were to happen nonetheless and if part of mankind were to survive we would certainly need to show resilience early discovery of a dangerous space-rock could give us some time for preparation and this might help us to recover from the damage and shorten the aftermath for now in the midst of our current predicament the covid-19 pandemic we need to worry about much smaller yet more likely major disasters with more means at our disposal to avoid them and if all else fails to mitigate them and control the harm and damage they might do looking at the safety zoo it would seem that dragons were suspected around the wild animal market but this danger was deemed unknown it were grey mouses in local governments that accepted their risks and paper tigers looking away in fact they were looking away from a dinosaur in the living room the who rendered powerless by many years of budget cutting many western countries thought it were black-swans the far-east was dealing with and  with sars in mind - decided that it was highly unlikely such a pathogen would ever reach the west it turned out this was an error of judgement since the world became quickly aware of a contagious elephant in the doctors room presenting a great threat to the global population the response observed in most countries to the emerging pandemic was like not moving out of the way while being in the path of a charging gray rhino several other countries did better by taking action immediately however resulting in exceptionally low death tolls leaders in several other countries behaved more like an ostrich since they downplayed denied or ignored the pandemic the consequences of ineffective responses are exceptionally high death tolls these notions raise many questions by many people about what it takes to choose the right strategy for health safety vulnerable groups critical functions essential services and supplies society and economy in relation to pandemic risk although - at first glance - the covid-19 pandemic first of all presents as a health crisis we contend there is more to it than health currently getting near to all of our attention from a safety management point of view the world is confronted with an unwanted event and huge adverse consequences by june 10 2020 the growing total death toll in over 190 countries passed 408000 who 2020f who 2020 while societal disruption and global economic damage continue to develop our current predicament the covid-19 pandemic has an anatomy similar to that of major accidents such as the bhopal- tsjernobyl- and seveso disasters there are multiple causal factors important risks to consider prevention measures to take and  in case all those fail  a well prepared repression system consisting of preparation emergency response and mitigation to put in place since several critical observations can be made originating from this background we would like to explore in this study learning from the current covid-19 pandemic the possibilities for applying and improving current safety management and risk control concepts to potential future pandemics we do not distinguish between industrial- chemical- occupational- environmental- biological- social or medical safety and -security since risk control touches upon many disciplines and expertise areas to this end we want to look at pandemics in general from the point of view of major accident hazard risk control as it is in use in eg the chemical industry ec 2012 in health safety and environment management systems in in hospitals paris et al 2019 niv et al 2017 and in live stock and breeding farms biosafety and biosecurity systems heckert et al2011 this study centres on the following questionwhat could have been done better in prevention and repression of the covid-19 pandemic from a safety management and risk control perspective
 the overall design of this study follows the case study method yin et al 2006 it consists of a sequence of steps to follow in the research process here simplified from eisenhardt 1989 to design data gathering from literature and observations analysis and construction of a theoretical model and a critical reflection on the outcome the latitudinal descriptive case study form we use requires a blue-print to provide a structure for data gathering yin et al 2006 to this end we use a shortlist of aspects kohn 1997 derived from a preliminary literature search the quality and validity of our findings are protected by using multiple independent and peer-reviewed sources where available and by triangulation of data originating from different stakeholders mays  pope 2000 our research design consists of three main parts each requiring different methods and techniques
literature search

 since a wide range of subjects is involved we explored literature in a series of separate searches using the scoping review technique smith et al 2015 we started with a preliminary search to derive initial search terms for the successive literature searches per subject we used a progressively extended set of search terms and inclusionexclusion criteria the subjects are listed in the case study blue-print see table1
 several inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to protect the quality of the sourcesprimary peer-reviewed scientific sources from various databases and via reference listingssecondary sources cronin et al 2008 from government organisations and international institutionstertiary grey sources wessels 1997 only if particularly relevant to the subjectstime period 2000-2020 with a few exceptions for essential sources from before 2000we excluded publications only available in other languages than english and dutchwe screened sources found by means of the search terms and the inexclusion criteriasearch terms are successively derived from the sources found and different subsets of terms were used for each subject to ensure that important sources were includeddatabases used scopus medline google scholar academia research gate and associated proprietary databasesconstruction of a theoretical model
 the risk management model we use in this study consists of three well proven elementsa 6 steps risk awareness approach oliveira et al 2017 enders 2001 iso 310002009a risk matrix based assessment system iso 310002009 anda bow-tie timelinecausality model lger et al 2008 khakzad et al 2012
 these elements are generally accepted and widely used risk management techniques and their combination enables mapping analysing and comparing the outcomes of safety management and risk control approaches over time in support of the theoretical model we analyse the process observed as the current covid-19 pandemic is unfolding from our literature findings we deduce a series of generic pandemic scenario events a range of countermeasures and a suite of supporting activities the way we do this follows the steps in a meta-synthesis process cronin et al 2008 polit  beck 2006critical reflection
 comparing our ideals with observed practice is at the roots of every critical reflection no matter which belief culture or emotion we come from learning from this comparison is what it is all about to this end we compare observed practice and the ideal outcome according to a reference frame derived from the theoretical model both the ideals and the outcome of our learning need to be constantly debated van woerkom 2010 critical reflection is a sociological methodology often used in education but also in a variety of other disciplines fook et al 2006 in practice the method in its simplest form consists of an introduction followed by two stages hickson 2010 1 deconstruction of reality and 2 reconstruction towards achieving the ideal outcomelimitations reliability and validity
 this study is limited with respect to the number of sources used versus the number of sources available the data gathering via literature search started mid-april 2020 and continued up to june 3 2020 by that time it became clear that the internet had grown considerably reflected by an astounding 5000000000 hits on google the scientific community had produced a huge number of papers indicated by some 133000 hits in google scholar over 38000 related research items on researchgatenet and 16500 related papers on academiaedu all found by searching on covid-19 this overwhelming quantity of information defies any attempt to get an overview any time soon since the exploratory work for this study was conducted by the authors and the danger of subjectivity can therefore not be simply discarded we contend that the study is repeatable and verifiable the reliability of each observation is based on multiple sources from before and after the start of the current pandemic our own interpretations are clearly identified as such by the choice of wording we have chosen the research methodology and the time period for searching as described in the above to ensure that our findings  learning from the current covid-19 pandemic  are relevant to the framework of safety management based risk control of pandemics we propose the increasing threat of viral pandemics such as spanish flu 1918 hong kong flu 1968 hivaids 1981 sars 2002 influenza a2009 ebola 2014 mers 2015 and several others francis et al 2019 kain and fowler 2019 jebril 2020 has started a sense of urgency in emergency preparedness especially in intensive care units icu and in elderly homes preparation for a pandemic should include 1-coordinated surveillance in order to spot new viruses 2-scalable emergency response 3-quickly mass produced vaccines 4-excellent communication and 5-pre-approved research plans instead we remain largely underprepared kain  fowler 2019 p3-4 spotting a virus requires a detection method testing capability and a warning system kain  fowler 2019 the scalability refers to surge capacity of equipment physical space human resources and system sheikhbardsiri et al 2017 p612 the later part of the period of some 100 years preceding our current predicament showed a series of multiple and returning h2n2 h1n1 and h3n2 pandemic influenza virus outbreaks francis et al 2019 by 2013 the who had completed guidance on pandemic influenza emergency risk management who 2013 preparing for a next influenza virus pandemic has been subject of who studies since this resulted in a preparedness framework issued in 2018 who 2018 several countries have developed national derivatives of these plans by 2019 the dutch government finalized the latest national safety strategy nvs 2019 mentioning a large scale outbreak of an infectious disease most likely an influenza pandemic the plan revolves around prevention    defence and    reinforcement and fits within the context of an integrated foreign countries and safety strategy nvs 2019 p892839 these emergency preparedness plans focus on influenza viruses which are returning and rather well known viruses francis et al 2019 because of their assumed higher likelihood more recent outbreaks from 2014 onwards however were unexpectedly originating from the ebola virus and the mers corona virus our current predicament is the novemberdecember 2019 outbreak of the sars-cov-2 virus causing the coronavirus disease 2019 abbreviated to covid-19 the outbreak was first detected in december 2019 when several clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause that were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in wuhan were recognized zhu et al 2020 p727 hua  shaw 2020 p2 a timeline was established starting from the first reported case - patient 1 - on december 1 2019 yan et al 2020 several detailed studies of the onset by wu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 and zhang et al 2020 did not lead to certainty about how the virus transferred to humans zhang li et al 2020 suggest that airborne transmission is the main culprit chinese officials from the wuhan municipal health commission reported an epidemic by december 31 wang et al 2020 shortly after the outbreak was reported to the who from wuhan city a major industrial centre in hubei province china on december 31 2019 after the declaration by chinese officials of covid-19 as the culprit on january 6 2020 the genome sequence was published on virologicalorg zhang 2019 a day later by january 20 an international group of experts concluded that covid-19 was similar to the sars virus of 2002 that evidence was found of human-to-human transmission and that they had developed a diagnostic protocol being tried out from january 13 onwards to detect the virus in patients corman et al 2020 the virus particles are some 100 nanometers in size consist of rna and proteins are decomposing above 50 o celsius and most likely originate from chrysanthemum bats or pangolin jebril 2020 zhou et al 2020 on january 30 the who assigned the public health emergency of international concern pheic status to this outbreak thereby underlining the international threat wangwang 2020 rivm 2020 initial average primary reproduction numbers r0 of 15 up to 492 were reported yan et al 2020 on february 8 the who stated that the virus had reached 24 countries ghebreyesus 2020 the who declared the outbreak a pandemic on march 11 2020 who 2020a who 2020 almost 2 weeks before on february 27 2020 the first covid-19 case was recorded in the netherlands rivm 2020 next the dutch government activated its national procedures according to the dutch national safety strategy plan nvs 2019 based on the integrated risk analysis on national safety anv 2019 and started taking measures as described in the concept directive covid-19 rivm 2020 slowly it became clear that some 40 of people diagnosed with the virus get mild symptoms 40 get pneumonia 15 experiences severe disease and 5 becomes critically ill and of those about one third die from it who 2020c by may 15 2020 the estimated economic impact had exceeded the effect of the 2008 financial crisis and large parts of society and economy were put on hold who 2020c p1 in many countries the pandemic was still rapidly developing but in a few countries across the globe the impact of the pandemic remained at least a factor 100 less in magnitude at the same time in more remote areas such as the solomon islands in oceania thanks to travel restrictions the virus had not yet arrived after 5 months since the onset of the pandemic beginning of december 2019 who 2020b who 2020 2020c while at the end of april 2020 china is recovering from the outbreak and is gradually bringing back wuhan city to normal business levels the pandemic is still sky-rocketing in other countries at its peak in yet other countries and in more remote places on the planet it has not even arrived astounding differences between countries are observed also the spatial variations within countries seem large as illustrated by covid-19 hot spots for example in the milan region in northern italy new york state in the usa and the province noord-brabant in the netherlands although the death count per country heavily depends on the point it has reached in the process following the outbreak who 2020c a comparison between countries is indicative when referring to approximately the same point this provides a first glance at the effect their national strategies have had on the spread of the covid-19 virus chang et al 2020 identify 180 countries and territories struck by the pandemic by march 21 2020 of which eight were most affected besides these eight countries which are china italy spain iran germany france south korea and the usa also several other countries are of special relevance since they adopted clearly deviating strategies obtaining clearly different results these other countries are new zealand taiwan hong kong finland belgium and the netherlands the dutch national television channel npo1 reported 5600 officially tested and recorded victims and another 3600 suspected covid-19 victims on may 15 2020 bringing the total estimated death toll on 9200 by june 10 2020 the official death toll in the netherlands reached 6031 who 2020f who 2020 leading to an estimated total of 10000 dutch covid-19 victims each country used a different strategy in their approach of the covid-19 pandemic their strategies had different outcomes of death toll versus time figure 1
shows that a quick response with mitigation measures makes all the difference where china south korea new zealand hong kong and taiwan managed to reduce spreading from the earliest moment on leading to the number of local outbreaks and the resulting mortality counts staying low the other countries showed prolonged and higher growth rates of death tolls wang et al 2020 khafaie and rahim 2020 who 2020b who 2020 moes 2020 vpro-ovt 2020 who 2020f who 2020 table 2

 the world is a very complex dynamic and changing place our knowledge is equally limited so like in the distant past we then fear the dragons elahi 2011 ale et al 2020 part of the world around us is unknown due of lacking awareness of its existence for another part we know it is there but we have no knowledge about it the mysterious part we are both not aware of and have no knowledge about is often referred to as unknown-unknown or unk-unk petersen et al 2013 unknown risk though is not as unknown as the unknown-unknown category is sometimes presumed to be lindhout 2019 unknown does not always imply not foreseeable ramasesh  browning 2014 rather often safety improvement action can actually be taken instead of merely settling for unknown and do nothing about such foreseeable danger lindhout  reniers 2017 this requires sufficient risk appetite however gjerdrum  peter 2011we are fully aware of them yet accept their risk
 in this probabilistic approach as the probability gets closer to zero extremely large consequences may become acceptable even without specific measures being taken simply following procedures by grey mouses can get us there verhagen 2018 this implies that a large nationwide disaster scenario could be regarded as acceptable since its risk is properly controlled hse 2001 p43 the probability may not really be zero though hence such a disaster is not completely ruled out and it must therefore be considered and accepted as a residual risk we deem such risks to be unlikelywe know about specific safety threats yet regard them as highly unlikely or impossible
 if we are not fully aware of how identified threats to safety might lead to unwanted events  because they are seen as too complex interacting multiple causal dynamic entropic mol 2003 or they are depending on conditions  then we might one day suddenly unexpectedly be overwhelmed by a black swan taleb 2007 murphy and conner 2012 ale et al 2020obvious safety risks actually cause damage yet we do not act on them
 we build safety system routines to improve safety yet we create bureaucracy while doing so improving on safety management systems in industry and health care may lead to paper tigers dekker 2014 this makes safety management focus on going through the required administrative motions rather than keep awareness high to spot safety threatseveryone sees a known and feasible opportunity to improve yet we pretend it doesnt exist
 a paradoxical observation done by cohen 1998 cohen 2005 in a wider more general area than only safety management shows that managers pretend known and major improvement potential not to exist even though means to realize them are available he coined this looking away from the dinosaur in the living room the obvious next thing to do in order to make a leap forwardwe recognize big and emerging threats to our safety but we still dont act
 pandemic risks are an example of a huge threat known to have created damage in the past and expected to do so again in the future but is not receiving adequate attention so that prevention activities are in place and mitigation is well prepared when srivatsa 2018 mentioned the elephant in the doctors room he was addressing the emerging danger of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections said to be capable of killing 10 million people before the year 2050we are watching immediate lethal danger of epic proportion and hesitate to act
 this means - as if the above was not enough to describe the frighteningly unresponsive human condition - we can even deny and ignore a big rapidly developing global disaster out to destroy millions of us closing in on us at high speed and do not move when a gray rhino charges wucker 2016 p6we watch the threat coming at us and freeze
 people believe their eyes more than their ears an unknown and invisible enemy is initially met with unbelief much like animals in nature we are not only hesitant scared and avoid engaging in a fight but we can even freeze in the face of approaching danger sagliano et al 2014 people sometimes appear to have ostrich bird -like ways to go about sudden threats although disaster risk management preparation and response were mentioned in the who plans for the next pandemic who 2013 who 2018 the approaches presented by the many countries following their guidance showed a range of problems
prepared for influenza

 we have all been preparing more for the next influenza virus outbreak rather than for a next new unknown virus pandemic outbreak the majority of activities deployed for an influenza outbreak are valid for any virus outbreak kain and fowler 2019 madhav et al 2017 however the covid-19 virus differs from an influenza virus assumptions made in the emergency preparedness protocols may therefore not always be applicable render some of the influenza specific preparation activities unusable and slow down the response since new measures need to be developed on the spot with limited knowledge about the pathogen recently the who priority for research and development was placed at medical countermeasures including vaccines therapeutics and diagnostics to cover this gap who 2020c p15 preparation for any virus might have brought us in a better position on eg detection method pre-approved vaccine research vaccine development required hospital space testing commodities icu staff and ventilator equipment kain  fowler 2019 case fatality rates cfr of eg influenza-a are between 0011 dawood 2012 and 01 anderson et al 2020 other viruses may have significantly higher cfrs such as covid-19 2 sars 96  and mers 35 yan et al 2020 peeri et al 2020 khafaie and rahim 2020 also the initially observed primary reproduction number r0 of the covid-19 virus r05 indicates it spreads between 2 and 3 times faster than influenza viruses r015 khafaie and rahim 2020 jebril 2020 anderson et al 2020 as cfr is clearly higher and bats and perhaps pangolin in the south-east asian region are a reservoir of sars-like corona viruses li 2005 the preparation for a pandemic of any virus would have been more substantial and most likely this would have made us be more cautious more keen to act and preparing more robust measures in fact many animals are reservoirs of many pathogens han et al 2015confusion about the onset
 we also argue that along these lines there is still much to investigate about the causal tree preceding the first confirmed case of patient-1 yan et al 2020 of course this requires full transparency of the events in the wuhan region leading to this first case also a better understanding of how containment of the new virus was handled between december 31 2019 and the january 18 2020 record breaking wuhan new year celebration kynge et al 2020 is needed at that time the term prevention as it was used by wang  wang 2020 was applied to stopping further infections in an ongoing pandemic from a safety system point of view  regarding the pandemic in its entirety  this would have to be labelled repression or mitigation the word prevention as used in safety management refers to all that is being done to avoid a first outbreak
lack of education and involvement of citizens and workers

 education would make a difference education increases awareness less unsafe behaviour would improve prevention more acceptance of and better adherence to social distancing measures during the repression of a pandemic would be achieved for example chang et al 2020 mention a home quarantine strategy which  if explained adopted and implemented correctly  could help to reduce spreading the virus to other members of a household the who 2013 seeks more alignment between their guidance and the many member states national disaster management structures an example of a successful approach is found with the  in fact still ongoing  pandemic of the hivaids virus a worldwide information program comprising education and empowerment of the population groups most involved with the onset of this pandemic and other groups affected later chin 1990 was started some 4 years after the onset mann  kay 1991 by the who 1987 based on the knowledge acquired about the particular relevance of gender sexual behaviour and education of citizens for the prevention of further spread of the disease chin 1990 dowsett et al 1998 gupta 2000 also in agricultural biosafety and biosecurity systems there is an acknowledged need for education and training among workers heckert et al 2011 hence there is a need for education training and empowerment
treating a continuous threat as a single event

 if pandemics are to occur increasingly more often wef 2019 kain and fowler 2019 madhav et al 2017 they will become part of our daily lives even more as hivaids and influenza are today irrespective of the specific pathogen potentially causing a pandemic several generic countermeasures could already be taken identifiable areas in the world having a spark-risk ie where onset is more likely madhav et al 2017 both preventive and repressive measures are necessary here prevention would include eg preventive prophylaxis and spatial- and temporal segregation the repressive measures required to quickly contain an outbreak in such areas could include investing in existing public health methods such as routine health monitoring regular vaccination detection activities and emergency drills but also new measures other areas may be more susceptible to spread risk ie where the situation enables spreading more than elsewhere necessitating other supplementary mitigation measures madhav et al 2017 this continuous presence of routine pandemic prevention activities creates attention awareness and caution among the general public and health care providers wang  wang 2020 especially in regions susceptible for spark-risk the onset of an epidemic or pandemic madhav et al 2017 this compares to earthquake shelter- fire evacuation- and cruise ship safety drills an involved educated and trained citizen can become partner in both the prevention and the repression of pandemics countries would become more resilient if many citizens take part in some form of volunteer disaster fighting wef 2019 it would certainly help to satisfy the scalability requirement practice shows that red cross volunteers former- or retired health care workers and many other groups spontaneously and creatively display a plethora of activities to do just that
disregarding the need for resilience in societal design

 a pandemic creates disruption in society and economy that this will happen more often in the future is presented as an acknowledged fact who 2013 2020c wef 2019 since it might happen this points at a government responsibility for creation and safeguarding of societal resilience a truly daunting task consecutive pandemics might not even allow a full societal recovery in between this would have a profound impact on both long term global economic development and on social wellbeing and social stability in many countries affected the who 2020c points this out and individual countries are to take action businesses buildings schools public space and transportation systems are not designed to accommodate for    a sustainable steady state time period of low-level or no transmission    in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine who 2020c p10 if pandemics are recurrent recovery periods in between are also an agreed prepared and detailed societal economical and ethical post-pandemic recovery plan and practical preparation for resilience are missing before the covid-19 pandemic earlier economic financial and political considerations have put priorities elsewhere in societies leading to a slow response to major logistical problems and little socio-economic resilience
poor national procedures

 consensus between neighbouring countries is lacking this is leading to local regional and country level differences most noticeable in social distancing measures and emergency preparedness the safety management aspects mentioned in the dutch national safety strategy plan nvs 2019 ie identification prevention pro-action preparation response and aftercare as necessary are not directly linked to pandemic risk control when it comes to risk identification this is achieved via an integrated risk analysis on national safety which is  in line with the who 2013 who 2018  focusing on an influenza pandemic anv 2019 p25 all other risk control aspects and activities to implement appropriate measures are covered by the dutch institute for public health and environment rivm as laid down in the concept directive covid-19 cdc19 guidance rivm 2020 the word prevention is used as a label on the protection of vulnerable groups and on individual citizen behaviour as to prevent further spreading of the influenza virus the nvs anv and cdc19 are not aiming at avoiding a pandemic altogether and therefore do not deal with prevention in the safety management sense pro-action is not mentioned preparation is detailed in a range of organisational measures in the cdc19 and response consists of a description of patient treatment from first detection via home care hospital care up to icu care aftercare is not described and therefore - by default - assumed to be arranged via regular care
not building up an emergency stockpile and scalable local production capacity

 at the end of april 2020 the measures applied in practice in the netherlands consisted of personal hygiene hospital staff wearing personal protective equipment and the public applying social distancing care professionals dealing with the most vulnerable group in elderly care institutions had no access to personal protection however health care- and infection case contacts tracing staff were a constraining factor scarcity of material and equipment supplies led to criticality of hospital and icu capacity jeopardised the timely distribution of personal protection equipment in care institutions and testing among the general public mainly due to privacy concerns no contactless temperature monitoring and contacts tracing phone-app were introduced in many countries such as the netherlands in direct response to the test test test instruction coming from the who director-general ghebreyesus 2020 and of the detect test isolate care quarantine contacts strategy who 2020c p8-10 international press and digital media had shown the presence of anti-spreading measures in several countries already very shortly after the onset of the pandemic eg face masks infrared temperature sensors drive through virus testing booths disinfection spraying of public places and smart phone based contacts tracing methods in countries not having built-up an emergency supplies stockpile and not having production capacity locally available the supply problems were paramount including in china wang  wang 2020 these logistic problems have led to health professionals working without adequate personal protection and to the general public not contributing to reducing the r0 below 10 as much as would have been possible these problems explain much of the death toll differences observed in figure 1
no guidance for being responsive to needs of vulnerable groups

 vulnerable groups whether due to age other physical or mental diseases to unhealthy or overcrowded living conditions eg in facilities for asylum seekers and prisons or due to social isolation in health care facilities to poverty or to low socio-economic status all need special attention who 2020c p11 no specific guidance was available with suitable well proven solutions and best practices derived from previous epidemics during previous epidemics the overwhelmed health-care system creates yet another vulnerable group those in need of postponed treatment due to this higher death rates were observed for other causes anderson et al 2020 this underlines the need for preparedness for these groups
case history not recorded in detail

 at first statistical data about the different health stages which persons with a diagnosed pathogen infection go through zhong 2017 are highly uncertain most so immediately after the onset as pandemic spread grows such data can provide useful records such records would gradually shed more light on the success rates of treatment options used in various countries accurately kept records also allow detailed analysis on vulnerability of specific social groups weiss 2020 however as health systems in various countries were overwhelmed their records became increasingly incomplete rather than more accurate some countries did not keep records
early swot analysis

 
wang  wang 2020 published an early systematic analysis of strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of the covid-19 epidemic prevention and control strategy by the end of march 2020 of the four highest priority improvements they identify three are about emergency response and one is about strengthening the economic structure furthermore various aspects of social security psychological issues economical damage and opportunities for education in relation to emergencies with infectious diseases were mentioned wang  wang 2020 p81112 do mention prevention of public health emergencies and describe such emergencies as a threat to all human beings practical issues they mentioned are weak wildlife market supervision basic health security facilities lagging behind and hazard risk assessments although it is early days for a holistic swot analysis on the covid-19 pandemic we underline the necessity of further evaluation
criticality of leadership

 transactional leadership aimed at an exchange of rewards for fulfilling expectations grote 2019 p60 seems necessary switching between fixed and flexible attitudes and between different safety management modes of operation paris et al 2019 are needed to restore society and economy after a disaster to fully recover from a disaster putting back damaged systems to establish a new normal at least as reliable and robust as before if not improved is needed pettersen  schulman 2019 p460461 the importance of leadership during a crisis cannot be underestimated henley  roy 2020 wonder whether female leaders were more successful during the early part of the covid-19 pandemic they suggest that firm action new zealands premier jacinda ardern go hard and go early and an effective communication strategy jacinda ardern stay home save lives chosen by new zealand taiwan denmark finland south korea norway iceland and germany were of paramount importance for adherence to social distancing measures the question is whether the opposite was also observed have male leaders done considerably worse henley  roy 2020 point out that the performance of countries with the highest death toll per april 20 2020 the usa 34203 italy 23660 and spain 20453 who 2020b who 2020 would confirm this observation although clear examples of very effective male leadership also exist since on the same date vietnam 0 the czech republic 188 greece 110 australia 70 who 2020b who 2020 had managed the pandemic rather well we contend that speed and quality of action and of communication determined success rather than gender of the leaders
lacking resilience

 
wiig and fahlbruch 2019p1 mention the range of related fields the many definitions of resilience and several challenges ao the many theories and the lack of empirical evidence in several areas one such area is the lack of knowledge about the role of stakeholders moser et al 2019 p212627 point out that resilience as a concept gradually evolved from the ability to bounce back via coping mechanism via capacity to adapt to impacts and prevention strategy towards system change and radical transformation pettersen and schulman 2019 p460461 see resilience as a means to cope with unexpected events and note that resilience is described in many ways eg rebound stretching an organisation robustness the magnitude of disruption caused by an unwanted event determines the effort to neutralize the adverse effects leading to resilience types kinds scales or levels macrae  wiig 2019 p126 pettersen  schulman 2019 p460461 woods 2015 describes resilience is as sustainable adaptabilitytiernan et al 2019 suggest a nuanced exploration of the concept of adaptive resilience woods 2015 defines this as a network architectures that can sustain the ability to adapt to future surprises as conditions evolve
ethical concerns

 the relatively short medical emergency phase after the pandemic onset is followed by a long mitigation phase lasting until an effective vaccine becomes available in many countries society builds up resistance to the constraints imposed on personal lives business operations leisure time and travelling the behaviour of individuals not respecting temporary distancing and hygiene measures and individuals engaging in criminal activities such as providing sub-standard medical supplies or selling fake medicines may require specific temporary legislation to allow adequate law enforcement governments could be tempted to hastily introduce new legislation without respecting democratic decision-making procedures to introduce election driven aspects into implementation practice and not ensure a timely end to its being in force smits and van duijn 2020 jones 2020 major ethical concerns emerge not only with criteria to be used during triage when health professionals are suddenly facing limited health care capacity and medical supplies berlinger et al 2020 who 2007 who 2008 but also with the constraints of fundamental rights with a lack of democratic debate on proportionality of fines or imprisonment with uncertainty about which precise behaviour causes the pathogen to spread and about treating all citizens equal when taking away their livelihood curtail exertion of democratic rights and limit access to health care even more ethical issues arise about criminalizing peoples proximity to loved ones about focusing on physical health and ignoring mental health police intrusion in private life and even about messing with peoples zest for life health ethics aims to contribute to wellbeing avoidance of damage respecting autonomy and seeks justice in an inclusive way beauchamp  childress 2012 an inquisitive approach of prevention may lead to the discovery of new preventive barriers placed well before the onset of pandemics since within 4 months time a fully-fledged global covid-19 pandemic emerged we contend that practice has underlined that also opportunities for new repressive barriers to be placed shortly after the onset need further investigation as the impact of a pandemic is large we contend that continuous searching for new barriers both preventive and repressive is justified we have found several lines of thinking opening up possibilities for development of new barrier types
embrace the safety management paradigm

 on february 8 2020 who director-general ghebreyesus 2020 mentioned 216 health threat signals had the attention of the who of which covid-19 was just one hence the pandemic danger is both big and growing experts are pointing out that pandemics will occur more often in the future seeing pandemics as a given madhav et al 2017 or as a a continuum of pandemic phases who 2013 distracts the attention away from the introduction of preventive countermeasures treating pandemics as a medical emergency who 2020c may stimulate emergency preparedness and mitigation but leaves prevention - in the safety management sense - out of scope placing the focus of attention on repression implies looking less at what caused an event evidently these lines of thinking will result in avoidable repeats of the unwanted event only working on the repression aspect of pandemics implies that the great value of prevention is for a part ignored as a consequence of that education and training of people working with animals remain underutilized as a preventive means moreover nobody in their right mind would knowingly want to accidentally start a global pandemic there is much work to do in the prepandemic period madhav et al 2017 p326 the current line of thinking does not prepare society for dealing with the social disruption and the huge effort needed for socio-economic recovery wef 2019 we contend that safety management would be a better paradigm for dealing with pandemic risk
segregation

 with the australian mathematical model acemod analysts managed to predict that school closures are not contributing much to the social distancing strategy assuming compliance levels are above 70 also the acemod analysis results are pointing at a minimum requirement of 80 to 90 adherence to social distancing measures in order to effectively control the pandemic chang et al 2020 with allowing the lower grade schools to re-open on may 11 2020 the dutch government took the first step on the path towards bringing society back on its feet this was combined with a temporal segregation measure half the kids in the mornings half the kids in the afternoons extending early morning shop opening hours especially for the older more vulnerable age group is another example of age segregation another strategy would be to quickly compartmentalize society in case of emergency limit traffic between compartments and introduce robust surveillance this would qualify as spatial segregation one of the questions here is whether spreading of the covid-19 virus could also be slowed down at intermediate distances somewhere in between social distancing with short distances - 3 feet who 2020e who 2020 15 meter rivm 2020 6 feet cdc 2020 or 2 meters jebril 2020 - and closed borders with neighbouring countries at long distances say 300 kilometres such intermediate distances would be on the scale of a city or region an in depth investigation of the effects of closing the perimeter around eg wuhan city singapore and hong kong in the first months of 2020 could offer sufficient proof of the potential of such measures
embrace biosecurity and biosafety practices

 employers having workers in close contact with animals should comply with safe work legislation in all countries the united nations safe work branch the international labour organisation ilo in geneva issues best practice based guidance for safe work the current guidance from the ilo 2001 ilo 2010 does not touch upon epidemic or pandemic risk or upon the principles of biosafety and biosecurity however barker 2015 p16 describes a case where 10 infected animals crossed paths with 24500 other animals underway in the livestock trade in the uk during the 2001 foot and mouth disease epidemic law 2006 this example indicates that also animal-to-animal a2a transfer needs to be minimized during livestock production and transport in fact the adoption of biosecurity and biosafety principles will be essential for successful prevention of pandemics in all countries this is most necessary in spark prone regions in development countries madhav et al 2017 where the international community can invest in long term biosecurity programmes the cost of such programmes is dwarfed by the damage caused by a global pandemic these programmes could set up biosecurity plans for small producers assess risks implement bio-safe working methods and put in place a monitoring and warning system using veterinary control on animal isolation sanitation and transport conan et al 2012 alhaj 2011 kimman et al 2008 barker 2015 cardona 2008 zhou et al 2019 gonzalez 2015
prepare for all known danger

 it is known where the danger comes from the biggest threats are the so called select agents and they are of viral bacterial fungal prions    and other origins gonzalez 2015 p1015-1016 selectagentsgov 2020 much is known about related virus families zhu et al 2019 p732 yan et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 pre-approved research plans kain  fowler 2019 and even intensified continuous research on these known sources of pandemic risk are appropriate and justified when considering the magnitude of damage caused by the global pandemic instead of preparing for influenza pandemic the who could initiate worldwide cooperation in order to extend the scope of pandemics preparation activities to several other threats from the select agents list selectagentsgov 2020
use of safety system failure indicators

 pandemic prevention consisting of a chain of several preventive measures connected in series can be assisted by listening to weak signals delatour et al 2013 and early warning signals paltrinieri et al 2019 such signals indicate that the likelihood of an outbreak may have increased and that attention or action is needed ideally if a procedural or technical measure in the chain fails this would be detected and corrective action would be triggered immediately while the other measures in the chain still prevent the onset of a pandemic the failing measure could be reinstated if the whole chain of measures fails the pathogen emerges at the end detection of such a system failure could be done by direct detection of the pathogen on contaminated personal protection equipment indirect detection eg by detection of infected people having symptoms eg elevated temperature has become a proven alternative the covid-19 virus was found in waste water jebril 2020 so could bio-sampling sewers be a way to detect and localize a zoonosis before an outbreak sniffer dogs can be trained to smell even intentionally hidden and well wrapped illegal substances barker 2015 so could dogs less vulnerable to the virus as they seem to be shi et al 2020 be trained as reliable covid-19 sniffers the nosais trial in france and in and other countries may provide the answer roe 2020 biosensors may offer an alternative technical solution for covid-19 qiu et al 2020 the development of a reliable detection method for a new pathogen takes time however corman et al 2020 hence failure detection earlier in the prevention part of the chain of events is needed in practice that could be done by detection of failures to perform of the successive measures lined up in the chain as we have learned from man-made disasters with nuclear power plants and high-risk chemical plants also our ways to go about handling animals could be made safer with extra layers of preventive and repressive measures vadimovna  sergeevich 2017 as this is a proven way to control risks with an unacceptably large potential impact it may also be useful as a tool to control pandemic risk in the chemical industry a similar chain of measures often referred to as concentric layers of protection baybutt 2003 vadimovna and sergeevich 2017 if the primary containment fails there is a secondary containment protecting people and environment this approach is used around many industrial high risk locations and often combined with an emergency shut down esd provision markowski  siuta 2017 such failure detection and esd can even be working automatically if suitable equipment is installed bio facilities could be treated in much the same way as high risk chemical facilities are ec 2012 this leads to the concept of a quarantine delay circle around a bio facility as a secondary containment measure the risk management model we construct in this study is based on three well proven elements firstly risk management distinguishes several successive time phases associated with increasing awareness and moving towards action there are many ways to do this though oliveira et al 2017 enders 2001 iso 310002009 in this study we use 6 generally applicable risk awareness steps 1-discovering a danger 2-acknowledge it 3-investigate and understand its nature 4-assess its effect magnitude and evaluate the risk 5-take appropriate preventive and repressive countermeasures and 6-evaluate incidents in support of learning and improvement secondly risk management can be done in different ways depending on the probability and effects of an unwanted event this approach shows risk the interrelation between likelihood and adverse effect to this end such an event can be plotted in an extended risk matrix figure 2
 if the probability of an unwanted event is close to 100 we avoid it by taking specific strong and effective measures such as using other methods prohibition by law or allowing prescribed safety measures only often referred to as the precautionary principle are potential effects very large and uncertainties are large as well then the cautionary principle applies aven 2019 these two constitute the deterministic approach to safety making the unwanted event impossible if the event has a smaller probability we often use the risk matrix a square with an effect scale versus a probability scale an unwanted event can be plotted in this risk field within the framework of a safety management system the tiled centre area of this risk matrix can be used to show which effect and probability combinations are acceptable which need risk reduction measures and which are not acceptable this dual approach principle of risk control is widely used in industry iso 310002009 at the left and top of the deterministic and probabilistic areas in figure 2 is a zone where probability andor effect are zero so nothing will happen here at the lower right is a zone which we consider as not realistic at the lower left we situate the possible yet unlikely extreme events risk management can be applied yet there is rather little we actually do in this corner here are opportunities for better repression but certainly also for better prevention and more education since prevention offers a very attractive perspective we want to take this into account explicitly thirdly what happens before and after an unwanted event follows one of many possible scenarios involving several causal factors which may occur at the same time the term prevention is used to describe the risk control on what happens before an unwanted event takes place the term repression is used for minimizing all the negative effects which occur after the event the event is situated in between cause and effect hence the term unwanted central event is used here such central events normally have both multiple possible causes and multiple possible effects an unwanted central event is therefore preceded by a causal tree and followed by a consequences tree usually referred to as a bow-tie because of its shape see figure 3
 thus far as far as we can see bowtie models have been introduced to manage covid-19 risks for health and safety from a worker perspective wajidi 2020 manton johnson miles scanlon  cowley 2020 and from an organisation perspective protecht 2020 but not from a global pandemic risk management perspective in this model the unwanted central event in fault-tree terminology also referred to as top-event either happens or does not happen depending on whether preventive barriers in the causal tree stop one or more causal factors from contributing to a pandemic scenario unfolding in time in case the central event happens repressive barriers are put in place to stop mitigate and minimize the adverse effects preventive and repressive barriers can be classified in several types behavioural human-hardware hardware-human active hardware passive hardware li et al 2020 and they are kept in place by supporting delivery systems  resources  within a safety management system context such as leadership communication education training monitoring inspection maintenance and a right attitude of people towards safety a feedback loop ensures that learning from unwanted events leads to system improvements via education and renewed risk assessment li et al 2020 since prevention is not always perfect and the central event can happen preparation is needed for foreseeable events thereto repressive barriers are put in place to prepare for emergency response mitigation and avoidance of long term effects what must be done depends on the risk inventory if a risk is not identified there will be neither preparation of specific countermeasures nor any prevention activities emergency response is needed immediately after the event a thorough preparation allows a fast and adequate response to the emergency situation after an unwanted yet anticipated event occurs ideally an effective prevention does not allow the unwanted event to happen in the first place analyses of the root causes of previous incidents feed improvement of preventive barriers evaluation of the aftermath of an event feeds the improvement of the effectiveness of all barriers including the repressive ones this socio-technical modelling technique is used in industrial major accident hazard risk control practice and enables safety analysts to graphically display causality scenarios barriers and time-lines in an integrated way lger et al 2008 in this framework further analysis is possible using static probability data on events and barriers in the causality tree such analysis can also be made dynamic by replacing the static data by model analysis using real time measurements of process parameters as inputs khakzad et al 2012 for the purpose of mapping and analysing the effects of barriers against any pandemic while it is unfolding combinations with bayesian networks and agent based spreading models chang et al 2020 may become powerful tools data about the pathogen properties could be included as they are becoming available in such a model predicting the outcome of mitigation strategies if not prevented a pathogen coming from an animal may infect a human in this way one person may get a zoonosis this single case may lead to human-to-human h2h transfer more persons may become infected if not contained this case can become an outbreak if not quickly stopped it may reach the stage of a local epidemic if not mitigated sufficiently the pathogen may cross country borders and become a global pandemic all these events together constitute a pandemic scenario unfolding over time we designed a generic pandemic scenario to be used in our model it is built-up in line with the sequence of events unfolding in the current covid-19 pandemic the generic scenario starts from root causes as identified from literature even though root causes may for a part reside in political cultural religious traditional and economical realms certainly all of them are worth a closer look from risk management point of view important trends contributing to pandemic risk are population-growth more deforestation more living in cities now 55 and in 2050 some 68 and more travelling across the globe wef 2019 kain and fowler 2019 limiting animal-to-human a2h contact transfer risk is an important preventive measure chang et al 2020 who 2020b who 2020 if human-to-human transfer h2h occurs the risk of epidemic or even pandemic spreading becomes manifest necessitating increased epidemiologic surveillance and monitoring peeri et al 2020 p8 infection can continue with human-to-animal h2a transfer like the recent case at two dutch mink farms lnv 2020 where minks cats and a dog were infected on may 20 2020 the dutch news media reported a case of a2h transfer back from the minks to a human demonstrating the risk of creating new pathogen reservoirs in animals on june 3 2020 the dutch government started to destruct all minks at infected farms this vulnerability of several domesticated animals was discovered recently shi et al 2020 p3 the risk of infection could even involve plants heckert et al 2011 the covid-19 virus has already been detected in waste water jebril 2020 it would seem that distancing and other spread reducing measures should be applied to animal-human contacts too jebril 2020 p5 10-11 lists repressive measures on four geographical levels global travel restrictions national government border control keep vulnerable population safe from infection reduce transmission local quarantine covid-19 cases 14  18 or 21 days in hospital isolate covid-19 cases  safe covid-19 case burial practice safe covid-19 contaminated waste disposal personal  hand washing safe coughingsneezing wearing face mask in public keep 2 m distance keep away from covid-19 cases infected people di gennaro et al 2020 list several more personal measures refrain from touching eyes nose and mouth in case of symptoms seek medical care early and follow advice given by your healthcare provider the first response should be as fast as possible jebril 2020 turning back part of the transfer reduction measures during mitigation too early may trigger an uncontrolled second wave of infection cases who 2020c we extracted 204 text fragments from the literature sources used in this study these fragments are describing conditions events required knowledge listing emergency preparedness activities and needs and mitigation issues concerning our current predicament the covid-19 pandemic thematic analysis according to the meta-synthesis process cronin et al 2008 polit  beck 2006 was then used to identify supporting systems unwanted events in a generic pandemic scenario and barriers capable of stopping the scenario at a particular point from progressing any further the combination of these three model elements and the meta-synthesis into the integrated pandemic barrier model we constructed is shown in figure 4
 the horizontal time scale is composed of the 6 steps and the bowtie time scale the model is integrated because we merge three safety models and use the sequence of events observed during the covid-19 pandemic as it unfolded starting from december 1 2019 the model is also about barriers since it is explicating and interrelating countermeasures of many different kinds this model provides an overview of what may happen between root causes and long term effects from a safety management and risk control point of view the pandemic scenario in figure 4 is starting from the position of the country having the first outbreak this country is the origin of the pandemic the scenario is  though inspired by the current covid-19 pandemic events  not limited to a specific pathogen there is not just this first central unwanted event to consider in each country where the pathogen first arrives there is another one each successive country will have a longer time advantage if the country of origin quickly issues an international alert the unwanted event in our model is therefore placed at the first local outbreak this is the point in the pandemic process where an infection may either come from a local outbreak in the country of origin as shown or from an infected person arriving from another country the model structure can be used for any outbreak of any pathogen our approach is complementary to the mathematical modelling of geographical infectious disease spreading over time such as acemod chang et al 2020 based on analysis of complex human behaviour in space and time and calibration with epidemiological case data schoenberg et al 2019 recursive patterns gouyet 1996 are observed both in pathogen spreading hohl et al 2016 and in the complex human behaviour in society vazquez-prokopec et al 2013 prediction and evaluation of mitigation strategies requires sophisticated mathematical models alsharawi et al 2012 chang et al 2020 such mathematical models show their strengths starting from detection of an outbreak onwards to mitigation and emergence of a pandemic siettos and russo 2013 zamba et al 2013 the integrated pandemic model as developed in this study see figure 4 provides an overview of all possible barriers in the pandemic scenario and shows the causal tree and its opportunities for prevention it shows the safeguarding of operational readiness of barriers by supporting systems pathogen spreading goes on during the mitigation of a pandemic this may cause flares ie local outbreaks which may develop into a second wave and even multiple waves each new infection case eg a first case in a country travelling in from abroad comes in as patient-1 and brings the scenario at the unwanted central event of the pandemic scenario in the model proposed by hickson 2010 the text in the previous sections in this study is the introduction to the two stages below 
stage 1-deconstruction  understanding how an event came about its elements what happened and why any pandemic will come about via the generic pandemic scenario shown in figure 4 our current predicament the covid-19 pandemic here used as an example is the resulting effect of barriers failing in a series of 5 consecutive events 
1-root causes local traditions unawareness of biohazard risks travelling across the globe pathogen reservoirs in animals these lead to  
2-causal factors people close to animals food and hygiene habits people close to people these lead to  
3-transfer fromvia animal to a human a2a a2h single case zoonosis this leads to  
transfer between humans h2h local outbreak this leads to  
4-epidemic infected people pathogen transfer this leads to  
5-pandemic treatment quarantine unnoticed spreading epidemic reaching other countries this leads to  
6-adverse effects most of the health social and economic effects in the scenario are observed vaccine induced immunity is not observed since no vaccine is available a second wave is not yet observed although there were several new local outbreaks status per may 11 2020 
stage 2-reconstruction  building the event up from altered elements and compare the outcome to reality if this scenario would be subject of robust risk-control all successive scenario events have barriersbiosafety education of people working with animals would create awareness about biohazard risks and about safe behaviourbiosecurity controlled wild animal markets using animal-human distancing personal protection and hygiene measures when working with animals at farms routine animal disease control if applied systematically at all times would prevent animal-to-human transfer a quarantine delay circle around bio-facilities would prevent escaping pathogen eg via workers daily commute and logistic activitiesfast detection quarantine and health alert when a single zoonosis case occurs would prevent human-to-human transfer of the pathogen a quarantine delay circle would allow immediate containment of a zoonosis by closing off a bio-facility from the outside worldpreventive prophylaxisvaccination safety distancing frequent health checks and hygiene measures such as disinfection spraying would prevent a local outbreakfast response to contain a local outbreak would be possible via routine detection using sensors sniffers ir-thermometers swab-tests immediate alert and direct quarantine travelling to and from the originating bio-facility must be stopped suspect infection cases must be quarantined their social contacts must be traced and quarantined too safe waste and waste water disposal methods must be in place local hubs for long distance travelling must be subjected to emergency biosecurity detection
 comparison between deconstruction and reconstruction 
pillay 2017 p129 argues that the gap between work as imagined and work as performed is an important aspect comparison between deconstruction and reconstruction shows such a gap even if each of these 5 barrier groups only reaches 80 effectivity the remaining probability of a pandemic will be reduced by more than a factor 3000 for 90 effectivity per barrier the factor becomes 100000 if a barrier is 80 effective the probability the scenario passes the barrier is p102 then the probability the scenario passes 5 barriers in series is p5 025  000032 the inverse is the reduction factor of 3125 this means that 5 preventive barrier groups connected in series can effectively stop a pandemic before the first outbreak the performances in practice of countries with biosecurity interventions wang artois et al 2020 whether it is a fast emergency response implementation of robust travelling restrictions automated contacts tracing a stockpile of emergency supplies or a full lockdown all illustrate the feasibility of taking effective measures the covid-19 pandemic has shown that in many countries from a safety management perspective both prevention and repression have failed on the other hand several countries have shown remarkable successes with repression prevention in the sense of avoiding a pandemic altogether has not been fully exploited two paradigms the acceptance of pandemic risk as a given and - if it happens - deal with it as a medical emergency have not led to effective pandemic risk control it would seem that considering pro-active prevention of pandemic risk received too little attention as ignorance lacking biosafety and biosecurity measures and limited protective means when people are close to animals were among the causal factors there are many opportunities for improvement a trade-off between investment in effective country biosecurity programmes and prevention systems and the social and economic damage caused by a global pandemic will very likely be in favour of prevention education in biosafety and biosecurity management systems supports sustainability of effective pandemic prevention barriers these would as a minimum comprise human-animal distancing personal protection and routine monitoring and testing pro-active preparation for an outbreak of any new pathogen requires continuous research for detection methods and vaccines so that no time is lost after the onset of a pandemic due to failure of preventive measures repression of the covid-19 pandemic was taken up in force after undue delay but spreading of the virus beyond the wuhan region could not be stopped successive and methodically differing attempts to do so in many countries resulted in only a few exemplary relatively successful cases and many poor responses the global death toll by june 10 2020 exceeds 400000 and is still increasing in many western countries a slow response initially unrestrained travelling preparation for influenza viruses rather than sars like viruses and major logistical problems with materials equipment and facilities played a main role the quality of leadership became an issue in several countries the paradigm of a medical emergency is not addressing all that is needed the huge socio-economic aftermath was not addressed in advance or even foreseen specific preparation activities and barriers to avoid or minimize the socio-economic damage were not in place societal resilience is currently based on huge financial emergency reserve funds new ways are needed to protect businesses institutions and individuals against the sudden loss of income due to large scale enforced closure now the lack of such protection leads to deterioration of the complex society we have been building for many decades if more pandemics are our future we might not fully recover before the next one hits new solutions are needed to accommodate for social distancing in public spaces for incapacitated public transport for the alleviation of the social deprivation caused by unsuitable buildings and for a wide variety of services bringing people in close proximity of each other of course this daunting effort will not be required if all of us would take up prevention of the pandemic risk more seriously

and rapidly spread throughout the world resulting in a global public health emergency the lack of vaccine and antivirals has brought an urgent need for animal model human angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 has been identified as a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 in this study we generated a mouse model expressing human ace2 hace2 using crisprcas9 knock-in technology compared with wild-type c57bl6 mice both young and aged hace2 mice sustained high viral loads in lung trachea and brain upon intranasal infection although fatalities were not observed interstitial pneumonia and elevated cytokines were seen in sars-cov-2 infected-aged hace2 mice interestingly intragastric inoculation of sars-cov-2 was evidenced to cause productive infection and lead to pulmonary pathological changes in hace2 mice overall this animal model described here provides a useful tool for studying sars-cov-2 transmission and pathogenesis and evaluating covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics  coronaviruses covs are a group of enveloped positive-sensed single-stranded rna viruses within the subfamily coronavirinae in the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales all coronaviruses can be divided into four genera as alphacoronaviruses betacoronaviruses gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses during the past decades two highly transmissible and pathogenic covs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have emerged in humans and caused global concerns sars-cov was first recorded in guandong china in december 2002  and rapidly spread to five continents peiris et al 2003  the sars-cov outbreak ultimately caused 8437 infections and 813 deaths worldwide according to who mers-cov firstly emerged in the arabian peninsula in 2012 zaki et al 2012  and has caused 1728 confirmed cases including 624 deaths in middle east countries uk and south korea according to who both sars-cov and mers-cov likely originated from wild animals and are prone to cause lethal pneumonia in humans cui et al 2019  there is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat their infections and transmission in humans in december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia patients with link to huanan seafood market and with potential animal contact was reported in wuhan hubei province china zhou p et al 2020 zhu et al 2020  subsequently the disease rapidly spread throughout the world to become a pandemic the etiologic agent of the disease was then identified as a novel coronavirus by several independent groups  and now named as sars-cov-2 due to its close relationship to sars-cov the disease was subsequently termed coronavirus disease 19  the most common clinical manifestations of the patients are fever cough shortness of breath and fatigue and some patients have radiographic ground-glass lung changes and finally died from acute respiratory distress syndrome ards wang d et al 2020 the who has declared covid-19 as public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 full genome sequencing analysis has classified sars-cov-2 as a new member of the betacoronavirus genus which includes sars-cov mers-cov and bat sars-related coronaviruses sarsr-cov sars-cov-2 has 82 nucleotide identity with sars-cov and 89 identify with a bat cov ratg13 discovered in a cave of yunnan china in 2013 zhou p et al 2020  like other covs the genome rna of sars-cov-2 encodes a non-structural replicase polyprotein and structural proteins including spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins the s protein of covs constitutes the spike on the virion surface and plays a vital role in viral binding fusion and entry as well as the induction of neutralizing-antibody and t-cell responses du et al 2009  more importantly several pioneering investigations have demonstrated that both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov utilizes the same cellular receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 hace2 to enter cells li et al 2003 zhou p et al 2020  the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 s protein receptor-binding domain rbd binding to hace2 has been resolved with an estimated 10 to 20-fold higher affinity towards hace2 than sars-cov has lan et al 2020 shang et al 2020  these findings pave the way for potent intervention strategies targeting rbdhace2 interactions exogenous hace2 has been demonstrated to inhibit sars-cov-2 infection in cell cultures v et al 2020 x et al 2020  and several monoclonal antibodies targeting rbd of sars-cov or sars-cov-2 are being tested using in vitro cultures walls et al 2020  at present no vaccine or antiviral drugs has been tested effectively in animal models small animal models that reproduce the clinical course and pathology observed in covid-19 patients are highly needed in the present study we generated a stable humanized ace2 mice using crisprcas9 knock-in technology replacing the endogenous mouse ace2 mace2 with the human ace2 further characterization demonstrated that these humanized mice are highly susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection via intranasal inoculation and the viral kinetics and pathological outcomes seen in the sars-cov-2 infected animals recapitulated the major finding from covid-19 patients additionally intragastric injection of sars-cov-2 could also establish infection and caused lung injury in the humanized ace2 mice this unique mouse model described here provides a useful tool for studying sars-cov-2 infection and transmission as well as evaluating sars-cov-2 vaccines and therapeutics previous studies have demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing human ace2 became highly susceptible to sars-cov infection mccray et al 2007 menachery et al 2016 netland et al 2008 tseng et al 2007 yang et al 2007  here we aimed to establish a humanized ace2 mouse using crisprcas9 knock-in technology as shown in figure 1a  5 the full cdnas of hace2 was inserted into exon 2 fig1a  the first coding exon of the mace2 gene located in grc m38p6 sites on chromosome x this disrupted the mace2 gene and terminated its expression the tdtomato gene was inserted downstream of hace2 with an internal ribosome entry site ires allowing co-expression of hace2 and tdtomato a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element wpre and poly a sequence were added to enhance mrna stability and translation efficiency this targeting strategy allowed an intrinsic expression profile of hace2 under control of mace2 promoter along with subgenomic rna sgrna and cas9 mrna the targeting construct was injected into 370 zygotes of c57bl6 mice successful insertion in 10 of 46 offspring 2174 was confirmed by pcr screen figure 1b  then three founders were backcrossed with c57bl6 mice and 37 f1-positive offspring were screened the targeting results of 12 positive f1 mice were further confirmed by sequencing  figure 1c  and southern blotting  figure 1d  as expected no animals had random insertion as demonstrated by the wpre internal probe  figure 1d  importantly western blotting results showed that hace2 expression was strong in the lung and kidney but very weak in spleen and liver which displayed a similar expression pattern of mace2 protein in wild-type wt animals  figure   1e  more importantly the mace2 gene was not detected by pcr in homozygous hace2 mice and decreased largely in heterozygous mice  figure 1f  while significant hace2 expression were detected in lung small intestine spleen and kidney from both hace2 heterozygous and homozygous mice but not in the wt mice  figure 1g  profiting from the co-expression design the rough global expression patterns of hace2 were examined visually via bioluminescent imaging in the hace2 mice  figure 1h  furthermore immunofluorescence staining of the lung sections from the homozygous mice showed that hace2 as well as tdtomato were predominantly expressed in the cc10  clara cells along the airway as well as a small population of surfactant protein c positive spc   alveolar type ii cells  figure 1i  thus we established a homozygous mouse model that stably expresses hace2 under the control of mace2 promoter which were termed hace2-kinifdc mice abbreviated to hace2 mice accordingly to further characterize the susceptibility of hace2 mice to sars-cov-2 infection groups of young 45-week-old and aged 30-week-old hace2 mice were intranasally infected 6 with 410 5 pfu of sars-cov-2 and wild-type wt c57bl6 mice that received the same dose of viral challenge were set as control figure 2a  all animals were monitored daily for clinical symptoms and body weight changes and sacrificed on day 6 post infection dpi none of the inoculated animals displayed obvious clinical symptoms and only the aged hace2 mice lost 10 of their weight at 3 dpi and then recovered  figure s1  as shown in figure 2b  robust viral rna replication was seen in the lung trachea and brain tissues from both young and aged hace2 mice while no detectable viral rna was seen in spleen kidney liver intestine and serum especially infectious sars-cov-2 were successfully rescued from lung samples using plaque assay as expected no viral rnas was detected in any tested tissues or serum from the wt c57bl6 mice figure 2  interestingly we also detected high level of viral rnas 2910 5 copiesg in feces of aged hace2 mice further immunostaining of mouse lung section showed that robust viral s protein was detected along the airway in both young and aged hace2 mice while bare viral protein was detected in the sars-cov-2-inoculated wt mice  figure 2c  to confirm the major target cells of sars-cov-2 in our model we further stained the lung section from the infected hace2 mice with different cell markers including clara cells marked by clara cell 10 kda proteincc10 ciliated cells marked by -iv-tubulin alveolar type 1 cells at1 marked by podoplaninpdpn and alveolar type 2 cells at2 marked by surfactant protein cspc as well as viral s protein and hace2 as shown in figure 2d  sars-cov-2 s protein predominantly colocalized with cc10 and hace2 indicating that cc10-postive clara cells are the major target cells of sars-cov-2 along the airway in our model additionally immunostaining of brain sections from the infected hace2 mice showed that robust viral s protein expression could also be detected in neuron astrocyte and microglial cells  figure   s2  together these results indicate that the hace2 mice are highly susceptible to intranasal infection of sars-cov-2 compared to wt mice with sustained robust viral rna replication in lung clara cells as well as trachea and brain to check whether the sars-cov-2 infected hace2 mice produced similar pathological features as those observed in covid-19 patients histopathological examination immunohistochemistry ihc and immunofluorescence staining were performed in lung sections from sars-cov-2 infected animals compared with sars-cov-2 infected wt 7 mice he staining showed that both young and aged hace2 mice developed interstitial pneumonia characterized with inflammatory cell infiltration alveolar septal thickening and distinctive vascular system injury more lesions of alveolar epithelial cells and focal hemorrhage were observed in the aged mice  figure 3a  compared to wt mice ihc staining analysis showed sars-cov-2 infection induced more neutrophils neu   and macrophages cd68   infiltration in the aged hace2 mice  figure 3bc  additionally immunofluorescence co-staining showed sars-cov-2 directly infected cd68-positive macrophages in lung resulting in significant apoptosis c-casp3   in the aged hace2 mice  figure 3d  most importantly luminex cytokine analysis showed that sars-cov-2 infection led to elevated cytokine production including eotaxin g-csf ifn- il-9 and mip-1 in aged hace2 mice but had a weaker response in young mice  figure 3e  table   s1  thus the hace2 mice not only sustained viral replication but also developed pulmonary pathology upon sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov-2 mainly transmits via droplets and close contact among humans however some patients with covid-19 infection had gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea abdominal pain and vomiting lin et al 2020 wang d et al 2020  and viral rnas have been detected in feces of covid-19 patients xu et al 2020  highlighting the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of sars-cov-2 yeo et al 2020  here we sought to investigate whether sars-cov-2 could establish productive infection via intragastric route in hace2 mice following intragastric administration of sars-cov-2 all animals were subjected to daily monitoring and tissue processing on 5 dpi  figure 4a  albeit no clinical signs were seen in the three inoculated hace2 mice high level of viral rna were detected in the trachea 2910 6 copiesg and lung 3210 6 copiesg of two animals  figure 4b  which was comparable to that in animals infected via intranasal route importantly the expression of sars-cov-2 s protein was also detected along the lung airway in the infected hace2 mice  figure 4c  in addition interstitial inflammation was observed with alveolar septal thickening in the intagastric sars-cov-2 infected hace2 mice  figure 4d  overall our results demonstrated that intragastric administration of sars-cov-2 could also establish productive infection and lead to pulmonary pathological changes in hace2 mice in the present study we generated a stable humanized mouse strain in which hace2 expression is under the control of ires in fusion with the tdtomato reporter gene further characterization demonstrated that the expression of mace2 was completely replaced by hace2 in the homozygous mice with peak hace2 expression in lung and small intestine  figure 1  previously several hace2 transgenic mice have been generated with different strategies and used for modeling sars-cov infection mccray et al 2007 tseng et al 2007  generally the pulmonary pathology caused by sars-cov in transgenic mice correlated with the level of hace2 expression in lung thus such transgenic mouse has been explored to mimic sars-cov-2 infection bao et al 2020  compared with such transgenic mouse model our hace2 mouse model has several advantages first the hace2 gene was inserted at grc m38p6 sites on chromosome x to replace mace2 and there is no endogenous mace2 expression in homozygous hace2 mice since transgene insertion occurs randomly the integrity of the landing genes would be probably affected second the tissue distribution of hace2 in our mouse model matches the clinical findings from covid-19 patients and high level hace2 expression were detected in lung  figure 1e  interestingly recent analysis based on single-cell sequencing results from human tissues showed that kidney heart esophagus bladder and ileum also represent tissues of high abundance zou et al 2020  while liver spleen small intestine ovary and brain are the hace2 abundant tissues in our model  figure 1h  this inconsistency between human and mice deserves further investigation third the introduction of tdtomato gene allows real-time monitoring of hace2 expression all these ideal physiological features and stable inheritance and phenotype of hace2 mice prompted us to test their application in reproducing sars-cov-2 infection not surprisingly our challenge experiment of sars-cov-2 clearly demonstrated that these hace2 mice are highly susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection via intranasal inoculation and 410 5 pfu of sars-cov-2 readily led to robust viral replication in respiratory tracts lung and trachea as well as brain the peaked viral rna loads in lung reached 10 8 copiesg which is much higher than that in hace2 transgenic mice bao et al 2020  the presence of viral rnas in brain was somewhat unexpected as few covid-19 patients developed neurological systems  previous findings from sars-cov 9 infected transgenic model also confirmed viral tropism to brain mccray et al 2007  which is consistent with our findings the underlying mechanism through which sars-cov or sars-cov-2 invades the brain and the correlation to disease severity remain to be determined further characterization demonstrated that cc10  clara cells along the airway are the major target cells of sars-cov-2  figure 2d  in our model specific protease in clara cells like tryptase clara might contribute to the efficient cleavage of s protein to enhance viral entry into cells additionally cd68  macrophages in pulmonary alveolus are also infected with sars-cov-2 resulting in severe cell apoptosis  figure 3d  interestingly a significant population of cells that do not express hace2 were also infected with sars-cov-2  figure 2d  how sars-cov-2 invades these cells also deserves further investigation overall our result provides the first line of evidence showing the specific major target cells of sars-cov-2 in the mouse lung most importantly all hace2 mice intranasal challenged with sars-cov-2 developed interstitial pneumonia characterized with inflammatory cell infiltration alveolar septal thickening and distinctive vascular system injury which recapitulated the clinical features in most covid-19 patients early epidemiological findings have suggested that advanced age resulted in increased mortality of covid-19 patients yang et al 2020 zhou f et al 2020  and our results from the hace2 model well reflect this finding the aged hace2 mice 30-week-old lost their weight upon sars-cov-2 infection while young hace2 mice 45-week-old as well as wt mice maintained their body weight increase during the observation period  figure s1  remarkably although both young and aged mice sustained similar viral replication in lung more severe pathological changes as well as increased cytokine response was seen in the aged hace2 mice figure 3  these unique features in aged hace2 mice resembling clinical findings highlight the potential application in different settings it should be noted that no clinical symptoms or mortality was observed in our model and other animal models that can recapitulate severe or lethal disease of covid-19 should be warranted in the future there are several lines of evidence that support potential fecal-oral transmission of sars-cov-2 first gastrointestinal symptoms were seen in many covid-19 patients jin et al 2020 lin et al 2020  and viral shedding in feces have been well reported second ace2 was found to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells and in vitro studies also indicated sars-cov-2 can infect multiple cells from gastrointestinal tracts third experience from sars and mers supported that human covs maintained their 10 viability in environmental conditions essential for fecal-oral transmission chan et al 2011 van doremalen et al 2013  recent data from sars-cov-2 revealed similar stability to sars-cov suggesting similar transmission routes are plausible van doremalen et al 2020  our results from hace2 mouse model provide evidence supporting this hypothesis upon intranasal infection viral rna shading was also confirmed in the feces from the hace2 mice data not shown due to facility limitation we were not able to collect and quantitate feces sample from each individual animal importantly sars-cov-2 given  the authors declare no competing interests 14 star   methods further information and

excised and fixed with 10 neutral buffered formaline dehydrated and embedded in paraffin each embedded tissue was sectioned into 4 m thickness longitudinal sections three tissue sections derived from different parts of each tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin he according to standard procedures for examination by light microscopy the degree of lung damage under the light microscopy was assessed by the degeneration of alveolar epithelial cells the expansion of parenchymal wall edema hemorrhage and inflammatory cells infiltration the semiquantitative assessment were performed as reported previously and described briefly as the following haagmans et al 2004 van den brand et al 2010  for the degree of degeneration of alveolar epithelial cells we scored 0 when no alveolar epithelial cells degeneration was observed scored 1 when the alveolar epithelial cells degeneration was less than 10 and scored 2 when the degeneration was 10-50 for the degree parenchymal wall expansion we scored 0 when no parenchymal wall expanded scored 1 when the area of the expanded parenchymal wall was less than 10 but no focal fusion was observed and scored 2 when the area was 10-50 but no focal fusion was observed for the degree of edema we scored 0 when no edema was observed scored 1 when the area of edema was less than 10 and scored 2 when the area was 10-50 for the degree of inflammatory cells infiltration we scored 0 when no inflammatory cell infiltration scored 1 when occasional infiltration of single inflammatory cell was visible and scored 2 when focal infiltration of inflammatory cells was visible the lesion of lung was observed by an experienced experimental pathologist who focuses on the pathogenesis study of virus infection the cumulative scores of the severity

december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified 1 2 as of march 14 2020 over 140000 cases were
reported worldwide with over 5400 deaths surpassing the combined number of cases and
deaths of two previously emerging coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov 3 the disease caused by this
virus covid-19 is characterized by a range of symptoms including fever cough
dyspnoea and myalgia in most cases 2 in severe cases bilateral lung involvement with
ground-glass opacity is the most common chest computed tomography ct finding 4 similarly to the 20022003
outbreak of sars the severity of covid-19 disease is associated with increased age
andor a comorbidity although severe disease is not limited to these risk groups 5 however despite the large
number of cases and deaths limited information is available on the pathogenesis of this
virus infection two reports on the histological examination of the lungs of three
patients showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage dad pulmonary edema and hyaline
membrane formation indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards as well as
characteristic syncytial cells in the alveolar lumen 6 7 similar to findings during the 20022003 outbreak of
sars-cov 8 the pathogenesis of
sars-cov infection was previously studied in a non-human primate model cynomolgus
macaques where aged animals were more likely to develop disease 913 in the current study sars-cov-2 infection was
characterized in the same animal model and compared with infection with mers-cov and
historical data on sars-cov 9
10 12 first two groups of four cynomolgus macaques both young adult young 4-5 years of
age and old adult aged 15-20 years of age were inoculated by a combined
intratracheal it and intranasal in route with a sars-cov-2 strain from a german
traveler returning from china no overt clinical signs were observed in any of the
infected animals except for a serous nasal discharge in one aged animal on day 14 post
inoculation pi no significant weight loss was observed in any of the animals during
the study by day 14 pi all remaining animals seroconverted as revealed by the
presence of sars-cov-2 specific antibodies against the virus s1 domain and nucleocapsid
proteins in their sera fig s1 as a measure of virus shedding nasal throat and rectal swabs were assayed for virus by
rt-qpcr and virus culture in nasal swabs detection of sars-cov-2 rna peaked by day 2
pi in young animals by day 4 pi in aged animals was detected up to at least day 8
pi in two out of four animals and up to day 21 pi in one out of four animals fig 1a overall higher levels of sars-cov-2 rna
were detected in nasal swabs of aged animals compared with young animals sars-cov-2 rna
detection in throat swabs peaked at day 1 pi in young and day 4 pi in aged animals
and decreased more rapidly over time by comparison with the nasal swabs but could still
be detected intermittently up to day 10 pi fig
1b low levels of infectious virus were cultured from throat and nasal swabs
up to day 2 and 4 respectively table s1 in support of virus shedding by these
animals environmental sampling was performed to determine potential contamination of
surfaces environmental sampling indicated the presence of low levels of sars-cov-2 rna
on surfaces through both direct contact hands and indirect contamination within the
isolator table s2 sars-cov-2 rna was only detected in a rectal swab from one animal
on day 14 pi and no viral rna was detected in whole blood at any time point throughout
the study on autopsy of four macaques on day 4 pi two had foci of pulmonary consolidation in the
lungs fig 2a one animal aged 17 years showed
consolidation in the right middle lobe representing less than 5 of the lung tissue a
second animal young 5 years had two foci in the left lower lobe representing about
10 of the lung tissue fig 2a the consolidated
lung tissue was well-circumscribed red-purple level and less buoyant than normal the
other organs in these two macaques as well as the respiratory tract and other organs of
the other two animals were normal virus replication was assessed by rt-qpcr on day 4 pi in tissues from the respiratory
digestive urinary and cardiovascular tracts from endocrine and central nervous
systems as well as from various lymphoid tissues virus replication was primarily
restricted to the respiratory tract nasal cavity trachea bronchi and lung lobes with
highest levels of sars-cov-2 rna in lungs fig
1c interestingly in three out of four animals sars-cov-2 rna was also
detected in ileum and tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes fig
1c the main histological lesion in the consolidated pulmonary tissues of both the young and
aged animals involved the alveoli and bronchioles and consisted of areas with acute or
more advanced dad fig 2b in these areas the
lumina of alveoli and bronchioles were variably filled with protein-rich edema fluid
fibrin and cellular debris alveolar macrophages and fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes
fig 2c-e there was epithelial necrosis with
extensive loss of epithelium from alveolar and bronchiolar walls hyaline membranes were
present in a few damaged alveoli in areas with more advanced lesions the alveolar
walls were moderately thickened and lined by cuboidal epithelial cells type ii
pneumocyte hyperplasia and the alveolar lumina were empty alveolar and bronchiolar
walls were thickened by edema fluid mononuclear cells and neutrophils there were
aggregates of lymphocytes around small pulmonary vessels moderate numbers of
lymphocytes and macrophages were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the
bronchial walls and a few neutrophils in the bronchial epithelium regeneration of
epithelium was seen in some bronchioles visible as an irregular layer of squamous to
high cuboidal epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei there were occasional
multinucleated giant cells syncytia free in the lumina of bronchioles and alveoli
fig 2f and based on positive pan-keratin
staining and negative cd68 staining these appeared to originate from epithelial cells
fig 2f inset sars-cov-2 antigen expression was detected in moderate numbers of type i pneumocytes and
a few type ii pneumocytes within foci of dad fig
2g fig 2h fig s2 the pattern of
staining was similar to that in lung tissue from sars-cov-infected macaques positive
control sars-cov-2 antigen expression was not observed in any of the syncytia in
addition sars-cov-2 antigen expression was detected in non-lesional tissues of all lung
lobes in three out of four macaques both young and one aged in a few type i and ii
pneumocytes bronchial ciliated epithelial cells and bronchiolar ciliated epithelial
cells the other aged macaque without virological or pathological evidence of
sars-cov-2 infection in the lungs did have sars-cov-2 antigen expression in ciliated
epithelial cells of nasal septum fig 2i nasal
concha and palatum molle in absence of associated histopathological changes no
sars-cov-antigen expression was detected in other sampled tissues including brain and
intestine  to assess the severity of infection with sars-cov-2 compared with mers-cov young
cynomolgus macaques 3-5 years of age were inoculated with mers-cov via the in and it
route all animals remained free of clinical signs at day 21 pi all remaining
animals n2 seroconverted as revealed by the presence of mers-cov specific antibodies
in their sera by elisa fig s3 mers-cov rna was detected in nasal fig 3a and
throat swabs fig 3b on days 111 pi
with peaks on days 1 and 2 pi respectively low levels between 1-85 tcid50
equivalentml of mers-cov rna were detected in rectal swabs on days 2 and 3 pi at autopsy of four macaques at day 4 pi three animals had foci of pulmonary
consolidation characterized by slightly depressed areas in the lungs representing less
than 5 of the lung tissue table 1 similar to
sars-cov-2 infection in both young and aged animals on day 4 pi mers-cov rna was
primarily detected in the respiratory tract of inoculated animals fig 3c infectious virus titers were comparable to sars-cov-2 but
lower compared to sars-cov infection of young macaques table 1 in addition mers-cov rna was detected in the spleen table 1 consistent with the presence of virus in the lower respiratory tract at day 4 pi
histopathological changes characteristic for dad were observed in the lungs of
inoculated animals fig 3d the alveolar septa
were thickened owing to infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages and moderate type
ii pneumocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy in the alveolar lumina there were elevated
alveolar macrophages and some edema fluid containing fibrin and some neutrophils fig 3d few syncytial cells were seen in the
alveolar lumina interestingly mers-cov antigen was not detected in tissues on day 4
pi in any part of the respiratory tract we therefore sampled four young macaques at
day 1 pi at this time we observed multifocal expression of viral antigen
predominantly in type ii pneumocytes and occasionally in type i pneumocytes bronchiolar
and bronchial epithelial cells and some macrophages fig
3d in summary we inoculated young and aged cynomolgus macaques with a low passage clinical
isolate of sars-cov-2 which resulted in productive infection in the absence of overt
clinical signs recent studies in human cases have shown that presymptomatic and
asymptomatic cases can also shed virus 14 15 increased age did not affect disease outcome but
there was prolonged viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of aged animals
prolonged shedding has been observed in both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov patients 16 17 interestingly sars-cov-2 shedding in our
asymptomatic model peaked early in the course of infection similar to what is seen in
symptomatic patients 16 also
sars-cov-2 antigen was detected in ciliated epithelial cells of nasal mucosae at day 4
pi which was not seen for sars-cov 10 or mers-cov infections this manuscript in this
animal model viral tropism for the nasal mucosa fits with efficient respiratory
transmission as has been seen for influenza a virus 18 this early peak in virus shedding for sars-cov-2
is similar to influenza virus shedding 19 and may explain why case detection and isolation
may not be as effective for sars-cov-2 as it was for the control of sars-cov 20 sars-cov-2 was primarily
detected in tissues of the respiratory tract however sars-cov-2 rna was also detectable
in other tissues such as intestines in line with a recent report 21 similar results regarding viral shedding and
tissue and cell tropism were recently also reported following sars-cov-2 inoculation in
rhesus macaques however unlike in our model sars-cov-2 infection in rhesus macaques
does result in transient respiratory disease and weight loss 22 23 two out of four animals had foci of dad on day 4 pi the colocalisation of
sars-cov-2-antigen expression and dad provides strong evidence that sars-cov-2 infection
caused this lesion the histological character of the dad including alveolar and
bronchiolar epithelial necrosis alveolar edema hyaline membrane formation and
accumulation of neutrophils macrophages and lymphocytes corresponds with the limited
pathological analyses of human covid-19 cases 6 7 in particular the presence of syncytia in the lung
lesions is characteristic of respiratory coronavirus infections whereas mers-cov
primarily infects type ii pneumocytes in cynomolgus macaques both sars-cov and
sars-cov-2 also infect type i pneumocytes injury to type i pneumocytes can result in
pulmonary edema and formation of hyaline membranes 24 which may explain why hyaline membrane formation
is a hallmark for sars and covid-19 7 10 but not frequently reported for mers 25 26 these data show that cynomolgus macaques are permissive to sars-cov-2 infection shed
virus for a prolonged period of time and display covid-19-like disease in this
non-human primate model sars-cov-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial
cells throughout the respiratory tract including nasal cavity bronchi bronchioles
and alveoli replication in the upper respiratory tract fits with efficient transmission
between hosts while replication in the lower respiratory tract fits with the
development of lung disease an in-depth comparison of infection with sars-cov mers-cov
and sars-cov-2 in this model may identify key pathways in the pathogenesis of these
emerging viruses this study provides a novel infection model which will be critical in
the evaluation and licensure of preventive and therapeutic strategies against sars-cov-2
infection for use in humans as well as evaluating the efficacy of repurposing species
specific existing treatments such as pegylated interferon 12  nipah20 lessons learned from another virus with pandemic potential ral gmez romn lin-fa wang benhur lee kim halpin emmie de wit christopher broder c mahmudur rahman paul kristiansen melanie saville michael imperiale j   nipah20 brought together a community of scientists who over the past 20 years have passionately studied the epidemiology virology pathogenesis and therapeutics of viruses that have pandemic potential many of the invited speakers were involved in understanding and responding to the 20022003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 sars-cov-1 outbreak it is no surprise that most of these scientists are currently involved in responding to the covid-19 pandemic for the past 15 years this scientific community has been heavily involved in warning governments about the possible emergence of pathogen x and about the need to invest in preparedness against such a pathogen in terms of policy and implementation however prior to the emergence of sars-cov-2 this scientific community had struggled to convince policy makers about the benefits to invest in research development and vaccine manufacturing preparedness against pandemics as an example even though nipah disease has been known for more than 20 years investment on nipah vaccine development has been limited the development of a sound businessinvestment case remains a priority to conduct advocacy and to move forward the development of effective nipah countermeasures cepi has estimated that to bring four nipah vaccine candidates through successful phase 2a clinical trials an investment of up to 200 million us dollars usd would be required assuming no risk of failure 4 this figure may seem high but it pales in comparison to the economic and nonfinancial impact that a pandemic can create as currently being demonstrated by covid-19 studies estimating the economic impact of past and present henipavirus outbreaks could provide valuable data to model a sound investment case for medical countermeasures against nipah virus hendra virus and other henipaviruses with pandemic potential to maximize investments the possibility of a pan-henipavirus vaccine should also be considered similar to programs considering the development of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines 5 regarding progress and challenges in surveillance scientists from several countries presented their research on nipah and henipavirus-like sequences found in bat samples throughout asia and africa in addition the indian council for medical research icmr has found several new viruses among bats and is exploring their eid potential opinions may vary on how to translate bat surveillance into policy and prevention of disease however it is clear that international collaboration and further investment on surveillance research are needed to propose policy and to prepare against potential new pathogens that will continue to emerge from bats and other animals in areas with high biodiversity 6 in terms of nipah diagnostics the need for international reference standards was highlighted organizing and coordinating the collection of sera and virus isolates in the midst of an epidemic are of great importance for the timely establishment of standard material international standards are needed for assay validation calibration comparison and quality controls but cost-effective diagnostic kits and devices are also needed for example a mobile nucleic acid-based nipah diagnostic system is being used and validated in india and bangladesh with potential applications in clinical trials and outbreak response against other eids these and other methods for nipah diagnostics were presented at the conference together with a draft nipah diagnostics target product profile tpp developed by the who rd blueprint team 7 in the absence of an effective nipah-specific treatment it could be argued that there is no clinical justification or direct clinical benefit to an individual patient when testing however what may not benefit the individual patient will undoubtedly benefit public health at large and thus save lives two use cases for nipah diagnostics include rapid detection of nipah virus infections at a peripheral health center or hospital and confirmation of active nipah virus infection at a centralized laboratory for the former a tpp would envision a near-patientpoint-of-care nptpoc test for rapid screening for the latter the tpp would envision a nptpoc for rapid confirmation in settings with higher infrastructures 8 nptpoc testing contact tracing and proactive quarantine of suspected cases are indicated at the onset of an outbreak and can quickly halt further spread as evidenced by the nipah outbreaks that were successfully contained by indian authorities in kerala in 2018 and 2019 9 in an outbreak situation involving a novel pathogen of pandemic potential referring to previously developed diagnostics use cases and tpps can help to quickly articulate diagnostics strategies in the early stages of a pandemic widespread nptpoc diagnostics may need to prioritize sensitivity at the expense of specificity if needed widespread sensitive diagnostic testing combined with appropriate prevention and control measures has so far been the fastest way to bring the covid-19 reproduction number r0 to less than 1 in some countries two conference sessions were dedicated to nipah pathogenesis in animal models and to transmission and case management in humans data were presented on aerosol and intranasal challenges in african green monkeys agm intratracheal challenge in cynomolgus macaques and intranasal challenge in ferrets although models vary in recapitulating specific aspects of nipah disease observed in humans there was no specific mention of myocarditis observed in heart tissue myocarditis has been a consistent observation among nipah virus-infected patients in india and bangladesh but this has not yet been reported in animal models it is possible that this difference may be due to early humane endpoints not allowing the heart tissue from infected animals to reach the level of myocarditis deterioration observed in some nipah virus-infected humans there was also mention of relapse and late onset of infection observed in malaysian patients several years after the acute infection there is no evidence of renewed viremia during relapsed encephalitis in humans and there is currently no animal model for relapsing nipah disease although many investigators have proposed such research and its importance for nipah and henipaviral diseases it is conceivable that an animal rule or similar regulatory pathway may be necessary to achieve licensure of vaccines and other countermeasures direct dialogue between preclinical scientists pathologists and health workers can better inform the design of animal models suitable for eid countermeasure development importantly henipavirus research has benefited from having a diverse preclinical testing portfolio as many different animal species are susceptible to disease which means that preclinical studies do not have to be limited to the use of nonhuman primates nhps this is also proving important for sars-cov-2 as research with nhps hamsters mice and ferrets ensures that covid-19 vaccines can be tested simultaneously according to each model in a wider range of biosafety level 3 bsl3 laboratory facilities for large and small animals across the world 10 it is conceivable that there will be different animal models for different endpoints such as infection disease and transmission in addition the use of human organoids is also being explored as a model to better understand sars-cov-2 biology in human tissue 11 three sessions were dedicated to epidemiological needs for clinical trials and to review progress in the development of nipah medical countermeasures there are several therapeutics in development including the following lipid-anchored peptides to prevent viral fusion low-cost compounds such as heparin and a nasal spray with compounds for potential prophylactic use there are also two monoclonal antibodies that can neutralize the virus and protect against henipavirus infection and disease in vivo one monoclonal antibody m1024 has completed a phase i trial in australia and has been approved for compassionate use in humans 17 since antibodies do not cross the blood-brain barrier for monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics to be effective virus neutralization will likely have to occur in the respiratory tract blood and other tissues before the virus disseminates into the brain however multiple nipah challenge models including nhps indicate that passive immunization with nipah neutralizing antibodies can also prevent central nervous system cns involvement if administered at the first signs of nipah disease there was discussion on what the optimal nipah clinical trial design would be in the context of an eid with very low incidence ie in the absence of feasible randomized controlled trials rcts observational studies such as case-control studies could still provide valuable evidence relevant clinical trials for nipah countermeasures will require engagement of local regulatory authorities in bangladesh directorate general of drug administration dgda and india drug controller general of india dcgi partnerships are being built locally with a focus on equitable access and low-cost interventions recognizing that pathways to nipah vaccine licensure are likely to vary across countries early dialogue between regulators from asia europe and north america was facilitated during the conference and an international nipah-focused regulatory group was created similarly bringing regulators together early during covid-19 medical countermeasure development could result in the identification of actions that can be harmonized or accelerated to meet common requirements or convergences along the pathway to licensure across multiple national regulatory agencies one nipah20 session was devoted to the nipah vaccine pipeline at least 13 vaccine candidates have been confirmed to be under development in preclinical stages 4 five of these active vaccine developers presented their latest preclinical data with two speakers presenting on platform technologies that are being used for the development of covid-19 vaccines keith chappell and paul young from the university of queensland in brisbane australia presented their molecular clamp approach to produce a highly stable prefusion form of the nipah virus f glycoprotein which is responsible for membrane fusion and could be an additional target for neutralizing antibodies the molecular clamp is a novel way of locking synthetic versions of viral surface proteins into the same shape that appears on the virus surface this technology has been designed as a platform approach to generate vaccines against a range of human and animal viruses and has shown promising results in the laboratory targeting viruses such as influenza virus ebola virus nipah virus and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus this same principle is also being supported by cepi to develop a recombinant spike protein-based covid-19 vaccine with phase i trials expected to begin by july 2020 sarah gilbert from the jenner institute at oxford university united kingdom presented the chadox1 nipah vaccine a simian adenovirus-based vaccine encoding nipah virus niv glycoprotein g bangladesh chadox1 is a replication-deficient simian adenoviral vector which has been used for the development of vaccines against many pathogens in preclinical and clinical studies it is safe for use in all ages and in patients who are immunocompromised inducing strong and well-maintained humoral and t cell responses against the encoded antigen without the requirement for an adjuvant a single dose of a chadox1-vectored nipah vaccine protects against homologous bangladesh strain and heterologous malaysia strain challenge in the intraperitoneal syrian golden hamster challenge model 12 sarah gilberts team is now using the same chimpanzee adenoviral platform technology to develop a covid-19 vaccine candidate supported in part by cepi a single dose of the vaccine which encodes the spike protein of sars-cov-2 may confer protection against disease in a rhesus macaque pneumonia model 13 this covid-19 vaccine candidate has now entered phase iii trials in the united kingdom eu clinical trials register httpswwwclinicaltrialsregistereuctr-searchtrial2020-001072-15gb thus becoming the first cepi-supported vaccine technology platform to move from pathogen sequence availability to phase i trials in less than 18 weeks investment in many other vaccine platform technologies has resulted in an unprecedented speed moving quickly from pathogen sequence availability in early 2020 to a diverse portfolio of more than 70 vaccine candidates in less than 4 months 14 although regulatory agencies are adapting to keep up with such a rapidly evolving vaccine pipeline preparedness for future pandemics may necessitate regulatory frameworks to preapprove specific platforms with consistent safety data in order to save precious time when plugging in a novel pathogen sequence into a vaccine platform technology for many covid-19 platform technologies dialogue is ongoing to articulate strategies for large-scale manufacturing 15 and access 16 the final conference session was dedicated to collaboration and synergy zhengli shi from the wuhan institute of virologychinese academy of sciences cas described how a sino-french agreement to collaborate on eids was established in 2004 following the sars-cov outbreak bsl4 labs were established in the wuhan institute of virology as a result of the sars-cov outbreak prior to the covid-19 pandemic the institute had an annual call launched around april each year for external organizations wanting access to the facility to test their own samples or to have access to samples from the in-house repositories the many years of research experience and international collaborations built by the cas since 2004 have provided a preparedness framework through which chinese scientists have responded and continue to respond to the sars-cov-2 epidemic 16 years later nivedita gupta from the indian council of medical research icmr described the regional enabler for the southeast asia research collaboration for health research platform the research platform was established on 28 august 2019 with icmr as the secretariat the goal of the platform is to facilitate clinical research across the region leveraging the unique capabilities of each country and sharing expertise of the 11 member states in the who southeast asia region 10 participated in the second research platform meeting with the platform in place it will be easier to mount rapid responses to new outbreaks and to conduct clinical trialsnot only on nipah virus but also other eids unbeknownst to the scientists attending the nipah20 conference in singapore in december 2019 the covid-19 outbreak had already begun we started the year 2020 confronted with a new eid that required rapid mobilization for vaccine development nipah20 was a scientific drill a timely dialogue about the need to invest in the development of vaccines and medical countermeasures against eids with pandemic potential cepi has since mobilized early investment for several covid-19 vaccine candidates as stated earlier for two awardees this builds on work already undertaken with nipah virus vaccine projects which were showcased at the nipah20 conference transparency and a collaborative spirit underpinned the nipah20 conference although nipah virus may not seem like a priority in the current covid-19 context we hope that the scientific momentum will continue with high-value eid-related research being undertaken and published when will henipavirus experts next meet an unofficial suggestion has been to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the discovery of hendra virus which was the founding member of the henipavirus genus sometime in 2024  animal models for emerging coronavirus progress and new insights lunzhi yuan qiyi tang tong cheng ningshao xia   the pleomorphic and enveloped coronaviruses are a genus in the coronaviridae family and contain a 30 kb positive-sense rna genome 1 the viral envelop contains envelope e protein transmembrane m and spike s glycoprotein and surrounds a disordered or flexible nucleocapsid n 2 most coronaviruses infect wild animals with narrow host range and cause self-limiting diseases 1 human coronaviruses such as oc43 229e nl63 and hku1 are associated with self-limiting respiratory tract infections 3 however two zoonotic coronaviruses the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov cross the species barrier to infect humans and have caused severe acute respiratory disease sard and thousands of deaths 45 since december of 2019 a new sars-like coronavirus named sars-cov-2 raised intense concerns not only within china but also internationally 6 importantly sars-cov-2 showed approximately 8090 of genome sequence homology with previously identified sars-cov strains suggesting an evolving similarity in virological properties 7 receptor-mediated entry is the first step of a viral infection in the host cell receptor binding domain rbd of the viral s protein of sars-cov or mers-cov attaches to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 hace2 or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hdpp4 proteins respectively the hace2 has been also believed to be the receptor of sars-cov-2 7 after entry into cells these three coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 replicate efficiently to produce progeny viruses give rise to cytopathogenesis and establish productive infection sars-cov of 2002 caused over 8098 cases and 774 deaths in over 30 countries mers-cov of 2012 resulted in more than 2182 cases and 779 deaths in 27 countries sars-cov-2 has caused over two million cases in more than 213 countries areas or territories with over 150000 deaths up to date 17 april 2020 therefore it is highly emergent to obtain the effective clinical medication and vaccines to prevent and treat coronavirus infection animal models are critical for us to understand the viral infection and pathogenesis moreover animal models are essential for development and preclinical evaluation of a vaccine or an antiviral agent an ideal animal model is the one that mimics viral infection and diseases in humans in multiple aspects including morbidity viral load typical clinical symptoms host immune responses and mortality therefore the urgent need of preventing and controlling coronavirus infection necessitates the search for an optimal sars-cov-2 animal model based on the published studies animal models of sars-cov and mers-cov include civet cats camelidaes monkeys mice hamsters ferrets rabbits and other potential hosts figure 1 we aim to summarize and discuss their ability to mimic the disease symptoms and natural history of coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 in humans as well as their usage in development of vaccine and antiviral drugs furthermore humanized animal models available to support coronavirus infection and pathogenesis might provide new options to overcome the limitations of the traditional coronavirus animal models additionally animal models for pseudovirus are also prospected to avoid the concern of biosafety
 clinical symptoms of sars-cov- and mers-cov-infected patients at early time include fever chills coughing malaise myalgia headache diarrhoea vomiting and nausea 8 furthermore immunohistochemistry ihc detection demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in lung tissues the covid-19 patients present similar symptoms to those of sars-cov- or mers-cov-infected patients while some patients may show no typical clinical symptom in the early stage of infection 9 the typical pathological features of severe cases include prolonged inflammation with destruction and desquamation of alveolar pneumocytes hyaline-membrane formation interstitial inflammatory infiltration and interalveolar hemorrhage multinucleated giant cells were also observed in the tissues of covid-19 patients 10 over 70 of covid-19 patients were diagnosed as pneumonia by chest computed tomography ct to be admitted to hospital ct images showed the typical features of ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing in lungs 9 recent clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated sars-cov-2 caused the nosocomial infection and fecal-oral transmission its infection results in immune abnormality and multiple organ failures of the covid-19 patients moreover a long incubation period 29 days was observed in some covid-19 cases 11 suggesting a risk of occult and chronic infection although sars-cov-2 displays a lower rate of severe cases and case fatality than sars-cov and mers-cov its high infectivity widely spreading and huge infection population have become a catastrophic medical burden and critical social problem the studies of coronavirus have been greatly benefited from the using nhps as the infection and disease models the old- and new-world monkeys include rhesus macaques macaca mulatta cynomolgus macaques macaca fascicularis african green monkeys chlorocebus sabaeus common marmosets callithrix jacchus squirrel monkeys saimiri and mustached tamarins saguinus mystax all of them have been demonstrated to be permissive for sars-cov infection to cause symptoms such as fever diarrhea and clinical manifestations of pneumonitis 1516 the african green monkeys cynomolgus and rhesus macaques showed mild symptoms after infection of sars-cov urbani strain and they produced neutralizing antibodies nabs that might help to clear the virus 17 in another study on rhesus macaques challenged with the sars-cov pumc01 strain transient severe pneumonia was observed 18 meanwhile greenough et al reported sard with fever diarrhea hepatitis and multi-organ failure in common marmosets around four to seven days post sars-cov infection 19 in some studies the rhesus macaques and common marmosets were used as a model for mers-cov infection however mers-cov infections in the two nhps caused different levels of consequences first the symptoms in the common marmoset model was much more severe and viral yield was approximately thousand-fold higher than those in the rhesus macaque model secondly viral replication in the common marmosets reached peak level and the viral infection caused severe pneumonia within four to six days post mers-cov infection 20 however mers-cov infection in the rhesus macaques did not produce a high viral load and didnt cause severe symptoms 21 the rhesus macaque has been demonstrated permissive for sars-cov-2 infection via ocular conjunctival route 22 sars-cov-2 induced a transient infection and mild pneumonia in the rhesus macaques however severe pneumonia and death were not observed meanwhile the infected rhesus macaques pounced nabs that effectively prevent re-challenge of sars-cov-2 23 more recently the cynomolgus macaques and common marmosets were also demonstrated available to support sars-cov-2 infection 24 in this study rhesus macaques were demonstrated more susceptible to sars-cov2 infection as compared to cynomolgus macaques and common marmosets ferrets has been used as a model for the studies of respiratory pathogens including influenza virus ifv respiratory syncytial virus rsv adenovirus and coronavirus up on infection of sars-cov the ferret presented fever and sneezing associated with detectable viral titres in the upper respiratory tract 25 however severe symptoms and deaths caused by viral infection were not observed and ferrets do not support replication of mers-cov 26 recently ferrets were demonstrated available to support sars-cov-2 infection by two different groups 1427 it was reported that sars-cov infects the golden syrian hamster 28 viruses seeded in the upper and lower respiratory tract and reached a peak level at three days post sars-cov infection and declined and cleared within seven to ten days the infection of sars-cov resulted in mild and transient pneumonia by contrast similar infection course and symptoms were recently observed in hamsters that infected with sars-cov-2 29 hamsters have been demonstrated not susceptible to mers-cov infection 28 interestingly primary sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in ferrets and hamsters elicited a strong nab response that protected the hosts from subsequent infections the above-mentioned information implies that sars-cov-2 infection might induce a mild to severe pulmonary diseases in ferrets and hamsters the severities of symptom might depend on viral strains the ability of mers-cov to infect small animal species may be defected by lack of viral entry or replication surprisingly rabbits were susceptible to mers-cov infection 30 although viral nucleic acid and infectious progeny virus were detectable in lung tissues neither significant histopathological changes nor clinical symptoms were observed these findings indicate a potential route of mers-cov transmission in some common animal species however there is no reported investigation of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in the rabbits therefore it is important to experimentally investigate whether ferret hamster and rabbit are susceptible to the infection and are able to be used as animal model of sars-cov-2 several strains of mice have been tried to be intranasally infected with sars-cov urbani strain it was found that the virus poorly replicated in several young and adult inbred strains of mice balbc c57bl6 and 129s to only a low viral yield clinical illness was not observed and the virus was cleared within nine days meanwhile mice are not naturally susceptible to mers-cov infection it was later revealed that the mouse dpp4 receptor differs from human counterpart in crucial domains that is critical to bind the s protein 13 to overcome the species-specificity barrier for sars-cov or mers-cov human receptor protein hace2 or hdpp4 was expressed in mice by knocking in or transfecting a human receptor gene in mouse the studies of hace2-transgenic mice were performed at almost the same time in 2007 independently in three groups they reported that hace2-transgenic mice supported sars-cov infection and pathogenesis mccray et al demonstrated that systemic expression of hace2 under the control of an epithelial cell-specific promoter k18 resulted in lethal sars-cov infection within five days 31 tseng et al developed two lineages of transgenic mice expressing hace2 under the cag promoter 32 after sars-cov infection the two transgene-positive mice ac70 and ac63 showed high viral load clinical illness and tissue pathology the lethal lineage of mice ac70 displayed higher hace2 expressions in several organs wider spectrum of clinical illness including wasting symptom severe pneumonia and death rather than the non-lethal lineage mice ac63 with lower hace2 expressions yang et al generated another non-lethal lineage mouse that expresses hace2 under mouse ace2 promoter 33 another study further revealed the differential virological and immunological outcomes among different hace2 transgenic lineages 34 to rapidly generate a mers-cov infecting mouse model zhao et al transduced common adult balbc and c57bl6 mice with an adenoviral vector expressing hdpp4 ad5-hdpp4 after mers-cov infection these mice showed interstitial pneumonia expressed viral antigen in the lungs and lost weight but deaths were not observed later hdpp4-transgenic mice were generated to mimic severe mers-cov infection and lethal pathogenesis agrawal et al developed a transgenic mouse that expresses hdpp4 under the control of the cag promoter 35 this hdpp4-transgenic mouse was fully permissive for mers-cov infection to cause severe respiratory illness that led to death within six days after infection remarkably high viral load was detected in multiple organs and pathological changes were consistent with extensive inflammation throughout the infection course in addition mers-cov infection induced profound acute innate inflammatory responses within the lungs of this model in 2017 li et al developed another hdpp4-transgenic mouse and demonstrated that mers-cov infection induced lethal lung disease is viral load dependent 36 similar to the model by agrawal et al activated innate immune cells accumulated in the lungs after mers-cov infection recently yoshikawa et al observed the cytokine storm in a newly generated hdpp4-transgenic mouse 37 these receptor-transgenic or -transduced mice have been widely used to study the pathogenesis mechanism and evaluate vaccines and other therapeutics table 2 because hace2 has been recently demonstrated as the receptor of sars-cov-2 in a cell infectious model 7 the hace2 transgenic mice are supposed as an option to study sars-cov-2 infection and pathogenesis recently bao et al demonstrated that hace2-transgenic mice are able to support sars-cov-2 infection 38 it is observed that mice presented weight loss virus replication infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes in alveolar interstitium and accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities from three to five days post sars-cov-2 infection however no significant histopathological lesions or viral antigens were observed in the other organs including myocardium liver spleen kidney cerebrum intestine and testis furthermore pneumonia became mild with focal lesion areas at seven days post infection suggesting a non-lethal and self-limiting infection course this lineage of hace2-transgenic mouse cannot mimic the severe and lethal cases of covid-19 which necessity attempts in other lineages with different hace2 promotors alternatively transduction of ad-hace2 in young adult balbc and c57bl6 mice might provide an avenue for rapid and robust generation of sars-cov-2 infectious mouse model
 in order to promote the replication of sars-cov in young adult immunocompetent mouse three mouse-adapted ma viral strains were developed by serial passage of sars-cov urbani strain in mouse respiratory tract in contrast to the original urbani strain the sars-cov ma sarsma strains such as ma15 ma20 and v2163 replicated in the lungs of mice to a higher titre that is proportionally associated with pathological changes dissemination of the virus to extrapulmonary sites and mortality table 3 as shown in figure 2a several mutations occurred in orf1a nsp5 and nsp9 orf1b nsp13 and s protein it is believed that the combination of these genetic changes enhanced the viral virulence 39 implying the importance of these proteins in viral pathogenesis in brief the three sarsma strains induced sard in mice that is similar to the clinical symptoms observed in human cases of sars-cov infection

 ferrets hamsters and mice are not naturally susceptible to mers-cov infection because mers-cov s protein cannot bind dpp4 of these animals thus progeny infectious virus could not be isolated from these animals after initial infection and the mers-cov adaptation is unlikely to be carried out as mentioned above mers-cov can successfully infect a hdpp4-transgenic mouse interestingly in vivo serial passage of the emc2012 strain of mers-cov in the hdpp4 knock-in mice resulted in a ma virus strain mersma that causes a fatal pulmonary disease phenotype associated with severe inflammatory responses 36 furthermore it was reported that more passages in the mouse caused more severe diseases for example the mersma strain with 21 adaptive passages emc-p21 cause 50 lethality of hdpp4 transgenic mice while the strain with 30 adaptive passages emc-p30 killed all the mice within eight days 36 moreover different mutations in mers-cov s1 receptor binding domain and s2 fusion domain occur in different plaques or clones of the passaged emc-p30 strain implying that the gene diversity has impacts on the viral entry figure 2b the s protein of coronaviruses needs to be cleaved by host proteases to be functional the proteases include endosomal cathepsins cell surface transmembrane proteaseserine tmprss proteases furin and trypsin 40 for example sars-cov-2 uses serine protease tmprss2 in host cell to cleave s protein to activate its entry process 41 the s protein mutations enhanced infectivity of mersma strains by promoting early entry and broadening tissue tropism 42 comparing to mers strain with an uncleaved s protein mersma strain has an s protein that is pre-cleaved by furin of the infected cells and hence achieves a non-endosome cellular entry thus mutations in the protease cleaving site of s protein might alter infectivity of sars-cov-2 considering the similarity of receptor and highly gene sequence homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 adaptive viral strain of the novel coronavirus might be obtained after 1020 serial passage in hace2 transfected cells or animal models overall generating adaptive viral strains might become another approach to enhance the infectivity and establish an effective and lethal sars-cov-2 infection in experimental animals several studies have attempted to use the immune-compromised mice to determine the role of immune effectors in the coronavirus infection first the following knock-out mice have been applied for the infection of sars-cov beige lacking functional nk cells cd1 lacking nk-t cells rag lacking t and b cells 43 however all the immune-compromised mice failed to allow the infection of sars-cov viral kinetics were not significantly different among the 57bl6 wild type beige cd1 and rag1 mice histopathological detection showed similar self-limiting bronchiolitis and mild pneumonia among these mice interestingly a prolonged viral replication and illness were observed in stat1 mice with 129s background 44 in this model viral replication is detectable until day 22 post infection indicating that a stat1 mediated type i interferon response is required to control sars-cov infection 45 the stat1 mice were also challenged with mers-cov emc-2012 strain because the lack of receptor hdpp4 clinical illness were not observed and viral replication was undetectable 46 however the hdpp4-transfected mice additional deficiency of interferon- receptor myd88 and mvas still cannot prolong the viral replication or cause severe cause throughout a mers-cov infection course 36 generally mice with targeted immune deficiency are useful tools to investigate interaction between host immunity and coronavirus besides the relatively low viral load and mild illness the immunodeficient mice are of limited value in the studies of vaccine and immunotherapy it is important to know the risk factors that affect the clinical outcomes of coronavirus infection 47 first does age play an important role in disease severity to know that an aged mouse model was used for sars-cov infection and it was found that sars-cov infection in aged mice resulted in increased mortality than that in younger mice in the studies 1214 month old balbc or c57bl6 mice developed more severe disease include viral replication weight loss ruffled fur and dehydration than that in the 612 week-old ones 48 however aged 129svev mice did not support prolonged pulmonary viral replication and cleared the virus within five days 49 interestingly the sarsma strain ma15 showed higher mortality in the 920 month aged balbc and c57bl6 mice than that in the 25 month ones 50 recently yoshikawa et al demonstrated that the immunopathology degree of mers-cov infection in the hdpp4-transgenic mouse is age dependent 37 mechanistic studies demonstrated that age-dependent increases of phospholipase pla2g2d and dysfunction of cd4 positive t cell could be the reasons for the enhanced sars-cov infection 5152 according to epidemiology data sars-cov-2 is more likely to cause severe causes and high mortality in elder people 53 overall the aged mouse model provided an opportunity to study the age-dependent susceptibility of humans to coronavirus second does the gender has impact on infection outcomes generally the males generate mild immune responses and females mount stronger innate and adaptive immune responses and are relatively resistant to virus infections which explains why males and females showed different response patterns after infection of viruses recent studies showed the higher expression of hace2 in asian males than the females 54 epidemiological data showed gender-specific differences in sars-cov infection with males experiencing higher mortality compared to females 55 this gender-dependent increase in disease severity after pathogenic sars-cov infection was more pronounced with advancing age 55 male c57bl6 and balbc mice showed more susceptible to and higher mortality after sars-cov ma15 infection than female mice 50 in addition the male mice displayed a higher proinflammatory cytokine levels than female ones which was is independent of t and b cell responses throughout the sars-cov infection course these clinical and experimental findings imply a higher risk of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in the elder asian males however mers-cov infection showed no difference between male and female hdpp4-transgenic mice in mortality and weight loss the epidemiological data of mers-cov infection in human with different gender is conflict some study showed high incidence and mortality among the males 56 and others showed that gender may not have impact on the infection outcome of mers-cov 5 thus it is necessary to clarify the conflicting results of gender impacts in clinical and experimental studies of mers-cov infection overall gender might be an interesting topic for further investigation for the mechanism of sars-cov-2 infection and pathogenesis in addition infection routes and inoculation doses might also have impact on the characteristics of virus shedding pathogenesis and disease outcomes in experimental animals presumptively animal models of sars-cov might fit for the study of sars-cov-2 due to the similarities of the two viruses in pathogenesis replication viral characteristics and host receptor for viral entry therefore combination of hace2 transgenic- or transduce-mice and sars-cov-2 ma strains might result in an enhanced infection severe pathogenesis and higher mortality which resembling the clinical illness comparing to sars-cov and mers-cov the sars-cov-2 might be more complicated in transmission and pathogenesis which makes the animal studies more difficult for example sars-cov-2 infection has a long incubation time 11 more rapid transmission among populations 53 and more severe multiple organ failure 47 an appropriate animal model is important to evaluate a vaccine in medical safety protective efficacy and comprehensive immune activation although many attempts of developing vaccines have been tried there is currently no approved vaccine for sars-cov and mers-cov several approaches to develop sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines were evaluated in indicated animal models that are summarized in table 4 the traditional inactivated virus vaccines use chemicals or radiation to render the viral genome non-infectious while maintaining the virion structure thus preserving antigenicity but eliminating the potential to cause productive infection animal studies have assessed the inactivated sars-cov vaccines and found that they can elicit the production of nabs and inhibit viral replication in nhps mice ferrets and hamsters however in some cases the inactivated vaccine may not arouse enough nabs for the cover or damage of dominant epitopes 57 moreover the inactivated vaccines might lack adequate cross-protection among different viral strains especially for the unknown and newly identified strains live-attenuated vaccines are produced by reducing or eliminating the virulence of a live virus typically using chemical-driven site mutation or gene deletion although the live-attenuated vaccine can elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses in mice and hamsters risk of phenotypic or genotypic reversion and disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients limit further translation 1
 among all the functional structural proteins of coronavirus the s protein is an important antigen that might effectively inducing nabs to block viral binding and entry as well as stimulating robust host immune responses 58 therefore the s protein has been designed as the main target for the development of sars vaccines by different strategies including developing a s subunit using an expression vector packaging a virus-like particle delivering a dna plasmid and nanoparticle 3 these vaccine strategies showed protection effects in different animals table 4 however they are limited by the possibilities of incomplete protection the risk of antibody dependent enhancement ade include expanded infection tissue destruction cytokine storm and multiple organ failure 3 the mechanism of ade effect is complicated and not yet clearly clarified serum of inactivated sars-cov and s protein immunized mice as well as the s protein specific antibodies were demonstrated to promote viral infection and cytopathogenesis in human immune cells such as macrophage and b lymphocytes via a ph- and cysteine protease-independent fc receptor pathway 59 moreover s protein specific antibodies treatment caused fatal acute lung injury in sars-cov infected nhps by skewing macrophage mediated inflammation-resolving responses 60 in addition prior immunization with n protein might also cause severe pneumonia in mice infected with live sars-cov 61 indeed many studies showed that virus-like particle inactivated virus vaccine rdna-produced s protein vaccine led to occurrence of pulmonary and th2-type immunopathology on challenge with live sars-cov in mice suggesting hypersensitivity to sars-cov components was induced 5762 similar lung immunopathology was also observed in mice immunized with inactivated mers-cov vaccine 63 these findings suggested that a potential pathogenic effect of antibodies targeted at sars-cov-2 would be of major concern for vaccine development and antibody-based therapies although the nhps were supposed to be closer to human different mouse models and ma viral strains have occupied a large proportion of these coronavirus vaccine studies for their advantages of convent and large-scale to draw a more robust conclusion due to the genetic differences the results from animals are not necessarily going to be the same in humans to the contrary many vaccines that are effective in animal experiments but showed inadequate protective effects in humans such as rsv 64 and hiv 65 nevertheless animal experiments are the essential step before trials in human for any vaccines more than a dozen anti-cov drugs have been tested in vitro and in vivo targeting protease and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp are the two of the most effective approaches for inhibition of viral replication mycophenolic acid an inhibitor of inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase and guanine monophosphate synthesis displayed a potential anti-mers-cov activity in cell culture 66 however in an animal study the mers-cov infected common marmosets treated with mycophenolate mofetil presented a worse outcome with more severe disease and higher viral loads in necropsied lung than those without treatment 67 ribavirin targeting rdrp and lopinavir-ritonavir that targeting 3clpro protease were approved to treat sars-cov and mers-cov patients respectively nevertheless these drugs showed limited antiviral effects upon monotherapy and have severe side effects on patients and animals including rhesus macaques common marmosets and mice in recent studies remdesivir a broad spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug showed a better anti-mers-cov activity than lopinavir and ritonavir in both in cell culture study and animal studies hdpp4 transgenic mice and nhps 6869 notably the in vitro anti-sars-cov-2 activity of remdesivir has been demonstrated in a cell culture study 70 the rbd site of the s protein is the most important target for development of nabs 58 these nabs have been well evaluated in animal models including rhesus macaques and common marmoset mice rabbits ferrets and hamster however like the vaccines abnormal immune responses and ade effects induced by the antibodies remain to be a serious issue 60 the interferon signalling is a double-edged sword for therapy of coronavirus infection on one hand recombinant interferons showed preventive and antiviral effects in animal models include cynomolgus and rhesus macaques and common marmosets mice and ferrets at the early stage of sars-cov and mers-cov infection combined action of type i and type iii interferon restricts initial replication of sars-cov in the lung but fails to inhibit systemic virus spreading in mice 45 on another hand delayed administration of interferons induce dysregulated interferon signalling and inflammatory monocyte macrophages responses which cause severe transformation and lethal pneumonia in sars-cov infected mice 71 these experimental findings suggested that a precision intervention time is important for interferon therapy of coronavirus infection hormones that used to restore cytokine storm and other host signalling pathways involved in viral replication might also considered as options to treat coronavirus infection but only a few of them were evaluated in mice 72 moreover old and new drugs associated with host endosomal surface and other proteases utilized for viral entry host receptors mediated viral entry endocytosis and endosomal acidification also showed ability to inhibit coronavirus infection in cell models respectively nevertheless unknown in vivo antiviral effects risk of toxicity and adverse effects might limit their further translation for example chloroquine which has been demonstrated able to inhibit viral replication of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro but showed no significant therapeutic effect against sars-cov in mice model 73 other therapy strategies such as the convalescent-phase plasma still lack mechanism study or detailed in vivo evaluation because the lack of adequate or appropriate animal models additionally testing the antiviral ability of old drugs such as metformin atorvastin glitazones fibrates and sartans might be another option at this urgent moment 74 clinically the combined use of several antiviral drugs and host target agents may be more effective than using either modality alone for example sars-cov patients who received ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir and a corticosteroid had lower 21-day sard and death rates than those who received ribavirin and a corticosteroid 75 regards to the patients with severe mers-cov infection viremia was resolved within two days after combined treatment of ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon- 76 in sum we should learn from the lessons of many previous animal experiments firstly a drug with antiviral effects in vitro does not necessarily have antiviral effects in vivo secondly combination of two or more drugs that have different antiviral mechanisms might achieve a synergistic or an enhanced therapeutic effect thirdly to know the advantages and disadvantages all the drugs need to be systematically evaluated in several different animal models before clinical study prevention of and recovery from the coronavirus infection are usually associated with adaptive and innate immunity the outcomes of the coronavirus infection depend on humoral immune responses such as the subtype and titre of antibody although nhps mice and other experimental animals can effectively mimic coronavirus infection the genetic diversity might disturb the interpretation of the possibly different results between human and non-human species to directly study coronavirus infection in human organ or tissue humanized animal models are the method of choice which can also be used for evaluation of coronavirus vaccines and host target agents in the past decades mice with one or several human tissues or cells engraftment have been widely used to investigate the pathogenesis of hiv hbv hcv cmv varicella-zoster virus vzv and other important pathogens lung is the main target organ of coronavirus infection in 2012 maidji et al grafted human fetal lung tissues under the kidney capsule of immunodeficient scid mice 77 the lung tissues rapidly grew and developed mature structures resembling the normal human lung and were demonstrated to support cmv infection and pathogenesis in 2017 wang et al established a human lung-xenografted mouse model for vzv infection 78 after vzv infection viral replication lung pathogenies and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses were detected in the human lung xenografts more recently wahl et al reported a humanized mouse with mono human lung engraftment lom or incorporated with human bone marrow liver and thymus blt-l 79 the lom or blt-l mice supports infection and replication of human pathogens such as mers-cov rsv cmv and zika virus 79 antigen-specific humoral and t-cell responses were observed in blt-l mice suggesting that human lung and immune cell dual chimeric mice might be an ideal humanized animal model for the pathogenesis and immune study of sars-cov-2 due to the abundant expression of hace2 in multiple organs of human multiple organs and tissues including liver heart intestine kidney bladder and immune cells are susceptible to the infection of sars-cov-2 suggesting a reason that causes multi-organ failures therefore mice with engraftment of human somatic progenitor and stem cells as well as varied human tissues and organoids might be useful to investigate the tropism of sars-cov-2 comparing to the traditional animal models the humanized mice provide new options for investigators to directly study the viral infection in human tissues which is adequate to delineate the tissue tropism and the host-virus interactions the development of humanized mice is important to improve our fundamental understanding for mechanisms of coronavirus infection and immunopathophysiology in the future humanized mice might become a unique tool to obtain the insights into our strategies for developing coronavirus vaccine early intervention and antiviral therapy the coronaviruses are one of the most important pathogens causing robust respiratory infection severe cases and deaths in humans here we input key words including coronavirus animal model sars-cov mers-cov sars-cov-2 also named 2019-ncov in the early stage sard and covid-19 to screen the published articles from pubmed the most related articles have been cited in this review recent proceedings and important data of the coronavirus studies are summarized we suggested that a rapid animal test of sars-cov-2 is important to assess the efficiencies of the vaccines antivirals and the sensitivity of the diagnostic tests we also debated that a rapid generation of ma viral strains or mice carrying human receptor is a good option for urgent and effective animal studies in addition development of humanized animal model might provide a direct infection of coronavirus to human tissue taken together animal models are the fundamental tolls to investigate the viral pathogenesis to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs  infection and rapid transmission of sars-cov-2 in ferrets young-il kim seong-gyu kim se-mi kim eun-ha kim su-jin park kwang-min yu jae-hyung chang

generaalphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirusalphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus are commonly associated with respiratory illness in humans and gastroenteritis in animals cui et al 2019 covs were not typically considered to be highly pathogenic in humans until the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov zhong et al 2003 middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov zaki et al 2012 and more recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in late december of 2019 a novel coronavirus disease covid-19 was identified in wuhan city hubei province china from patients with severe pneumonia zhu et al 2020 deep sequencing analysis of lower respiratory tract samples revealed the identity of the causative agent as a newly emerged strain of betacoronavirus temporarily named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv ictv 2020 as of march 23 there have been approximately 81601 confirmed cases of covid-19 in china with over 3276 deaths who 2020b the sars-cov-2 has been found to have high human-to-human transmission through close contact with infected patients leading to rapid global spread by infected travelers from china as of march 23 2020 sars-cov-2 cases have been confirmed in at least 171 countries with a steady increase in the number of laboratory confirmed cases 251329 cases outside of china suggesting that non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies have not ultimately been successful in limiting spread therefore an animal model that recapitulates the covid-19 clinical symptoms in human infection is urgently needed in order to decipher the transmission routes and pathobiology of this virus and to allow testing of pharmaceutical interventions given that sars-cov-2 shares higher sequence homology with sars-cov 79 homology than with mers-cov 50 homology the entry receptor for sars-cov human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 hace2 was considered as a receptor candidate for sars-cov-2 lu et al 2020 correspondingly bao et al 2020 reported weight loss and virus replication in lungs of hace2 transgenic mice following sars-cov-2 infection however no other clinical symptoms such as cough or fever were observed in order to understand the rapid spreading characteristics of sars-cov-2 additional animal models that mimic high human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 infections are warranted given that ferret ace2 has been shown to contain critical sars-cov binding residues wan et al 2020 we performed infection and direct and indirect contact transmission studies using a ferret model previously developed for influenza virus infections park et al 2018 bouvier 2015 to demonstrate ferret-to-ferret transmission in an experimental setting ferrets n  2 were inoculated via the intranasal in route with 1055 tcid50 of nmc-ncov02 a strain that was isolated from a covid-19-confirmed patient in south korea in february of 2020 to evaluate the transmission mode of the virus naive ferrets n  2group were placed in direct contact dc co-housed or indirect contact ic housed in cages with a permeable partition separating them from infected ferrets with infected ferrets two days after the primary infection clinical features of sars-cov-2 infections were recorded this study was repeated in three independent trials total n  24 direct infection n  6 dc n  6 ic n  6 and pbs control n  6 ferrets nmc-ncov02-infected

a while reduced activity was observed in nmc-ncov02-infected ferrets between 2 and 6 dpi with occasional coughs there was no detectable body weight loss nor were there any fatalities during the experimental period interestingly all six dc ferrets showed increased body temperatures 39c with reduced activity between 4 and 6 days post contact dpc and no detectable body weight loss figures s1a and s1b however none of the ic ferrets showed increased body temperature or weight loss over the 12 days of the studies figures s1c and s1d these data indicate that the efficient establishment of covid-19 clinical features in ferrets exposed to infected animals requires direct contact recapitulating human-to-human transmission to investigate sars-cov-2 replication and shedding in each group of ferrets we collected blood nasal washes saliva urine and fecal specimens every other day for 12 days collected ferret secretions were resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline pbs containing antibiotics 5 penicillinstreptomycin gibco for virus titration total rna was extracted from the collected samples using the rneasy mini kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacturers instructions qiagen 2012 and cdna was synthesized with a cdna synthesis kit omniscript reverse transcriptase qiagen hilden germany to quantitate viral rna copy number quantitative real-time rt-pcr qrt-pcr was performed targeting the spike table 1
 and orf1a table s1 genes as previously described zhu et al 2020 using the sybr green kit iqtm sybr green supermix kit bio-rad hercules ca usa the number of viral rna copies was calculated by comparison to the number of copies of a standard control in the nmc-ncov02 infected group viral spike rna was detected in all specimens at 2 dpi the highest amount of viral rna was detected in nasal washes and peaked at 4 dpi 383 log10 copiesml persisting until 8 dpi before dropping below detection limits at 10 dpi table 1 the virus was also detected in saliva specimens from 2 dpi 173 log10 copiesml through 8 dpi although viral spike rna was detected in sera of infected ferrets the viral copy number was low peaked titer 035 log10 copiesml and dropped below detection limits earlier than in nasal wash and saliva specimens to evaluate the infectious virus titer in each specimen collected nasal washes and saliva specimens were inoculated onto vero cells for virus isolation in in infected ferret group nmc-ncov02 was isolated from both saliva and nasal washes specimens as early as 2 dpi and persisted until 4 and 6 dpi respectively table 1 nasal washes specimens showed higher virus titers 183288 log10 tcid50ml than saliva specimens 082092 log10 tcid50ml in dc ferret group virus was isolated from the nasal washes at 4 dpc 24 log10 tcid50ml and 6 dpc 10 log10 tcid50ml but not in saliva specimens table 1 because gastrointestinal involvement is a characteristic of coronavirus infections of animals and humans leung et al 2003 we also collected fecal and urine specimens viral rna was detected in a majority of collected specimens in both in-infected and dc groups as early as 2 dpc table 1 similarly to the in infected group the dc group had the highest virus copy numbers 327 log10 copiesml in nasal washes with rna detected through 8 dpc in addition viral rna was detected in saliva and fecal specimens of the dc group for 8 days whereas the urine specimens contained detectable viral rna until 4 dpc for the ic group 2 out of 6 ferrets were positive for viral rna in nasal washes and fecal specimens at 4 dpc although viral rna copy numbers were lower 053 and 052 log10 copiesml respectively than in dc ferrets due to the cytotoxicity of urine and fecal specimens of ferrets we could not assess virus isolation and titer in vero cells to evaluate the presence of infectious nmc-ncov02 in urine and fecal specimens urine or fecal specimens at 4 dpi of in-infected dc or ic ferrets were centrifuged to remove the debris and the supernatants were inoculated into naive ferrets n  3 per each specimen nasal washes from specimen-inoculated ferrets were collected at 2 4 and 6 dpi and infected onto vero cells for virus isolation noticeably nmc-ncov02 was isolated from the nasal wash specimens of 2 out of 3 urine-specimen-treated or fecal-specimen-treated ferrets table 1 however we failed to re-isolate virus from the ferrets infected with the fecal specimens of ic ferrets these results indicate that ferret is highly susceptible for the infection of sars-cov-2 derived from body fluids and infectious sars-cov-2 sheds through urine and fecal specimens of infected ferrets to assess the replication of sars-cov-2 in ferret organs an additional 12 ferrets were infected with nmc-ncov02 or pbs via the in route and 3 ferrets were sacrificed at 4 8 and 12 dpi nasal turbinate trachea lung kidney and intestine tissues were collected using individual scissors to avoid cross contamination the highest viral rna levels were detected in nasal turbinate 42 log10 copiesg and lung tissue 153 log10 copiesg at 4 dpi viral rna was also detected in intestine 093 log10 copiesg and kidney 087 log10 copiesg at 4 dpi at 8 dpi viral rna was still detected in nasal turbinate trachea lungs kidney and intestine figure 1b in correlation with viral rna copy numbers figure 1b the highest infectious virus titer was detected in nasal turbinate 323 log10 tcid50g and lung tissue 14 log10 tcid50g at 4 dpi whereas infectious virus recovery failed from trachea kidney and intestine tissues which carried less than 113 log10 viral rna copiesg figure 1c finally infectious nmc-ncov02 was isolated from nasal turbinate 207 log10 tcid50g and trachea 107 log10 tcid50g at 8 dpi but not from other tissues at 8 dpi figure 1c however both viral rna detection and virus recovery failed in all tested tissues at 12 dpi these results suggest that virus isolation from infected tissues is closely related to viral rna copy number to further confirm viral replication in infected ferrets immunohistochemistry ihc and histopathological examinations were conducted figure 1 and figure s2 briefly tissue samples were collected from nmc-ncov02 infected or pbs-treated ferrets at 4 dpi and incubated in 10 neutral-buffered formalin for virus inactivation and tissue fixation before they were embedded in paraffin the embedded tissues were sectioned and dried for 3 days at room temperature to detect the viral antigens by ihc mouse polyclonal antibody raised by the immunization of mice with inactivated nmc-ncov02 virions was used as a primary antibody slides were viewed using the olympus bx53 olympus tokyo japan microscope with dp controller software to capture images ihc analyses showed that a number of cells in the nasal turbinate trachea lung and intestine sections of nmc-ncov02-infected ferrets figures 1i1l but not pbs-treated control ferrets figures 1e1h were positive for sars-cov-2 antigen further the lung histopathology showed that compared with pbs-treated ferrets nmc-ncov02-infected ferrets at 4 dpi showed increased immune infiltration and cell debris in the alveolar wall bronchial epithelium and bronchial lumen figure s2 evidencing acute bronchiolitis by nmc-ncov02 infection after 12 days of infection all remaining ferrets including in infection n  6 dc n  6 and ic n  6 had returned to normal ranges of body temperature and body weight and all specimens were negative for viral rna to evaluate the seroconversion rate of each group sera were collected from all remaining ferrets and a serum-neutralizing sn antibody assay against nmc-ncov02 100 tcid50 was conducted on vero cells although in infection group showed the highest mean sn titers compared the other groups the sn titers of both in infection and dc groups ranged between 32 and128 figure 1d on the other hand only 1 of 6 ic ferrets showed a positive sn titer of 16 taken together this demonstrates the presence of sars-cov-2 in multiple sources from infected ferrets potentially explaining the rapid transmission to naive hosts in close contact with the infected hosts given the rapid geographical spread of covid-19 the who declared the sars-cov-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern pheic on the 30th of january 2020 who 2020a and labeled the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic by the 12th of march 2020 who 2020 most confirmed covid-19 patients at this time reported close epidemiological association direct or indirect with other covid-19 patients interestingly a growing number of individuals with no travel history to china and no direct contact with infected patients have become infected lim et al 2020 to understand how this virus rapidly spreads within a community and to inform infection control messaging it is essential to develop an experimental animal model that can support the active infection shedding and transmission of sars-cov-2 to sentinel animals in this study we established an infection and transmission ferret animal model for covid-19 the sars-cov-2 was found to efficiently infect ferrets and induce moderate increases in body temperature 385-403c moreover we were able to detect viral rna in blood for 4 dpi nasal washes for 8 dpi urine for 8 dpi and fecal for 8 dpi specimens findings suggest that sars-cov-2 can be shed through multiple routes of body discharge specimens with these potentially serving as sources for viral transmission to those in close contact with infected individuals interestingly ferrets in direct contact with sars-cov-2-infected ferrets were positive for sars-cov-2 infection as early as 2 dpc suggesting that rapid transmission occurred even prior to infected ferrets reaching their highest viral rna copy numbers in nasal washes at 4 dpi transmission also occurred prior to peak body temperature and body weight loss in infected animals which is consistent with the infectiousness of individuals during asymptomatic periods with regard to potential airborne transmission of sars-cov-2 viral rna was detected in nasal washes and fecal specimens in ic ferrets and persisted for 4 days after indirect contact only one of the two positive animals seroconverted these data show that airborne transmission is likely but is considerably less robust than direct contact transmission following the fortuitous discovery of the natural susceptibility of ferrets to human influenza viruses ferret models were found to highly reproduce the human disease manifestation of several respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenzaviruses and sars-cov-1 capraro et al 2008 chan et al 2018 enkirch and von messling 2015 park et al 2018 in addition to the presence of the respective viral receptors the anatomic proportions of the ferret upper and lower respiratory tracts the density of submucosal glands in the bronchial wall and the number of generations of terminal bronchioles all reproduce the condition in the human respiratory tract enkirch and von messling 2015 this further supports the significance of ferrets as animal model for human respiratory viral infection we demonstrated that sars-cov-2-infected ferrets showed high virus titers in upper respiratory tracts nasal washes and consequently transmitted to naive ferrets by direct contact at high efficiency suggesting that sars-cov-2 ferret model recapitulates aspects of human infection and transmission further as suspected in recent covid-19 patients kim et al 2020 xu et al 2020 we detected the infectious viruses in urine and fecal specimens of virus-infected ferrets however there are also limitations in the sars-cov-2 ferret model as sars-cov-2 infected ferrets showed only mild clinical symptoms and relatively lower virus titers in lungs of infected animals than sars-cov-1-infected or mers-cov-infected hace2 or hdpp4 transgenic mice glass et al 2004 and li et al 2017 on the other hand it is also possible that sars-cov-2 replicates weaker but persists longer in vivo than sars-cov-1 ultimately leading an asymptomatic carrier with a persistent infection to effectively spread the virus therefore given the rapid spreading characteristics of sasrs-cov-2 in humans ferret model would be a useful tool to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic anti-virals and preventive vaccines

february at a dose of 1055 tcid50 per ferrets n  2 at one-day post-infection one naive direct contact dc and indirect contact ic ferrets were introduced into the cage while ic ferrets were separated from inoculated animals with a partition which allowed air to move and without direct contact between animals this study was conducted with three independent trials blood fecal nasal wash saliva and urine specimens were collected every other day for 12 days from each group of ferrets to detect sars-cov-2 further to investigate whether each collected specimen contained infectious live virus we inoculated it onto vero cells to access the replication of the virus in ferrets following sars-cov-2 infection in various organs additional 9 ferrets were infected with sars-cov-2 by in route three ferrets were sacrificed at 4 8 and 12 dpi were and their lung liver spleen kidney and intestinal tissues were collected with individual scissors to avoid cross contamination collected ferret

statistically significant  bioengineering tools to speed up the discovery and preclinical testing of vaccines for sars-cov-2 and therapeutic agents for covid-19 manuela raimondi teresa francesca donnaloja bianca barzaghini alberto bocconi claudio conci valentina parodi emanuela jacchetti stephana carelli   as of may 8 2020 the 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was responsible in 215 countries for 3767744 infections and 259593 deaths from the related disease defined as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1 the human population has no immunity to sars-cov-2 because this virus had never previously infected humans before its initial outbreak in december 2019 until now no drugs or biologics have been proven to be effective for the prevention or treatment of covid-19 to deal with this pandemic apart from non-pharmaceutical containment measures including quarantine and maintenance of social distance possible interventions consist of the repurposing of existing pharmaceutical products along with the development of new products and vaccines 2-4 the development of a radically new pharmaceutical product either traditional or biological such as an antibody targeting a sars-cov-2 receptor is subject to regulatory approval for use in humans based on three steps 1 lab discovery in vitro on cell cultures 2 preclinical testing in vivo in animals to confirm the mechanism of action and to measure the range of effective dosages and tolerability and 3 clinical testing in patients to define the safe dosage and to confirm the efficacy and possible interactions this process involves serious challenges both related to the efficiency for example the development of a human vaccine from concept to licensing takes at least 15 years 5 and also to the effectiveness drug development currently involves a 999 overall failure rate of which 964 is due to failure in the preclinical testing phase meaning that the drug efficacy measured in vitro is almost never confirmed in animals 6 the main issue is that the most widespread technology currently used to test therapeutic agents in vitro is obsolete often it consists of a two-dimensional 2d polystyrene culture dish in which a single cell population is cultured on the bottom the drug to be tested is added to the culture medium and the expected modulation in specific processes or targets is measured however in these simplified in vitro culture conditions the drug elicits a cell response that is not representative of the in vivo response which is based on the cell interactions that occur a in three-dimensional 3d non-flat environments and b within an heterogeneous cell population which is never limited to the cell population primarily addressed by the drug another very serious issue is the unethical slaughter of lab animals which more effective in vitro methods would replace at least in part moreover the methods adopted for monitoring the drug effects in animals are also obsolete whereas new miniaturized intravital imaging techniques are now available that could greatly refine in vivo observations even in terms of the temporal evolution in the same animal thus reducing the number of animals sacrificed by 80-90 there are many on-going clinical trials evaluating potential vaccines and treatments for covid-19 which cannot be accelerated without putting the safety of patients at risk instead both the in vitro and in vivo preclinical phases of drug development could be accelerated by replacing some of the current unrepresentative and obsolete study models with new ones based on improved modeling tools for example many groups have developed 3d static microfluidic and intravital imaging models of viral infection and relevant therapeutics using new high-performance experimental devices that are user-friendly for operators and enable live organoids to be cultured and examined in 3d with high-resolution imaging here we review the published work based on these modeling tools in the specific fields of virology and pharmacology sars-cov-2 infection can lead to covid-19 infection which causes massive damage to the pulmonary cells 7-11 due to a cytokine storm ie an acute secretion of inflammatory signals by innate monocytes in response to the infection which causes hyper inflammation the who 12 and clinicaltrialsgov database currently report many active trials on covid-19 patients of drugs that have already been licensed for other infectious and inflammatory diseases these include anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine large spectrum antivirals inhibitors of endonucleases nucleosides protease inhibitors and other antiretrovirals interferons corticosteroids immune suppressants and anticoagulants in parallel many groups are repurposing known compounds and are developing new vaccines 3 and therapeutic solutions 4 to specifically target the sars-cov-2 virus the drug targets are primarily viral proteins most of which have been resolved and are available on the protein data bank pdb much progress has been made in the structural biology of sars-cov-2 many structural and non-structural proteins have been determined experimentally by cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em and x-ray crystallography the proteins specific to sars-cov-2 that have already been determined experimentally are shown in figure 1 drug therapies may act either a on the host cells affecting the specific receptor or restoring the innate immunity of the cells or b on the virus by blocking the virus functions i target or acting on the virus structural proteins ii target the primary i drug target is represented by several non-structural viral proteins nsps whose inhibition blocks the viral rna synthesis and replication 13 these include the papain-like protease plpro in the nsp3 region the main protease mpro also known as c-like protease 3clpro the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and the helicase the structural spike protein on the viral envelope is the most studied protein of the secondary ii drug targets 13 the virus cannot bind to the host cell receptors fuse with cell membranes and enter cells if the spike protein is inhibited and thus it has also already been solved by electron microscopy 14 this comprises a receptor binding domain rbd mainly involved in the host-cell interaction incorporating a sub-domain called a receptor binding motif rbm believed to bind similarly to sars-cov mainly with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 cell receptor to gain entry inside cells 15 the ace2 receptor was discovered in 2000 and is expressed above all in the lungs heart kidneys gastrointestinal tract testis and other tissues or organs 16 most drugs against sars-cov-2 investigated today therefore target the complex rbdace2 17-19 solved sars-cov-2 molecular structures have been used to set-up docking analyses and molecular dynamics simulations that predict the affinity of chemical binding of these structures with known compounds this in silico modeling technique has been used intensely for drug screening in virtual libraries table 1 shows the latest published results in terms of drugs predicted to bind with sars-cov-2 targets it is worth noting that most of the in silico drug docking analyses listed in table 1 use the homology modelling strategy to predict the structures of the target proteins that have not yet been experimentally resolved 20-25 the homology modelling approach predicts the atomic-resolution model of a target protein based on the structure of the protein chosen as a template according to the genome sequence identity 26 the genome of sars-cov-2 showed a high homology with the sars virus which makes it a reliable template 13 the sequence alignment with the previous sars-like viruses have also been applied to perform the virus evolutionary analysis 27 or to highlight particular features of the sars-cov-2 virus table 2 several studies have compared sars-cov-2 with sars in terms of interaction of the spike protein with the host cell receptor structural- and free-binding energy-based analyses have revealed accurate details of sars-cov-2 these observations may explain the aggressiveness of sars-cov-2 at least in part 17-1928 a similar approach has also been taken to explore the efficiency of the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ace2 allelic variants with the sarscov2 spike protein from the binding analysis two variants showed variations in the orientation of the amino acid side chain altering the intramolecular interactions and the complex formation this aspect may represent partial intrinsic susceptibility or resistance to the sarscov2 infection 29 these parameters can be imaged and are replicated similarly to in-vivo in 3d cell and organoid models unlike in cell monolayers for example cells in 3d engineered airway epithelium infected with sars-cov-2 showed apical-apical polarity which is known to restrict the infection to the airway lumen in vivo
30 and reproduced infection peaks and significant morphological alterations earlier in nasal cells compared to bronchial cells 32 cells in liver organoids infected by sars-cov-2 33 and cells in intestinal organoids infected by mers-cov 46 had syncytia and membrane fusions as observed in mice in vivo models when infected by the respiratory syncytial virus rsv lung organoids had a morphological structure and infection features matching human fetal lung tissue 35 and airway epithelium organoids had massive epithelial modifications as in mature tissue infection in vivo
36 in a 3d engineered airway epithelium cell morphology was close to in-vivo characteristics with a reorganization of cytoskeletal components an abundance of ciliated cells 38 and a mucociliary layer 41 with surfactant and mucus often produced 37 here the h7n9 influenza virus infected both ciliated and non-ciliated cells causing cilia and tight junction damage seen in vivo
42 a 3d engineered liver model reproduced and demonstrated greater physiological hepatocyte morphology polarity and apicalbasal adhesion to ecm compared to a classical cell monolayer 47 3d cell and organoid models are significantly more permissive to viral infection compared to cell monolayers for example when infected by sars-cov-2 the peak infection in 3d-engineered human airway epithelium was reached 30 faster 31 also when infected by avian influenza virus h7n9 viral proliferation was faster 42 in addition propagation of human rhinovirus c and bocavirus was two and three orders of magnitude greater respectively 41 in airway epithelium organoids infected with avian influenza virus such as h1n1 the viral proliferation was faster and with a time-order equivalent to the in vivo proliferation time 38 mers-cov was shown to infect intestinal organoids more than epithelial monolayers 46 in a model of hiv-1 infection of primary human cd4 t-lymphocytes 3d collagen culture unlike suspension conditions promoted cell-associated hiv-1 transmission consistent with spread mechanisms described in vivo
48 human intestinal organoids infected with rotavirus displayed a 10000-fold increase in genomic viral rna than cells infected in monolayer 49 hepatitis b replicated one order of magnitude faster in a 3d-engineered liver model compared to a cell monolayer 47 the expression of all these markers is more similar in time and space to in-vivo values in 3d cell and organoid models compared to cell monolayers for example a 3d-engineered airway epithelium infected by sars-cov-2 showed different expression levels of immune-response genes type i and type iii interferons and a subset of genes associated with the nf-kb and tnf pathways between nasal cells with strong upregulation at 24 hours post infection and bronchial cells with low expression 31 cells in liver organoids expressed the ace2 receptor thus enabling sars-cov-2 infection unlike in the mouse model 33 when infected by the respiratory syncytial virus rsv lung organoids had gene and marker expression primarily the mesenchymal markers pdgfr- pdgfr- -sma vimentin and cd90 that matched infected human fetal lung tissue 35 while airway epithelium organoids expressed levels of genes involved in migration krt16 krt6b interferon signaling il1rn ifi44l and viral response mx2 oas1 comparable to in vivo values 36 in 3d-engineered airway epithelium expression of inflammatory cytokines aquaporin-5 and cytokeratin-14 was two-fold higher than monolayers when infected with avian influenza viruses h1n1 and h3n2 37 and two orders of magnitude higher for il-6 and il-8 when infected with human rhinovirus c and human bocavirus 41 closely recapitulating the immune response seen in vivo in a model of stratified airway epithelium infected by the andes-hantavirus long-term culture at seven days showed a switch in immune response from anti-viral transient interferon to antinflammatory cytokines and vegf-a as occurs in-vivo
40 hepatitis b induced a two-fold higher expression of specific antigens hbsag in a 3d-engineered liver model compared to cell monolayers 47 in 3d models the sensitivity to antiviral drugs is significantly lower and more similar to in vivo than cell monolayer observations for example the efficacy of clinical-grade soluble human ace2 in reducing sars-cov-2 infection in both human capillary organoids and kidney organoids was one order of magnitude lower than in monolayers 34 in a 3d-engineered airway epithelium infected with the h7n9 influenza virus and treated with recombinant human interferons 2b and 1 the expression of interferon-stimulated antiviral genes was significantly reduced and the level of gene expression induced by the two agents was reversed consistently with data in vivo compared to monolayers 42 human intestinal organoids infected by human rotavirus compared to the simple cell line model in monolayers were twice less sensitive to interferon  and ribavirin with a range of effective doses comparable to that administered in in vivo models 49 the response to the antiviral drug entecavir in a 3d human engineered liver model infected by hepatitis b was more similar to in vivo compared to the cell line model 47 in conventional cell monolayers the response of herpes simplex infection to antivirals is unrealistically fast with 100 reactivation for herpes simplex 1 virus reactivation after exposure to interferon  was reduced five-fold in infected 3d brain organoids compared to cell monolayers as reported in animal models 50 in addition in hydrogels made of acrylated hyaluronic acid and loaded with fibroblasts the time for cell recovery and reaggregation after infection and exposure to the antiviral drug acyclovir was three-fold greater than in cell monolayers similarly to in vivo
51 the evidence outlined above shows that 3d cells and organoid models consistently develop properties that are able to determine the in vivo-like dynamics of infection by pathogenic viruses they thus may represent a valuable tool towards a more rapid assessment of infectivity to humans of emerging respiratory viruses such as the sars-cov-2 and of relevant drug responses from a technological point of view there are two principal limitations of the previously analyzed 3d models compared to conventional monolayer models which are essentially related to the 3d scaffolds the current scaffolds are mainly represented by either hydrogels 52-53 or solid ecm analogues 54 which are placed on the bottom of culture plates or in trans-well inserts resulting in constructs which are a few millimeters thick and cannot be examined under optical microscopy the second problem in current 3d scaffolds is the very limited control over the culture time of some physical and chemical properties known to profoundly affect cell behavior such as biodegradation with the release of various solutes and mechanical properties such as stiffness which influence cell adhesion and migration 54 to overcome all these limitations many groups of researchers are developing miniaturized 3d scaffolds by a cutting-edge fabrication technique called two-photon laser polymerization 55 for example our group has developed an innovative 3d micro-scaffold called the nichoid figure 2 which is optically and physically accessible to the cells cultured inside over time and to all the existing biological assays the nichoid is a miniaturized rigid transparent ultra-precise 3d grid fabricated in a biocompatible resin 56-58 this scaffold is up to 100 microns thick thus truly 3d for cells but 100 optically accessible to high-resolution fluorescence diagnostics by mimicking the 3d stiffness of a physiological cell niche 59 the nichoid can guide the self-organization of several types of stem and progenitor cells 60-61 including embryonic stem cells 62 and mesenchymal stem cells msc 63 it also maintains their phenotype in expansion culture by regulating hundreds of genes involved in mechanotransduction processes such as cell migration cytoskeletal organization and membrane plasticity 64 the nichoid could thus provide an effective culture environment to test mechanobiological effects such as the overexpression of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins that can rigidify the cell membrane thus markedly inhibiting viral membrane fusion and entry it could thus be used for screening candidate antiviral drugs and vaccines based on the targeting coronavirus spike protein we also observed that the nichoid potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of stem cells expanded inside 65 this substrate is a powerful candidate to maintain the safety and function of expanded msc 63 which is a new therapy already being tested in clinical trials to treat post-covid-19 pulmonary fibrosis 66 for example a 3d bioreactor-engineered respiratory epithelium infected with sars-cov was found to more closely resemble normal human tissue in terms of cell apical polarity essential to viral cell-cell transport compared to non-perfused culture 67-68 a bioreactor-engineered liver model of hepatitis b infection recapitulated the functional hepatic microarchitecture and complete cell polarization which is critical for the cells susceptibility to infection compared to non-perfused organoids which show de-differentiation over 10-13 days 70 a bioreactor-engineered model of neuronal tissue based on neural progenitors showed some features of the human trigeminal ganglia the site of latency of the varicella-zoster virus not seen in non-perfused cultures 68-69 a 3d bioreactor-engineered respiratory epithelium infected with sars-cov remained viable three-times longer than non-perfused controls 67-68 a bioreactor-engineered liver model of hepatitis b infection was metabolically and functionally stable for at least 40 days ie four times longer than conventional non-perfused cultures 70 a bioreactor-engineered model of neuronal tissue infected by the varicella-zoster virus was successfully maintained in culture for 180 days compared to the limit of a few days for primary human ganglia in non-perfused culture 68-69 in a microfluidic model of fibroblast infection by the adenovirus a 50 higher infection efficiency was maintained at a lower multiplicity of infection the minimum viruscell ratio able to cause infection for longer incubation times with respect to non-perfused controls 71 a bioreactor-engineered liver model of hepatitis b infection led to a 10000-fold lower multiplicity of infection compared to non-perfused culture 70 a bioreactor-engineered model of neuronal tissue infected by the varicella-zoster virus maintained persistent viral infection for 90 days which is not possible with non-perfused culture 68-69 in a 3d bioreactor-engineered respiratory epithelium infected with sars-cov the antibody response to sars-cov-specific spike and nucleocapsid glycoproteins was two-fold compared to non-perfused culture 67-68 a bioreactor-engineered liver model of hepatitis b infection maintained stable expression levels of receptors of innate immune cells and downstream effectors compared to non-perfused cultures 70 the evidence above therefore shows that perfused models enable infection studies to be extended even up to several months on stable cell cultures of highly differentiated cells with a higher infection efficiency and lower multiplicity of infection compared to non-perfused models this makes it potentially feasible to extend the study of the life cycle and genetic stability of new viruses such as sars-cov-2 to in vitro systems despite being derived from minimal doses from patients and to test sequential antiviral drug treatments 70 most importantly perfused cell models make it feasible to reproduce dynamic interactions between tissue-resident cells and circulating cells including the response to a pathogen of innate and adaptive immune cells and thus to extend the testing of vaccines to in vitro models a first step forward in this regard is a recent microfluidic-based model of a lymph node 72 here the stroma was modeled with adherent murine tumor dendritic cells and cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes were put in suspension in the culture medium and recirculated interstitially within the engineered organ this system selectively promoted the adhesion of antigen-specific t cells through affinity isolation by serial cell contacts with fluid-induced shear stresses maintained in the range 01-1 dyncm2 in contrast to non-perfused cultures this model was able to compare in parallel and in real time the effect on t cell adhesion to dendritic cells of different treatments inhibitors activators and immunogens with regard to vaccine testing bioreactors that host cm-sized 3d scaffolds such as the rotating wall vessel are able to provide tens of millions cells for confirmation assays such as pcr or facs as required by regulatory agencies their technological limitation however is that they are too thick to be accessed thoroughly for real time optical inspection of cell interactions 5473 microfluidic bioreactors instead are 2d and have micron-sized channels that are also fully inspectable in real time 74-75 however they can host only a few thousand cells which are difficult to harvest and in any case would not be sufficient for robust confirmation assays 76 to overcome these limitations our group developed a millifluidic optically-accessible bioreactor moab which is a compromise between the two categories mentioned above the moab figure 3 is a chambered microscope slide allowing the culture of fully 3d cell models with dimensions of up to a few millimeters containing several million cells under interstitial perfusion of the culture medium with the infusion of cells in suspension and the therapeutic agents to be tested the culture chambers are only 400 microns thick and enable full-thickness high-resolution fluorescence diagnostics both in real time and post-cultivation 77-81 in in vitro tests the moab led to a comparable cell response to biodrugs to the one seen in experimental animals in specific fields characterized by slowly-developing diseases and slowly-developing healing induced by the therapeutic agent stem cell therapy for neurodegeneration 82 gene therapy for muscular dystrophy 83 and chemotherapy for bone metastases 84 by adding lymphocytes in suspension in the perfused medium figure 3 the moab easily extended to 3d a microfluidic model of lymphocytes instruction within a lymph node 72 millifluidic bioreactors in fact have a high potential to speed up the discovery and testing of drugs and new vaccines for sars-cov-2 and are not limited to the interactions with the immune system for example they can successfully maintain human primary neurons infected by a virus in long-term culture for up to 180 days compared to the limit of a few days in non-perfused culture 68-69 millifluidic bioreactors can even be hydraulically connected in multiple units to reproduce transport of neurotoxic agents through multiple body barriers pertaining to distant body compartments for example from the gut endothelial barrier to the blood-brain-barrier 85 this method can be exploited to assess neurotoxicity which is a primary concern for new antiviral drugs and vaccines for sars-cov-2 in addition the sars-cov-2 virus itself could hold a neurotropic potential new observations on the loss of smell and taste by patients later manifesting symptoms of covid-19 together with evidence showing that coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov could target the central nervous system open up a new window in this regard 86 in fact a long-term bioreactor co-culture of olfactory neurons and ensheathing glial cells in 3d could not only confirm the expression of ace2 in human olfactory neurons thus their role as a potential entry site for the sars-cov-2 virus but also could help to clarify the potential mechanism of virus propagation to the brain through neural cell populations ie from the olfactory neurons to their ensheathing glial cells such a model could verify whether in sars-cov-2 infection the defense mechanism provided by olfactory ensheathing cells is present and whether it is maintained during aging such an experiment could add crucial insights into unveiling the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by covid-19 11 also suggesting new prevention measures such as the vaporization of nasal disinfectants in the elderly population these can be quantified in real time with a resolution at the cellular scale for example intravital imaging studies in lungs quantified in time the recruitment of cd4 t cells from blood vessels in response to the influenza a virus 89-90 and most recently the recruitment of neutrophils in response to the pr8-h1n1 and h5n5 influenza viruses 91 multiphoton intravital microscopy in abdominal lymph nodes was used to quantify a partial reduction in the motility of hiv-infected t cells as well as their tethering to and fusion with cd4 immune cells 92-93 intravital imaging within vessels of colon adenocarcinoma tumors was used to quantify the timely evolution of several oncolytic viruses binding to intravascular leukocytes and endothelial cells 94-95 these parameters are greater than in in vitro assays for example in an immunization study using a glycoprotein of the respiratory syncytial virus associated with an antiviral treatment with the specific monoclonal antibody live imaging was used to visualize and capture virus-infected cells in the nasal cavity and in the lungs of experimental mice with a higher sensitivity compared to the in vitro plaque assay 87 intravital imaging of live mice was sufficiently sensitive to quantify vaccinia viruses in ear blood vessels and labial mucosa 96 and single oncolytic virus particles interacting with individual leukocytes and endothelial cells within blood tumors and visceral organs 94-95 intravital imaging is thus emerging as a key tool to observe the spatial-temporal dynamics of very complex phenomena even as complex as embryonic development at a cellular resolution 97 in the field of immunology however intravital imaging models have significant limitations temporary suction window chambers are highly invasive and always require animal euthanization at the end of each observation preventing repeated observations at subsequent time points in contrast implantable windows allow for long-term repeated observations in the same animal however they are currently too invasive and affected by chronic inflammation at the surgical site thus interfering with the desired measurements 88 in addition implanted imaging windows in general do not retain lymphatic circulation thus preventing the recruitment of cells from the bone marrow or lymphatic system 89-90 to overcome these limitations we developed an implantable miniaturized intravital imaging device called microatlas figure 4 this minimally invasive device which is 5 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness is implantable in chicken embryos or subcutaneously in mice to quantify in vivo aspects of the immune response to biomaterials and drugs 98 microatlas integrates a micro-fabricated fluorescent 3d scaffold that guides and hosts the intravital regeneration of vascularized tissue in addition this scaffold enables the repositioning of the observation field of view of a two-photon microscope which is necessary for repeated and quantitative intravital measurements of immune cell recruitment neo-angiogenesis and fibrotic reaction on the same animal at different time-points the fluorescent grid is currently designed to provide beacons to correct aberrations derived from deep optical sectioning of the 3d micro-scaffold repopulated by cells during ex ovo experiments expression of the human ace2 receptor can be engineered in transgenic mice in contrast with histopathology techniques imaging through a miniaturized intravital window can be used at incremental time points within the same mouse in vital conditions to study the localization and distribution pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of antiviral therapies and vaccines while seeking solutions for covid-19 it could significantly speed-up the preclinical testing of experimental antiviral drugs and vaccines while eliminating the need for animal sacrifice at the various time points thus reducing by up to 90 the number of animals required by the regulation for ex vivo assessments intravital imaging could be very effective in this model also to test therapeutic agents based on an engineered messenger rna mrna that directs cells to make a protein which could work as a drug or vaccine for sars-cov-2 human safety trials have already begun for mrna-based vaccines against two flu strains and the zika virus in each case the mrna encodes for viral proteins that infected cells would physiologically present to activate the immune system against infections to succeed the engineered mrna must hide from dendritic cells enter the cells avoid degradation and be translated efficiently the efficiency off all these stages could be monitored and measured by the intravital imaging of fluorescently-labeled mrna in this review we have discussed various cutting-edge bioengineering tools already available in the fields of virology and pharmacology which are based on i 3d co-cultures that are highly predictive of in vivo mechanisms and ii high-resolution intravital microscopy we have also discussed the potential strategies aimed at repurposing these tools in order to significantly accelerate the development of therapeutics and vaccines against covid-19 although several academic institutions have already adopted these improved tools for research into basic immune biology and drug discovery pharmaceutical companies still use conventional cell lines and standardized animal models for confirmatory studies as requested by the standards for the passage of new drugs through the preclinical steps of regulatory approval but despite the limited predictive capability of these models the particular urgency to find clinical solutions for the sars-cov-2 pandemic makes it even more evident that an adequate validation of these new tools could lead to an update of the current preclinical testing standards with the new ones based on the concepts of 3d culture perfused culture and intravital imaging presented here in virology and vaccinology as well as in many other pharmaceutical sectors the new standards suggested in our review would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the whole drug development process with the added benefit of drastically reducing

nucleotide prodrug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses here we tested the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a rhesus macaque model of sars-cov-2 infection to evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on sars-cov-2 disease outcome we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of sars-cov-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with sars-cov-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily clinical virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy in contrast to vehicle-treated animals animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered at necropsy on day 7 after inoculation lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue in sars-cov-2-infected rhesus macaques these data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in covid-19 patients to prevent progression to severe pneumonia  effective treatments for covid-19 are urgently needed while a large number of investigational as well as approved and repurposed drugs have been suggested to have utility for treatment of covid-19 preclinical data from animal models can guide a more focused search for effective treatments in humans by ruling out treatments without proven efficacy in vivo remdesivir gs-5734 is a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity 1  including against coronaviruses 2  that is currently investigated in covid-19 clinical trials worldwide including in china the us and europe summarized in 3  in animal models remdesivir treatment was effective against mers-cov and sars-cov infection 2 4 5 in vitro remdesivir inhibited replication of sars-cov-2 6 7 moreover in vitro experiments have shown that mutations conferring resistance to remdesivir do not easily emerge in coronaviruses 8  here we investigated the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in our recently established rhesus macaque model of sars-cov-2 infection in this model infected rhesus macaques develop mild to moderate transient respiratory disease with pulmonary infiltrates visible on radiographs and a shedding pattern similar to that observed in covid-19 patients 9  therapeutic treatment of rhesus macaques with remdesivir shortly before the peak of virus replication resulted in a significant clinical improvement reduction in pulmonary infiltrates and a reduction in pulmonary pathology animals rhesus macaques were housed in adjacent individual primate cages allowing social interactions in a climate-controlled room with a fixed light-dark cycle 12-hr light12-hr dark animals were monitored at least twice daily throughout the experiment commercial monkey chow treats and fruit were provided twice daily by trained personnel water was available ad libitum environmental enrichment consisted of a variety of human interaction manipulanda commercial toys videos and music the institutional biosafety committee ibc approved work with infectious sars-cov-2 strains under bsl3 conditions sample inactivation was performed according to ibc-approved standard operating procedures for removal of specimens from high containment to evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on sars-cov-2 disease outcome we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of sars-cov-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease 9  twelve animals were randomly assigned to two groups and inoculated as described previously with a total dose of 26x10 6 tcid50 of sars-cov-2 strain ncov-wa1-2020 via intranasal oral ocular and intratracheal routes the efficacy of therapeutic remdesivir treatment was tested in two groups of six adult rhesus macaques 3 males and 3 females each 36-57kg due to the acute nature of the sars-cov-2 model in rhesus macaques therapeutic treatment was initiated at 12 hours after inoculation with sars-cov-2 and continued once daily through 6 days post inoculation dpi one group of rhesus macaques was treated with a loading dose of 10mgkg remdesivir followed by a daily maintenance dose of 5 mgkg the other group of six animals served as infected controls and were administered an equal dose volume ie 2 mlkg loading dose and 1 mlkg thereafter of vehicle solution 12 sulfobutylether--cyclodextrin in water and hydrochloric acid ph35 according to the same treatment schedule this dosing scheme in rhesus macaques mimics the daily dosing tested in clinicals studies with covid-19 patients and results in a similar systemic drug exposure treatment was delivered as an intravenous bolus injection total dose delivered over approximately 5 minutes

were assigned a daily clinical score based on a preestablished scoring sheet in a blinded fashion twelve hours after the first remdesivir treatment clinical scores in remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower than in control animals receiving vehicle solution this difference in clinical score was maintained throughout the study fig 1a  only one of the six remdesivir-treated animals showed mild dyspnea whereas tachypnea and dyspnea were observed in all vehicle-treated controls table s1  radiographic pulmonary infiltrates are one of the hallmarks of covid-19 in humans radiographs

was not statistically significant  fig 2a  however 12 hours after the first remdesivir treatment was administered the infectious virus titer in bal was 100-fold lower in remdesivir-treated animals than controls by 3 dpi infectious virus could no longer be detected in bal from remdesivir-treated animals whereas virus was still detected in bal from four out of six control animals fig 2b  despite this reduction in virus replication in the lower respiratory tract neither viral loads nor infectious virus titers were reduced in nose throat or rectal swabs collected from remdesivir-treated animals except a significant difference in virus titer in throat swabs collected on 1 dpi and in viral loads in throat swabs collected on 4 dpi fig 3  all animals were euthanized on 7 dpi tissue samples were collected from each lung lobe to compare virus replication in remdesivir-treated and vehicle-treated control animals in 10 out of 36 lung lobe samples collected from remdesivir-treated animals viral rna could not be detected whereas this was the case in only 3 out of 36 lung lobes collected from control animals in general comparison across individual lung lobes in the two groups showed lower geometric mean of viral rna in remdesivir-treated group fig 4a  taken together the viral load was significantly lower in lungs from remdesivir-treated animals than in vehicle-treated controls fig 4b  virus could be isolated from lung lobes of five out of six vehicle-treated control animals but none of the lung tissue collected from remdesivir-treated animals was positive in virus isolation although fewer tissues from other positions in the respiratory tract were positive by qrt-pcr in remdesivir-treated animals these differences were not statistically significant fig 4c  at necropsy on 7 dpi lungs were assessed grossly for presence of lesions gross lung lesions were observed in one out of six remdesivir-treated animals in contrast all six vehicle controls had visible lesions resulting in statistically significantly difference in the area of the lungs affected by lesions fig   5a b and fig 6a b  this difference was also evident when calculating the lung weight to bodyweight ratio as an indicator of pneumonia with a statistically significantly lower ratio observed in remdesivirtreated compared to vehicle-treated animals fig 5c  histologically there was a clear effect of remdesivir treatment on lung lesions with fewer and less severe lesions in the remdesivir animals than in vehicle-treated controls histologic lung lesions were absent in three of six

covid-19 remdesivir treatment in rhesus macaques infected with sars-cov-2 was highly effective in reducing clinical disease and damage to the lungs the remdesivir dosing used in rhesus macaques is equivalent to that used in humans however due to the acute nature of the disease in rhesus macaques it is hard to directly translate the timing of treatment used to corresponding disease stages in humans in our study treatment was administered close to the peak of virus replication in the lungs as indicated  the authors affiliated with gilead sciences are employees of the company and own

viral loads in plasma peaked at 3 dpi and 77 viral replication was detected in the large bowel at 2 dpi figure 1b and table s1  no viral rna was 78 detected in almost all the other samples tested

figure 1a and 1b  viral loads in lungs peaked at 2 and 3 dpi 81 with doses of 10 5 and 10 4 tcid50 respectively maximum viral loads in lungs of animals infected with 82 each dose of virus were comparable viral rna yields in plasma and large bowel followed a similar 83 trend but with more variability with this two lower doses in addition clinical monitoring of animals 84 showed no marked symptoms of infection but significant weight losses from 3 dpi when compared to 85 animals intranasally inoculated with sodium chloride 09 figure 1c  86 87 figure 1  implementation of hamster model

details in table s1  in vivo efficacy of favipiravir 93 to assess the efficacy of favipiravir hamsters received the drug intraperitoneally three times a day 94 tid we used three doses of favipiravir 1875 375 and 75mgday corresponding to 34036 67042 95 and 1390126 mgkgday respectively 96 in a first set of experiments treatment was initiated at day of infection preemptive antiviral therapy 97 and ended at 2 dpi we infected groups of 6 animals intranasally with three doses of virus 10 6  10 5 and 98 10 4 tcid50 and viral replication was measured in lungs and plasma at 3 dpi  figure 2a  when analysis 99 of virus replication in clarified lung homogenates was based on infectious titers as measured using 100 tcid50 assay an inverse relationship was observed between infectious titers and the dose of 101 favipiravir  figure 2b  this trend was even more important when low doses of virus were used to infect 102 animals at each dose of virus mean infectious titers for groups of animals treated with 75mgday tid 103 were significantly lower than those observed with untreated groups p00001 reduction of infectious 104 titers ranged between 19 and 37 log10 for animals infected with 10 5 or 10 4 tcid50 significant 105 infectious titer reductions of around 08 log10 were also observed with the dose of 375mgday tid 106 p0038 drug 90 and 99 effective doses ed90 and ed99 were estimated based on these results 107 and ranged between 31-42mgday and 53-70mgday respectively table 2  when analysis of virus 108 replication in clarified lung homogenates were assessed on viral rna yields as measured using 109 quantitative real time rt-pcr assay significant differences with groups of untreated animals ranging 110 between 07 and 25 log10 were observed only with the higher dose of favipiravir p0012 once 111 again this difference was more noticeable with lower doses of virus  figure 2b  since we found higher 112 reductions of infectious titers than those observed with viral rna yields we estimated the relative 113 infectivity of viral particle ie the ratio of the number of infectious particles over the number of viral 114 rna molecules decreased infectivity was observed in all treated groups of animals these differences were always significant with the higher dose of favipiravir p0031 and were significant with the dose 116 of 375mgday tid for animals infected with 10 5 or 10 4 tcid50 of virus p0041 we then measured 117 plasmatic viral loads using quantitative real time rt-pcr assay and found with the higher dose of 118 favipiravir and the groups of animals infected with 10 6 or 10 4 tcid50 significant reductions of 21 and 119 262 log10 respectively p0022 figure 2b  120  10 5 or 10 4 tcid50 of virus lung infectious titers measured using a tcid50 assay and viral

assessed over a period of 7 days the impact of treatment on the 133 clinical course of the disease using weight loss as the primary criterion  figure 3a  beforehand we 134 evaluated the toxicity of the three doses of favipiravir with groups of four non-infected animals treated 135 from day 0 to day 3 figure 3b  high toxicity was observed with the dose of 75mgday tid with 136 significant weight loss noticed from the first day of treatment table s4  we also found a constant 137 but moderate toxicity with the dose of 375mgday tid that was significant at day 4 and 5 only no 138 toxicity was detected with the lower dose of favipiravir to assess if the toxicity observed with the 139 highest dose of favipiravir was exacerbated by the infection we compared weight losses of infected 140 and non-infected animals treated with the dose of 75mgday tid regardless of the dose of virus no 141 significant difference was observed at 1 2 and 3 dpi  figure s3  after this evaluation of favipiravir 142 toxicity we intranasally infected groups of 10 animals with two doses of virus 10 5 or 10 4 tcid50 143 treatment with a dose of 375mgday tid was initiated on the day of infection preemptive antiviral 144 therapy and ended at 3 dpi  figure 3a  with both doses of virus treatment was associated with 145 clinical alleviation of the disease figure 3c -d with the dose of 10 5 tcid50 mean weights of treated 146 animals were significantly higher than those of untreated animals at 5 and 6 dpi p0031 similar 147 observations were made with the dose of 10 4 tcid50 at 5 6 and 7 dpi p00001 148  normalized weight at day n was calculated as follows  of initial weight of the animal at day nmean  of 154 initial weight for mock-infected animals at day n data represent mean sd  and  symbols indicate a 155 significant difference between treated and untreated animals with a p-value 00001 and ranging between 001-156 005 respectively details in table s2 and s4 in a third set of experiments treatment was started one day before infection preventive antiviral 158 therapy and ended at 2 dpi we intranasally infected groups of 6 animals with 10 4 tcid50 of virus and 159 viral replication was measured in lungs and plasma at 3 dpi  figure 4a  once again an inverse 160 relationship was observed between lung infectious titers and the dose of favipiravir figure 4b  mean 161 infectious titers for groups of animals treated with 375 and 75mgday tid were significantly lower 162 than those observed with untreated groups p0002 of note undetectable infectious titers were 163 found for all animals treated with the higher dose estimated ed90 and ed99 were 35 and 47mgday 164 respectively table 2  significant reductions of viral rna yields of 09 and 33 log10 were observed with 165 animals treated with 375 and 75mgday tid respectively p0023 resulting infectivity of viral 166 particle was decreased with a significant reduction only for the higher dose of favipiravir p0005 167 finally we found significantly reduced plasmatic viral loads with animals treated with 375 and 168 75mgday tid p0005 169 177   and  symbols indicate that the average value for the group is significantly different from that of the 178 untreated group with a p-value 00001 ranging between 0001-001 and 001-005 respectively details in table   179 s2 and s3 favipiravir pharmacokinetics pk in a hamster model 181 we first assessed the pk and lung distribution of favipiravir in a subgroup of uninfected animals groups 182 of animals were treated respectively with a single dose of favipiravir administrated intraperitoneally 183 625mg 125 mg and 25 mg in each dose group we sacrificed 3 animals at specific time points post-184 treatment 05 1 5 or 8 hours for determination of favipiravir in plasma drug concentration in lung 185 tissue was determined at 05 and 5 hours post-treatment subsequently we assessed the favipiravir 186 concentration after multiple dose in animals intranasally infected with 10 5 tcid50 of virus groups of 9 187 animals received the three doses evaluated for 3 days figure 2a  1875mgday 375mgday and 188 75mgday tid and were sacrificed at 12-hours after the last treatment dose favipiravir was quantified 189 in plasma n9 and lung tissue n3 190 results are presented in table 3 and figure s4  the single dose pk analysis showed that the maximum 191 concentration of favipiravir was observed at 05 hour at all doses then plasma drug concentrations 192 decreased exponentially to reach concentrations below 10 gml at 12 hours favipiravir pk exhibited 193 a non-linear increase in concentration between the doses after multiple doses trough concentrations 194 12 hours of favipiravir also exhibited a non-linear increase between doses the extrapolated 12 hours 195 post-treatment concentrations after a single dose were calculated in order to determine the accumulation ratio accumulation ratios were respectively 6 16 and 21 at the 3 doses confirming the 197 non-proportional increase between doses the average concentration after single dose administration 198 over 0 to 12-hour intervals was calculated and the respective values obtained were 101 gml 387 199 gml and 1005 gml for the 3 favipiravir doses 200 favipiravir lung concentrations were 16 to 27-fold lower than in plasma for both administration of 201 single and multiple doses after a single dose the mean lung to plasma ratio ranged from 037 to 062 202 according to the time post-treatment and was similar between the 3 doses of favipiravir at 05 hours 203 a high ratio 5 hours post-treatment was observed at the highest dose 25 mg with an increase by a 204 factor 16 to 18 compared with the lower doses after multiple doses the lung penetration of 205 favipiravir was confirmed with a mean lung to plasma ratio ranging from 035 to 044 favipiravir was 206 not detected in the lungs at the lowest dose 1875 mgday 207 to understand which genomic modifications accompanied favipiravir treatment direct complete 215 genome sequencing of clarified lung homogenates from animals intranasally infected with 10 6 tcid50 216 of virus and treated with the two highest doses of drug preemptive antiviral therapy figure 2  was 217 performed data were generated by next generation sequencing from lung samples of four animals 218 per group untreated 375mgday tid and 75mgday tid the mean sequencing coverage for each 219 sample ranged from 10991 to 37991 reads per genomic position and we subjected substitutions with 220 a frequency 1 to further analysis the genetic variability in virus stock was also analyzed 14 221 nucleotide polymorphisms were detected of which 5 recorded a mutation frequency higher than 10 222 table s6  223 in order to study the mutagenic effect of favipiravir we used the consensus sequence from virus stock 224 as reference and all the mutations simultaneously detected in a lung sample and in virus stock were 225 not considered in the further analysis 1 to 4 mutations per sample see table s6  overall no majority 226 mutations were detected mutation frequency 50 mutations were distributed throughout the 227 whole genome and almost all of them exhibited a frequency lower than 10 figure 5a and 5b  sub-populations were detected in two independent animals notably 18 of these shared mutations 242 were detected only with treated animals 14 of them being non-synonymous table s8 is significantly different from that of the untreated group with a p-value ranging between 0001-001 and 001-257 005 respectively details in details in table s6 and s7 e association between lung infectious titers measured 258 using a tcid50 assay and frequency of non synonymous synonymous and ga mutations each dot represent 259 data from a given animal in the current study we used a hamster model to assess efficacy of the favipiravir against sars-cov-262 2 following infection viral rna was mainly detected in lungs blood and to a lesser extent in the 263 large bowel peak of viral replication was observed at 2-3 dpi followed by observation of significant 264 weight losses in line with recently reported investigations that involved 6-10 weeks old hamsters 265 kaptein et al 2020  chan et al 2020  clinically the main symptom was weight loss observed from 266 the first day of infection and followed by recovery at 6dpi this confirmed that the in vivo model with 267 younger animals 4 weeks-old is suitable for preclinical evaluation of antiviral compounds against 268 sars-cov-2 269 using a preemptive strategy we demonstrated that doses of favipiravir of around 700-1400mgkgday 270 tid reduced viral replication in lungs of infected animals and allowed clinical alleviation of the disease 271 reduction of viral replication was greater when estimated on the basis of infectious titers than on total 272 viral rna as previously observed in non-human primates treated with remdesivir williamson et al 273 2020  however the effective doses of favipiravir were higher than those usually used in rodent models 274 100-400mgkgday sidwell et al 2007  smither et al 2014  julander et al 2009  tani et al 2018  275 oestereich et al 2016  yamada et al 2019  this can be correlated with the high favipiravir ec50 found 276 in vitro for sars-cov-2 moreover effective doses were associated with significant toxicity in our 277 hamster model this observed toxicity reflected only the adverse effects of favipiravir and was not 278 exacerbated during sars-cov-2 infection indeed similar weight losses were measured among 279 infected and non-infected animals treated with the highest dose of favipiravir at 1 2 and 3dpi 280 in the present study reduction of viral replication was correlated with the dose of favipiravir 281 administrated and inversely correlated with the dose of virus inoculated in a recent study favipiravir 282 administrated per os twice daily loading dose of 600mgkgday followed by 300mgkgday revealed 283 a mild reduction of lung viral rna yields using a similar hamster model with high doses of virus 2x10 6 284 tcid50 kaptein et al 2020  these results are in accordance with ours at the lower dose of favipiravir 285 around 340mgkgday tid 286 by characterizing the dose response curve we estimated that the dose required to reduce by 90 287 ed90 the level of infectious titers in lungs is in the range of 570-780mgkgday in the most favourable 288 situation where high doses were used as a preemptive therapy favipiravir led to undetectable viral 289 replication in lung and plasma these results showed that the use of high doses of favipiravir could 290 expand its in vivo spectrum against rna viruses 291 with influenza viruses favipiravir acts as a nucleotide analogue it is metabolized intracellularly to its 292 active form and incorporated into nascent viral rna strands this inhibits rna strand extension and induces abnormal levels of mutation accumulation into the viral genome baranovich et al 2013  294 sangawa et al 2013  recently it was shown in vitro that favipiravir has a similar mechanism of action 295 with sars-cov-2 through a combination of chain termination reduced rna synthesis and lethal 296 mutagenesis shannon et al 2020  our genomic analysis confirmed the mutagenic effect of favipiravir 297 in vivo indeed we found that favipiravir treatment induced appearance of a large number of ga 298 and cu mutations into viral genomes this was associated to a decrease of viral infectivity probably 299 because alteration of the genomic rna disturb the replication capacity similar findings were described 300 in vitro and in vivo with other rna viruses baranovich et al 2013  guedj et al 2018  escribano-301 romero et al 2017  arias et al 2014  of note we also observed a strong inverse association between 302 infectious titers in lungs and the proportion of non-synonymous mutations detected in viral 303 populations because random non-synonymous mutations are more deleterious than synonymous 304 mutations cuevas et al 2012  this suggests that they were randomly distributed over the three 305 positions of the codons and that no compensatory mechanism was triggered by the virus to eliminate 306 them ie negative selection finally the inverse correlation between lung infections titers and the 307 frequency of ga substitutions showed that an increased proportion of these mutations beyond an 308 error threshold might be expected to cause lethal mutagenesis 309 genomic analyses revealed that 18 mutations detected in viral sub-populations were shared only with 310 treated animals two of them were located in the nsp14 coding region involved in the proof-reading 311 activity of the viral rna polymerisation eckerle et al 2007  ferron et al 2018  however they were 312 located in the n7 mtase domain involved in viral rna capping chen et al 2013  ma et al 2015  by 313 comparison resistance mutations selected against remdesivir in -coronavirus murine hepatitis virus 314 model were obtained in the rdrp nsp12 coding sequence agostini et al 2018  further 315 investigations are needed to assess the impact of these mutations on the antiviral effect of favipiravir 316 favipiravir pk in our hamster model displayed a non-linear increase in plasma exposure between the 317 doses as already reported in nonhuman primates madelain et al 2017  the observed favipiravir 318 concentration versus time profiles were in agreement with previous results of a pk study performed 319 in 7-8 week-old hamsters orally treated with a single dose of 100mgkg of favipiravir gowen et al 320 2015  the maximum plasma drug concentration occurred at 05 h after oral administration earlier 321 than in humans and then decreased rapidly in agreement with its short half-life madelain et al 2016  322 after repeated doses plasma exposure confirmed non-linear pk over the entire range of doses further 323 emphasized by accumulation ratios the important accumulation observed at the highest dose could 324 explain in part the toxicity observed in hamsters at this dose favipiravir undergoes an important 325 hepatic metabolism mainly by aldehyde oxidase producing an inactive m1 metabolite and inhibits 326 aldehyde oxidase activity in a concentration-and time-dependent manner these properties explain the self-inhibition of its own metabolism as observed in our study in which the highest dose of 328 favipiravir led to a greater increase in favipiravir concentrations madelain et al 2020  329 a good penetration of favipiravir in lungs was observed with lungplasma ratios ranging from 35 to 330 44 after repeated doses consistent with its physicochemical properties lung exposure was also in 331 accordance with previous studies gowen et al 2015  332 how clinically realistic are these results to address this question we compared the drug 333 concentrations obtained in the hamster model with those obtained in patients in 2016 a clinical trial 334 evaluated the use of favipiravir in ebola infected patients sissoko et al 2016  the dose used in ebola 335 infected patients was 6000mg on day 0 followed by 1200mg bid for 9 days the median trough 336 concentrations of favipiravir at day 2 and day 4 were 461 and 259gml respectively this is within 337 the range observed here in hamsters treated with the highest dose around 1400mgkgday with a 338 mean trough concentration of 299gml however additional investigations are required to 339 determine whether or not similar favipiravir plasma exposure in sars-cov-2 infected patients are 340 associated with antiviral activity the major differences in pk between hamster and humans and the 341 toxicity observed at the highest doses in our animal model limits the extrapolation of our results 342 therefore whether safe dosing regimens in humans may achieve similar plasma exposure and 343 recapitulate the profound effect on viral replication is unknown further the intracellular 344 concentration of the active metabolite was not determined and which parameter of the drug 345 pharmacokinetics best drives the antiviral effect remains to be established 346 in summary this study establishes that high doses of favipiravir are associated with antiviral activity 347 against sars-cov-2 infection in a hamster model the better antiviral efficacy was observed using a 348 preventive strategy suggesting that favipiravir could be more appropriate for a prophylactic use our 349 results should be interpreted with caution because high doses of favipiravir were associated with signs 350 of toxicity in our model it is required to determine if a tolerable dosing regimen could generate similar 351 exposure in non-human primates associated with significant antiviral activity before testing a high 352 dose regimen in covid-19 patients furthermore subsequent studies should determine if an increased 353 antiviral efficacy can be reached using favipiravir in association with other effective antiviral drugs 354 since this strategy may enable to reduce the dosing regimen of favipiravir finally this work reinforces 355 the need for rapid development of animal models to confirm in vivo efficacy of antiviral compounds 356 and accordingly to determine appropriate dose regimens in humans before starting clinical trials we thank laurence thirion uve marseille for providing rt-qpcr

edwards sjl lees jg santini jm orengo ca  sars-cov-2 has a zoonotic origin and was transmitted to humans via an undetermined intermediate host leading to infections in humans and other mammals to enter host cells the viral spike protein s-protein binds to its receptor ace2 and is then processed by tmprss2 whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range s-proteinace2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely to predict infection risks we modelled s-proteinace2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species relative to human ace2 and correlated these changes with covid-19 infection data we also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity we predict that mutations are more detrimental in ace2 than tmprss2 finally we demonstrate phylogenetically that human sars-cov-2 strains have been isolated in animals our results suggest that sars-cov-2 can infect a broad range of mammals but few fish birds or reptiles susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged towards the end of 2019 and is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 global pandemic available data suggests that sars-cov-2 has a zoonotic source 1  with the closest sequence currently available deriving from the horseshoe bat 2  as yet the transmission route to humans including the intermediate host is unknown so far little work has been done to assess the animal reservoirs of sars-cov-2 or the potential for the virus to spread to other species living with or in close proximity to humans in domestic rural agricultural or zoological settings coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 are major multi-host pathogens and can infect a wide range of non-human animals 3 4 5  sars-cov-2 is in the betacoronavirus genus which includes viruses that infect economically important livestock including cows 6 and pigs 7  together with mice 8  rats 9  rabbits 10  and wildlife such as antelope and giraffe 11  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the betacoronavirus that caused the 2002-2004 sars outbreak 12  likely jumped to humans from its original bat host via civets viruses genetically similar to human sars-cov have been isolated from animals as diverse as racoon dogs ferret-badgers 3 and pigs 13  suggesting the existence of a large host reservoir it is therefore probable that sars-cov-2 can also infect a wide range of species real-world sars-cov-2 infections have been reported in cats 14  tigers 15  dogs 16 17 and minks 16 17  animal infection studies have also identified cats 18 and dogs 18 as hosts as well as ferrets 18  macaques 19 and marmosets 19  recent in vitro studies have also suggested an even broader set of animals may be infected 20 21 22  to understand the potential host range of sars-cov-2 the plausible extent of zoonotic and anthroponotic transmission and to guide surveillance efforts it is vital to know which species are susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection the receptor binding domain rbd of the sars-cov-2 spike protein s-protein binds to the extracellular peptidase domain of angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace2 mediating cell entry 23  the sequence of ace2 is highly conserved across vertebrates suggesting that sars-cov-2 could use orthologues of ace2 for cell entry the structure of the sars-cov-2 s-protein rbd has been solved in complex with human ace2 24 and identification of critical binding residues in this structure have provided valuable insights into viral recognition of the host receptor 24 25 26 27 28  compared with sars-cov the sars-cov-2 s-protein has a 10-22-fold higher affinity for human ace2 24 25 29  which is thought to be caused by three classes of mutations in the s-protein 30  similarly variations in human ace2 have also been found to increase affinity for s-protein receptor binding 31  these factors may contribute to the host range and infectivity of sars-cov-2 both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov additionally require the transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 to mediate cell entry together ace2 and tmprss2 confer specificity of host cell types that the virus can enter 32 33  upon binding to ace2 the s-protein is cleaved by tmprss2 at two cleavage sites on separate loops which primes the s-protein for cell entry 34  tmprss2 has been docked against the sars-cov-2 s-protein which revealed its binding site to be adjacent to these two cleavage sites 33  an approved tmprss2 protease inhibitor drug is able to block sars-cov-2 cell entry 35  which demonstrates the key role of tmprss2 alongside ace2 36  as such both ace2 and tmprss2 represent attractive therapeutic targets against sars-cov-2 37  recent work has predicted possible hosts for sars-cov-2 using the structural interplay between the s-protein and ace2 these studies proposed a broad range of hosts covering hundreds of mammalian species including tens of bat 27 and primate 38 species and more comprehensive studies analysing all classes of vertebrates 38 39  including agricultural species of cow sheep goat bison and water buffalo in addition sites in ace2 have been identified as under positive selection in bats particularly in regions involved in binding the s-protein 27 40  the impacts of mutations in ace2 orthologues have also been tested for example structural modelling of ace2 from 27 primate species 38 demonstrated that apes and african and asian monkeys may also be susceptible to sars-cov-2 however whilst cell entry is necessary for viral infection it may not be sufficient alone to cause disease for example variations in other proteins may prevent downstream events that are required for viral replication in a new host hence examples of real-world infections 14 15 16 17 and experimental data from animal infection studies 18 19 20 21 22 are required to validate hosts that are predicted to be susceptible here we analysed the effect of known mutations in orthologues of ace2 and tmprss2 from a broad range of 215 vertebrate species including primates rodents and other placental mammals birds reptiles and fish for each species we generated a 3-dimensional model of the ace2 protein structure from its protein sequence and calculated the impacts of known mutations in ace2 on the stability of the s-proteinace2 complex we correlated changes in the energy of the complex with changes in the structure of ace2 chemical properties of residues in the binding interface and experimental covid-19 infection phenotypes from in vivo and in vitro animal studies to further test our predictions and rationalise the key sites contributing to energy changes of the complex we performed detailed manual structural analyses presented as a variety of case studies for different species unlike other studies that analyse interactions that the s-protein makes with the host we also analyse the impact of mutations in vertebrate orthologues of tmprss2 our results suggest that sars-cov-2 could infect a broad range of vertebrates which could serve as reservoirs of the virus supporting future anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission we aligned protein sequences of 247 vertebrate orthologues of ace2 most orthologues have more than 60 sequence identity with human ace2 supplementary fig 1a  for each orthologue we generated a 3-dimensional model of the protein structure from its protein sequence using funmod 41 42  we were able to build high-quality models for 236 vertebrate orthologues with ndope scores  -1 supplementary table 5  11 low-quality models were removed from the analysis ace2 residues directly contacting the s-protein dc residues were identified in a structure of the complex pdb id 6m0j fig 1a  supplementary results 2 supplementary fig 3  we also identified a more extended set of both dc residues and residues within 8 of dc residues likely to be influencing binding dcex residues after analysing the orthologue interfaces we removed models that were missing  10 dcex residues 21 models were removed from the analysis leaving 215 models to take forward for further analysis we observed high sequence  60 identity and structure similarity score  90 out of 100 between ace2 proteins for all species supplementary results 1 we used multiple methods to assess the relative change in binding energy g of the sars-cov-2 s-proteinace2 complex following mutations in dc residues and dcex residues that are likely to influence binding we found that protocol 2 employing mcsm-ppi2 henceforth referred to as p2-ppi2 calculated over the dcex residues correlated best with the phenotype data supplementary results 3 supplementary fig 4  table 1  justifying the use of animal models to calculate g values in this context since this protocol considers mutations from animal to human lower g values correspond to stabilisation of the animal complex relative to the human complex and therefore higher risk of infection we show the residues that p2-ppi2 reports as stabilising or destabilising for the sars-cov-2 s-proteinace2 animal complex for dc  supplementary fig 7  and dcex  supplementary fig 8  residues to consider g values in an evolutionary context we annotated phylogenetic trees for all 215 vertebrate species analysed  supplementary fig 6  and for a subset of animals that humans come into close contact with in domestic agricultural or zoological settings fig 2   these thresholds were chosen as they agree well with the available experimental data fig 3  for each animal the number of residue changes compared to human ace2 sequence and the total chemical shift across the dcex residues are also shown this tree contains a subset of animals from supplementary fig 6  in general we see a high infection risk for most mammals with a notable exception for all nonplacental mammals g values measured by p2-ppi2 correlate well with the infection phenotypes table 1  g values are significantly lower for animals that can be infected by sars-cov-2 than for animals for which there is no evidence of infection  fig 3  mann-whitney one-sided p  41 x 10 -5  two animals are outliers in the infected boxplot corresponding to horseshoe bat g  3723 and marmoset g  3438 to be cautious since in vivo experiments have shown that marmosets can be infected and in vitro experiments have shown that horseshoe bats can be infected 2 20 21 22  table 1  we consider animals that have g values less than or equal to the g  37 for horseshoe bat to be at risk additionally there is a clear sampling bias in the set of animals that have so far been experimentally characterised all but chicken and duck are mammals as more nonmammals are tested the median g value for non-infection is likely to increase fig 3  as shown in previous studies and supported by experimental data many primates are predicted to be at high risk 19 38 39  in agricultural settings camels cows sheep goats and horses also have relatively low g values suggesting comparable binding affinities to humans in agreement with experimental data 20 21  in domestic settings dogs 18  cats 18  hamsters 20  and rabbits 20 21 22 also have g values suggesting risk again in agreement with experimental data table 1  whilst zoological animals that come into contact with humans such as pandas leopards and bears are also at risk of infection as shown experimentally 20 in predicting susceptibility we have chosen thresholds supported by in vivo or in vitro experimental data previous work contrasted the binding energy of the s-protein of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with human ace2 protein 24 25 29  sars-cov is able to infect humans despite a 20-fold lower binding affinity 24 25 29  suggesting that even where mutations in different animal species make the interfaces less compatible for sars-cov2 a considerably decreased binding energy may still be sufficient to enable infection by applying this threshold we correctly predict all 32 animals in our dataset that have experimental evidence of infection to be at risk table 1  however for a few animals we predict at risk using this threshold in vitro experimental studies to date have not shown infection for example donkeys are at risk of infection g  13 but no infections were observed in vitro for these animals 21  however infection has been observed in vitro for horse 21 and horse and donkey have identical dcex residues and the same g amongst new world monkeys marmosets have been experimentally infected 19  we predict that the closely related capuchin and squirrel monkey are also at risk although they have not been shown to be infected using functional assays 20  we performed detailed structural analyses to characterise the key residues contributing to binding energy changes and to consider these discrepancies further our analyses reveal that the interfaces in both capuchin and squirrel monkey are similar to marmoset suggesting that these two new world monkeys are also likely to be at risk even though there is no current experimental data supporting this 20 supplementary results 4  furthermore all these monkeys have high global sequence similarity to human for capuchin and squirrel monkey this is 90 and their dcex residues are identical to those of human further supporting risk in marmoset which has experimental evidence of infection the global sequence identity is 89 and 93 over the dcex residues additionally we compared changes in energy of the s-proteinace2 complex in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov and found similar changes suggesting that the range of animals susceptible to the virus is likely to be similar for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov supplementary results 5 ace2 and tmprss2 are key factors in the sars-cov-2 infection process both are highly coexpressed in susceptible cell types such as type ii pneumocytes in the lungs ileal absorptive enterocytes in the gut and nasal goblet secretory cells 43  since both proteins are required for infection of host cells and since our analyses clearly support suggestions of conserved binding of sproteinace2 across animal species we decided to analyse whether the tmprss2 was similarly conserved there is no known structure of tmprss2 so we built a high-quality model from a template structure pdb id 5i25 since tmprss2 is a serine protease and the key catalytic residues are known we used funfams to identify highly conserved residues in the active site and the cleavage site that are likely to be involved in substrate binding this resulted in two sets of residues that we analysed the active site and cleavage site residues ascs and the active site and cleavage site residues plus residues within 8 of catalytic residues that are highly conserved in the funfam ascsex the sum of grantham scores for mutations in the active site and cleavage site for tmprss2 is zero or consistently lower than ace2 in all organisms under consideration for both ascs and ascsex residues fig 4  this means that the mutations in tmprss2 involve more conservative changes mutations in dcex residues seem to have a more disruptive effect in ace2 than in tmprss2 whilst we expect orthologues from organisms that are close to humans to be conserved and have lower grantham scores we observed some residue substitutions that have high grantham scores for primates such as capuchin marmoset and mouse lemur in addition primates such as the coquerel sifaka greater bamboo lemur and bolivian squirrel monkey have mutations in dcex residues with high grantham scores mutations in tmprss2 may render these animals less susceptible to infection by sars-cov-2 a small-scale phylogenetic analysis was performed on a subset of sars-cov-2 assemblies in conjunction with a broader range of sars-like betacoronaviruses supplementary table 3  including sars-cov isolated from humans and civets the phylogeny is consistent with previous work 2 which identified the virus isolated from horseshoe bats ratg13 epiisl402131 as the closest genome to sars-cov-2 strains currently available fig 5  aided by a large community effort thousands of human-associated sars-cov-2 genome assemblies are now accessible on gisaid 16 17  at the time of writing these also include one assembly generated from a virus infecting a domestic dog epiisl414518 one obtained from a zoo tiger epiisl420923 and one obtained from a mink epiisl431778 sars-cov-2 strains from animal infections all fall within the phylogenetic diversity observed in human lineages fig 5a  the receptor binding domain is completely conserved fig 4b-c  across both human and animal sars-cov-2 with replacements in the spike protein of dog sprotein v8l tiger s-protein d614g and mink s-protein d614g strains relative to wuhan-hu-1 also observed in human-associated lineages 44  consistent with circulation in non-human hosts of note whilst genome-wide data indicates a closer phylogenetic relationship between sars-cov-2 strains and ratg13 the receptor binding domain alignment instead supports a closer relationship with a virus isolated from pangolins 45 epiisl410721 fig 5c  in line with previous reports 46  this highlights the importance of considering variations in protein structure that may determine host range the ongoing covid-19 global pandemic has a zoonotic origin necessitating investigations into how sars-cov-2 infects animals and how the virus can be transmitted across species given the role that the stability of the complex formed between the s-protein and its receptors could contribute to the viral host range zoonosis and anthroponosis there is a clear need to study these interactions however relative changes in the energies of the s-proteinace2 complex have not been explored experimentally or in silico a number of recent studies 20 21 39 have suggested that due to high conservation of ace2 some animals are vulnerable to infection by sars-cov-2 concerningly these animals could in theory serve as reservoirs of the virus increasing the risk of future zoonotic events though transmission rates across species are currently not known therefore it is important to try to predict which other animals could potentially be infected by sars-cov-2 so that the plausible extent of transmission can be estimated and surveillance efforts can be guided appropriately animal susceptibility to infection by sars-cov-2 has been studied in vivo 18 19 47 48 49 and in vitro 20 21 22 during the course of the pandemic parallel in silico work has made use of the protein structure of the s-proteinace2 complex to computationally predict the breadth of possible viral hosts most studies simply considered the number of residues mutated relative to human ace2 29 50 51  although some also analyse the effect that these mutations have on the interface stability 31 38 52  the most comprehensive of these studies analysed the number and locations of mutated residues in ace2 orthologues from 410 species 39  but did not perform detailed energy calculations as we have done also no assessment of tmprss2 was made furthermore our work is the only study that has so far explored changes in the energy of the s-proteinace2 complex on a large scale in this study we performed a comprehensive analysis of the major proteins that sars-cov-2 uses for cell entry we predicted structures of ace2 and tmprss2 orthologues from 215 vertebrate species and modelled s-proteinace2 complexes we calculated relative changes in energy g of sproteinace2 complexes in silico following mutations from animal residues to those in human our predictions suggest that whilst many mammals are susceptible to infection by sars-cov-2 most birds fish and reptiles are not likely to be however there are some exceptions we manually analysed residues in the s-proteinace2 interface including dc residues that directly contacted the other protein and dcex residues that also included residues within 8 of the binding residues that may affect binding we clearly showed the advantage of performing more sophisticated studies of the changes in energy of the complex over more simple measures--such as the number or chemical nature of mutated residues--used in other studies furthermore the wider set of dcex residues that we identified near the binding interface had a higher correlation to the phenotype data than the dc residues in addition to ace2 we also analysed how mutations in tmprss2 impact binding to the s-protein we found that mutations in tmprss2 are less disruptive than mutations in ace2 indicating that binding interactions in the s-proteintmprss2 complex in different species will not be affected to increase our confidence in assessing changes in the energy of the complex we developed multiple protocols using different established methods we correlated these stability measures with experimental infection phenotypes in the literature from in vivo 18 19 47 48 49 and in vitro 20 21 22 studies of animals protocol 2 using mcsm-ppi2 p2-ppi2 correlated best with the number of mutations chemical changes induced by mutations and infection phenotypes so we chose to focus our analysis employing this protocol our method cannot determine relative changes in energy that are associated with no risk instead we used experimental in vivo and in vitro infection data as the gold standard to identify animals at risk of note horseshoe bats heavily advocated as a putative reservoir host are predicted to be infected from in vitro experiments despite the considerable disruption in the interface that our detailed structural analysis shows we found that our predicted g values for animals that can be infected by sars-cov-2 are significantly lower than for animals that showed no infection when tested experimentally fig 1  table 1  g values for horseshoe bat and marmoset were outliers for infected animals these g values are higher than the median g value for animals that are not infected and are approximately the same value as the median g 388 for all animals included in this study however this may be a result of the biased sampling of animals that have been tested experimentally where most have been mammals to date going forward if more distantly related animals are experimentally characterised it is plausible that non-placental animals of which many have g  37 the value obtained for horseshoe bat would be found to not be infected therefore the difference between g values for animals that can and cannot be infected by sars-cov-2 will increase humans are likely to come into contact with 26 of these species in domestic agricultural or zoological settings fig 6  of particular concern are sheep that have no change in energy of the sproteinace2 complex as these animals are farmed and come into close contact with humans we also provide phylogenetic evidence that human sars-cov-2 is also present in tigers 15  dogs 16 17 and minks 16 17 fig 5  consistent with reports of human-to-animal transmission in the latter our measurements of the change in energy of the complex for the sars-cov s-protein were highly correlated with sars-cov-2 so our findings are also applicable to sars-cov to gain a better understanding of the nature of the s-proteinace2 interface we performed more detailed structural analyses for a subset of species in a few cases we had found discrepancies between our energy calculations and experimental phenotypes namely predicting risk for some animals where in-vitro experiments showed no infection table 1  to test our predictions we manually analysed how the shape or chemistry of residues may impact complex stability for all dc residues and a selection of dcex residues in agreement with other studies 25  we identified a number of locations in ace2 that are important for binding the s-protein these locations namely the hydrophobic cluster near the n-terminus and two hotspot locations near residues 31 and 353 stabilise the binding interface sars-cov-2 is better able to exploit the hydrophobic pocket than sars-cov by increased flexibility of its rbd loop and by mutation of l486f 25  our structural analysis showed how sars-cov-2 can utilise this pocket for binding at the interface in all the species we examined including those for which current experimental test data suggest no risk hotspot 353 shows more structural variability in agreement with our calculations of large changes in energy of the s-proteinace2 complex in horseshoe bat our structural studies show that the variant d38n causes the loss of a salt bridge and h-bonding interactions between ace2 and s-protein at hotspot 353 these detailed structural analyses are supported by the high grantham score and calculated total g for the change in energy of the complex both dog and cat have a physicochemically similar variant at this hotspot d38e which although disrupting the salt bridge still permits alternative h-bonding interactions between the spike rbd and ace2 for marmosets and other new world monkeys capuchin and squirrel monkey our structural analyses revealed similarity to human at hotspot 353 in the ace2 interface in fact capuchin resembled the human ace2 interface even more closely than marmoset which can be infected 19  even though in vitro experiments have not reported infection in capuchin 20  our g value for capuchin g  34 suggests risk of infection and also for squirrel monkey g  25 despite the fact that squirrel monkey also failed to show risk in in vitro experimental studies of note is the fact that marmoset showed no infection in in vitro studies 20  whilst recent in vivo experiments 19 have shown risk perhaps suggesting that it can be difficult to detect infection in vitro for these monkeys alternatively the lack of infection may suggest additional factors influencing infection and indicate that these animals which are primates closely related to human may be useful models for studying immune or other factors related to resistance finally our structural analyses showed that some dcex residues were likely to be allosteric sites which may represent promising drug targets 53  the value of our study is not in determining an absolute g threshold for risk but rather in providing information about relative changes in binding energy that will allow the host range of the virus to be more accurately gauged once more experimental work has been conducted we believe that false positive predictions are more acceptable than false negatives so within the context of possible transmission events between species and particularly to human we consider that an animal can be infected if there is any experimental evidence of infection we applied protocols that enabled a comprehensive study of host range within a reasonable time for identifying species at risk of infection by sars-cov-2 or of becoming reservoirs of the virus although we felt that these faster methods were justified by the need for timely answers to these questions there are clearly caveats to our work that should be taken into account whilst we use a state of the art modelling tool 53 and an endorsed method for calculating changes in energy of the complex 54  molecular dynamics may give a more accurate picture of energy changes by sampling rotamer space more comprehensively however such an approach would have been prohibitively expensive at a time when it is clearly important to identify animals at risk as quickly as possible each animal could take orders of magnitude longer to analyse using molecular dynamics further caveats include the fact that although the animals we highlight at risk from our changes in binding energy calculations correlate well with the experimental data there is only a small amount of such data currently available and many of the experimental papers reporting these data are yet to be peer reviewed finally we restricted our analyses to one strain of sars-cov-2 but other strains may have evolved with mutations that give more complementary interfaces for example recent work suggests sars-cov-2 can readily adapt to infect mice following serial passages 55  in summary our work is not aiming to provide an absolute measure of risk of infection rather it should be considered an efficient method to screen a large number of animals and suggest possible susceptibility and thereby guide further studies any predictions of possible risk should be confirmed by experimental studies and computationally expensive but more robust methods like molecular dynamics the ability of sars-cov-2 to infect host cells and cause covid-19 sometimes resulting in severe disease ultimately depends on a multitude of other host-virus protein interactions 37  while we do not investigate them all in this study our results suggest that sars-cov-2 could indeed infect a broad range of mammals as there is a possibility of creating new reservoirs of the virus we should now consider how to identify such transmission early and to mitigate against such risks in particular farm animals and other animals living in close contact with humans could be monitored protected where possible and managed accordingly 56  ace2 protein sequences for 239 vertebrates including humans were obtained from ensembl 57 version 99 and eight sequences from uniprot release 20201 supplementary table 1  tmprss2 protein sequences for 278 vertebrate sequences including the human sequence were obtained from ensembl supplementary table 2  a phylogenetic tree of species to indicate the evolutionary relationships between animals was downloaded from ensembl 57  the structure 24 of the sars-cov-2 s-protein bound to human ace2 at 245 was used throughout pdb id 6m0j we used standard methods to analyse the sequence similarity between human ace2 and other vertebrate species supplementary methods 1  we also mapped ace2 and tmprss2 sequences to our cath functional families to detect residues highly conserved across species supplementary methods 1 in addition to residues in ace2 that contact the s-protein directly various other studies have also considered residues that are in the second shell or are buried and could influence binding 58  therefore in our analyses we built on these approaches and extended them to compile the following sets for our study 1 direct contact dc residues this includes a total of 20 residues that are involved in direct contact with the s-protein 24 identified by pdbe 59 and pdbsum 60  2 direct contact extended dcex residues this dataset includes residues within 8 of dc residues that are likely to be important for binding these were selected by detailed manual inspection of the complex and also considering the following criteria i reported evidence from deep mutagenesis 58  ii in silico alanine scanning using mcsm-ppi 61  iii residues with high evolutionary conservation patterns identified by the funfams-based protocol described above ie residues identified with dops  70 and scorecons score  07 iv allosteric site prediction supplementary methods 2 and v sites under positive selection supplementary methods 2 selected residues are shown in supplementary fig 3 and residues very close to dc residues ie within 5 are annotated we also included residues identified by other related structural analyses reported in the literature supplementary methods 2 using the ace2 protein sequence from each species structural models were generated for the sproteinace2 complex for 247 animals using the funmod modelling pipeline 41 42  based on modeller 53 supplementary methods 3 models were refined by modeller to optimise the geometry of the complex and the interface only high-quality models were used in this analysis with ndope62 score  -1 and with  10 dcex residues missing this gave a final dataset of 215 animals for further analysis the modelled structures of ace2 were compared against the human structure pdb id 6m0j and pairwise against each other using ssap 63  ssap returns a score in the range 0-100 with identical structures scoring 100 we also built models for tmprss2 proteins in all available species and identified the residues likely to be involved in the protein function supplementary methods 3  we calculated the changes in binding energy of the sars-cov-2 s-proteinace2 complex and the sars-cov s-proteinace2 complex of different species compared to human following two different protocols 1 protocol 1 using the human complex and mutating the residues for the ace2 interface to those found in the given animal sequence and then calculating the g of the complex using both mcsm-ppi1 61 and mcsm-ppi2 54 supplementary methods 4  this gave a measure of the destabilisation of the complex in the given animal relative to the human complex g values  0 are associated with destabilising mutations whilst values  0 are associated with stabilising mutations 2 protocol 2 we repeated the analysis with both mcsm-ppi1 and mcsm-ppi2 as in protocol 1 but using the animal 3-dimensional models instead of the human ace2 structure and calculating the g of the complex by mutating the animal ace2 interface residue to the appropriate residue in the human ace2 structure this gave a measure of the destabilisation of the complex in the human complex relative to the given animal values  0 are associated with destabilisation of the human complex ie animal complexes more stable whilst values  0 are associated with stabilisation of the human complex ie animal complexes less stable we subsequently correlated g values with available in vivo and in vitro experimental data on covid-19 infection data for mammals protocol 2 mcsm-ppi2 correlated best with these data to measure the degree of chemical change associated with mutations occurring in dc and dcex residues we computed the grantham score 64 for each vertebrate compared to the human sequence supplementary methods 5 we performed phylogenetic analyses for a subset of sars-cov n  10 sars-like n  27 and sars-cov-2 n  13 viruses from publicly available data in ncbi 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 and gisaid 16 17 supplementary methods 6  linking human destruction of nature to covid-19 increases support for wildlife conservation policies ganga shreedhar susana mourato   this paper investigates if narratives varying the likely cause of the covid-19 pandemic influence peoples support for pro-wildlife conservation policies as well as pro-wildlife behaviours and behavioural intentions understanding the cause of the outbreak is important for choosing what we should do to contain it and to mitigate the risk of future ones yet where the coronavirus originated from still remains a mystery much uncertainty characterises debates about the origin of the coronavirus evident from the various and sometimes conflicting narratives concurrently circulating online in news and social media three popular narratives proposing different causal explanations for the coronavirus outbreak are particularly pertinent for peoples engagement with wildlife and environmental conservation the first narrative is that the sars-cov-2 virus causing the covid-19 outbreak originated in animals and may have jumped to humans via intermediary animal hosts in a market in wuhan which sold wildlife animal-cause ac narrative this is the proximate cause of the pandemic this causal explanation is based on a growing scientific consensus that the virus is most likely zoonotic and that the pandemic is an instance of a zoonotic spillover ie where animal pathogens are transmitted to humans similar to past infectious epidemics like swine flu and ebola andersen et al 2020 mallapaty 2020 cyranoski 2020 the second narrative takes this reasoning further by suggesting that the ongoing human destruction of nature via the depletion of wild animals and their habitats escalates the risks of such zoonotic spillovers since it increases human-animal interactions animal  human-cause ahc narrative this is the distal cause of the pandemic it is compatible with the first narrative and frames the increased risk of zoonotic pandemics as an unintended consequence of anthropogenic mass animal extinction and climate change it has been put forward by leading biologists like jane goodall thompson 2020 and environmental policymakers like the uns environment chief inger andersen carrington 2020a the third narrative which is often simultaneously shared alongside the other two suggests that the virus came from a biosecurity lab in wuhan studying bat coronaviruses animal  human  lab-cause ahlc narrative it provides an alternate proximate cause that has been proposed by some prominent political figures like president trump and more recently the former uk intelligence head richard dearlove gardener 2020the virus could have accidentally escaped from the lab eg through an infected lab worker and it is possible that scientists at the lab might have tweaked the viruss genome for research purposes before it escaped but unlike the other two narratives there is no publicly available scientific evidence for this cause at present1 this story locates the pandemics cause in the ongoing geopolitical rather than anthropogenic environmental change context since it proposes an alternate explanation that diverges from the first two stories it can be conceptualised as a counter-narrative which can increase uncertainty about the cause when it appears alongside the other stories to estimate if these types of covid-19 origin narratives affect pro-conservation outcomes we ran a pre-registered online experiment in the uk n  1081 subjects were randomly allocated to either a control group which read a neutral article unrelated to the pandemic or one of three narrative treatment groups each presenting a different likely cause of the covid-19 outbreak an animal cause ac an animal and human cause ahc and an animal human or lab cause ahlc fig 1 then subjects were asked about a number of pro-wildlife conservation outcomes donations to nature conservation in an incentivised charitable giving task stated intentions to undertake pro-conservation behaviours and stated support for policies that are pro-wildlife conservation to the best of our knowledge this is the first ever effort to estimate the causal impact of types of covid-19 origin narratives on pro-wildlife conservation outcomes in a controlled setting we add a number of new insights to the literature firstly providing causal evidence about how types of narratives affects pro-conservation outcomes eg bnabou et al 2018 secondly estimating the effect of varying the cause of public health challenges ie covid-19 on support for conservation policies eg kahneman et al 1993 and thirdly examining the impact of inserting alternate causal explanations into narratives eg van der linden 2015 we found that the ahc narrative elicited significantly greater support for conservation policies especially for commercial wildlife trade bans when compared to the control and other treatment groups adding the lab story as in the ahlc group or removing the human-cause component as in ac group attenuated this effect when we explored possible mechanisms we found that ahc narratives were less familiar elicited greater mental and emotional engagement and induced stronger feelings that firms and governments are responsible for mitigating wildlife extinction the ahc narrative increased the likelihood of making a donation at the default amount of 10 and over but neither the ac or any of the other treatment narratives influenced the donation amount or pro-conservation intentions in this setting overall the results suggest that narratives causally linking the human destruction of nature to covid-19 can increase support for wildlife conservation policies section two reviews the literature on how narratives and causal information shift beliefs preferences and behaviour section three presents the experimental design and materials and section four the results section five concludes with a discussion narratives according to bruner 1991 deal in human or human-like intention and action and the vicissitudes and consequences that mark their course they are stories that people tell themselves and share with others to make sense of human experience ie to organize explain justify predict and sometimes influence its course bruner 1991 chater and loewenstein 2016 bnabou et al 2018 insights from both economics and psychology suggest narrativesand the causal explanations they providecan shift support for policies and behaviour to be consistent with the stories told in economics for instance bnabou et al 2018 formalise narratives as rationales or justifications for what one should do or not in situations where actions have moral or social implications such as those involving externalities also see shiller 2017 dolan 2019 they differentiate between responsibilizing and absolving narratives the former creates pressure to behave morally for instance by emphasizing how a persons actions impact others and moral responsibility responsibilizing narratives therefore can increase prosocial beliefs preferences and behaviour conversely absolving narratives employ strategies like blaming the victims appealing to alternate facts and denying responsibility they can be used to justify antisocial selfish or short-sighted actions both responsibilizing and absolving narratives can operate by changing beliefs about the externality of their choices or how responsible people feel for negative externalities as long as they are perceived by recipients as containing enough of a grain of truth similarly eliaz and spiegler 2018 consider narratives as causal models of the world which map action variables onto consequences in their model lever narratives provide causal explanations or levers which trigger specific outcomes and therefore shape policy preferences narrative persuasion and discourse psychology scholars also conceptualise narratives as a type of communication format specifying a cause-effect relationship over time using specific characters kreuter et al 2007 dahlstrom 2014 they examine how information placed within narratives eg protagonists plot emotional valence elicit responses compared to fact-based or persuasive messages green et al 2004 kreuter et al 2007 moyer-gus 2008 dahlstrom 2010 braddock and dillard 2016 apart from altering beliefs this strand of research suggests that narratives operate via specific psychological mechanisms such as reducing counter-arguing changing norms self-efficacy and outcome expectancies moyer-gus 2008 a particularly important channel is narrative engagement ie narratives work by enabling greater mental emotional and attentional absorption or transportation into the story green and brock 2000 appel et al 2015 van laer et al 2019 this work therefore suggests that exposure to narratives can impact multiple outcomes like beliefs preferences intentions and behaviours via several psychological mechanisms yet inconsistent results from empirical research suggest that the effect of narratives is not fully understood while studies operationalise narratives in numerous ways most tend to expose subjects to different narratives or formats eg fictionnon-fiction videostext and then measure stated beliefs and behavioural intentions rely on small convenience samples eg students and many lack control groups winterbottom et al 2008 dahlstrom 2010 greitemeyer 2013 shen et al 2015 van der linden et al 2015 braddock and dillard 2016 cooper and nisbet 2016 moezzi et al 2017 recent meta-analyses point to positive associations between narrative exposure and narrative-consistent beliefs intentions and behaviour braddock and dillard 2016 shen et al 2015 highlight that the effectiveness may depend on the issue at handthey found narrative-format health interventions advocating detection and prevention behaviours led to significant effects whereas those advocating cessation did not in the environmental domain greitemeyer 2013 found that watching a climate change sceptic film decreased environmental concern relative to a neutral film condition whereas exposure to a climate change affirming film did not similarly van der linden 2015 found exposure to anti-climate change conspiracy narratives reduced peoples pro-climate behavioural intentions such as signing petitions donating or volunteering compared to a control condition where participants solved a word puzzle these studies largely focus on the impact of public health or environmental narratives on behaviours in their respective domains we are not aware of any studies that investigate the effects of narratives connecting health and anthropogenic wildlife extinction especially in the coronavirus context moreover although causal information is considered a crucial attribute of all narratives there is less evidence about how varying the cause affects outcomes economists and psychologists have demonstrated that both causal information and the type of cause matters in environmental valuation studies for example people are willing to pay more to address environmental problems caused by humans rather than nature kahneman et al 1993 1998 kahneman and ritov 1994 brown et al 2005 bulte et al 2005 bhm and pfister 2017 kahneman et al 1993 termed this the outrage effect because they found that people reported human-caused harm as more upsetting than unintentional harm more recently shreedhar and mourato 2019 found evidence for the outrage effect on wildlife conservation donations they found that subjects increased donations after exposure to audio-visual narratives causally linking wildlife loss to human causes like poaching and habitat loss compared to a control group omitting this causal information from the narrative apart from outrage feelings of responsibility are another mechanism through which the varying type of causehuman versus naturalcan influence the willingness to address environmental problems walker et al 1999 brown et al 2005 bulte et al 2005 in contrast to the outrage effect the responsibility effect implies that the willingness to pay for human-caused environmental problems is lower than natural ones when people dont feel responsible for the damages this is likely in situations when people attribute responsibility to third parties like negligent or polluting firms walker et al 1999 bulte et al 2005 related literature also highlights that felt responsibility is an important psychological mechanism that causally links beliefs about human-caused climate change to pro-environmental and climate change mitigation engagement and behaviour kaiser and shimoda 1999 gifford and nilsson 2014 bateman and oconnor 2016 bnabou et al 2018s framework also supports the notion that denying or feeling moral responsibility via absolving or responsibilizing narratives respectively affects prosocial behaviour we contribute to and connect these distinct strands of literature studying the impacts of narratives and causal information by investigating if different causal explanations offered by narratives about a public health challenge covid-19 influences pro-wildlife conservation outcomes instead of comparing narratives that vary human versus nature-causes of environmental problems the main focus of past studies we studied the effect of adding on distal human causes to proximate nature-causes of covid-19 in the same narrative in addition we study if the inclusion of an alternative causal explanation via an absolving narrative ie the lab story affects outcomes we motivate our predictions drawing on bnabou et al 2018s framework of responsibilizing and absolving narratives and the outrage versus responsibility effect we conduct exploratory analysis on whether effects are driven by two important psychological mechanisms highlighted in the literature namely narrative engagement and felt responsibility we also make a modest contribution by addressing previous methodological limitations in the literature since we conduct a controlled and pre-registered online experiment using a comparatively larger sample of uk residents and attempt to elicit both stated behaviour intentions and policy support and revealed behaviour through an incentivised charitable giving task in the same study our main objective is to examine whether different types of narratives about the cause or origin of covid-19 namely the ac ahc and ahlc narratives impact pro-wildlife conservation behaviours intentions and policy preferences collectively called pro-conservation outcomes since all three narratives raise the issue of covid-19 originating from wild animals we expect that they will all elicit higher pro-conservation outcomes when compared to the control group this is in line with past studies showing how narrative exposure can increase narrative consistent beliefs preferences intentions and behaviours eg braddock and dillard 2016 so the first hypothesis is that the ac ahc and ahlc narratives will increase pro-conservation outcomes when compared to the control narrative a second objective is to investigate differences between the ac ahc and ahlc narratives the ahc narrative can be seen as a responsibilizing narrative in bnabou et al 2018s framework it creates a moral pressure to increase prosocial pro-conservation outcomes by making the plight of wildlife and nature salient via trade of wild animals and depletion of their habitats and identifying human behaviour as the distal cause as a negative externality of current trade production and consumption systems the outrage effect also predicts that human causes may elicit greater pro-conservation outcomes kahneman et al 1993 the ac narrative on the other hand does not make the causal link between human-caused mass extinction and covid-19 explicit so the second hypothesis is that the ahc narrative will increase pro-conservation outcomes when compared to the ac narrative the lab counter-narrative can be seen as an absolving narrative by adding it to the ahc narrative as in the ahlc narrative people might be more likely to justify not engaging in personally effortful and costly pro-conservation outcomes in line with the responsibility effect people may deny responsibility for covid-19 by attributing blame to the biosecurity lab which in turn may dampen any increase in pro-conservation outcomes walker et al 1999 bnabou et al 2018 that said since the ahlc treatment group also contains information on the animal and human causes it is unclear which effect if any will dominate so our third and fourth hypotheses are that the ahc narratives will increase pro-conservation outcomes by the same magnitude as ahlc narrative and that the ac narrative will increase pro-conservation outcomes by the same magnitude ahlc narrative respectively we also undertake further analysis by examining if the impact of different types of narratives is based on past behaviour and beliefs about human-caused mass extinction in particular we expect that people who believe more strongly that anthropogenic mass extinction is happening and who have undertaken pro-conservation behaviours in the past may be more likely to respond by increasing pro-conservation outcomes than those who hold weaker beliefs and have undertaken fewer relevant behaviours in the past in addition we also explored if treatment effects depended on past beliefs about the animal cause of the covid-19 outbreak finally we undertake exploratory analysis by investigating two possible psychological mechanisms namely felt responsibility and narrative engagement which could affect the outcomes considered our first exploratory hypothesis is that the ac ahc and ahlc narratives will increase felt responsibility about wildlife conservation when compared to the control narrative our second exploratory hypothesis is that the ac ahc and ahlc narratives will increase narrative engagement when compared to the control narrative we conducted an online survey experiment the study was pre-registered on the open science framework2 the survey was programmed on qualtrics and implemented on 3 june 2020 on the prolific academic platform it was advertised as a study on daily life and views during the covid-19 outbreak participation was open to all uk residents ten subjects who previously took part in a pilot and were from the same participant pool were excluded in addition the survey was restricted to those using laptops and computers to ensure all questions were correctly displayed on the survey interface to determine the sample size per treatment group a power analysis was conducted on gpower using a non-parametric test of difference in means wilcoxon-mannwhitney test two independent groups faul et al 2007 an effect size of d  025 alpha  005 power  080 was assumed3 this yielded 265 subjects per treatment group subjects were excluded if they failed a seriousness check in which they could indicate that they did not take part in the survey seriously aust et al 2013 we recruited 1120 subjects in total to account for possible reductions in the final sample size a few subjects did not consent to take the survey dropped off while taking the survey or failed the seriousness check the final usable sample consisted of 1081 subjects or an average of 270 subjects per treatment group all participants were paid 2 apart from any earnings from the donation task explained in sect 34 and the average completion time was around 6 min after subjects consented to participate they answered some introductory socio-demographic questions followed by questions about the coronavirus and their pro-conservation behaviours and beliefs then each participant was randomly allocated to read one of the four narrative stimuli explained in sect 33 after which they could choose to donate money to an environmental charity they then answered questions about their intentions to undertake more pro-conservation behaviours and their support for different wildlife conservation policies this was followed by questions about feelings of responsibility and narrative engagement and the survey concluded with some more exploratory and socio-demographic questions we attempted to mitigate the possibility of bias arising from order effects in a number of ways day et al 2012 firstly by embedding belief and past behaviour questions amongst other filler questions about peoples daily behaviours and experiences secondly by randomising the order of these questions thirdly by randomising the item order within questions where relevant for eg in the multiple-choice questions and finally by designing the questions to be short and simple in order not to tire the participants subjects were asked to imagine that they came across an article on their social media feed and to please read it carefully they were then randomly assigned to one of the articles containing the narrative treatments and the control there were three narrative treatment articles as shown in fig 1 panels bd in the ac treatment the article stated that scientists believe that the coronavirus may have jumped from wild animals to humans in a market in wuhan this narrative links the proximate animal cause to the covid-19 pandemic the ahc treatment was exactly the same but added causal information explaining that human destruction of nature may be responsible for animal viruses spreading to humans this narrative links two types of compatible causes namely the proximate animal and the distal human cause to the covid-19 pandemic the ahlc treatment was exactly the same as the ahc but added an alternate causal explanation by stating that president trump suggested that the coronavirus came from a lab in wuhan this narrative presented an alternate explanation as the cause of the covid-19 pandemic while still making the link with the proximate animal and distal human causes the content of the treatment articles was adapted from real online narrative-format articles from the bbc briggs 2020 the guardian carrington 2020b beaumont 2020 the daily mail boyd 2020 pleasance 2020 and the journal nature mallapaty 2020 cyranoski 2020 as commonly seen in these real articles our treatment articles also contain one picture placed above the text for greater realism another reason why we chose to place pictures in the narratives is that previous studies pointed out that they enable more effective communication pictures can enable us to retain more information via the picture superiority effect compared to plain text hockley and bancroft 2011 schwabish 2014 they can clarify implicit or unclear relations in the text eitel and scheiter 2015 and can facilitate deeper learning via the multimedia effect mayer 2002 green and brock 2002 also suggest narratives with visual images are more engaging and persuasive because pictures enable greater transportation into that narrative we followed three criteria in the selection of the final photo use a real photo of good quality not explicitly distressing or visceral and with no people the picture we selected was a single caged animal to reflect the animal source of the virus it is also nearly identical to those appearing in bbc articles about the source of the coronavirus eg in briggs 2020 the animal source is the one common causal explanation across all the treatment groups so we kept this photo constant across all treatment groups to minimise differences between them and to balance experimental control with realism although we cannot isolate the effect of the picture its inclusion in the treatment could make the narrative more engaging memorable and realistic similarly we designed the text in the treatment articles to be closely aligned with real online narrative-format articles we used more neutral words in an effort to keep people focused on the arguments presented in the text4 moreover the articles were carefully designed to systematically add on different types of causal information in a way that generates greater complexity and uncertainty as we move from the ac to the ahlc treatments since we used an add-on design the addition of new causal explanations increased the word count of each article from 172 in the ac group to 245 words in the ahc group to 272 words in the ahlc group in this way we attempted to mirror how real covid-19 origin stories in online news and social media often contain multiple causal explanations within the same narrative-format article while we cannot isolate the effects of word length per se our approach arguably reflects the multi-layered complex causal connections between environmental and health systems in the covid-19 context finally to ensure the treatments were realistic and as similar as possible we presented them to participants as a snapshot of an online bbc article using the same logo formatting font type and colouring the main message from each paragraph of text in the narrative was underlined in bold in a nearly identical format as online bbc articles both to help clarify the main message and enable greater comprehension to account for variations in reading ability amongst the participants the bbc was chosen because recent surveys indicate that it is the most widely used and trusted source of online and offline news in the uk across the political spectrum including both conservative and labour voters and brexit leave and remain voters the control narrative was about a scottish heritage monument it was adapted from a recent online bbc article to act as a realistic placebo of an article actually in circulation bbc 2020 it was of a similar length to the ac narrative at 181 words and identically formatted with one picture fig 1 panel a pro-conservation outcomes included charitable donations as a revealed behaviour via an incentivised task behavioural intentions and support for different wildlife conservation policies donations were elicited from a modified charitable giving task at the start of the experiment subjects were informed that they had a 1100 chance to win 20 for successfully completing the survey after being exposed to the narrative they were asked how much of that amount if anything they wanted to allocate to a conservation charity from a pre-selected list of nature conservation and animal charities5 the remaining amount would be sent directly to them with a donation receipt if they won the draw subjects used a slider to choose the desired donation amount that could take any value between 0 and 20 in 1 increments with the default amount set at 10 we chose this format including the default to reflect the practices of real-life charities6 four self-assessment items were used to measure if subjects were willing to take up relevant pro-conservation behaviours in the future especially lifestyle and civic actions these included intentions to avoid eating meat attend a protest and other civic actions engage with a conservation organisation for instance by donating money or time and to follow a more sustainable lifestyle for example by using renewable energy response options raged from definitely not 1 to definitely yes 5 three self-assessment items measured support for three conservation policies including stricter regulation of the trade and farming of wild animals a tax on red and processed meat and a ban of most commercial trade in wild animals response options ranged from definitely not 1 to definitely yes 5 to measure past pro-conservation behaviours we asked subjects to indicate whether they had engaged with any animal or wildlife organisation or taken civic action over the past 2 years they could indicate if they had undertaken any or some of the following six actions conservation organisation membership donating or volunteering which captured engagement attended a protest signed a petition or written to their mp which captured civic action these responses were summed up for each participant to denote how many actions they undertook such that values ranged from 0 no actions to 6 all six actions we also asked subjects to describe their diet by selecting one option from a list of the following omnivore pescatarian flexitarian vegetarian vegan and restricted diets we coded this as a dummy variable as 1 vegetarian or vegan diet or 0 other to measure past pro-conservation beliefs we asked subjects to indicate to what extent they agreed with three items that examined anthropogenic mass extinction and environmental change statements included climate change is mostly caused by human activities mass extinction of wild animals is happening and mass extinction of wild animals is mostly caused by human activities these items were adapted from leiserowitz et al 2010 response options ranged from strongly disagree 1 to strongly agree 7 these three items were averaged to form a past-proconservation belief score cronbach alpha  071 to measure past animal cause beliefs about the origin of the coronavirus we asked subjects to indicate to what extent they agreed with one item stating the coronavirus came from animals in a market in wuhan response options ranged from strongly disagree 1 to strongly agree 7 in order to check for balance across observables and for further analyses we collected basic sociodemographic data including age gender education self-identified ethnicity and annual income we also elicited whether people identified as leavers or remainers or neither with regards to brexit7 feelings of responsibility for mitigating wildlife extinction was measured by asking subjects how much they agreed with two items one measuring personal responsibility and another measuring whether they felt firms and governments have a responsibility to help mitigate wildlife extinction response options ranged from strongly disagree 1 to strongly agree 5 and were adapted from bateman and oconnor 2016 narrative engagement and familiarity were measured by using three items modified from appel et al 2015s narrative transportation scale subjects were asked to indicate to what extent they felt mentally and emotionally engaged while reading the articles and whether they were already familiar with the narrative responses ranged from not at all 1 to extremely 5 we assessed if participants recalled information in the narratives by asking them to indicate if they remembered the following firstly what the article suggested the cause of the covid-19 outbreak was humans due to either the destruction of nature or a lab wild animals none of the above or dont remember and secondly what other zoonotic diseases were swine flu diabetes none of the above or dont remember another item asked subjects if they remembered the article source where options included the bbc itv or cnn we also asked subjects if they typically used the bbc as a source of online news and whether they trusted the bbc where response options were yes maybe and no finally we measured the amount of time subjects spent on the survey page containing the articles to check if there were any differences in the time spent reading narratives between groups we used filler questions throughout and a neutral title that directed people to their daily life during covid-19 to address concerns about experimenter demand to better understand why people chose not to donate we asked the subset of non-donors to select the reasons for their decision from a list of common responses eg i would rather keep the money i need to save money i dont know the charities etc to estimate the causal effect of the narratives on donations we used the cragg-hurdle regression model because it allowed us to jointly estimate both the amount donated as well as the probability of making a donation by treating 0 as the observed lower bound of the donations8 we also explored if narrative exposure increased the likelihood of subjects donating 10 or over ie default donation amount using a logistic regression the dependent variable was a categorical variable taking the value 1 if donations were 10 or greater for the other pro-conservation outcomes including pro-wildlife behavioural intentions and policy support we used ordered logistic regressions since they are ordinal variables9 wald tests of differences between the treatment categories were used to examine if there was any difference in the treatment effects on policy support any heterogeneous effects of past behaviour and beliefs were explored by interacting the treatment dummy with the variable under consideration and only if it had a significant effect in the main analysis all statistical models are estimated with robust standard errors the main analyses to estimate the average treatment effect is undertaken without covariates for the entire sample of 1081 subjects covariates are added in the additional and exploratory analysis for the sample for those 1008 subjects who chose to disclose their sociodemographic data table 1 presents summary statistics around 69 of subjects identified as being female 54 were below 34 years of age with only 9 being over 55 years old almost 90 identified as white 66 completed an undergraduate degree or attended college and 65 had an annual income below 50000 the sample also contained more people identifying as remainers 65 than leavers 25 in terms of past pro-conservation behaviours 90 of the sample did not follow a vegetarian or vegan diet in terms of civic actions like attending a protest donating moneytime etc 47 had not taken up any of these actions while 31 had taken up at least one action and 17 had taken up at least two actions figure 3 in the appendix shows the distribution of responses across groups most people were found to hold pro-conservation beliefs with 20 at least somewhat agreeing and 75 agreeing or strongly agreeing that mass wildlife extinction and climate change are happening and are caused mostly by humans there was relatively less agreement on whether coronavirus originated in animals with 30 of the sample at least somewhat agreeing with the animal origin story and just over 34 agreeing or strongly agreeing figures 4 and 5 in the appendix show the distribution of responses across groups since the treatment was randomly allocated most observable characteristics are evenly spread across treatment groups as noted in the p values in table 1 while the summary statistics of past pro-conservation behaviour dont seem to show much difference across groups the p value from the kruskalwallis balance tests indicates some difference across groups because a smaller share of those in the ahlc group relative to the control group reported undertaking no actions as noted in sect 38 and in the pre-registration plan we will first conduct the main analysis without covariates and then add in the covariates in the subsequent analysis to address this issue turning to pro-conservation outcomes in table 2 the average donation was just under 8 with the median and mode being 10 likely reflecting the fact that this was the default donation starting point the mean donation in the control group is slightly lower at about 74 when compared to around 81 in the treatment groups overall some 19 of the subjects chose not to donate while 81 donated some amount when we examined the distribution of donation responses across groups see fig 6 in appendix we found a slightly higher share of subjects donated 10 or over ie default amount on the donations task in the treatment groups 539 in the ac narrative 563 in the ahc narrative and 518 in the ahlc narrative compared to 485 in the control group in terms of pro-conservation behavioural intentions we found generally low average scores suggesting that people have relatively weak intentions to act in the specified pro-conservation ways in the future the average score for intentions to engage in future social action avoid eating meat and engage with conservation organisations were 26 29 and 3 respectively the score for intentions to follow sustainable lifestyles was higher averaging 4 average scores were only slightly higher in the treated groups relative to the control figures 7 8 9 and 10 in the appendix present the distribution of responses across groups support for the three wildlife conservation policies presented in the survey was relatively higher gaining average scores of around 45 3 and 41 in support of stricter regulation of wildlife trade and farming a meat tax and banning commercial trade in wildlife respectively once more scores were slightly higher in the treated groups figures 11 12 13 and 14 in the appendix present the distribution of responses across groups when we regressed the narrative treatment variable on donations we found that the treatment coefficients were positive but the difference was not statistically significant when compared to the control group the results are presented in table 5 in the appendix in table 3 model 1 presents the results of the effect of treatment narratives on the likelihood of donating the default 10 amount and over without any covariates while all the treatment coefficients were positive the difference was statistically significant at the 10 only for the ahc narrative relative to the control group this result suggests that when exposed to the ahc narrative subjects are 365 more likely to make a donation of 10 or higher compared to the control group10 when we considered intentions to act in more pro-conservation ways the regression results revealed that the narrative treatment coefficients are positive but not significant when compared to the control table 7 in the appendix presents the results given the lack of robust treatment effects we focus the rest of our analysis on the effect of the narratives on support for different wildlife conservation policies table 3 models 25 presents our main results where the narrative dummy is regressed on the policy support outcomes without any covariates relative to the control group the ahc narrative group elicited higher support for all policies and this difference was significant at the 5 level for stricter regulation and the meat tax and at the 1 level for the wildlife trade ban and the aggregate conservation policies variable more specifically relative to the control group being exposed to the ahc narrative increased the odds of a subject reporting higher support by one point for stricter regulation the meat tax and the ban by 418 374 and 679 respectively exposure to the ahlc narrative significantly increased support only for the trade ban at 5 level when compared to the control group this translated into an increase in the odds of a subject reporting higher support by one point for the ban by 368 these results indicate that exposure to the ahc narrative significantly increased pro-wildlife conservation policy support in line with the possible existence of an outrage effect removing the human cause from the narrative as in the ac narrative or adding in an alternate causal explanation as in the ahlc narrative removes this effect overall also considering the effects on donations and behavioural intentions these results lend partial support to our first hypothesis wald tests show that the difference in the ac and ahc coefficients was significant and positive since ahc had a higher effect at the 10 level for both the meat tax and the trade ban chi2  356 p value  006 and chi2  275 p value  010 respectively the difference between the ac and ahc coefficients was significant at the 5 level when the outcome was the aggregated support for conservation policies variable chi2  438 p value  004 there was no difference between the ac and ahlc coefficients or ahc and ahlc coefficients in any of the models these results suggest that adding the distal human cause in the ahc narrative increased pro-conservation policy support relative to the narrative that omits distal human cause ie the ac narrative this lends support for hypothesis two in the context of the wildlife policy outcome we also found no difference between the ahc and ahlc narratives and the ac and ahlc narratives lending support to hypothesis three and four that there is no difference between these narratives in terms of their effect in the wildlife policy outcome we did not find any heterogeneous effects on policy support when we interacted a dummy for the narrative treatments with past pro-conservation behaviour past pro-conservation beliefs and past beliefs about whether the virus originated in animals the only exception was a positive and significant interaction effect between the ahlc and past beliefs about the animal cause of the virus significant at the 5 see table 9 in the appendix figure 2 plots the coefficients from the ordered logistic regression where the narrative dummy is regressed on the policy support outcomes with past conservation behaviour past beliefs and socio-demographic covariates the results are consistent in terms of effect size and significance level with the main results of the treatment effect presented in table 3 the only exception is that the coefficient on the ahc narrative is no longer significant at the 5 level for the stricter regulation policy support following a vegetarian or vegan diet relative to those who dont and past conservation behaviour and beliefs are the strongest predictors of policy support the respective coefficients are all positive and statistically significant at the 1 level support for wildlife trade bans and stricter regulations but not the meat tax are positively associated with age compared to those identifying as leavers remainers were more likely to support a meat tax significant at 5 table 4 presents the results of the effect of the narrative treatments on felt responsibility and narrative engagement while exposure to the treatment narratives increased feelings of personal responsibility the difference was not significant model 1 the ahc narrative however increased the feeling that firms and governments were responsible and the difference was positive and significant at the 1 level model 2 in terms of covariates stronger past pro-conservation beliefs and behaviours and following a vegetarianvegan diet were positively associated with higher feelings of both personal and firms and government responsibility significant mostly at the 1 level remainers felt firms and governments were more responsible compared to leavers significant at 1 all the treatment narratives increased feelings of emotional and mental involvement in the article compared to the control group significant at the 1 level models 3 and 4 turning to whether effects were different between treatments we found that the ahc narrative elicited higher mental and emotional involvement than the ac narrative chi2  353 p value  006 and chi2  1050 p value  000 respectively the ahc narrative also elicited higher mental and emotional involvement than the ahlc narrative chi2  633 p value  001 and chi2  340 p value  007 respectively in terms of covariates those with stronger past pro-conservation beliefs and behaviours reported feeling more engaged significant at the 1 level finally unsurprisingly subjects reported more familiarity with all the treatment narratives relative to the control narrative about a scottish castle subjects reported less familiarity with the ahc narrative when compared to the ac narrative chi2  767 p value  001 and also marginally less familiarity than with the ahlc narrative chi2  270 p value  010 to ensure that we controlled for any imbalance across groups in observable characteristics we repeated the main analysis with the addition of covariates to find similar results ie the ahc narrative increased the likelihood of donating 10 and over significant at the 10 level as well as support for conservation policies significant at the 1 level especially meat taxes significant at the 5 level and a wildlife trade ban significant at 1 level fig 2 and tables 6 and 8 in appendix these results were also similar when using ordinary least squares regressions instead of logistic and ordered logit models for outcome of donations  10 and policy support variables respectively to check that the subjects read the narratives we asked if they remembered the source of the article ie the bbc we also asked questions regarding the narrative content namely whether the article discussed the cause of covid-19 and if it mentioned other zoonotic diseases like the swine flu reassuringly 84 of subjects remembered the content and source of the narrative removing from the sample those who did not remember reducing the sample size to 908 does not significantly alter the results the regression analysis on the policy support outcomes and the likelihood of donating 10 and over showed the same results table 10 in the appendix we also checked if our results were driven by prior attitudes and choices towards the bbc around 876 of the subjects used the bbc to obtain news online and this share was evenly distributed across treatment groups chi2  101 p value  080 only 97 reported not trusting the bbc and again this proportion was spread evenly across groups chi2  309 p value  080 as before the results on policy support are qualitatively similar after omitting these subjects table 11 in the appendix in addition we checked if the positive effect of the ahc narrative on support for stricter regulation meat taxes wildlife trade bans and aggregate conservation policies ie outcome averaging all three policies and the likelihood of donation  10 when compared to the control group was replicated after adjusting for hypothesis testing with multiple outcomes following list et al 2019 the differences in means between the ahc and control group remained significant at the 10 level for the donation  10 dummy and at the 1 level for the commercial wildlife trade ban and the overall conservation policy variables the adjusted p value fell to 10 from the 5 level for stricter regulation and meat taxes from the main regression results in table 3 when using list et al 2019s correction method see table 12 in the appendix overall this suggests that the effect on the aggregated policy support variable and commercial wildlife trade bans are the most robust we also explored whether there were differences between groups in the time people spent reading narratives the summary statistics are similar across the groups namely 75 s for the control group sd  516 65 s for the ac group sd  729 76 s for the ahc group sd  535 and 77 s for the ahlc group sd  99 for all groups the pooled average is 73 s sd  72 we ran an ols regression model to test whether the differences were significant see table 13 in appendix time spent was marginally lower by 10 s in the ac group significant at 10 results below wald tests showed that differences between the ac and ahc group were significantly different at the 5 level chi2  419 p value  004 differences between the ac and ahlc and ahc and ahlc were not significant in sum participants conformed with expectations by spending marginally less time on the shorter ac narrative when we checked why people chose not to donate the most commonly cited reason was i need to save money for myself and for my family 377 of those choosing not to donate followed by i already donate enough 139 and id rather keep the money 103 these reasons were evenly distributed across groups some 76 and 4 of the subjects around 26 out of 1080 people reported not liking or knowing the charities on the list this was spread evenly across groups as well despite our effort to offer people a wide choice of environmental charities upon examining the written comments we found that some subjects preferred to donate to health causes which may reflect the current preoccupations with health in the covid-19 context another concern was that subjects might have guessed the true objective of the experiment and in doing so might have changed their responses on the one hand social desirability bias predicts that subjects may increase their pro-conservation outcomes if they think that the causal information in the articles was designed for that purpose on the other hand if subjects perceive an intent to manipulate narrative-format communications can induce reactance and any effects may be reduced escalas 2007 it is not clear which of these effects dominate in this study we attempted to address this by using filler questions and framing the title of the survey experiment in a neutral way lastly while we do observe a higher share of people donating at or above the default of 10 in the ahc narrative otherwise we do not observe robust effects on donations or intentions to act in more pro-conservation ways one explanation for this may be that the narratives we tested were not strong enough for eg compared to videos or the exposure was not long enough eg repeated in many ways over a long period to have an effect on behaviour even if it affected policy preferences another possibility is that our sample size is not large enough to detect the true effects on donation and intentions which may be smaller it is also possible that effects are smaller at this point in time because of the broader covid-19 context which may have shifted peoples focus and inclination to take prosocial actions to improve health rather than environmental outcomes that said we believe this study is a first step in the right direction since we have a higher-powered experiment with a comparable active control group when compared to most existing research future work can examine the impact of such narratives on a larger and more representative sample to address some of the limitations of this study we examined the effects of three alternative narratives currently in circulation each proposing different causal explanations for covid-19 on pro-wildlife conservation outcomes the ac narrative points to origins amongst wild animals the ahc narrative includes the causal link with the human depletion of nature and the ahlc narrative adds the possibility of blame on a biosecurity lab we found that the ahc narrative influenced peoples willingness to support conservation policies especially commercial wildlife trade bans this is in line with both the outrage effect kahneman et al 1993 bulte et al 2005 shreedhar and mourato 2019 and the predicted impact of responsibilizing narratives bnabou et al 2018 we found that the ahc narrative increased the feeling that firms and governments were responsible but had no significant effect on personal responsibility which is only partially in line with the responsibility effect walker et al 1999 one possible explanation is that people may not feel the burden of personal responsibility when they are not solely responsible for an outcome and there are multiple are other parties who are also responsible cryder and loewenstein 2012 this may give them some more moral wiggle room dana et al 2007 but not necessarily dampen their outrage at others they perceive are guilty the increased feeling that firms and governments are responsible may explain why subjects supported policies that ostensibly affected these other parties eg bans but the findings also suggest that the effect of narrative exposure is fragile either removing information about the human cause as in the ac group or conversely adding a counter-narrative as in the ahlc group can attenuate these effects that ac is less effective than ahc is compatible with the explanation that natural-causes elicit lower responses than human-caused problems brown et al 2005 bulte et al 2005 that ahlc is less effective than ahc is compatible with the prediction that absolving narratives dampen prosocial behaviour bnabou et al 2018 it also supports findings that even brief exposure to climate conspiracy theories can dampen pro-climate actions greitemeyer 2013 van der linden 2015 moreover it aligns with literature suggesting that articles presenting duelling experts without any sense of how the weight of evidence is distributed generates greater climate scepticism and is a barrier to engagement corbett and durfee 2004 lorenzoni et al 2007 corner et al 2012 understanding the impact of narratives shared on online news and social media is crucial since this is where people increasingly get information about public health and environmental issues dahlstrom 2014 pearson et al 2016 it is also an important route to forming preferences over policy issues we found that the ahc narrative linking human destruction of nature to covid-19 increases support for wildlife conservation policies interestingly this narrative was rated as the least familiar by subjects although it is the story favoured by environmental policymakers the results from this experiment suggest that there is scope to use this narrative to grow public engagement with extinction this public support is key to craft a durable and legitimate long-term policy response to covid-19 which concurrently addresses anthropogenic mass wildlife extinction
  covid-19 and respiratory support devices marti pons-dena arnau valls jordi grifols ramon farr francico lasosa jose bruce rubin k   initially many hospitals were able to convert operating rooms and general wards into icus using anaesthetic ventilators transport ventilators and older ventilators coming from laboratories or teaching simulation areas non-invasive ventilators have also been used transiently as invasive ventilators in pressure-controlled modes however in some hospitals these resources were rapidly exhausted in spain the national government provides most of the healthcare resources and the regional authorities regulate their use catalonia is situated in the north east corner of the country with barcelona as its capital the local government undertook several key initiatives as listed in table 1 table 2
 in spain as in other countries most general hospitals redeployed clinicians including paediatricians trainees and nurses to care for adults with respiratory failure due to covid-19 each of these healthcare professionals was incorporated into an adult care team to work under an adult intensivists supervision as a childrens hospital hospital sant joan de du received paediatric patients from general hospitals which transformed all their paediatric wards including picus to treat adult covid patients during the worst period of the outbreak in barcelona our picu adapted one room ten-bed picu area for several weeks at the epidemic peak 16 adult covid-19 patients were admitted although some patients were transferred from the emergency department of a general hospital most were transferred from adult icus when beds were needed for new urgent admissions it was challenging for the team to continuously update protocols of care to manage adults with underlying chronic disorders rarely seen in paediatrics such as essential hypertension copd and morbid obesity there are significant logistical challenges to providing respiratory support devices beyond simple oxygen flow when centres run out of supplies or do not have these devices at all such as in low resource settings at the peak of the covid-19 crisis it was difficult to import medical equipment and supplies because most countries prohibited their medical industry from selling outside their own countries even helmet interfaces the safest option according to experts 1 could not be imported because of government restrictions the authors were involved in supporting the hospitals innovation department engineers in developing a cpap device with a peep valve and a venturi connector fitted to a facial snorkel interface as previously used by italian doctors 2 this device called ecpap was recently approved by the government agency that certifies medical products agencia espaola del medicamento y productos sanitarios aemps to conduct clinical safety studies the initial purpose in developing this system was to offer an alternative interface to adult full-face or oro-nasal masks if these were not available face masks can reduce droplet dispersion and consequently decrease the risk of infection to healthcare workers 1 recently a team from our university developed a low-cost bilevel turbine-based ventilator for non-invasive ventilation niv support which was published as an open access article to allow all interested to see the technical description 3 this ventilator compared favourably against a commercial device in a pilot study of healthy subjects instrumented to mimic respiratory diseases remarkably it has been shown that cpap and niv allowed many patients to avoid intubation by using the algorithm developed in italy which included a short trial on cpap 4 in the most severe cases requiring invasive ventilation the simplest way to proceed could be the use of a bag resuscitator however the use of bag resuscitators for hand ventilation showed significant variability in the tidal volume provided 5 a randomized controlled trial comparing transport ventilators to hand bag ventilation showed that transport ventilators were significantly better in achieving the volume target 6 thus hand bag ventilation should not be used except for short periods of ventilation accordingly enthusiastic teams of engineers worldwide responded to the challenge to build devices that could provide respiratory support to covid-19 patients a variety of automated bag devices called by fda emergency use resuscitator systems eurs were developed as a result in spain aemps facilitated a procedure to permit the use of alternatives devices without the conformity european ce mark for compassionate clinical studies in covid-19 patients the authors had the chance to evaluate the performance of several emergency ventilators and a split device using an acute respiratory distress syndrome ards animal model the split ventilation prototype although capable to regulate and monitor the tidal volumes of the two different animals could not proportionate different levels of peep and maintain both animals stability when changing one of the animals compliance even though some of these devices may become available there is no guarantee that they will provide optimal ventilation especially for invasive ventilation the need for an appropriate environment with a trained staff is crucial to good outcomes indeed clinical experience in bangladesh having an 80 mortality in pneumonia patients mechanically ventilated in the picu prompted a rct 7 which showed superior results using the simplicity and safety of bubble cpap a device that can be built locally at low cost 8 most teams of engineers who did not have biomedical backgrounds concentrated on developing simple respiratory devices based on resuscitation bags requiring positive end-expiratory pressure peep valves companies with medical device experience or academic centres developed respiratory devices fulfilling most requirements for the device to be properly called a ventilator mechanical ventilator milano mvm is an example of the value of international collaboration between university centres and companies from italy canada and the usa 9 it is important to stress that new devices should initially be evaluated in a physiology laboratory using a lung simulator in our case most were evaluated at the school of medicine of the university of barcelona where the bi-level device previously mentioned was developed with minimal monitoring available in most of the eurs it is important to ensure that the delivered tidal volume is accurate for diverse clinical conditions according to the spanish regulatory body aemps ventilator prototypes must then be tested in a porcine model ideally suffering from ards in collaboration with the comparative medicine and bioimage centre of catalonia cmcib belonging to the research institute germans trias i pujol igtp a covid-19 ards scenario was developed in a pig model to test different devices animal numbers and procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the institution and the competent authorities protocol  10945an ards model was created with bronchoalveolar lavage and high tidal volume ventilation 10 until a pao2fio2 ratio between 150-250 was achieved with obesity being a common comorbidity in severe cases of covid-19 we further tested the ventilator by adding a 10 kg weight on the abdomen of the supine animal to simulate the mechanical effects of obesity advanced simulation with an animal model permits identification of possible pitfalls not apparent in the physiology laboratory for example evaluating an eurs with an external peep valve we found that condensed humidity induced by respiration affected the behaviour of the peep valve a phenomenon that could compromise patient oxygenation moreover inappropriate settings can generate rebreathing or auto peep which is a problem that can be missed in the laboratory but is easily identified by blood gas measurements in the animal during the in vivo testing procedure importantly each new emergency device will also require its own troubleshooting checklist which are likely different from those used for conventional ventilators available in hospitals therefore it is crucial to have a clinicians guidance based on the problems observed in the laboratory and in the simulation with animals no matter how acute the anxiety generated by the lack of ventilators is connecting a patient to an insufficiently tested device may lead to morbidity which could be worse than not using the device at all additionally a certification laboratory should assess safety issues and electromagnetic compatibility similar to those required to get the ce label fortunately even at the peak of the epidemic the newly developed ventilators were not required for clinical use hence checking their clinical performance in spain was not possible as there was no ethical reason to justify this we do have a unique opportunity to learn whether some of these relatively inexpensive and simpler covid-19 inspired devices could play a role in low-middle income countries where mechanical ventilators are in short supply or simply unavailable as mentioned before ventilator support is not only a matter of having devices available in formula-1 racing it is possible to finish a race with only one car and driver nevertheless to compete for the world championship requires having a seasoned driver replacement cars and a support team trained with engineers mechanics for maintenance and the availability of spare parts for repairs providing effective mechanical ventilation therapy also requires a multi-disciplinary well-trained team including health care staff and technical support people able to service the equipment it is time to offer more than oxygen from the concentrator or low-cost devices to improve the outcome of respiratory failure in developing countries open source technology publication 11 co-creation design approaches involving local partners 8 and training modules for on-site healthcare workers technicians and engineers are needed to make a difference which with sufficient commitment globally could finally bring about long-term improvements 
reallocation of resources is needed to supply essential medical equipment during an epidemic outbreakthe development and use of emergency devices for respiratory support is a complex interaction between healthcare providers patients and the respiratory support devicesit is essential to implement appropriate procedures to rapidly evaluate new medical devices including the testing and training using animal models that replicate human disease
 
in low-middle income countries due to the scarcity of cpap devices or ventilators conducting clinical studies with novel covid-19 emergency devices could contribute to saving livesto reassess the management of respiratory failure with affordable and straightforward devices to provide both non-invasive and invasive support
 to evaluate the most effective and efficient ways to train healthcare providers from diverse settings to understand and correctly use novel devices 
10  novel coronavirus disease covid-19 a pandemic epidemiology pathogenesis and potential therapeutics saima hamid mohammad mir yaseen gulab rohela khan   coronavirus is one of the major pathogens which targets primarily the human respiratory system earlier coronaviral outbreaks covs include middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov which have significantly caused great threat to human beings in december 2019 a number of patients were admitted to hospitals with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia these patients were found to have epidemiological links with wet animal and seafood wholesale market in wuhan hubei province china 12 early studies predicted the onset of a possible coronavirus outbreak the who on 11th february 2020 estimated the reproduction number for covid-19 significantly largely ranging between 224 to 358 3 in december 2019 the first cases for covid-19 infections were reported 4 from 18th december 2029 to 29th december 2019 5 patients having acute respiratory distress syndrome were hospitalized among which one patient died 5 upto 2 january 2020 41 patients were identified to possess laboratory confirmed covid-19 infection almost half of these patients had underlying diseases particularly cardiovascular diseases hypertension and diabetes 6 it was believed that these patients were infected in hospital possibly due to nosocomial infection thus it was concluded covid-19 is not a super-hot spreading virus spread to many others from one patient but it most likely spread as many patients get infected by unknown mechanisms at different locations in the hospital furthermore only those patients were tested that were clinically sick and probably there were several more patients who were infected as of january 22 2020 a total of 571 covid-19 infection cases were reported in 25 provinces of china 7 upto 22 january 2020 china national health commission reported the details of first 17 deaths on 25th january 2020 a total of 1975 covid-19 infection cases were confirmed along with 56 deaths in mainland china 8 another report of 24th january 2020 estimated 5502 covid-19 infections in china 910 the first covid-19 infection case was reported on 10th january 2020 which was led by identification description clinical diagnosis and management of the case it included initial mild symptoms of the patient which leaded to pneumonia on 9th day of illness 11 moreover on 30 january 2020 first case of covid-19 human-to-human transmission was reported in us httpswwwcdcgovmediareleases2020p0130 until 5th april 2020 total number of covid-19 infected cases in usa mounted to 311635 surpassing the infected cases of italy 124632 and china 81669 out of these 288356 cases are active and 8454 are death cases while as rest ie 14825 cases have recovered httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus a study published in nature reported that chinese health authorities concluded that 31161 people had contracted the infection in china as of 7 february 2019 and that more than 630 people had died of the infection httpwwwnaturcomarticlesd41586-020-00154 on 5th april 2020 total number of infected cases in italy has reached to 124632 out of which 20996 have recovered and 88274 cases are active out of these 15362 are death cases httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus currently total number of corona virus cases in india reported so far 3374 so far there are 77 covid-19 deaths cases reported in india at the time of preparation of this manuscript ie 5th april 2020 the who has reported 1056159 covid-19 confirmed cases throughout the world including 57206 confirmed death cases so far covid-19 has spread to 208 countries around the globe httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019 the number of confirmed covid-19 cases per million people around the globe as on 4th april 2020 is represented in fig 1 the covid-19 infection symptoms starts to appear after an incubation period of 5-6 days 12 wang et al 8 reported that time period between onset of covid-19 symptoms to death ranges between 6-41 days with a 14-day median this time period depends on patients immune system and age of the patient it is found shorter among patients of more than 70 years of age relative to those below 70 years patients 8 the common symptoms at the onset of infection are fatigue cough and fever while as other symptoms include lymphopenia haemoptysis headache sputum production and diarrhea 13 the chest ct scan reveals pneumonia nevertheless there are some other clinical features like acute cardiac injury acute respiratory distress syndrome rnaaemia and incidence of grand-glass opacities that leads to death 6 in certain cases several peripheral ground-glass opacities have been identified in subpleural regions of both lungs which likely induce both localized and systemic immune response leading to increased inflammation 14 unfortunately interferon inhalation therapy showed no therapeutic benefit but instead aggravated the disorder by worsening pulmonary opacity 14 it is pertinent to mention here that symptoms between earlier betacoronavirus infections and covid-19 such as bilateral ground-glass opacity on ct scans dry cough dyspnea and fever are similar 6 more importantly covid-19 showed unique clinical features like targeting the lower airway as is evident by symptoms like sore throat rhinorrhoea and sneezing 1516 additionally on the basis of chest radiographs results some cases were found to possess infiltrate in the upper lobe of the lung associated with increasing dyspnea with hypoxemia 17 although covid-19-infected patients reported gastrointestinal gi symptoms like diarrhoea a small percentage of sars-cov or mers-cov patients experienced similar gi distress hence analyzing faecal and urine samples is necessary to eliminate a possible alternative route of transmission specifically by health care staff patients etc 1516 therefore development of methods for identifying the different modes of transmission such as feacal and urine samples is urgently needed to establish strategies for inhibiting andor reducing transmission and developing therapeutics to manage the disease the first four cases of an acute respiratory syndrome of unknown etiology were identified among people linked to a local seafood market wet market in wuhan city china on 29 december 2019 12 the research is under progress to learn more about covid-19-related transmissibility frequency and other features 18 it has been observed that early detected cases had some kind of history of interaction with the seafood market 19 eventually human-to-human transmission by close contact was found as secondary cause of covid-19 infection there has been rise in the frequency of infected individuals with no history of wildlife exposure or visiting wuhan and several cases of infection have been identified among medical professionals as well 20 it has become apparent that covid-19 infection occurs upon exposure to virus and both normal and immunosuppressed population seem susceptible most of adult patients were between 35 -55 years of age with fewer cases found among children and infants 1921 a research on the dynamics of early transmission of the virus reported that the median age of patients was 59 years ranging from 15 - 89 years with the majority being males 59 12 people with low immune function particularly old aged people and those with renal and hepatic dysfunction were considered to be high risk group 12 covid-19 was found to have higher rates of transmissibility and pandemic risk than sars-cov as covid-19s effective reproductive number r is 29 which is much higher than recorded effective reproductive number r of sars 177 different covid-19 studies have estimated the basic reproduction r0 ranges between 26 to 471 the covid-19 average incubation duration was estimated to be 48  26 ranging from 2-11 days 22 the chinese health authorities have recently reported average incubation of 7 days ranging from 2- 14 days the findings of epidemiological studies based on important indicators are summarized on the table 1 coronaviruses are single-stranded zoonotic rna viruses that cause symptoms ranging from common cold to more extreme respiratory enteric hepatic and neurological symptoms 2324 besides sars-cov-2 there are six other coronaviruses reported in humans these are hcov-oc43 hcov-229e sars-cov hcov-hku1 mers-cov and hcovnl63 2526 over the last two decades coronavirus has caused two major pandemics sars 27 and mers 28 in order to find out the source of the covid-19 outbreak cdc researchers of china collected 585 environmental samples from huanan seafood market in wuhan hubei province they found 33 samples were sars-cov-2 suggested that it came from wild animals sold on the market 29 researchers also used the lung fluid blood and throat swab samples from 15 patients for laboratory research such laboratory studies revealed that virus-specific nucleic acid sequences in the sample vary from those of known human coronavirus species the laboratory findings also showed sars cov-2 is identical to some of the beta  coronaviruses genera found in bats which is located in the sarssars-like cov groups 30 for the conduction of next-generation sequencing from cultured isolates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid nine inpatients were enrolled by researchers in wuhan with viral pneumonia and without any common respiratory pathogens the results indicated sars-cov-2 was more distinct from mers-cov with approximately 50 sequence identity and sars-cov with approximately 79 sequence identity than from two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzxc21 with 872 sequence identity and bat-sl-covzc45 with 879 sequence identity 31 the studies also showed that covid-19 s-protein strongly interacted with human ace2 molecules in spite of dissimilarity of its sequence with that of sars-cov 3233 the case fatality rate cfr of any disease is not fixed it varies with location and with time it is reported that cfr of covid-19 varies widely between countries ranging from 02  in germany to 77  in italy it may not be accurate comparison of the true likelihood particularly like that of covid-19 since we are not aware weather the same criterion of testing is applied between the countries or many cases are symptomatic vs asymptomatic so for better decision making and to understand differences in cfr we need better data however if we are careful to acknowledge its limitations cfr can help us to understand pandemic better and what should be done to combat itthe countries having small number of confirmed cases till now are left as cfr at small sample size is not significant as we look towards the trajectory in case of iran on 24th of february 2020 it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths an implausible cfr of 100 as the number of cases increased into hundreds over time its cfr dropped to the level seen in other countries the cfr of ongoing covid-19 pandemic is represented in fig 2 it is anticipated that there is probable zoonotic origin of covid19 based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet animal market in wuhan city where live animals are routinely sold efforts were made to look for a host reservoir or intermediate carriers from which the infection could spread to humans 10 the two snake species were identified which were thought the possible covid-19 reservoirs however there is no clear cut evidence for the reservoirs of coronavirus other than mammals and birds till date the covid-19 genomic sequence analysis showed its 88  identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like coronaviruses suggesting that bats are the most likely link between covid-19 and humans 34 several studies have indicated that transmission from person to person is a possible way for covid-19 infection to spread as it was observed covid-19 infection occurred in many people who did not even visited wuhans wet animal market 13 transmission of disease from person to person occurs mainly through direct contact or by droplets released by an infected person through coughing or sneezing the fig 3 how quickly the disease has spread in each country since the 100th confirmed case a study was conducted on covid-19 infected women having third trimester and no evidence was analyze which can confirm that transmission can occur from mother to child nevertheless pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections so it remains uncertain if transmission can occur during vaginal delivery this study is important as pregnant womens are comparatively more vulnerable to respiratory infections and extreme pneumonia 34 the first step of covid-19 viral infection is the binding of the receptor expressed by host cells followed by fusion with the cell membrane the lung epithelial cells are the primary target of the virus it has been stated that human-to-human transmissions of sars-cov occurs through binding between cellular receptor known as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor and receptor-binding domain of virus spikes 34 it is important to mention here that receptor binding domain sequence of covid-19 is similar to that of sars-cov these results indicate that the most likely entry into the host cells is through the ace2 receptor 35 the covid-19 has been classified as  cov of group 2b by the world health organization 36 the covid-19 genome sequencing from nine patients showed 9998 sequence identity 37 another study in five patients showed 998999 nucleotide identity and sequencing studies revealed the presence of a new beta-cov strain 5 the covid19 genetic sequence showed more than 50  identity to mers-cov and 80 to sars-cov 37 and both mers-cov and sars-cov originate in bats 38 covid-19 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans and has been categorized under the subfamily orthocoronavirinae it was a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus 23 on the basis phylogenetic reports and genetic sequence studies covid-19 varies significantly from sars-cov and can thus be regarded as a new betacoronavirus that infects humans the covid-19 most likely developed from bat origin coronaviruses the another evidence which supports that covid-19 is of bat origin is the high of homology ace2 receptor from a diversity of animal species there by implicating these animal species are possible intermediate hosts or animal models for covid-19 infections 35 additionally these viruses have single intact open reading frame on gene 8 which is another sign of bat-origin covs nevertheless the amino acid sequence of receptor-binding domain resembles with that of sars-cov indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor 5 the complete clinical manifestation is not yet clear as the symptoms recorded so far vary from mild to extreme with some cases even leading to death 18 the most frequently reported symptoms include cough-producing phlegm runny nose myalgia fever pneumonia and complicated dyspnea while the less widely documented symptoms include headache vomiting and hemoptysis 618 the patients with mild symptoms usually recover within a week while as severe cases have been reported to suffer from progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage which can lead to death as well 18 usually elderly patients and middle aged patients with some pre-existing diseases coronary heart disease parkinsons disease diabetes hypertension tumor surgery and cirrhosis were seen to more prone to death 38 the case definition guidelines mentioned the following symptoms decrease in lymphocytes and white blood cells fever and new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography with no improvement in symptoms after 3 days of antibiotic treatment 38 in patients with suspected infection the following techniques for diagnosis have been suggested conducting real-time fluorescence rt-pcr to detect sars-cov-2 positive nucleic acid in sputum throat swabs and lower respiratory tract sample secretions 39 there is no vaccine currently available for covid-19 and neither there is specific antiviral treatment recommended so far the treatment is symptomatic and the patients with severe infection are given oxygen therapy in cases of respiratory failure mechanical ventilation is required whereas hemodynamic support is important for septic shock management the who on 28th january 2020 released a document summarizing who guidelines and clinical data obtained from the treatment of previous hcovs epidemics the document address steps for identification and sorting of patients with serious acute respiratory disease guidelines for laboratory diagnosis early supportive therapy and monitoring management of septic shock and respiratory failure and methods of treatment for pregnant patients amongst these recommendations we focus on approaches to tackle respiratory failure including safe mechanical ventilation and non-invasive ventilation niv or high-flow nasal oxygen hfno during intubation special precautions are required an professional operator who uses personal protective equipments ppe such as protective goggles disposable double socks disposable gloves ffp3 or n95 mask and disposable gown long sleeve raincoat can conduct the operation the rapid sequence intubation rsi should be performed if possible the preoxygenation 100 o2 should be performed for 5 minutes using the method of continuous positive airway pressure cpap heat and moisture exchanger hme must be located between the circuit of fan and mask or between the ventilation balloon and the mask in case of mechanical ventilation lower inspiratory pressures reaching a plateau pressure pplat  28 to 30 cm h2o and lower tidal volumes 4 to 6 mlkg predicted body weight pbw should be kept the positive end expiratory pressure peep should be kept as high as possible so as to maintain driving pressure pplat-peep as low as possible 14 cm h2o furthermore to prevent atelectasis and loss of peep disconnections from the ventilator must be avoided the paralytics is not recommended until pao2fio2  150 mm hg the use of conservative fluid management strategy and prone ventilation for 12 hours per day for patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome is strongly recommended with regard to high flow nasal oxygen hfno or non-invasive ventilation niv the panel of experts points out that these approaches performed by systems with good interface fitting do not cause widespread dispersion of exhaled air and their use can be considered at low risk of airborne transmission 40 in practical sense non-invasive ventilation can be used only in non severe forms of respiratory failure nevertheless if the patient does not improve or even worsen within a limited period of time 12 hours the mechanical ventilation must be preferred at first broad-spectrum antibiotics interferons- nebulization and anti-viral drugs were used to reduce the viral load 41 but only remdesivir has shown promising viral impact 42 remdesivir alone and in combination with chloroquine or -interferon significantly blocked the sars-cov-2 replication and patients were found to recover clinically 43 several other anti-virals drugs are currently being evaluated against infection moderate results were exhibited by favipiravir nitazoxanide ribavirin baricitinib penciclovir ritonavir and arbidol when tested against infection in vitro clinical isolates and in patients 44 many other formulations have also been tested against covid-19 infections in humans and mice such as combinations of antibiotic or antivral drugs with the traditional chinese medicines 45 the convalescent plasma therapy was also tested by doctors in shanghai china and in usa as well in which blood plasma was isolated from clinically treated covid-19 patients and injected it in the infected patients who showed positive results with rapid recovery 46 currently no vaccine is available against covid-19 infection however vaccines or strategies used to develop a vaccine against sars-cov can be effective the recombinant dna from the urbani strain of sars-cov ay278741 was administered to hamsters and mice which leaded to production of neutralizing antibodies and protection against sars-cov 4748 the dna was found to inactivate whole virus or live-vectored strain of sars-cov ay278741 and there by significantly reduced the viral infection in animal models 49 50 51 numerous other sars-cov strains are also used to develop inactivated or live-vectored vaccines that have effectively reduced the viral load in animal models these strains include bj01 ay278488 5253 tor2 ay274119 5455 fra ay310120 56 ns1 ay508724 57 zj01 ay297028 57 gz50 ay304495 58 utah ay714217 59 and gd01 ay278489 53 moreover there are few vaccines against sars-cov-2 in pipeline the chinese centre for disease control and prevention cdc is focusing on creating an inactivated vaccine for viruses 60 a sample mrna based vaccine prepared by stermirna therapeutics will be available soon 61 geovax and bravovax 62 is working for the formation of modified vaccina ankara mva based vaccine while as clover biopharmaceuticals are developing a recombinant 2019-ncov s protein subunit-trimer based vaccine 63 although research teams around the world are working to explore key characteristics pathogenesis and combating the disease appropriate attention should be drawn on therapeutic options and cross-resistance of other vaccines for instance vaccines for other diseases like for measles and rubella can create cross-resistance for sars-cov-2 this concept of cross resistance is based on the findings that children are found less vulnerable to infection as compared to elder population and children predominantly vaccinated for measles strategies for prevention and control are reported at three levels national level case-related population level and general population level in case of national level the chinas national health commission issued the no1 announcement which officially included covid-19 in the management of legally infectious diseases in class b and allowed for class a infectious disease preventive and control measures to be implemented 64 under this policy medical institutes can adopt observation protocols and isolation treatment to prevent and control the spread of the covid-19 in china the national health commission issued national guidelines on the prevention and control of covid-19 infection on 22 january 2020 for medical institutes to prevent nosocomial infection 65 on 28 january 2020 during the chinese spring festival the national health commission released guidelines for rapid prevention and control measures to effectively contain the spread of the disease through a major isolation and great disinfection program 66 national-level policies with targeted measures for elderly population published on 31 january 2020 and for rural areas released on 28 january 2020 were also released 67 several public health interventions have been implemented that can avoid or delay the covid-19 transmission these include case isolation identification and surveillance of contacts environmental disinfection and the use of personal protective equipments 68 as of now no specific antiviral therapy has been confirmed covid-19 infection with regard to patients diagnosed with covid-19 it was recommended that appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care be applied 6 the studies have also reported the prevention of psychological health issues and nosocomial infection associated with covid a series of measures have been suggested to minimize nosocomial infection including awareness training for prevention and control isolation disinfection protection at different levels in infection areas and protection of reported cases 68 with respect to psychological health some suggested psychological interventions are set up for medical staff suspected cases and confirmed cases 69 since there is no vaccine preventing covid-19 at this moment the best prevention for general population is to avoid exposure to the virus 70 the airborne measures and other protections were discussed and suggested for protection the infection prevention and control measures that can minimize the risk of exposure include use of face masks covering coughs and sneezes with tissues that are then safely disposed of regular hand wash with soap or disinfection with hand sanitizer having 60 alcohol in it maintaining an appropriate distance as much as possible avoidance of contact with infected people and refraining from touching nose mouth and eyes with unwashed hands 18 the who also released detailed recommendations on the use of face masks within the population during home care and in covid-19 health care settings 71 health care staff are advised to use particulate respirators such as those licensed n95 or ffp2 while conducting aerosol-generating procedures and to use surgical masks when providing any treatment for suspected or confirmed cases as per these guidelines an individual without respiratory symptoms when in public is not required to wear medical mask to avoid any increase in risk of transmission proper use and disposal of masks is important 71 in addition to papers published in scientific journals the china cdc has provided guidelines to raise awareness among the general public about the prevention and control of covid-19 the guidelines main messages include causes how to choose and wear face masks proper hand washing practices preventive measures at different locations eg at home on public transportation and in public space methods of disinfection and home medical monitoring 72 in addition to scientific knowledge on how to treat the outbreak of covid-19 the guidelines also recommends ways of reducing fear among the general population 72 animal models play a crucial role in uncovering the mechanisms of viral pathogenicity from the entrance to transmission and in the scheming of therapeutic strategies previously various animal models were used for examining replication of sars-cov which showed the symptoms of severe infection 73 in case mers-cov no pathogenesis was observed in small animals as against seen in case of sars-cov mice was found not susceptible to mers-coronavirus infection because of noncompatibility of the dpp4 receptor 74 as the entire genome of covid-19 is more than 80 similar previous human sars-like bat cov hence animal models previously used for sars-cov may be useful to study the pathogenicity of covid-19 novel coronaviruses and sars both recognize human ace2 cell receptor conclusively talen or crispr-mediated genetically modified hamsters or other small animals may be used to test the pathogenicity of novel coronaviruses it was observed that sars-cov having a mutation for spike glycoprotein replicate and cause severe disease in rats f344 75 thus spike glycoprotein targeting therapeutics is a suitable option against coronaviruses in recent studies to formulate some therapeutic strategy against covid-19 clinical isolates and mice models were used 45 artificial intelligence prediction were also used in similar studies to investigate the inhibitory role of the drug against sars-cov-2 44 randomized clinical trials were also used in covid-19 patients 11 it is now essential for scientists worldwide to collaborate on the design of an effective model and to investigate the in vivo mechanisms associated with covid-19 pathogenesis combating the current outbreak requires rigorous steps to reduce the transmission of covid-19 infection from person to person special attention and efforts should be applied for protecting or reducing transmission in vulnerable populations including infants health care providers and the elderly for medical personnel health care professionals public health individuals and researchers involved in the 2019-ncov guidelines to follow are published 76 the early death cases in covid-19 outbreak occurred mainly in the elderly possibly due to a poor immune system that allows for more rapid progression of viral infection 12 the decontaminating regents should be provided by public services and facilities regularly the physical contact with contaminated things particularly urine and facecal samples should be considered in dealing with the virus as these can potentially serve as an alternative route of transmission 15 most of the countries around the world particularly us china india uae etc have implemented major control and prevention measures like implementing state wise or country wise lockdown and travel screenings so as to control virus spread the epidemiological changes occurring in covid-19 infection should be monitored carefully taking into account potential transmission routes and subclinical infections as well as the adaptation evolution possible intermediate animals and reservoir and spread of virus among humans a large number of issues still remain to be addressed some of which are who and how many were tested what percentage of these came out positive weather this rate remains constant or it varies what proposition of people tested positive for covid-19 but showed clinical symptoms so far only few paediatric cases were reported it is because real lack of susceptibility or due to inadequate testing the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest   jasper fuk-woo  chan shuofeng yuan anna zhang jinxia vincent kwok-man  poon chris  chung-sing chan andrew chak-yiu  lee zhimeng fan can li ronghui liang jianli cao

a syrian hamster model surgical mask partition significantly reduced the transmission of sars-cov-2 from challenged index hamsters to the exposed nave hamsters via respiratory droplets andor airborne droplet nuclei a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 3 abstract background coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is believed to be mostly transmitted by medium-tolarge sized respiratory droplets although airborne transmission is theoretically possible in healthcare settings involving aerosol-generating procedures exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage however there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of covid-19 we used a well-established golden syrian hamster sars-cov-2 model we placed sars-cov-2-challenged index hamsters and nave hamsters into closed system units each comprising two different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator the effect of a surgical mask partition placed in between the cages was investigated besides clinical scoring hamster specimens were tested for viral load histopathology and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression results non-contact transmission was found in 667 1015 of exposed nave hamsters surgical mask partition for challenged index or nave hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25 624 p0018 surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 167 212 p0019 of exposed nave hamsters unlike the severe covid-19 manifestations of challenged hamsters infected nave hamsters had lower clinical scores milder histopathological changes and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 4 conclusions sars-cov-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei in the hamster model such transmission could be reduced by surgical mask usage especially when masks were worn by infected individuals  m a n u s c r i p t 5 the source of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic was traced to civets in live animal markets and ultimately to chinese horseshoe bats in the wild 1 2 3 the epidemiological significance of the large number of bat sars-related coronaviruses subsequently found in horseshoe and other bat species was not fully appreciated for the last 17 years 4 5 in late 2019 infection due to a novel betacoronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which is phylogenetically close to bat sars-related coronaviruses was reported in patients with epidemiological link to a market with wild mammal trade in wuhan china 6 7 8  disease 2019 covid-19 was initially recognized as an acute febrile pneumonia with lymphopenia and multifocal peripheral ground glass changes on thoracic computerized tomography 9 -11 covid-19 is often self-limiting but may have severe manifestations such as silent asymptomatic until sudden collapse hypoxia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation with diffuse microvascular thrombosis deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism andor multiorgan failure 9 10 12 13 gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea neurological manifestations such as meningoencephalitis and guillain-barr syndrome and kawasaki syndrome-like multi-systemic inflammatory disorder in children have also been reported 14 15 16 however most symptomatic patients have mild to moderate respiratory illness with manifestations such as rhinorrhea sore throat cough conjunctivitis anosmia and ageusia 17 18 furthermore a high proportion of patients with covid-19 have subclinical infections which is believed to enable efficient person-to-person transmission in both community and hospital settings this renders symptom screening at borders ineffective entails extensive testing and isolation of infected individuals require labor-intensive contact tracing measures and necessitates social distancing or lockdowns as a result the ongoing a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 6 pandemic has already affected more than 4 million patients with over 280000 deaths in just 5 months 19 although covid-19 is believed to be transmitted by respiratory droplet and direct or indirect contact no clear experimental evidence for this has been reported based on in silico estimates of the binding affinity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 of common laboratory mammals and the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of sars-cov-2 we recently established a golden syrian hamster model for covid-19 20 sars-cov-2-infected hamsters developed clinical signs of rapid breathing weight loss and histopathological changes of ards 20 using this animal model we showed that sars-cov-2-challenged index hamsters consistently infected co-housed nave hamsters confirming virus transmission by direct or indirect contact 20 however the controversies of whether there is transmission by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei and whether the wearing of surgical mask by the virus shedder or by the susceptible individual is useful for the prevention of transmission are still unsettled in this study using our hamster model for covid-19 we confirmed non-contact transmission of sars-cov-2 which could potentially be prevented by surgical mask worn by the infected or by the susceptible host sars-cov-2 was isolated from the nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen of a laboratoryconfirmed covid-19 patient in hong kong 21 the plaque purified viral isolate was amplified by one additional passage in veroe6 cells to make working stocks of the virus as described previously 21 all experiments involving live sars-cov-2 followed the approved standard operating procedures of the biosafety level bsl-3 facility of the university of hong kong hku 22 23 a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 7 approval was obtained from the hku committee on the use of live animals in teaching and research male and female syrian hamsters aged 6-10 weeks old were obtained from the chinese university of hong kong laboratory animal service centre through the hku laboratory animal unit the animals were kept in bsl-2 housing and given access to standard pellet feed and water ad libitum until virus challenge in our bsl-3 animal facility the animal rooms were kept at 25c and 50 humidity to study the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 among hamsters through non-contact transmission we housed sars-cov-2-challenged index hamsters and nave hamsters together in closed systems the closed systems were kept in isolators tecniplast spa varese italy to prevent leakage of contaminated air to the external environment  figure 1a   three sets of experiments were conducted using our isolator non-contact transmission model in the first experiment no mask partition was placed between the two cages in each system to investigate whether non-contact transmission occurred among the hamsters figure 2  a total of five systems housing 20 hamsters were included in the first experiment in the second experiment to simulate the situation when surgical masks are worn by a sars-cov-2infected person a fully knitted partition layer using surgical mask was placed on the polyvinyl chloride air porous partition between the cages with the outer fluid-repellent layer the blue side facing the exposed-nave hamsters to prevent emitted respiratory droplets containing sars-cov-2 from the challenged index hamster from reaching exposed nave hamsters  figure 3a  a total of four systems housing 16 hamsters were included in the second experiment in the third experiment to simulate the situation when close contacts of a sars-cov-2-infected person wear surgical masks the surgical mask partition with the outer fluid-repellent layer the blue side facing the challenged index hamsters was placed on the polyvinyl chloride air porous partition between the cages to prevent droplets containing sars-cov-2 emitted by the challenged index hamster from reaching the exposed nave hamsters  figure 3b  a total of four systems housing 16 hamsters were included in the third experiment the air velocities from the challenged index hamsters cage to the expose nave hamsters cage in the three experiments were shown in table 1  at day 0 a challenge dose of 100l of dulbeccos modified eagle medium dmem containing 10 5 plaque-forming units of sars-cov-2 was intranasally inoculated to the index hamster in each system under intraperitoneal ketamine 200mgkg and xylazine 10mgkg anaesthesia as we described previously 20 twenty-four hours later three nave hamsters were transferred to the cage adjacent and exposed to the cage housing the virus-challenged index hamster per system the animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease two of a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 9 the three exposed nave hamsters in each system were sacrificed at 5 days post-inoculation dpi 4 days after exposure the challenged index animal and remaining exposed nave animal in each system were then sacrificed at 7dpi the animals organ tissues at necropsy were separated into two parts one immediately fixed in 10 pbs-buffered formalin for histopathological analysis and the other immediately frozen at -80c until use for viral load studies as we described previously 20 24 25 serum samples were used for neutralizing antibody detection as we described previously 20 to compare the histopathological changes at 5dpi an additional control sars-cov-2-challenged hamster was sacrificed at 5dpi all data were analysed with graphpad prism software graphpad softwareinc fishers exact test was used to compare the rate of infection between the different groups of hamsters with or without surgical mask partition students t-test was used to determine significant differences in clinical scores and virus loads between different groups 20 p005 was considered statistically significant consistent with our previous findings all 13 n5 4 and 4 for experiments 1 2 and 3 respectively sars-cov-2-challenged index hamsters developed clinical signs of lethargy ruffled furs hunched back posture and rapid breathing starting at 2dpi and had virological and histological evidence of infection 20 in the first experiment six of the ten 60 exposed nave hamsters sacrificed at 5dpi 4 days after exposure also developed similar clinical signs the overall mean clinical score of the 10 exposed nave hamsters was 18001687  table 2  the 6 nave hamsters which developed clinical signs were confirmed to be infected with a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 10 sars-cov-2 as evidenced by positive rt-pcr results  table 3  the viral loads ranged from around 01 to 1000 genome copies-actin nasal turbinate 01 to 100 genome copies-actin trachea and 002 to 10 genome copies-actin lung  figure 4a  at 7 dpi 6 days after exposure the remaining 5 nave hamsters had a mean clinical score of 24001517 four of the five 800 exposed nave hamsters were found to be infected with viral loads of around 100 to 1000 genome copies-actin nasal turbinate 10 to 100 genome copies-actin trachea and 01 to 100 genome copies-actin lung  figure 4b  none of the index and nave hamsters died having demonstrated that non-contact transmission of sars-cov-2 occurred among the hamsters in our model we next investigated the effectiveness of surgical mask partition to reduce the risk of non-contact transmission surgical mask partition between cages was installed with the external fluid-repelling surface facing the exposed nave hamsters or the challenged index hamsters to mimic the situation of the mask being worn by index hamsters or by exposed nave contact hamsters respectively in the second experiment in which the external surface of the mask was facing the nave hamsters at 5 dpi 4 days after exposure two of the three nave hamsters in each system n8 were sacrificed only 1 out of 8 125 nave hamsters was sars-cov-2 rt-pcr-positive table 3  the viral loads of this hamster were about 1 nasal turbinate 100 trachea and 10 lung genome copies-actin  figure 4a  at 7 dpi the remaining exposed nave hamster n4 and the sars-cov-2-challenged index hamster n4 in each system were also sacrificed only one of the four 250 remaining nave hamsters were rt-pcrpositive with viral loads of around 05 lung to 100 nasal turbinate genome copies-actin a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 11  figure 4b  this transmission rate 167 was significantly p0019 lower than that of the exposed nave hamsters without surgical mask partition 667 in the third experiment the external surface of the mask was facing the challenged index hamsters at 5 dpi 4 days after exposure two of the three nave hamsters in each system n8 were sacrificed three out of 8 375 exposed nave hamsters developed clinical signs and were sars-cov-2 rt-pcr positive  table 3  the viral loads ranged from around 1 to 10 genome copies-actin nasal turbinate 001 to 100 trachea genome copies-actin and 1 to 1000 genome copies-actin lung  figure 4a  at 7 dpi the remaining exposed nave hamster n4 and the challenged index hamster n4 in each system were also sacrificed one of the four 250 remaining nave hamsters were rt-pcr positive with viral loads of around 1 lung to 100 nasal turbinate genome copies-actin  figure 4b  this transmission rate 333 was also lower than that of the exposed nave hamsters without surgical mask partition 667 although not reaching statistical significance p0128 at 7 dpi 6 days after exposure of the nave hamsters to the challenged index hamsters all challenged index hamsters n13 exhibited high titers of serum neutralizing antibodies ranging from 1320 to 1640 which is consistent with our previous observation  figure 5  interestingly three of the five exposed 60 nave hamsters without surgical mask partition sacrificed at 7 dpi also developed serum neutralizing antibody titers of 1160 to 1640 which suggested that these three rt-pcr-positive infected naive hamsters likely acquired the virus very early after exposure to the challenged index hamsters as it required 5 to 7 days before serum neutralizing antibodies were detectable in this animal model in contrast none of the 8 a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 12 exposed nave hamsters with surgical mask partition facing either side sacrificed at 7 dpi including the two rt-pcr-positive hamsters developed detectable serum neutralizing antibody all 120 these results suggested that even though these two exposed nave hamsters were infected they likely acquired the virus much later than the infected nave hamsters without protection by surgical mask partition the representative histological and immunofluorescent staining findings of the infected nave hamsters are shown in figure 6  at 5dpi 4 days after exposure the histopathological changes of the infected nave hamsters in experiments 1 2 and 3 were generally milder than those of the challenged control hamster  figure 6a the use of surgical mask partition to protect nave hamsters reduced the transmission rate to 333 although this did not reach statistical significance likely because of the relatively small number of animals p0128 as expected the histopathological changes and the amount of respiratory tract viral n antigen expression of these protected nave hamsters were also significantly lower than those of the challenged index hamsters the finding of sars-cov-2 being transmitted by the non-contact route of respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei is not unexpected as this is the case for other respiratory viruses for seasonal influenza viruses similar transmission has been demonstrated with syrian hamster ferret and guinea pig models 26 27 28 seasonal influenza viruses could be isolated by plaque assay from nave hamsters by day 4 post-exposure whereas sars-cov-2 could be detected by rt-pcr in our infected nave hamsters as early as day 4 postexposure 26 however in the case of nipah virus which is more of a neurotropic than were amongst the lowest in the world at the timing of writing 33 although we could not differentiate whether transmission occurred by respiratory droplets or airborne aerosols in this study both types of non-contact transmission might have happened because surgical masks is most efficient in filtering out large respiratory droplets of more than 10m but not the airborne aerosol particles of less than 5m therefore noncontact transmission still occurred in our hamster model despite a reduction of transmission when the nave hamsters were protected by mask partitioning alternatively the filtration efficiency of the masks might have declined over time during the study period interestingly a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 15 transmission to the exposed nave hamsters was significantly reduced when surgical mask partition was placed to prevent emission from the challenged index hamsters this was not completely unexpected because the masking of infectious patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis on a hospital ward in south africa reduced airborne transmission by 56 from these patients to guinea pigs which were breathing the ward air compared with the percentage of transmission to guinea pigs during periods when masks were not worn 34 this report clearly showed that surgical masks could be partially effective in reducing the however the presence of a significant proportion of asymptomatically infected patients who were not aware of the need of testing wearing mask or isolation has markedly impaired these control measures in the case of the princess diamond cruise outbreak 6 out of 9 returnees were found to be asymptomatically infected during the 14 days of quarantine and serial virological monitoring after returning to hong kong 37 our findings on the use of surgical mask partition for protection against non-contact transmission in this hamster model supported the use of community-wide masking to reduce the amount of virus shedding from the asymptomatically infected patients and to protect susceptible individuals this should be a reasonable approach for the epidemic control of a densely populated city like hong kong without resorting to city lockdown and an important measure during the stepwise loosening of social distancing measures in the days ahead our study had limitations the speed of the unidirectional airflow could not be unified when the surgical mask partitions were installed but that would also apply when surgical masks were worn by different individuals in real life and this could indeed be a mechanism for protection during mask usage we could not determine the exact timing of acquisition of a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 17 sars-cov-2 by the exposed nave hamsters as we only started sampling them 4 days after exposure moreover we could not determine if contact transmission has occurred among exposed nave hamsters housed in the same cage this might have resulted in an underestimation of the protective efficacy of masks which would otherwise be even more significant further studies on the relative importance of large respiratory droplets and small airborne aerosols are warranted  hamsters to exposed nave hamsters without surgical mask partition between the cages experiment 1 sars-cov-2 was intranasally inoculated to the index hamsters n5 at day 0 twenty-four hours later three nave hamsters were transferred to the adjacent cage and exposed to the cage housing the virus-challenged index hamster two exposed nave hamsters in each system were sacrificed at day 5 post-inoculation 4 days after exposure the challenged index animal and the remaining exposed nave animal in each system were then sacrificed at 7 dpi a

of coronaviruses with ace2 angiotensin ii and ras inhibitorslessons from available evidence and insights into covid-19 hisashi kai mamiko kai   a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was discovered in december 2019 in wuhan china and an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has been spreading around the world as of early april 2020 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic upper respiratory infection to critically ill pneumonia associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 13 in initial reports from china the prevalence of older age hypertension diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease cvd was high in covid-19 patients and individuals with these comorbidities tended to have greater case fatality rates 3 4 in addition it has been shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 infection 57 given that experimental studies suggested that angiotensin receptor blockers arbs and an ace inhibitor acei could increase ace2 expression in cardiovascular and renal systems 820 concerns may have been raised regarding whether arbs and aceis would augment the infection of sars-cov-2 and the severity of covid-19 in hypertension and cvd patients receiving these drugs 21 in contrast arbs have potential benefits in the prevention and treatment of lung injury caused by covid-19 22 these conflicting views appear to arise based on the results of experimental studies especially those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov because direct clinical data on covid-19 are lacking at present sars-cov caused the sars epidemic in china in 20022003 and its virological characteristics are closely related to those of sars-cov-2 23 24 here available investigations on the association of the reninangiotensin system ras particularly ace2 and angiotensin ii with sars-cov-induced lung injury and the latest information on covid-19 were reviewed as of early april 2020 which would provide insight into covid-19 and the direction of future research on covid-19 ace2 belongs to the membrane-bound carboxydipeptidase family and is widely distributed in the human body including the heart kidney small intestine and to a lesser extent the lung lung ace2 expression is concentrated mainly in type ii alveolar cells and macrophages and modestly in bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells 25 ace2 degrades angiotensin ii to generate angiotensin 1-7 which activates the mas oncogene receptor that negatively regulates a variety of angiotensin ii actions mediated by angiotensin ii type 1 receptor at1r 26 therefore it is thought that the ace2angiotensin 1-7mas receptor axis has counteracting effects against the excessively activated aceangiotensin iiat1r axis as seen in hypertension cardiac hypertrophy heart failure and other cvds 26 on the other hand human ace2 is an established functional receptor by which sars-cov enters host target cells fig 1 23 24 the transmembrane spike glycoprotein s protein of sars-cov binds to the cellular membrane ace2 sars-cov then attaches to the target cells followed by sars-cov-s protein priming by cellular surface proteases such as transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 allowing the fusion of viral and cellular membranes and resulting in sars-cov entry and replication in the target cells 6 moreover ace2 knockout greatly reduces viral infection and replication in mice after experimental sars-cov infection 27 thus it is suggested that the binding of the sars-cov-s protein to ace2 is crucial for sars-cov infection recently it has been shown that the sars-cov-2-s protein shares nearly 80 amino acid identity with the sars-cov-s protein and the binding affinity of the sars-cov-2-s protein to human ace2 is similar to that of the sars-cov-s protein 57 anti-human ace2 antibodies or antisera can inhibit sars-cov-2-s protein-mediated entry into cultured cells in vitro 57 accordingly sars-cov-2 utilizes ace2 for target cell entry as well however it is still not clear whether ace2 is the sole receptor for sars-cov-2 infection because cd209l a glycoprotein of c-type lectin also called l-sign is identified as a possible secondary receptor for sars-cov in cultured chinese hamster ovary cells 28 experimental sars-cov infection induces acute respiratory failure and lung parenchymal injury characterized by alveolar wall thickening pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability and inflammatory cell infiltration in mice 27 after sars-cov infection in mice lung ace2 protein levels are greatly reduced while ace levels are not changed 27 these findings are consistent with the previous observation that coronaviruses specifically downregulate ace2 expression in host cells depending on virus replication 29 in addition sars-cov-induced acute lung injury is remarkably attenuated in ace2 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice 27 lung angiotensin ii levels increase in wild-type mice after sars-cov infection 27 acid aspiration mice an ards model show functional and pathological changes mimicking sars-cov-induced lung injury 30 the lung angiotensin ii levels increase after acid aspiration and sars-cov-s protein treatment elicits a further angiotensin ii increase 27 interestingly exogenous recombinant ace2 treatment rescues acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury 30 taking this evidence together the following hypothesis has been raised for the mechanism underlying sars-cov-induced lung injury sars-cov infection downregulates lung ace2 and in turn shifts the balance toward the dominance of the aceangiotensin iiat1r system over the ace2angiotensin 1-7mas receptor system in the lung as a result noncompeting angiotensin ii accumulation occurs resulting in acute lung injury through at1r activation 27 it should be noted that a similar mechanism is proposed for the severe lung injury caused by the avian influenza a virus h5n1 which has spread worldwide in humans with a high mortality rate after h5n1 virus infection in mice lung ace2 expression is downregulated and serum angiotensin ii levels increase 31 acute lung injury is augmented by ace2 knockout in h5n1-infected mice while the administration of recombinant human ace2 ameliorates h5n1-induced lung injury in mice 31 moreover in other mouse models of acute lung injuryards such as acid aspiration sepsis and drug-induced lung fibrosis it has been shown that ace2 expression is downregulated in response to noxious stimuli and that acute lung injury is aggravated by ace2 knockout and rescued by exogenous ace2 administration or at1r knockout 30 32 accordingly it is suggested that the angiotensin iiat1r-induced aggravation resulting from ace2 downregulation and the protective effects of ace2 are not specific to lung injury in sars but rather may be common to acute lung injuryards induced by various viral infections and lung diseases several kinds of arbs eg olmesartan telmisartan losartan and azilsartan have been shown to increase the mrna or protein levels of ace2 in animal models of heart diseases hypertensive hypertrophy autoimmune myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy myocardial infarction and diabetic cardiomyopathy 814 and chronic kidney disease hypertensive nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy 15 16 as well as normal rat heart and renal vasculature 17 18 and hypertensive rat aorta but not the carotid artery 19 20 acei does not inhibit ace2 as a pharmacological property in normal rats lisinopril has been shown to modestly increase cardiac ace2 mrna levels while not changing cardiac ace2 activity 17 in the myocardial infarction model valsartan ramipril and their combination have no effects on cardiac ace2 expression 33 it should be noted that the doses of arbs and aceis used in these animal studies were much greater than those in clinical practice so that the observed effects of these drugs on ace2 expression and activity could not be extrapolated to clinical situations in humans importantly no clinical data exist regarding the effects of arbs and aceis on human tissue ace2 expression or activity in vivo although there are several clinical studies investigating the changes in plasma or urine levels of the soluble form of ace2 in hypertension and cvd patients receiving arbs or aceis the soluble form of ace2 in the plasma and urine is not a reliable indicator of the activity of tissue ace2 namely membrane-bound ace2 22 importantly there are no data on the effects of arbs and aceis on lung ace2 expression either in animal models or humans it is still unknown whether the changes in ace2 levels for example arb-induced upregulation actually facilitate greater engagement and entry of sars-cov and other viruses even in animal models on the other hand it has been shown that pretreatment with losartan an arb ameliorates acute pulmonary edema and lung injury in sars-cov-s protein-treated mice after acid aspiration fig 2 27 taken together with the lung angiotensin ii level elevation 27 this evidence suggested that even after considering the speculation that viral load would be enhanced by ace2 upregulation the net effects of arbs would be favorable to prevent sars-cov-induced acute lung injury in this model in addition there is another possibility that the arb pretreatment-induced baseline ace2 increase prior to sars-cov infection would result in higher ace2 levels that remained after sars-cov-induced downregulation and consequently conferred protection against lung injury in this model 22 34 however in interpreting the results of this study it should be noted that the effects of losartan have been observed merely in mice treated with sars-cov-s protein in addition to acid aspiration but not in mice treated with sars-cov-s protein alone additionally data on lung ace2 levels before and after treatment with sars-cov-s protein and acid aspiration are lacking in mice pretreated with or without losartan earlier studies reported that the case fatality rate was high in covid-19 patients with comorbidities such as older age hypertension diabetes mellitus cvd chronic pulmonary disease and malignancy 3 4 because patients with hypertension and cvd are likely treated with aceis or arbs the concern is raised regarding whether the use of aceis and arbs may aggravate the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 21 however it was possible that the observed phenomenon would result from reverse causality because older patients are at the highest risk for covid-19 and concurrently tend to have multiple comorbidities including hypertension and cvd and because adjustments for age and other possible confounding factors were not performed in such earlier studies 22 35 36 indeed in a recent retrospective multicenter cohort study enrolling 191 confirmed covid-19 patients in wuhan china multivariable regression analysis revealed that independent risk factors for in-hospital death are older age higher sequential organ failure assessment score and higher d-dimer levels at the early stage of covid-19 although hypertension diabetes and coronary artery disease were not included 37 a small case study reported that plasma angiotensin ii levels were markedly elevated and linearly associated with viral load and lung injury severity in covid-19 pneumonia patients 38 given that a remarkable elevation of circulating levels was also documented in various kinds of cytokines il-6 il-10 tnf-alpha etc it is unknown whether these findings of angiotensin ii are the cause or result of a systemic cytokine storm in covid-19 patients 39 in the context of the effects of arbs and aecis a retrospective single-center analysis enrolling 112 covid-19 patients showed that the use of arbs and aceis had no effects on the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 patients with cvd 40 currently a case-control study is underway to clarify the effects of aceis and arbs on the severity of covid-19 in italy nct04318418 most importantly at present there is no large-scale study with convincing evidence to determine whether arbs and aceis play a neutral beneficial or harmful role in the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 and the severity and outcomes of covid-19 patients 22 3436 41 in addition to vaccine development and antiviral agents the modulation of the ras especially by ace2 and angiotensin ii is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target for covid-19 based on an animal study suggesting the beneficial net effects of arb in sars-cov-infected acute lung injury mice 27 multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trials rcts are currently being conducted to investigate the effects of losartan on mortality and hospital admission in covid-19 patients requiring hospital admission nct04312009 and not requiring hospital admission nct04311177 respectively recombinant ace2 is another candidate to prevent covid-19 pneumonia as described above the efficacy of exogenous recombinant ace2 has been shown in animal models of acute lung injuryards 30 31 it is also possible that the circulating soluble form of ace2 may act as a decoy receptor that binds to sars-cov-2 and competitively inhibits virus entry to host target cells mediated by membrane-bound ace2 to investigate the efficacy of human recombinant ace2 in the treatment of covid-19 patients a randomized controlled pilot clinical study was planned nct04287686 however this study was withdrawn on march 17 2020 tmprss2 is a membrane protease for ace2 priming which is a crucial step for the fusion of sars-cov-2 and target cell membranes and the resultant viral entry into the cells 6 nafamostat mesylate and camostat mesylate are tmprss2 inhibitors that have been used for the treatment of acute pancreatitis in japan currently a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of nafamostat and camostat for treating covid-19 is underway in japan httpswwwu-tokyoacjpfocusenarticlesz050800083html the concern regarding whether arbs and aceis may have harmful effects on the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 patients is based on the speculation that these drugs would upregulate ace2 a receptor for sars-cov-2 which would increase the viral load and then augment lung injury however the evidence of ace2 upregulation is limited only in animal studies using the relatively high namely pharmacological doses of several arbs and one acei additionally it remains unclear whether the arbace-induced ace2 increase actually enhances the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 or sar-cov importantly no clinical studies exist supporting that arbs and aceis augment susceptibility to infection and worsen or improve all-cause and cardiovascular outcomes in not only covid-19 patients but also sars patients at present therefore the hypothesis underlying the concern would not be readily extrapolated to humans particularly to covid-19 patients in patients with heart failure prior myocardial infarction other cvds and cerebrovascular disease the benefit of arbs and aceis has been established in the improvement of quality of life and survival outcomes while the discontinuation leads to new onset or exacerbation of heart failure cvd and stroke and the worsening of the prognosis 42 thus ras inhibitors should be continued in high-risk patients who have received guideline-directed medical therapy gdmt in general switching from one to another class of antihypertensive agents does not infrequently result in destabilization of blood pressure control and requires frequent visits for drug titration to achieve appropriate and stable blood pressure control and to avoid adverse effects blood pressure destabilization increases the incidence of heart failure stroke and other cvds in addition frequent visits to the clinic or hospital expose patients to a greater risk of infection in a covid-19 pandemic situation accordingly even in stably controlled hypertension patients without compelling indications it is thought that not only simple discontinuation but also switching from arb or acei to other antihypertensive agents should be avoided unless physicians make a decision based on specific considerations cardiovascular comorbidities are common in covid-19 patients and such patients are at great risk for morbidity and mortality 14 myocardial damage ranging from silent troponin t elevation to fulminant myocarditis has been documented in covid-19 patients 35 in confirmed or suspected covid-19 patients acei and arb medications are recommended for the treatment of heart failure and other cvd according to gdmt based on the available evidence at this time 35 in conclusion at present the use of arbs and aecis should not be withheld in established standard therapy for not only high-risk patients such as those with heart failure prior myocardial infarction other cvd and cerebrovascular disease but also patients with hypertension in stable condition according to the recent statements released by the european society of hypertension the european society of cardiology and the american heart associationheart failure society of americaamerican college of cardiology 4345 the evidence on covid-19 is being accumulated each day large-scale clinical studies with convincing evidence not only rcts but also real-world big data analyses as well as experimental studies are awaited to solve the question of whether arbs and aceis have neutral favorable or harmful effects on the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 and the severity and outcomes of covid-19 finally we should learn from the lessons of covid-19 without being bound by common sense in the ante-covid-19 era in addition we should reconstruct a novel strategy for the treatment of hypertension and cvd in the post-covid-19 era  risks of ace inhibitor and arb usage in covid19 evaluating the evidence krishna sriram paul insel a   we focused our assessment on studies that evaluated ace2 levels in tissuescells involved in infection by sarscov1 or sarscov2 data from 12 animal studies are summarized in table 

1
 which shows the effect of aceiarb use on ace2 protein expressionactivity in animals primarily rats we used conversion factors based on the principles of allometric scaling to evaluate doses in animals relative to their use in humans
12
 for studies in which this was relevant we used the human equivalent dose  assuming a 60 kg human
12
 for doses of aceiarbs the conversion factor for rats was 62 ie doses in mgkg were divided by 62 then multiplied by 60 kg for a human equivalent dose and 11 for pigs we obtained recommended doses for humans using approved labeling from the us food and drug administration fda website fdagov these recommended human doses are provided in table 

2
 for most of the drugs the maximum doses indicated in table 

2
 are generally not administered to humans such that treatment of animals with equivalent or larger doses especially in models of acute dosing as in refs 13 and 14 discussed in table 

1
 raise concern about their relevance to aceiarb administration to patients in summary three studies
10
 
14
 
15
 in animals reported an increase in all treatment groups of ace2 protein expressionactivity with aceiarb treatment but in one such study
10
 combined arbacei treatment did not show this effect the other two studies reported relatively small effects  40 increase in ace2 protein expression in controlsham animals all of these studies used high doses of aceisarbs as noted above by contrast six studies
11
 
16
 
17
 
18
 
19
 
20
 found little or no change in ace2 expression with aceiarb treatment in three studies
13
 
14
 
21
 treatment with aceiarb had no effect or a decrease in ace2 protein expressionactivity in controlsham animals increased ace2 expression was only observed following experimental exposure such as lung injury myocardial infarction etc in nearly all studies that reported an increase in ace2 doses of aceisarbs used were greater than equivalent doses typically administered to patients we identified only one study
21
 in which aceiarb use increased ace2 protein expression at doses typically used to treat patients albeit these changes only occurred after exposure to acute injury subtotal nephrectomy overall the studies with experimental animals do not provide consistent evidence for an effect of arbacei administration on ace2 protein expression especially in contexts that model drug administration in humans a challenge with assessing the animal studies in table 

1
 is that although doses were provided for the drugs pharmacokinetic studies were not performed to ascertain peak serum concentration cmax and area under the curve auc which would allow more precision in evaluating the translational relevance of findings however data from other studies provide insight into the pharmacokinetics in rats at doses comparable to those used in the studies in table 

1
 table 

2
 shows estimates for cmax for the drugs used in the studies in table 

1
 in humans at therapeutic doses as indicated and rats at doses comparable to those in table 

1
 the differences in auc for these drugs between humans and rats mirror differences in cmax we refer readers to the indicated references for further details with the exception of a study in a nephrectomy model
21
 animal data including all data for control animals that show a relationship between ace2 expression and use of aceisarbs involved drug treatments associated with plasma concentrations far in excess often more than one order of magnitude of values normally seen in patients absent exposureresponse studies with more clinically appropriate drug concentrations we conclude that the bulk of the animal data regarding ace2 expression with aceiarb administration has dubious translational relevance evidence of changes in ace2 protein in human subjectspatients table 

3
 are derived from studies that assessed ace2 protein concentration or enzymatic activity in urine or serumplasma of the 11 studies summarized in table 

3
 seven showed no effect of arbacei use on ace2 protein levels in any conditionpatient grouping one study
22
 documented a small increase in serum ace2 attributable to use of aceis among patients with type1 diabetes but found no effect from use of arbs another study
23
 found a slightly larger proportional decrease in urinary ace2 in patients with type2 diabetes using aceisarbs but did not distinguish between effects from use of aceis or arbs in one study
24
 the investigators observed that subjects using the arb olmesartan had increased ace2 levels but several other arbs and aceis had no effect in one study
25
 acei use had no effect in control patients with stage 35 chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis arb only had a small effect in patients on dialysis besides these quantitative data in table 

3
 another study used immunohistochemical analysis to assess ace2 protein expression in the kidneys and found no aceidependent effect
26
 together these 12 studies in humans imply a lack of association between ace2 protein expression and the use of arbs or aceis and support the idea that aceisarbs are unlikely to raise ace2 or be harmful in the context of covid19 infection what would constitute strong supportive evidence for the hypothesis that aceiarb usage is a risk factor in the setting of sarscov2 infection findings to help support that hypothesis would include i replication of a prominent effect in multiple animal studies and models ii evidence that tissues with low expression of ace2 have prominent increases in its expression and activity following aceiarb treatment iii data documenting that increases in ace2 expression in response to aceiarb treatment enhance the ability of the sarscov2 virus to infect cells iv findings from human studies of statistically significant relationships between aceiarb usage and ace2 expressionactivity and v epidemiological data showing that patients with covid19 administered aceisarbs have increased morbidity and mortality ideally with a doseresponse relationship for such outcomes how well do the available data provide such evidence i the hypothesis that ace2 expression increases with aceiarb use is not supported by the plurality of available data from animal studies ii there is no available evidence for de novo expression of ace2 expression in response to aceisarbs in tissues with low expression iii the affinity of sarscov2 for ace2 is very high approximately fourfold greater than sarscov1
27
 or higher some studies suggest an orderofmagnitude higher affinity for sarscov2
28
 it is unclear if small or modest perturbations in ace2 expression impact the infectivity of sarscov2 moreover ace2 levels may decrease with age
29
 
30
 and diabetes
31
 yet elderlydiabetic subjects are more vulnerable than younger individuals to covid19
32
 modest changes in ace2 expression  2fold from most preclinical data discussed above may not meaningfully impact on the high infectivity of sarscov2 in host tissues iv data from human studies suggest that treatment with aceisarbs produces little or no effect on urinary or circulating ace2 levels as a caveat changes in ace2 levels in serum or urine may not reflect changes in tissue v epidemiological studies are slowly becoming available in matched groups of patients infected with sarscov2 who have or have not been taking aceisarbs one preliminary study
33
 examined 28 patients with severe covid19 and 18 patients with mild disease all of whom also had hypertension arb use was associated with a reduction in risk of severe covid19 disease morbidity and mortality a result that contradicts the hypothesis that arbacei use is harmful however only small numbers of patients were assessed a larger retrospective study from 1128 patients with covid19 in china with hypertension found a  2fold reduction in mortality in patients administered aceisarbs compared with patients not receiving those drugs
34
 an additional smaller retrospective study also noted that hypertensive patients with covid19 receiving aceiarb treatment had a lower rate of severe covid19 disease a trend toward reduced blood levels of interleukin6 plus reduced viral load and increased counts of cytotoxic t cells
35
 none of these three retrospective studies found an elevation of risk with aceiarb use based on the data summarized above we conclude that current evidence especially from human studies table 

3
 does not support the idea that treatment with aceis or arbs produces pathophysiologically relevant increases in ace2 protein abundance the hypothesis that the use of these drugs increases sarscov2 virus infectivity andor severity of covid19 is therefore not supported by the available evidence it would thus seem prudent for patients to continue receiving these medications as recently recommended by multiple health associations

spread internationally raising global public health concerns the causative pathogen was
identified as a novel coronavirus 116 that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
sars-cov-2 on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of related coronaviruses by the
coronavirus study group of the international committee on virus taxonomy 17 the disease it causes was
subsequently designated covid-19 by the world health organization who despite tremendous
efforts to control the covid-19 outbreak the disease is still spreading as of march 11
2020 sars-cov-2 infections have been reported in more than 100 countries and 118326 human
cases have been confirmed with 4292 fatalities 18 covid-19 has now been announced as a pandemic by who although sars-cov-2 shares 962 identity at the nucleotide level with the coronavirus
ratg13 which was detected in horseshoe bats rhinolophus spp in yunnan
province in 2013 3 it has not
previously been detected in humans or other animals the emerging situation raises many urgent
questions could the widely disseminated viruses transmit to other animal species which then
become reservoirs of infection the sars-cov-2 infection has a wide clinical spectrum in
humans from mild infection to death but how does the virus behave in other animals as
efforts are made for vaccine and antiviral drug development which animals can be used most
precisely to model the efficacy of such control measures in humans to address these
questions we evaluated the susceptibility of different model laboratory animals as well as
companion and domestic animals to sars-cov-2 all experiments with infectious sars-cov-2 were performed in the biosafety level 4 and animal
biosafety level 4 facilities in the harbin veterinary research institute hvri of the chinese
academy of agricultural sciences caas which was approved for such use by the ministry of
agriculture and rural affairs of china details of the biosafety and biosecurity measures
taken are provided in the supplementary materials 19 the protocols for animal study and animal welfare were
reviewed and approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments of the hvri of caas
approval number 2020-01-01jipi ferrets are commonly used as an animal model for respiratory viruses that infected humans
2026 we therefore tested the susceptibility of sars-cov-2
in ferrets two viruses sars-cov-2f13environment2020wuhan isolated from an environmental
sample collected in the huanan seafood market in wuhan f13-e and
sars-cov-2ctanhuman2020wuhan ctan-h isolated from a human patient were used in this
study pairs of ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 105 plaque forming unit
pfu of f13-e or ctan-h respectively and euthanized on day 4 post-inoculation pi the
nasal turbinate soft palate tonsils trachea lung heart liver spleen kidneys pancreas
small intestine and brain from each ferret were collected for viral rna quantification by
qpcr and virus titration in vero e6 cells viral rna fig 1 a
and b and infectious virus were detected in the nasal turbinate soft palate and
tonsils of all four ferrets inoculated with these two viruses but was not detected in any
other organs tested fig 1 c and d these results
indicate that sars-cov-2 can replicate in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets but its
replication in other organs is undetectable to investigate the replication dynamics of these viruses in ferrets groups of three animals
were inoculated intranasally with 105 pfu of f13-e or ctan-h and then placed in
three separate cages within an isolator nasal washes and rectal swabs were collected on days
2 4 6 8 and 10 pi from the ferrets for viral rna detection and virus titration body
temperatures and signs of disease were monitored for two weeks as shown in fig 1 viral rna was detected in the nasal washes on days 2
4 6 and 8 pi in all six ferrets inoculated with the two viruses fig 1 e and f viral rna was also detected in some of the rectal swabs of
the virus-inoculated ferrets although the copy numbers were notably lower than those in the
nasal washes of these ferrets fig s1 a and c infectious virus was detected from the nasal
washes of all ferrets fig 1 g and h but not from the
rectal swabs of any ferrets fig s1 b and d one ferret from each virus-inoculated group developed fever and loss of appetite on days 10
and 12 pi respectively to investigate whether these symptoms were caused by virus
replication in the lower respiratory tract we euthanized the two ferrets on day 13 pi and
collected their organs for viral rna detection however viral rna was not detected in any
other tissues or organs of either ferret except for a low copy number 1054
copiesg in the turbinate of the ferret inoculated with ctan-h fig s2 pathological
studies revealed severe lymphoplasmacytic perivasculitis and vasculitis increased numbers of
type ii pneumocytes macrophages and neutrophils in the alveolar septa and alveolar lumen
and mild peribronchitis in the lungs of the two ferrets euthanized on day 13 pi fig s3
antibodies against sars-cov-2 were detected in all of the ferrets by an elisa and a
neutralization assay although the antibody titers of the two ferrets that were euthanized on
day 13 pi were notably lower than those of the ferrets euthanized on day 20 pi fig 1 i to l a virus attachment assay indicated that sars-cov-2 could attach to bronchiolar epithelial
cells fig s4a and some type ii pneumocytes fig s4b in the ferret lung to further
investigate whether sars-cov-2 replicates in the lungs of ferrets we intratracheally
inoculated eight ferrets with 105 pfu of ctan-h and euthanized two animals each on
days 2 4 8 and 14 pi to look for viral rna in the tissues and organs viral rna was only
detected in the nasal turbinate and soft palate of one of the two ferrets that were euthanized
on days 2 and 4 pi in the soft palate of one ferret and in the nasal turbinate soft
palate tonsil and trachea of the other ferret that were euthanized on day 8 pi and was
not detected in either of the two ferrets that were euthanized on day 14 pi fig s5 these
results indicate that sars-cov-2 can replicate in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets for
up to eight days without causing severe disease or death cats and dogs are in close contact with humans and therefore it is important to understand
their susceptibility to sars-cov-2 for covid-19 control we first investigated the replication
of sars-cov-2 in cats seven subadult cats aged 6-9 months outbred domestic cats were
intranasally inoculated with 105 pfu of ctan-h two animals were scheduled to be
euthanized on days 3 pi and 6 pi respectively to evaluate viral replication in their
organs three subadult cats were placed in separate cages within an isolator to monitor
respiratory droplet transmission an uninfected cat was placed in a cage adjacent to each of
the infected cats it was difficult to perform regular nasal wash collection on the subadult
cats because they were aggressive to avoid possible injury we only collected feces from
these cats and checked for viral rna in their organs after euthanasia viral rna was detected in the nasal turbinate of one animal in the soft palates tonsils
tracheas lungs and small intestine of both animals that were euthanized on day 3 pi
fig 2a in the animals that were euthanized on day 6
pi viral rna was detected in the nasal turbinates soft palates and tonsils of both
animals in the trachea of one animal and in the small intestine of the other however viral
rna was not detected in any of the lung samples from either of these animals fig 2c infectious virus was detected in the viral
rna-positive nasal turbinates soft palates tonsils tracheas lungs of these cats but was
not recovered from the viral rna-positive small intestine fig
2 b and d in the transmission study viral rna was detected in the feces of two virus-inoculated
subadult cats on day 3 pi and in all three virus-inoculated subadult cats on day 5 pi
fig 3a viral rna was detected in the feces of one
exposed cat on day 3 pi fig 3a the pair of subadult
cats with viral rna-positive feces were euthanized on day 11 pi and viral rna was detected
in the soft palate and tonsils of the virus-inoculated animal and in the nasal turbinate soft
palate tonsils and trachea of the exposed animal fig
3b indicating that respiratory droplet transmission had occurred in this pair of
cats we euthanized the other pairs of animals on day 12 pi and viral rna was detected in
the tonsils of one virus-inoculated subadult cat in the nasal turbinate soft palate
tonsils and trachea of the other virus-inoculated subadult cat but was not detected in any
organs or tissues of the two exposed subadult cats fig
3b antibodies against sars-cov-2 were detected in all three virus-inoculated
subadult cats and one exposed cat by use of an elisa and neutralization assay fig 3 c and d we replicated the replication and transmission studies in juvenile cats aged 70100
days figs 2 e to h and 3 e to g and fig s6 histopathologic studies performed on samples from the
virus-inoculated juvenile cats that died or euthanized on day 3 pi revealed massive lesions
in the nasal and tracheal mucosa epitheliums and lungs fig s7 these results indicate that
sars-cov-2 can replicate efficiently in cats with younger cats being more permissive and
perhaps more importantly the virus can transmit between cats via the airborne route we next investigated the replication and transmission of sars-cov-2 in dogs five 3-month-old
beagles were intranasally inoculated with 105 pfu of ctan-h and housed with two
uninoculated beagles in a room oropharyngeal and rectal swabs from each beagle were collected
on days 2 4 6 8 10 12 and 14 pi for viral rna detection and virus titration in vero
e6 cells viral rna was detected in the rectal swabs of two virus-inoculated dogs on day 2
pi and in the rectal swab of one dog on day 6 pi table
1 one dog that was viral rna positive by its rectal swab on day 2 pi was
euthanized on day 4 pi but viral rna was not detected in any organs or tissues collected
from this dog fig s8 infectious virus was not detected in any swabs collected from these
dogs sera were collected from all of the dogs on day 14 pi for antibody detection by use of
an elisa two virus-inoculated dogs seroconverted the other two virus-inoculated dogs and the
two contact dogs were all seronegative for sars-cov-2 according to the elisa table 1 and fig s9 these results indicate that dogs have
low susceptibility to sars-cov-2 we also investigated the susceptibility of pigs chickens and ducks to sars-cov-2 by using
the same strategy as that used to assess dogs however viral rna was not detected in any
swabs collected from these virus-inoculated animals or from nave contact animals
table 1 and all of the animals were seronegative
for sars-cov-2 when tested by using the elisa with sera collected on day 14 pi table 1 these results indicate that pigs chickens and
ducks are not susceptible to sars-cov-2 in summary we found that ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to sars-cov-2 dogs have
low susceptibility and livestock including pigs chickens and ducks are not susceptible to
the virus ferrets have frequently been used as an animal model for the study of human respiratory
viruses 2026 unlike influenza viruses and other
human sars-coronavirus which replicate in both the upper and lower respiratory tract of
ferrets 20 2224 26
27 we found sars-cov-2 only
replicates in the nasal turbinate soft palate and tonsils of ferrets it may also replicate
in the digestive tract as viral rna was detected in the rectal swabs of the virus-infected
ferrets but virus was not detected in lung lobes even after the ferrets were intratracheally
inoculated with the virus it remains unclear whether the virus causes more severe disease in
male ferrets than in female ferrets as has been observed among humans 13 28 several studies have reported that sars-cov-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as
its receptor to enter cells 3 2931 ace2 is mainly expressed in type ii pneumocytes and serous
epithelial cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands in ferrets 25 ferrets and cats have only two amino acid differences
in the sars-cov-2 spike-contacting regions of ace2 table s1 therefore the underlying
mechanism that prevents the replication of sars-cov-2 in the lower respiratory tract of
ferrets remains to be investigated the fact that sars-cov-2 replicates efficiently in the
upper respiratory tract of ferrets makes them a candidate animal model for evaluating
antiviral drugs or vaccine candidates against covid-19 the cats we used in this study were outbred and were susceptible to sars-cov-2 which
replicated efficiently and transmitted to nave cats cats in wuhan have been reported
to be seropositive for sars-cov-2 32 surveillance for sars-cov-2 in cats should be considered as an
adjunct to elimination of covid-19 in humans  prediction and analysis of coronavirus disease 2019 lin jia kewen li yu jiang xin guo ting zhao  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus was found in a seafood wholesale market in wuhan china who officially named this coronavirus as covid-19 since the first patient was hospitalized on december 12 2019 china has reported a total of 78824 confirmed conid-19 cases and 2788 deaths as of february 28 2020 wuhans cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 611 and 765 of the whole china mainland  making it the priority center for epidemic prevention and control meanwhile 51 countries and regions outside china have reported 4879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of february 28 2020 covid-19 epidemic does great harm to peoples daily life and countrys economic development this paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models ie logistic model bertalanffy model and gompertz model the epidemic trends of sars were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the existing mathematical models the results were then used to fit and analyze the situation of covid-19 the prediction results of three different mathematical models are different for different parameters and in different regions in general the fitting effect of logistic model may be the best among the three models studied in this paper while the fitting effect of gompertz model may be better than bertalanffy model according to the current trend based on the three models the total number of people expected to be infected is 49852-57447 in wuhan12972-13405 in non-hubei areas and 80261-85140 in china respectively the total death toll is 2502-5108 in wuhan  theoretical analysis quantitative analysis and simulation are needed for the prediction of various infectious diseases the above analysis cannot be carried out without models established for various infectious diseases infectious disease transmission is a complicated diffusion process occurring in the crowd models can be established for this process to analyze and study the transmission process of infectious diseases theoretically 4  so that we can accurately predict the future development trend of infectious diseases 5  therefore in order to control or reduce the harm of infectious diseases the research and analysis of infectious disease prediction models have become a hot research topic 6  traditional infectious disease prediction models mainly include differential equation prediction models and time series prediction models based on statistics and random processes the differential equation prediction models are to establish a differential equation that can reflect the dynamic characteristics of infectious diseases according to the characteristics of population growth the occurrence of diseases and the laws of transmission within the population through qualitative and quantitative analysis and numerical simulation of the model dynamics the occurrence process of diseases is displayed the transmission laws are revealed the change and development trends are predicted the causes and key factors of disease transmission are analyzed the optimal strategies for prevention and control are sought and the theoretical basis and quantitative basis are provided for people to make prevention and control decisions common models for predicting infectious disease dynamics differential equations have ordinary differential systems which directly reflect the relationship between the instantaneous rate of change of individuals in each compartment and the corresponding time of all compartments partial differential system is a common model system when considering age structure delay differential system is a kind of differential system that appears when the structure of the stage is considered eg the infected person has a definite infectious period the latent person has a definite incubation period the immunized person has a definite immune period etc the currently widely studied and applied models include si model sis model sir model and seir model etc 7  system individuals are divided into different categories and each category is in a state respectively s susceptible eexposed i infected and r remove the classical differential equation prediction model assumes that the total number of people in a certain area is a constant which can prompt the natural transmission process of infectious diseases describe the evolution relationship of different types of nodes with time and reveal the overall information transmission law however in practice the population is changing over time there will always be some form of interaction with other populations in terms of food resources and living space the connection between individuals is random and the difference between spreading individuals is ignored thus limiting the application scope of the model the infectious disease prediction model established by this method relies on curve fitting and parameter estimation of available time series data so it is difficult to apply it to a large number of irregular data infectious disease surveillance research based on the internet has begun to rise since the mid-1990s 9  it can provide information services for public health management institutions medical workers and the public after analyzing and processing it can provide users with early warning and situational awareness information of infectious diseases 10  in the early research traditional web page web information for example related news topics authoritative organizations etc was the main data source however with the development of the internet research has begun to expand data sources to social media such as twitter facebook microblog etc and multimedia information in recent years due to the global spread of the internet people use internet search engines social networks and online map tools to track the frequency and location information of query keywords strengthen the integration of information on social public focus and hot issues realize disease monitoring based on search engines and social media and predict the incidence of infectious diseases which can provide important reference for the decision and management of infectious disease prevention and control 11  in theory internet search tracking is efficient and can reflect the real-time status of infectious diseases therefore the infectious disease prediction models based on internet and search engine are good supplement to the traditional infectious disease prediction models 12 compared with the traditional prediction models the internet-based infectious disease prediction models have the advantages of real-time and fast which can predict the incidence trend of infectious diseases as early as possible and are suitable for data analysis of a large number of people however the sensitivity spatial resolution and accuracy of its prediction need to be further improved so internet-based infectious disease prediction models cannot replace the traditional prediction models and they can just be used as an extension of the traditional infectious disease prediction model 16  this paper will use 2003 sars data to verify three mathematical models logistic model bertalanffy model and gompertz model to predict the development trend of the virus and then use these three models to fit and analyze the epidemic trend of covid-19 in wuhan mainland china and non-hubei areas including the total number of confirmed cases the number of deaths and the end time of the epidemic in short machine learning is to learn more useful information from a large amount of data using its own algorithm model for specific problems machine learning spans a variety of fields such as medicine computer science statistics engineering technology psychology etc 17  for example neural network a relatively mature machine learning algorithm can simulate any high-dimensional non-linear optimal mapping between input and output by imitating the processing function of the biological brains nervous system when faced with complex data relations the traditional statistical method is not such effective which may not receive accurate results as the neural network 18  since most new infectious diseases occurring in human beings are of animal origin animal infectious diseases it is an effective prerequisite to predict diseases by determining the common intrinsic characteristics of species and environmental conditions that lead to the overflow of new infections by analyzing the intrinsic characteristics of wild species through machine learning new reservoirs mammals and carriers insects of zoonotic diseases can be accurately predicted 19  the overall goal of machine learning-based approach is to extend causal inference theory and machine learning to identify and quantify the most important factors that cause zoonotic disease outbreaks and to generate visual tools to illustrate the complex causal relationships of animal infectious diseases and their correlation with zoonotic diseases 20  however the highly nonlinear and complex problems to be analyzed in the early prediction model of infectious diseases based on machine learning usually lead to local minima and global minima leading to some limitations of the machine learning model infectious disease prediction models mainly include differential equation prediction models based on dynamics and time series prediction models based on statistics and random processes internet-based infectious disease prediction model and machine learning methods some models are too complicated and too many factors are considered which often leads to over-fitting in this paper logistic model bertalanffy model and gompertz model which are relatively simple but accord with the statistical law of epidemiology are selected to predict the epidemic situation of covid-19 after the model is selected the least square method is used for curve fitting least square method is a mathematical optimization technique it finds the best function match of data by minimizing the sum of squareed errors using the least square method unknown data can be easily obtained and the sum of squares of errors between these obtained data and actual data is minimized 1 logistic model logistic model is mainly used in epidemiology it is commonly to explore the risk factors of a certain disease and predict the probability of occurrence of a certain disease according to the risk factors we can roughly predict the development and transmission law of epidemiology through logistic regression analysis qt is the cumulative confirmed cases deaths a is the predicted maximum of confirmed cases deaths b and c are fitting coefficients t is the number of days since the first case t0 is the time when the first case occurred 2 bertalanffy model bertalanffy model is often used as a growth model it is mainly used to study the factors that control and affect the growth it is used to describe the growth characteristics of fish other species can also be used to describe the growth of animals such as pigs horses cattle sheep etc and other infectious diseases the development of infectious diseases is similar to the growth of individuals and populations in this paper bertalanffy model is selected to describe the spread law of infectious diseases and to study the factors that control and affect the spread of covid-19 qt is the cumulative confirmed cases deaths a is the predicted maximum of confirmed cases deaths b and c are fitting coefficients t is the number of days since the first case t0 is the time when the first case occurred 3 gompertz model the model was originally proposed by gomperts gompertz1825 as an animal population growth model to describe the extinction law of the population the development of infectious diseases is similar to the growth of individuals and populations in this paper gompertz model is selected to describe the spread law of infectious diseases and to study the factors that control and affect the spread of covid-19 qt is the cumulative confirmed cases deaths a is the predicted maximum of confirmed cases deaths b and c are fitting coefficients t is the number of days since the first case t0 is the time when the first case occurred the regression coefficient r 2  is used to evaluate the fitting ability of various methods and can be obtained by the following equation is the actual cumulative confirmed covid-19 cases  is the predicted cumulative confirmed covid-19 cases  is the average of the actual cumulative confirmed covid-19 cases the closer the fitting coefficient is to 1 the more accurate the prediction as covid-19 and sars virus are both coronaviruses the infection pattern may be similar firstly we used sars data to verify the rationality of our model the  the cumulative number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus hereinafter referred to as covid- figure 3  the number of confirmed cases has dramatically increased in china since the first case was confirmed the epidemic spreads to other parts of hubei and the whole country with wuhan as the center since the main confirmed cases were in wuhan the development trend of new confirmed cases in the whole country are basically the same with wuhan judging from the prediction results the three models can predict the epidemic situation of covid-19 well in the later stage of the epidemic among them logistic model is better than the other two models in fitting all the data in wuhan while gompertz model is better in fitting the data outside wuhan due to various reasons it is worth noting that the number of confirmed cases suddenly increased by 13332 on february 12 2020obviously the mutation of this data does not originate from the mechanism of the virus so our treatment method is to remove the impact of this part of data mutation 13 332 peoplethen the impact of the sudden increase confirmed cases will be considered in the later fitting analysis according to the daily real-time updated data of covid-19 we used the above three mathematical models logistic model bertalanffy model and gompertz model to carry out fitting analysis on the epidemic of covid-19 the prediction results are shown in table 1 in which a is the prediction of cumulative confirmed number the final predicted cumulative confirmed number  a13332 b and c are fitting coefficients t is the number of days since the first case r 2 c means the fitting goodness of cumulative confirmed cases r 2 n means the fitting goodness of new confirmed cases c three models for predicting covid-19 cases in non-hubei areas since january 152020 in order to predict the turning point we use the above three models to compare the new confirmed cases in wuhan china mainland and non-hubei areas as can be seen in figure 4  the turning points in w wuhan china mainland and non-hubei areas are february 9 february 6 and february 2 2020 respectively from the results for the prediction of newly confirmed cases the three models can predict the covid-19 epidemic well in the early and late stages of the epidemic among them the logistic model is better than the other two models in fitting all the data  the fitting parameters of each model can be seen in table 2 in which a is the prediction of the death toll b and c are fitting coefficients t is the number of days since the first case r 2 dc means the fitting goodness of cumulative deaths according to the available data the death toll predicted by the three models is wuhan 2502-5108 non-  the stronger the support for various resources across the country is getting stronger and the ability to refine management and treatment is getting stronger these factors are likely to rapidly reduce the mortality rate of covid-19 the above factors may also have some influence on the cumulative number of confirmed cases but due to the large number of confirmed cases the influence of these favorable human factors on the cumulative number of confirmed cases may be small at present there are only a few papers on the prediction of covid-19 epidemic we have collected some covid-19 epidemic predictions of other researchers as shown in table 3  it can be seen from table 3   covid-19 infection origin transmission and characteristics of human coronaviruses muhammad shereen adnan suliman khan abeer kazmi nadia bashir rabeea siddique   coronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae family in the nidovirales order corona represents crown-like spikes on the outer surface of the virus thus it was named as a coronavirus coronaviruses are minute in size 65125 nm in diameter and contain a single-stranded rna as a nucleic material size ranging from 26 to 32kbs in length fig 1 the subgroups of coronaviruses family are alpha  beta  gamma  and delta  coronavirus the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov h5n1 influenza a h1n1 2009 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov cause acute lung injury ali and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which leads to pulmonary failure and result in fatality these viruses were thought to infect only animals until the world witnessed a severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak caused by sars-cov 2002 in guangdong china 1 only a decade later another pathogenic coronavirus known as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov caused an endemic in middle eastern countries 2 recently at the end of 2019 wuhan an emerging business hub of china experienced an outbreak of a novel coronavirus that killed more than eighteen hundred and infected over seventy thousand individuals within the first fifty days of the epidemic this virus was reported to be a member of the  group of coronaviruses the novel virus was named as wuhan coronavirus or 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov by the chinese researchers the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv named the virus as sars-cov-2 and the disease as covid-19 3 4 5 in the history sras-cov 2003 infected 8098 individuals with mortality rate of 9 across 26 contries in the world on the other hand novel corona virus 2019 infected 120000 induviduals with mortality rate of 29 across 109 countries till date of this writing it shows that the transmission rate of sars-cov-2 is higher than sras-cov and the reason could be genetic recombination event at s protein in the rbd region of sars-cov-2 may have enhanced its transmission ability in this review article we discuss the origination of human coronaviruses briefly we further discuss the associated infectiousness and biological features of sars and mers with a special focus on covid-19 in 2003 the chinese population was infected with a virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in guangdong province the virus was confirmed as a member of the beta-coronavirus subgroup and was named sars-cov 6 7 the infected patients exhibited pneumonia symptoms with a diffused alveolar injury which lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards sars initially emerged in guangdong china and then spread rapidly around the globe with more than 8000 infected persons and 776 deceases a decade later in 2012 a couple of saudi arabian nationals were diagnosed to be infected with another coronavirus the detected virus was confirmed as a member of coronaviruses and named as the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the world health organization reported that mers-coronavirus infected more than 2428 individuals and 838 deaths 8 mers-cov is a member beta-coronavirus subgroup and phylogenetically diverse from other human-cov the infection of mers-cov initiates from a mild upper respiratory injury while progression leads to severe respiratory disease similar to sars-coronavirus patients infected with mers-coronavirus suffer pneumonia followed by ards and renal failure 9 recently by the end of 2019 who was informed by the chinese government about several cases of pneumonia with unfamiliar etiology the outbreak was initiated from the hunan seafood market in wuhan city of china and rapidly infected more than 50 peoples the live animals are frequently sold at the hunan seafood market such as bats frogs snakes birds marmots and rabbits 10 on 12 january 2020 the national health commission of china released further details about the epidemic suggested viral pneumonia 10 from the sequence-based analysis of isolates from the patients the virus was identified as a novel coronavirus moreover the genetic sequence was also provided for the diagnosis of viral infection initially it was suggested that the patients infected with wuhan coronavirus induced pneumonia in china may have visited the seafood market where live animals were sold or may have used infected animals or birds as a source of food however further investigations revealed that some individuals contracted the infection even with no record of visiting the seafood market these observations indicated a human to the human spreading capability of this virus which was subsequently reported in more than 100 countries in the world the human to the human spreading of the virus occurs due to close contact with an infected person exposed to coughing sneezing respiratory droplets or aerosols these aerosols can penetrate the human body lungs via inhalation through the nose or mouth fig 2 11 12 13 14 the source of origination and transmission are important to be determined in order to develop preventive strategies to contain the infection in the case of sars-cov the researchers initially focused on raccoon dogs and palm civets as a key reservoir of infection however only the samples isolated from the civets at the food market showed positive results for viral rna detection suggesting that the civet palm might be secondary hosts 15 in 2001 the samples were isolated from the healthy persons of hongkong and the molecular assessment showed 25 frequency rate of anti-bodies against sars-coronavirus these indications suggested that sars-coronavirus may be circulating in humans before causing the outbreak in 2003 16 later on rhinolophus bats were also found to have anti-sars-cov antibodies suggesting the bats as a source of viral replication 17 the middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus first emerged in 2012 in saudi arabia 9 mers-coronavirus also pertains to beta-coronavirus and having camels as a zoonotic source or primary host 18 in a recent study mers-coronavirus was also detected in pipistrellus and perimyotis bats 19 proffering that bats are the key host and transmitting medium of the virus 20 21 initially a group of researchers suggested snakes be the possible host however after genomic similarity findings of novel coronavirus with sars-like bat viruses supported the statement that not snakes but only bats could be the key reservoirs table 1 22 23 further analysis of homologous recombination revealed that receptor binding spike glycoprotein of novel coronavirus is developed from a sars-cov covzxc21 or covzc45 and a yet unknown beta-cov 24 nonetheless to eradicate the virus more work is required to be done in the aspects of the identification of the intermediate zoonotic source that caused the transmission of the virus to humans all coronaviruses contain specific genes in orf1 downstream regions that encode proteins for viral replication nucleocapsid and spikes formation 25 the glycoprotein spikes on the outer surface of coronaviruses are responsible for the attachment and entry of the virus to host cells fig 1 the receptor-binding domain rbd is loosely attached among virus therefore the virus may infect multiple hosts 26 27 other coronaviruses mostly recognize aminopeptidases or carbohydrates as a key receptor for entry to human cells while sars-cov and mers-cov recognize exopeptidases 2 the entry mechanism of a coronavirus depends upon cellular proteases which include human airway trypsin-like protease hat cathepsins and transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 that split the spike protein and establish further penetration changes 28 29 mers-coronavirus employs dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 while hcov-nl63 and sars-coronavirus require angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a key receptor 2 26 sars-cov-2 possesses the typical coronavirus structure with spike protein and also expressed other polyproteins nucleoproteins and membrane proteins such as rna polymerase 3-chymotrypsin-like protease papain-like protease helicase glycoprotein and accessory proteins 30 31 the spike protein of sars-cov-2 contains a 3-d structure in the rbd region to maintain the van der waals forces 32 the 394 glutamine residue in the rbd region of sars-cov-2 is recognized by the critical lysine 31 residue on the human ace2 receptor 33 the entire mechanism of pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 from attachment to replication is well mentioned in fig 3 the genome of the sars-cov-2 has been reported over 80 identical to the previous human coronavirus sars-like bat cov 34 the structural proteins are encoded by the four structural genes including spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n genes the orf1ab is the largest gene in sars-cov-2 which encodes the pp1ab protein and 15 nsps the orf1a gene encodes for pp1a protein which also contains 10 nsps 34 35 36 according to the evolutionary tree sars-cov-2 lies close to the group of sars-coronaviruses 37 38 fig 5 recent studies have indicated notable variations in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 such as the absence of 8a protein and fluctuation in the number of amino acids in 8b and 3c protein in sars-cov-2 34 fig 4 it is also reported that spike glycoprotein of the wuhan coronavirus is modified via homologous recombination the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 is the mixture of bat sars-cov and a not known beta-cov 38 in a fluorescent study it was confirmed that the sars-cov-2 also uses the same ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cell receptor and mechanism for the entry to host cell which is previously used by the sars-cov 39 40 the single n501t mutation in sars-cov-2s spike protein may have significantly enhanced its binding affinity for ace2 33 animal models play a vital role to uncover the mechanisms of viral pathogenicity from the entrance to the transmission and designing therapeutic strategies previously to examine the replication of sars-cov various animal models were used which showed the symptoms of severe infection 43 in contrast to sars-cov no mers-cov pathogenesis was observed in small animals mice are not vulnerable to infection by mers-coronavirus due to the non-compatibility of the dpp4 receptor 44 as the entire genome of the 2019-novel coronavirus is more than 80 similar to the previous human sars-like bat cov previously used animal models for sars-cov can be utilized to study the infectious pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 the human ace2 cell receptor is recognized by both sars and novel coronaviruses conclusively talen or crispr-mediated genetically modified hamsters or other small animals can be utilized for the study of the pathogenicity of novel coronaviruses sars-cov has been reported to replicate and cause severe disease in rats f344 where the sequence analysis revealed a mutation at spike glycoprotein 45 thus it could be another suitable option to develop spike glycoprotein targeting therapeutics against novel coronaviruses recently mice models and clinical isolates were used to develop any therapeutic strategy against sars-cov-2 induced covid-19 46 47 in a similar study artificial intelligence prediction was used to investigate the inhibitory role of the drug against sars-cov-2 48 sars-cov-2 infected patients were also used to conduct randomized clinical trials 46 49 50 it is now important that the scientists worldwide collaborate the design a suitable model and investigate the in vivo mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 initially interferons- nebulization broad-spectrum antibiotics and anti-viral drugs were used to reduce the viral load 49 51 52 however only remdesivir has shown promising impact against the virus 53 remdesivir only and in combination with chloroquine or interferon beta significantly blocked the sars-cov-2 replication and patients were declared as clinically recovered 46 50 52 various other anti-virals are currently being evaluated against infection nafamostat nitazoxanide ribavirin penciclovir favipiravir ritonavir aak1 baricitinib and arbidol exhibited moderate results when tested against infection in patients and in-vitro clinical isolates 46 48 50 52 several other combinations such as combining the antiviral or antibiotics with traditional chinese medicines were also evaluated against sars-cov-2 induced infection in humans and mice 46 recently in shanghai doctors isolated the blood plasma from clinically recovered patients of covid-19 and injected it in the infected patients who showed positive results with rapid recovery 54 in a recent study it was identified that monoclonal antibody cr3022 binds with the spike rbd of sars-cov-2 this is likely due to the antibodys epitope not overlapping with the divergent ace2 receptor-binding motif cr3022 has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic candidate alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 infection 55 there is no available vaccine against covid-19 while previous vaccines or strategies used to develop a vaccine against sars-cov can be effective recombinant protein from the urbani ay278741 strain of sars-cov was administered to mice and hamsters resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies and protection against sars-cov 56 57 the dna fragment inactivated whole virus or live-vectored strain of sars-cov ay278741 significantly reduced the viral infection in various animal models 58 59 60 61 62 63 different other strains of sars-cov were also used to produce inactivated or live-vectored vaccines which efficiently reduced the viral load in animal models these strains include tor2 ay274119 64 65 utah ay714217 66 fra ay310120 59 hku-39849 ay278491 57 67 bj01 ay278488 68 69 ns1 ay508724 70 zj01 ay297028 70 gd01 ay278489 69 and gz50 ay304495 71 however there are few vaccines in the pipeline against sars-cov-2 the mrna based vaccine prepared by the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases against sars-cov-2 is under phase 1 trial 72 ino-4800-dna based vaccine will be soon available for human testing 73 chinese centre for disease control and prevention cdc working on the development of an inactivated virus vaccine 74 75 soon mrna based vaccines sample prepared by stermirna therapeutics will be available 76 geovax-bravovax is working to develop a modified vaccina ankara mva based vaccine 77 while clover biopharmaceuticals is developing a recombinant 2019-ncov s protein subunit-trimer based vaccine 78 although research teams all over the world are working to investigate the key features pathogenesis and treatment options it is deemed necessary to focus on competitive therapeutic options and cross-resistance of other vaccines for instance there is a possibility that vaccines for other diseases such as rubella or measles can create cross-resistance for sars-cov-2 this statement of cross-resistance is based on the observations that children in china were found less vulnerable to infection as compared to the elder population while children are being largely vaccinated for measles in china the novel coronavirus originated from the hunan seafood market at wuhan china where bats snakes raccoon dogs palm civets and other animals are sold and rapidly spread up to 109 countries the zoonotic source of sars-cov-2 is not confirmed however sequence-based analysis suggested bats as the key reservoir dna recombination was found to be involved at spike glycoprotein which assorted sars-cov covzxc21 or covzc45 with the rbd of another beta cov thus could be the reason for cross-species transmission and rapid infection according to phylogenetic trees sars-cov is closer to sars-like bat covs until now no promising clinical treatments or prevention strategies have been developed against human coronaviruses however the researchers are working to develop efficient therapeutic strategies to cope with the novel coronaviruses various broad-spectrum antivirals previously used against influenza sars and mers coronaviruses have been evaluated either alone or in combinations to treat covid-19 patients mice models and clinical isolates remdesivir lopinavir ritonavir and oseltamivir significantly blocked the covid-19 infection in infected patients it can be cocluded that the homologus recombination event at the s protein of rbd region enhanced the transmission ability of the virus while the decision of bring back the nationals from infected area by various countries and poor screening of passengers become the leading cause of spreading virus in others countries most importantly human coronaviruses targeting vaccines and antiviral drugs should be designed that could be used against the current as well as future epidemics there are many companies working for the development of effective sars-cov-2 vaccines such as moderna therapeutics inovio pharmaceuticals novavax vir biotechnology stermirna therapeutics johnson  johnson vido-intervac geovax-bravovax clover biopharmaceuticals curevac and codagenix but there is a need for rapid human and animal-based trails as these vaccines still require 310 months for commercialization there must be a complete ban on utilizing wild animals and birds as a source of food beside the development of most efficient drug a strategy to rapidly diagnose sars-cov-2 in suspected patient is also required the signs and symptoms of sars-cov-2 induced covid-19 are a bit similar to influenza and seasonal allergies pollen allergies person suffering from influenza or seasonal allergy may also exhibit temprature which can be detected by thermo-scanners hence the person will become suspected therefore an accurate and rapid diagnostic kit or meter for detection of sars-cov-2 in suspected patients is required as the pcr based testing is expensive and time consuming different teams of chinese doctors should immediately sent to eurpean and other countries especially spain and italy to control the over spread of covid-19 because chinese doctors have efficiently controlled the outbreak in china and limited the mortality rate to less than 3 only the therapeutic strategies used by chinese should also be followed by other countries  current global vaccine and drug efforts against covid-19 pros and cons of bypassing animal trials covid-19 has become one of the biggest health concern along with huge economic burden with no clear remedies to treat the disease doctors are repurposing drugs like chloroquine and remdesivir to treat covid-19 patients in parallel research institutes in collaboration with biotech companies have identified strategies to use viral proteins as vaccine candidates for covid-19 although this looks promising they still need to pass the test of challenge studies in animal models as various models for sars-cov-2 are under testing phase biotech companies have bypassed animal studies and moved to phase i clinical trials in view of the present outbreak this looks a justified approach but the problem is that in the absence of animal studies we can never predict the outcomes in humans since animal models are critical for vaccine development and sars-cov-2 has different transmission dynamics in this review we compare different animal models of sars-cov-2 with humans for their pathogenic immune response and transmission dynamics that make them ideal models for vaccine testing for covid-19 another issue of using animal model is the ethics of using animals for research thus we also discuss the pros and cons of using animals for vaccine development studies deb bijayeeta  shah hemal  goel suchi mathematical modeling explains differential sars cov-2 kinetics in lung and nasal passages in remdesivir treated rhesus macaques ashish goyal elizabeth duke r e fabian cardozo-ojeda   joshua schiffer t  these authors contributed equally to the work we developed a mathematical model to explain why remdesivir has a greater antiviral effect on sars cov-2 in lung versus nasal passages in rhesus macaques remdesivir was recently demonstrated to decrease recovery time in hospitalized patients with sars-3 cov-2 infection in rhesus macaques early initiation of remdesivir therapy prevented pneumonia and 4 lowered viral loads in the lung but viral loads increased in the nasal passages five days after therapy we 5 developed mathematical models to explain these results we identified that 1 drug potency is slightly 6 higher in nasal passages than in lungs 2 viral load decrease in lungs relative to nasal passages during 7 therapy because of infection-dependent generation of refractory cells in the lung 3 incomplete drug 8 potency in the lung that decreases viral loads even slightly may allow substantially less lung damage and 9 4 increases in nasal viral load may occur due to a slight blunting of peak viral load and subsequent 10 decrease of the intensity of the innate immune response as well as a lack of refractory cells we also 11 hypothesize that direct inoculation of the trachea in rhesus macaques may not recapitulate natural 12 infection as lung damage occurs more abruptly in this model than in human infection we demonstrate 13 with sensitivity analysis that a drug with higher potency could completely suppress viral replication and 14 lower viral loads abruptly in the nasal passages as well as the lung results 42 rhesus macaques in a recent pre-print article 12 rhesus macaques were infected with 26x10 6 tcid50 of 44 sars-cov-2 strain ncov-wa1-2020 via intranasal oral ocular and intratracheal routes and then treated 45 with either placebo or iv remdesivir 10 mgkg loading dose followed by 5 days of 5 mgkg starting at 46 12 hours post infection 5 overall treatment resulted in reduced severity of clinical illness less pronounced 47  there is a desperate need for treatments for sars cov-2 the virus which causes covid- 19 18 disease 1 one unmet need for of antiviral therapy development is identification of virologic surrogates for 19 clinically meaningful endpoints such as death or need for hospitalization in the case of sars-cov-2-20 infected people viral load can be routinely measured in nasal samples or saliva 2 however the primary 21 site of disease is lung tissue therefore bronchoalveolar lavage bal of the lungs would be an ideal 22 sample however bal is usually not necessary for diagnosis represents an infection risk to medical 23 personnel and is rarely performed in the care of covid-19 patients when bal does occur it is often 24 late during disease in critically ill patients rather than at early clinical presentation thus the natural 25 kinetics of sars cov-2 in lungs are unknown in humans 26 in humans a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial showed that the nucleoside 27 analog remdesivir limited the duration of illness and approached statistical significance for reduction in 28 mortality when given later in disease 3  in a separate study with an overall later time of treatment 29 initiation remdesivir had no effect on viral load or clinical outcome 4 a recent pre-print demonstrated that 30 remdesivir was highly effective when initiated 12 hours after infection in rhesus macaques 5 in this 31 context remdesivir prevented pneumonia and limited extent of clinical illness while there was an effect 32 on viral shedding in serial bal specimens viral load in the nasal passage was unchanged relative to 33 animals treated with a vehicle during the first several days of infection and higher starting at day 5 a 34 critical question is whether nasal viral loads are potentially useful as a surrogate for the extent of lung 35 disease during covid-19 infection 36 here we develop mathematical models that recapitulate viral load trajectories in both anatomic 37 compartments of the infected rhesus macaques the models explain these differences according to 38 different underlying viral kinetics off therapy in both compartments as well as differential drug potency in 39 nasal passage versus lung infiltrates on chest radiograph lower viral load by nucleic acid and viral titer measurement in 48 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid on days 1 3 and 7 and decreased volume of lung lesions lung weight and 49 inflammation on histologic post-mortem exam 5 50 we re-examined viral loads in bal and nasal specimens and noted that at days 1 3 and 7 post-51 infection bal viral loads were lower in the remdesivir arm relative to the vehicle arm by approximately a 52 single order of magnitude fig 1a  similar results were observed when viral load was measured using 53 viral culture 5 in nasal specimens there was no observed difference in viral loads at days 1 2 3 and 4 on 54 day 6 there was a trend towards higher viral loads in the remdesivir treated arm on day 5 and 7 nasal 55 viral loads were statistically higher in the treated arm relative to vehicle fig 1b  56 when nasal viral loads were compared longitudinally to bal viral loads in vehicle treated 57 animals viral loads were generally higher in bal than in the nasal passages at days 1 3 and 7 fig 1c  58 in the remdesivir-treated animals viral loads were equivalent on days 1 and 3 but higher in nasal 59 passages than bal at day 7 fig 1d  overall these results suggest that remdesivir lowered viral load in 60 the lung but appeared to have the opposite effect in nasal passages of rhesus macaques at late timepoints molecule to achieve its active triphosphate form ntp as well as the distribution of these metabolites 69 from plasma to tissue 70 for single-dose pk we fit the model to data from healthy rhesus macaques in which various 71 intermediate metabolites were measured over time following a single injection of 10 mgkg including the 72 levels of ntp is pbmcs 6 7 we also simultaneously fit the model to multi-dose drug and metabolite 73 trough levels from the infected rhesus macaques 10 mgkg at day 05 and thereafter 5 mgkg daily at 74 days 2 till 6 post-infection including a day 7 level of the nuc in tissue at the time of necropsy on day 7 75 in fig 3b 5 rdv pk parameters are listed in table 1  the pd models assumes an ec50 or concentration 76 of the active metabolite ntp at which replication is inhibited by 50 77 the model is able to recapitulate the levels of remdesivir and its metabolites in healthy fig 3a 78 and infected rhesus macaques fig 3b  79 lung and nasal mathematical model of sars co-v-2 in rhesus macaques we developed a model of 81 viral replication in the nasal passage and lungs that includes multiple mechanisms that may occur 82 following infection in lungs and the nasal passages fig 4a  this model is an adaptation of our previous 83 model of human covid-19 infection and includes a density-dependent death of infected cells as a proxy 84 for an intensifying innate response to a higher burden of infection proliferation of susceptible epithelial 85 cells the conversion of susceptible andor infected cells to an infection refractory state and the movement 86 of the virus between nasal passages and the lung 8 we fit different versions of this model to the viral loads 87 in nasal passages and lung from 6 infected remdesivir-treated animals 5 using model selection theory we found that the model with minimal complexity necessary to 93 explain the observed data was the one in fig 4b  in this model infected cell death and viral production 94 have different rates in lung compared to the nasal passage  table 2  furthermore in the selected model 95 susceptible lung cells proliferate and become refractory to infection but cells in the nasal passages do not 96 table 3  interestingly this model lacked viral interchange between lung and nasal passages 97 98 model fit to viral load data from untreated rhesus macaques the best model fit recapitulated the 99 frequently observed trend of higher viral loads in bal at late timepoints relative to the nasal passage in 100 untreated macaques fig 5a  the model also closely captured the viral dynamics in bal from untreated 101 animals and mostly captured nasal viral loads as well though outlier datapoints compromised model fit 102 somewhat in several of the animals 103 infected cell death rates were generally higher while viral replication rates were uniformly lower 104 in the nasal passages relative to lungs in the untreated animals  table 4  the density-dependent exponent 105 had a similar value in both compartments k009 was similar to that predicted in humans 8 and led to a suppressed viral replication varied somewhat across animals over the course of the treatment from day 05 to day 7 the mean efficacy of the rdv treatment in nasal mucosa was estimated to be 884 914 119 869 810 862 and 835 in rm1 rm2 rm3 rm4 rm5 and rm6 respectively similarly over 120 the course of the treatment from day 0 to day 7 the mean efficacy of the rdv treatment in lung was 121 estimated to be 763 750 804 698 774 and 755 in rm1 rm2 rm3 rm4 rm5 and 122 rm6 respectively fig 6  brief reductions in rdv drug concentrations between doses related to lower 123 active metabolite levels in cells were associated with viral re-expansion after each dose fig 5b  124 the antiviral potency of remdesivir was estimated using in vivo ec50 whereas in vitro ic50 125 estimate the antiviral concentration needed to inhibit 50 of viral replication based on in vitro 126 experiments we estimate ec50 based on viral loads measured in vivo in animal or human experiments 10 127 estimates for in ivio ec50 were roughly 2-fold higher 2-fold lower potency in the lung relative to the 128 nasal passages table 4  variability in nasal viral load peak and contemporaneous viral loads between 129 treated animals generally related to difference in in vivo ec50 rather than viral replication rate rm2 had 130 complex kinetics with low peak viral load followed by viral rebound which was not captured by the 131 model and may represent a drug resistant variant 11 and was found to have the lowest ec50 one animal 132 with accelerated viral elimination in the lung rm5 was found to have a higher infected cell death rate in 133 lung but similar ec50 relative to the other 5 treated animals table 4  134 135 we next performed counterfactual simulations in which the six treated animals were assumed to have not 137 received treatment   0 and   0 the viral load trajectories in these simulations fig 7 appear 138 similar to those in untreated animals with bal viral loads often exceeding nasal viral loads at later 139 timepoints fig 5a  comparisons of the counterfactual viral load tracings to the treated animals suggests 140 that a majority of viral load decrease in lungs is achieved following the first dose and is then carried 141 forward throughout the duration of therapy with unchanged decay slopes on the other hand in nasal 142 passages viral load is decreased initially during therapy but then stabilizes or even increases leading to 143 higher viral loads than counterfactual projections fig 7  in the nasal cavity somewhere between day 2 and 6 of therapy the tracings cross and viral loads 145 of the treated animals are predicted to exceed the counterfactual simulations of the same animals off 146 therapy fig 7  the model projects that early treatment reduces viral load thereby decreasing new early 147 infection and preventing depletion of susceptible cells in the nasal passages fig 8  even without 148 assuming susceptible cell proliferation there is an adequate population of these cells to establish a steady 149 state of viral replication fig 8  in the lung where remdesivir is less potent and initially susceptible cells 150 can become refractory to infection treatment leads to a slower depletion of susceptible cells these cells 151 are nevertheless depleted in a linear fashion as they convert to a refractory state fig 8  inclusion of a 152 refractory cell compartment is therefore necessary to allow linear elimination of virus from serial bal 153 decreased cell death in the lungs of remdesivir treated animals as an informal assessment of lung 156 damage we longitudinally assessed cell death over time in our counterfactual simulations in each case 157 therapy decreased the degree of peak cell death by at least 33 fig 9  while lung damage is multi-158 factorial during covid-19 this finding is qualitatively compatible with the observation that early 159 remdesivir spared these 6 animals from severe clinical disease and abnormal lung histopathology 160 161 projected nasal and lung viral load trajectories at higher drug potency next we performed sensitivity 162 analyses in which we assumed a more potent antiviral effect which could arise either from different 163 dosing of remdesivir or a drug with a more potent drug in nasal passages fig 10a and in lungs  fig  164   10b  the impact of the first dose is more profound with higher potency leading to a more abrupt decline 165 in viral load 166 we estimate that minimum drug efficacies of 9999 and 995 would be required to eliminate 167 virus from nasal passages and lungs within 5 days for a drug that is given 12 hours after infection the 168 need for such high potency reflects the lack of a concurrent immune response at this early stage of 169 infection modeling of human infection that antiviral treatment with moderate potency would not clear viral 173 infection in the nasal passage or sputum if dosed prior to the peak viral load but would clear infection if 174 dose several days later 8 our simulations of the rhesus macaque data arrive at a similar conclusion in the 175 nasal passage that paradoxically later treatment with a moderate potency drug results in lower viral 176 loads whereas treatment started before peak results in increased late viral loads fig 11a  in contrast in 177 the lungs later treatment at days 2 or 4 leads to a subsequent viral load trajectory similar to that of the 178 earlier treated animals during the later stages of infection fig 11b  179 we estimate that minimum drug efficacies of 50 and 995 would be required to eliminate 180 virus from nasal passages and lungs within 5 days for a drug that is given 4 days after infection this 181 result is due to the higher remaining viral load in the lungs of animals during the first untreated 5 days of 182 infection viral load is a valid surrogate endpoint for treatment efficacy of several viruses including hiv 185 hepatitis b hepatitis c and cytomegalovirus 12 13 14 15 16 it is plausible that sars cov-2 lung viral load is also 186 predictive of disease severity in humans viral loads from swabs of infected tissue provide an 187 approximation of the number of infected cells at a given point in time and therefore the surface area of 188 infected tissue 17 18 unfortunately it is less certain whether viral load measurements can be leveraged for 189 sars cov-2 treatment response in humans because bal is required to measure lung viral loads but 190 these are never performed longitudinally in infected people as part of routine clinical care experience 191 from other respiratory viruses suggests that viral load measures in the upper airway by nasal swab or 192 saliva may or may not be representative of those in the lung 19 193 here we apply mathematical models to remdesivir treatment data in rhesus macaques in which 194 both lung and nasal viral load were measured we identify that the relationship between lung and nasal on the other hand in rhesus macaques extensive lung damage and clinic illness is observed 215 within two days of infection which is not in keeping with severe illness in humans which emerges at least 216 a week after the initial phase of illness 5 21 we hypothesize that direct intratracheal inoculation of 217 macaques with a high viral titer results in more immediate infection of lung in humans a more common 218 pattern is for respiratory viruses to start replicating in the upper airway and then transmit to the lungs in a 219 second stage of infection 22 an alternative and not mutually exclusive explanation is that the degree of 220 viral replication in the lung can also be established extremely early in humans but that the more extensive 221 immune-mediated damage which may be correlated with the extent of early viral replication occurs 1-2 222 weeks later had the rhesus macaques with the highest lung viral loads been followed for a longer period 223 of time it is possible that a more severe pneumonia would have developed at later timepoints 224 a counterintuitive result predicted by our model is that remdesivir is slightly more potent in the 225 nasal cavity than in the lung on a per cell level assuming that drug levels are indeed equivalent in the two 226 compartments nevertheless sars cov-2 is not cleared in nasal passages as effectively as in the lungs 227 while on treatment because the effectiveness of antiviral therapies is never independent of the concurrent 228 intensity of the immune response to infection 10 23 we previously predicted that a more potent therapy is 229 needed after 2 days of sars cov-2 infection relative to 5 days after infection because there is little 230 innate immune pressure against the virus during its early expansion phase 8 as a result despite a slight 231 blunting of initial viral loads virus will rebound or stabilize and end up at a higher viral level in the nose 232 than in the absence of treatment 233 here we recapitulate this finding in the nasal passages but also predict why this does not occur 234 in the lungs of macaques in the lung as in the nasal cavity we assume density dependent killing as a proxy for an intensifying innate response to a higher burden of infection however our model also 236 suggests that ongoing infection drives a percentage of lung cells to become temporarily refractory to 237 infection inclusion of this assumption is required to recapitulate lung viral load data and to explain the 238 observation that lung damage is severely blunted in animals receiving treatment this assumption is 239 supported by modeling of influenza infection 24  there are several limitations of our approach first our approximation of lung damage is 241 relatively coarse based on the complexity of this post-viral inflammatory process which may be mediated 242 by factors other than number of infected cells this is therefore a qualitative target of our modeling 243 second our fits to nasal viral load are imperfect which may be due to imprecision in viral load 244 measurements as well as missed components within the model in the case of rm2 there is substantial 245 viral rebound that may be due to incomplete innate responses to the first pulse of infection or to de novo 246 drug resistance third we only model early infection and therefore neglect the critical impact of the late 247 acquired immune response 25-27 248 in conclusion we demonstrate that in rhesus macaques the non-linear forces governing sars 249 cov-2 viral load trajectories in the lung and nasal passages differ substantially in the presence of a 250 partially effective antiviral therapy to the extent that the rhesus macaque model approximates human 251 infection nasal viral load remains a promising surrogate endpoint marker but perhaps only in the context 252 of a highly potent antiviral therapy experimental data we analyzed viral load observations from nasal passages and bal and remdesivir and 255 its metabolites plasma concentrations from 12 sars-cov-2-infected rhesus macaques in which 6 were 256 treated with remdesivir and 6 received a vehicle control 5 remdesivir was infused 12 hours after infection 257 at a dose 10mgkg with subsequent daily doses of 5 mgkg for 6 day we also added viral loads from nasal 258 passages and bal from 8 additional untreated animals from muster et al 7 21 in both studies rhesus 259 macaques were infected with 26x10 6 tcid50 of sars-cov-2 strain details about the infection and 260 treatment protocol can be found in these two pre-prints 261 we also analyzed more frequently sampled observations of remdesivir and its metabolites averaged 262 from three healthy animals after a single iv infusion of 10mgkg of remdesivir 28 263 264 remdesivir pharmakinetics model we used a compartmental and metabolism pharmacokinetics pk 265 model for remdesivir the goal of this model was to recapitulate the sparse data from remdesivir and its 266 metabolites after several doses to the sars-cov-2-infected animals 5 along with the very frequently 267 sampled data after a single dose in healthy animals 6 the pk model depicted in fig 2 2 is produced at a rate  0 and cleared with rate  0  24 free virus is exchanged between the lungs and nasal 296 passages at rates 12 and 21  297 we also considered the possibility of the emergence of refractory cells due to antiviral actions of 298 cytokines such as interferon it has been experimentally demonstrated that uninfected lung airway cells may 299 become refractory    at rate   24 and that infected cells may convert directly to refractory cells    at 300 rate   refractory cells may lose their refractory state and become susceptible at rate   24 since we were only interested in the viral dynamics in a short span of 7 days with or without treatment we ignored the 302 death rate of uninfected and refractory cells in the lung that are usually long-lived 303 we also included the possibility of regeneration of susceptible cells during infection innate 304 immune cells eliminate virus but can also induce pulmonary tissue damage or endothelium damage as part 305 of this process 31 32 the restoration of the respiratory epithelial barrier after an injury is important and may 306 happens within days after viral clearance 33-35 depending on the severity of the infection and the extent of 307 lung involvement indeed the proliferation of epithetical cells and progenitor stem cells or distal airway 308 stem cells or dascs is critical for barrier repair following an inflammatory insult following lung injury 309 the tissue repair process is promoted by immune cells including innate lymphoid cells ilc-iis and 310 macrophages 36 epithelial restoration is initiated locally by proliferating alveolar type ii at2 cells 37 we 311 modeled this restoration by adding a logistic proliferation of susceptible and refractory but not infected 38  312 epithetical cells with maximum rate   all the previous mechanisms are modeled by the following 313 taking derivative on both sides we obtain 335 notice that this definition of 1 is equivalent to 1  1  1  1  1  under this assumption the 337 fraction of the lung covered with dead cells would be table 2  360 we next fit models to viral load and lung lesion observations from treated and untreated animals 361 here we explored different competing models listed in table 3 and described below we explored models 362 that included cell proliferation and refractory cells in the lungs fixing 2  0 42 2  0 and 2  0 we 363 explored the possibility that at2 cells proliferate with maximum rate 1 after some delay 33 ie 1  0 if 364   we also included models assuming that the antiviral activity of remdesivir in nasal passages occurs 365 after its activity in the lungs by a delay  for comprehensiveness we checked two models where refractory 366 1 with rate    and 2 with rate  notice that for the latter when 7810 then  for each compartment  since we were estimating 371 both 78 and  together we explored fixing the standard deviation of the random effects of 78 to 01 372 02 and 1 finally we only estimated the fixed effects of 1  and  when applicable here we also 373 assumed  0 as the time of infection with same initial values and fixed parameters 1  2  1 and 2 as 374 before we estimated the remaining parameters depending on each model assumptions 375 to determine the best and most parsimonious model among the instances above we computed the 376 log-likelihood log l and the akaike information criteria aic-2log l2m where m is the number of 377 parameters estimated we assumed a model has similar support from the data if the difference between its 378 aic and the best model lowest aic is less than two 43 379 assuming no treatment in the case of the lung bal specimens therapy is projected to lead to consistently 432 lower viral loads in the case of nasal viral load therapy temporarily lowers viral load but viral load is 433 predicted to ultimately persist at higher levels than in the absence of treatment simulations are based on 434 data from rm1-6 time is in days from infection 435   a review on sars-cov-2 virology pathophysiology animal models and anti-viral interventions sabari neerukonda nath upendra katneni   by the end of december 2019 a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov later renamed sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan city of chinas hubei province in 5 of 7 severe pneumonic patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu of the wuhan jin yin-tan hospital 1234 metagenomics sequencing analysis of patients bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and de novo sequence assembly revealed 2989kb genomes that shared 999 796 and 962 sequence identity with each other sars-cov-1 bj strain and bat cov ratg13 strain respectively 1 phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes revealed the identity of sars-cov-2 as a newly emerged strain of betacoronavirus that formed a distinct lineage from other sars-related covs sars-rcovs of bats but closely related to ratg13 1 since its identification the virus quickly spread within china and subsequently to 213 countries around the world within 3 months by march 2020 who declared the disease caused by sars-cov-2 termed cov disease 2019 covid-19 a pandemic as of 28 may 2020 more than 59 million cases and 350000 deaths had been reported globally with these numbers still on the rise in many countries in the united states alone rapid community transmission resulted in more than 17 million cases and 100000 deaths source johns hopkins coronavirus resource center httpscoronavirusjhuedu sars-cov-2 is a member of the coronavirinae subfamily in the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales based on genetic and phylogenetic relationships this subfamily is classified into four genera - - - and -cov members of the - and -cov genera infect mammals 5 members of the - and -cov genera primarily infect birds and also some mammals 5 covs are named after their crown-like morphology as observed under the electron microscope em afforded by the surface glycoproteins on the virus they are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses that can cause a wide range of respiratory enteric hepatic renal and neurologic diseases in birds and mammals 5 currently circulating covs in humans include two -covs 229e and nl63 and two -covs oc43 and hku1 that cause common cold the highly pathogenic human -covs that emerged in the past two decades include sars-cov-1 the middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and the more recent sars-cov-2 56 bats are considered natural hosts for progenitors of highly pathogenic covs whose spill over to humans is known to involve intermediate animal hosts 5 while domestic civets and dromedary camels are known intermediate hosts of sars-cov-1 and mers-cov respectively the role of an intermediary host if any in sars-cov-2 spillover is presently unknown a pangolin-cov that is closely related to ratg13 9055 genome identity and sars-cov-2 9102 genome identity was identified in a dead malayan pangolin which is now considered a possible intermediary host 7 human-to-human transmission via direct or indirect contact and inhalation of respiratory droplets are the main modes of global spread of highly pathogenic covs sars-cov-2 virions are spherical with a diameter of 60-100 nm conforming to the typical cov diameter of 125 nm 6 the virion surface displays characteristic club-shaped projections 8 sars-cov-2 is highly stable at 4 c for 2 weeks whereas at room temperature it can remain stable for a day without significant loss in infectivity 910 it is sensitive to uv inactivation and heat treatment 56 c for 30 min with a 70 c temperature reducing the virus inactivation time to 5 min its stability on printing paper or tissue paper 3 hr is limited compared to wood and cloth 2 days 910 by contrast it has higher stability 24 days on smooth surfaces such as on banknotes stainless steel plastic and both layers of a mask 9 the stability and half-life of sars-cov-2 on stainless steel and plastic is comparable to sars-cov-1 10 both these viruses have similar half-lives in aerosols as well with a median estimate of 1112 hrs 4 sars-cov-2 remains sensitive to most disinfectants including household bleach povidone-iodine chlorhexidine chloroxylenol benzalkonium chloride diethyl ether ethanol 7075 chlorine peracetic acid and chloroform 69 like sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 also utilizes human angiotenisin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor for cellular entry 11 ace2 is a type i membrane glycoprotein expressed in lungs heart intestines and kidneys 12 physiologically ace2 promotes cleavage and maturation of peptide hormones involved in the regulation of blood pressure angiotenisin ang i  ii ace2 cleaves ang i into ang-1-9 which then gets processed by other enzymes to generate ang-1-7 ace2 can also directly process ang ii to generate ang-1-7 12 ace2ang-1-7 forms another arm of the reninangiotensin system ras and has cardiovascular protective effects including anti-heart failure anti-thrombosis anti-myocardial hypertrophy anti-fibrosis anti-arrhythmia and anti-atherogenesis 12 furthermore ace2 also protects from lung injury and is downregulated upon sars-cov-1 infection 1314 these findings ignited interest in ace inhibitors andor angiotensin receptor blockers for potential treatment of covid-19 on the other hand upregulation of ace2 by these agents likely enhances viral entry and leads to worse disease outcomes 15 conflicting in vitro data exist regarding the benefit of these agents against sars-cov-2 but clinical practice guidelines recommend these agents for covid-19 therapy 16 full-length ace2 protein consists of an n-terminal peptidase domain pd and a c-terminal collectrin-like domain cld followed by a single transmembrane helix and an 40-residue intracellular segment 12 the cryo-em structure of sars-cov-2 spike -s trimer revealed metastable pre-fusion conformation which upon ace2 binding undergoes substantial rearrangement to promote fusion between viral and cell membranes 817 unlike sars-cov-1-s sars-cov-2-s harbors a multi-basic furin cleavage site rrarsv before the canonical s1s2 site aytm which allows efficient proteolytic processing during viral egress and prior to the subsequent round of entry 18 this processing is critical for the separation of the receptor-binding domain rbd and the fusion domain harbored in s1 and s2 subunits respectively figure 1 the stochastic movement of the rbd in s1 transiently exposes its binding determinants in an up conformation that permits receptor binding sars-cov-2-s binds ace2 with a 1020-fold higher affinity than sars-cov-1-s 817 receptor binding destabilizes the pre-fusion conformation resulting in the shedding of the s1 subunit and transition of the s2 subunit into a highly stable post-fusion conformation 17 following binding and endocytosis efficient proteolytic priming of s2 at a site proximal to the fusion peptide is essential for exposing the fusion peptide 11 like sars-cov-1-s sars-cov-2-s either use endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin b and l catbl or the serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming 11 these proteases therefore are attractive drug targets for example inhibitors of catbl e-64d and tmprss2 camostat mesylate nafamostat mesylate efficiently inhibit viral entry 1119 a vero e6 cell line engineered to overexpress tmprss2 produces higher yields of sars-cov-2 compared to parent vero e6 cell line 20 however tmprss2 but not catbl is known to be essential for sars-cov-1 entry into primary target cells and for efficient viral replication and spread in the infected mice 21 tmprss2 is co-expressed with the ace2 receptor in multiple cells or tissues that are likely targets of sars-cov-2 including nasal goblet and ciliated cells esophagus ileum colon and cornea 22 the relative importance of these proteases for sars-cov-2-s priming viral pathogenesis and target cell tropism need to be investigated in patient tissues and animal models in the acidified endosomes exposed fusion peptide inserts into the cell membrane followed by the joining of two heptad repeats in s2 into an anti-parallel six-helix bundle which facilitates mixing of viral and cellular membranes resulting in fusion 23 upon fusion the genome is released into the cytoplasm the sars-cov-2 genomic rna contains a 5 cap and a 3 polya tail that allow immediate translation to produce two coterminal replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab by utilizing a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism replicase polyproteins are encoded within two-thirds of the genome as orf1a and orf1b figure 2 1 these polyproteins are subsequently cleaved by the action of two viral proteases nsp3-plpro and nsp5-mpro into the individual non-structural proteins nsps nsp1-11 and nsp1-16 respectively 23 the remaining third codes for structural spike s envelope e membrane m nucleoprotein n and accessory proteins orf-3a -3b -6 -7a -7b -8 -9a -9b and 10 figure 2 1  the nsps are assembled into the replicasetranscriptase complex which begins to generate anti-sense - genomic and sub-genomic rnas that serve as templates for positive-sense genome  and sub-genomic mrna synthesis respectively these sub-genomic mrnas are 3 co-terminal with the viral genome and form a nested set of rnas due to discontinuous extension of the anti-sense rna the nsps also promote membrane rearrangement of rough endoplasmic reticulum er membranes into double-membrane vesicles in which the above replication and transcription processes occur 1 structural proteins translated from sub-genomic mrnas are inserted into the er and pass along the secretory pathway to the er-golgi intermediate compartment ergic 23 along this pathway s protein is cleaved into two subunits s1 and s2 by furin-like proteases 11 the newly synthesized genome forms a complex with n proteinand bud into the ergic to generate virions after the assembly virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and are exocytosed 23 accessory proteins also translated from sub-genomic mrnas carry out accessory functions that are likely important for pathogenesis and innate immune evasion 23 accessory protein functions of sars-cov-2 are yet to be characterized following transmission by droplets contact and other modes the virus replicates in cells of respiratory upper and lower and gastrointestinal tracts the clinical spectrum of covid-19 can vary from asymptomatic and mild symptomatic to an adverse clinical condition characterized by severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and hospitalization and critically ill condition 24 critically ill patients have systemic features characterized by sepsis septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes mods 24 mild covid-19 illness symptoms are typical of an upper respiratory tract viral infection including mild fever cough dry sore throat nasal congestion malaise headache muscle pain but no dyspnea 24 infrequently digestive symptoms such as nausea vomiting abdominal pain diarrhea may be present patients with moderate pneumonia display such symptoms as cough and shortness of breath tachypnea patients clinically diagnosed with severe pneumonia display symptoms with or without fever severe dyspnea respiratory distress tachypnea  30 breathsmin and hypoxia spo2  90 on room air 24 patients with sudden onset of respiratory failure or worsening of the already impaired lung function are diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and require mechanical ventilation 24 different ards forms include mild moderate and severe chest computerized tomography ct scans reveal bilateral ground glass opacities and subsegmental areas of consolidation 24 clinical features of covid-19 patients with sepsis are particularly critical with a wide range of signs and symptoms involving multiple organs 24 these signs and symptoms include respiratory manifestations such as severe dyspnea and hypoxemia kidney impairment with reduced urine output tachycardia altered mental status and coagulation dysfunction functional alteration of multiple tissues as reflected in laboratory findings include lymphopenia hyperbilirubinemia increased d-dimers acidosis high lactate coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia physiologically patients with severe disease have significantly lower counts of t cells cd8 t cells and nk cells compared to those with mild disease 25 overall covid-19 patients have fewer cd8 t cells and nk cells compared to healthy controls in addition nk- and cd8 t-cell populations in covid-19 patients are functionally exhausted nkg2a whereas convalescing patients recover functionality 25 out of 41 sars-cov-2-positive pneumonic patients admitted to jin yin-tan hospital 16 patients progressed to ards and were therefore placed under icu care 26 both icu and non-icu patients had higher initial plasma concentrations of il-1b il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 basic fgf g-csf gm-csf ifn- ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a mip-1b pdgf tnf- and vegf compared to healthy adult controls whereas il-5 il-12p70 il-15 eotaxin and regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted rantes were similar 26 a comparison between icu and non-icu patients showed higher plasma concentrations of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf in icu patients than in non-icu patients substantiating the association of cytokine storm in severe disease 26 a separate study also reported decreased counts of t cells and monocytes in covid-19 patients compared to healthy controls 27 while cd4 t cells displayed a remarkable decrease in both icu and non-icu patients decrease in cd8 t cells was noted only in icu patients covid-19 patient cd4 and cd8 t cells displayed activated phenotype with higher expression of cd69 cd38 and cd44 27 cd4 t cells of icu patients with more severe pneumonia showed higher percentage of gm-csf and il-6 cells compared to non-icu patients or healthy adults a higher percentage of cd14cd16 inflammatory monocytes in peripheral blood of covid-19 patients with a much higher percentage in icu patients were noted 27 notably these inflammatory monocytes were gm-csf and il-6 higher percentages of activated cd4 t cells and inflammatory monocytes in severe patients accompanied with gm-csf and il-6 production likely contribute to cytokine storm and pulmonary immune pathology in these patients interestingly no differences in granulocyte b cell and nk cell counts were noted between covid-19 and healthy patients in this study 27 a separate study on 452 patients admitted to tongji hospital china also reported higher leukocyte counts neutrophil counts lower lymphocyte counts higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as well as a lower percentage of monocytes eosinophils and basophils in severe patients compared to non-severe ones 28 severe patients also had higher levels of il-2r il-6 il-8 il-10 and tnf- but no differences in iga igg and complement proteins c3 or c4 percentage reduction in cd28 cytotoxic suppressor t cells cd3cd8cd28 and regulatory t cells cd3cd4cd25cd127low was observed in severe cases 28 overall immune dysregulation and exuberant inflammatory response in severe patients is due to higher neutrophils activated monocytes andor t cells and reduced suppressor or regulatory t cells 28 robust animal models that faithfully recapitulate sars-cov-2 pathogenesis as in humans do not exist as of now widely used laboratory mice are less susceptible to the sars-cov-2 infection likely due to mouse ace2 receptor incompatibility with s glycoprotein however research tools such as a mouse-adapted ma sars-cov-2 strain and human ace2 hace2 transgenic mice may overcome the incompatibility issue nevertheless c57bl6 and balbc mice infected with sars-cov-2 displayed transient infection and viral replication that is limited by an induction of innate immune response 29 however sars-cov-2 underwent efficient replication in the lower respiratory tract of hace2-transgenic mice but only caused mild or moderate interstitial pneumonia with no major clinical symptoms 30 another group recently demonstrated altered viral tropism and pathogenesis in sars-cov-2-infected hace2 transgenic mice although hace2 transgenic mice displayed active viral replication in lungs 40 mice mortality was observed by 5 days post infection dpi due to brain tropism 31 to overcome altered tropism and more accurately model the respiratory disease observed in humans the authors adapted s rbd interaction with mouse ace2 through directed evolution of rbd interaction residues q498tp999y 31 this ma sars-cov-2 displayed replication in upper and lower respiratory tracts and caused no mortality age-dependent pathogenesis as in humans was seen with infected 12-week-old and 1-year-old female balbc mice displaying mild or moderate and severe disease respectively 31 this model was successfully used in ma sars-cov-2 prophylaxis and therapy employing venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev-replicon and pegylated ifn- 31 by contrast sars-cov-2-infected syrian hamsters displayed early active virus replication in lungs and marked lung pathology characterized by necrotizing bronchiolitis massive leukocyte infiltration and edema recapitulating pathological changes of sars-cov-1-infected syrian hamsters and severe pneumonic patients 29 in addition a double-edged role of stat2 was demonstrated in the sars-cov-2 hamster model 29 stat2 knockout ko hamsters displayed higher lung titers viremia and systemic spread compared to wild-type ones indicating the role of stat2 in limiting systemic spread 29 on the other hand limited leukocyte infiltration attenuated lung pathology and no pneumonia was observed in stat2 ko hamsters ferrets have been successfully used to model respiratory disease and transmission of several respiratory viruses including influenza respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza viruses and sars-cov-1 32 similarities in tissue architecture and anatomy of ferret respiratory system to human with respect to receptor distribution submucosal gland density in the bronchial wall and the number of terminal bronchioles made them attractive models of study susceptibility of various laboratory companion and domestic animals to sars-cov-2 has been tested to model pathogenic mechanisms and the efficacy of control interventions several animal models that were tested for sars-cov-2 susceptibility include 3-4-month-old female ferrets 12-20-month-old mixed sex ferrets sub-adult or juvenile cats 3-month-old beagles 40-day-old mixed sex specific-pathogen-free spf landrace and large white pigs 4-week-old specific-pathogen-free spf white leghorn chickens and 4-week-old spf ducks 33 sars-cov-2 also underwent efficient viral replication in organs of the upper respiratory tract of 3-4-month-old infected or contact ferrets including nasal turbinate soft palate and tonsils while neither virus nor viral replication was detected in the trachea lungs heart kidneys spleen pancreas small intestine and brain 33 in contrast in 12-20-month-old mixed sex ferrets that are infected or contact-exposed to sars-cov-2 efficient replication was observed in organs of the upper or lower respiratory tract along with viral rna detection in trachea kidneys and intestines 33 furthermore efficient viral shedding was noticed in biological fluids saliva urine and nasal washes and feces of infectedcontact ferrets as observed in humans 33 apart from age-related difference in pathogenesis one limitation of sars-cov-2-infected ferrets is lower lung virus titers with no severe disease or mortality compared to other animal models such as sars-cov-1-infected or mers-cov-infected hace2 or hdpp4 transgenic mice 33 age-related difference in viral replication was also noted among cats with juvenile cats being more permissive compared to sub-adult cats 33 efficient viral replication was noted in all the above organs tested in juvenile cats whereas in sub-adult cats viral replication was limited to organs of the upper respiratory tract 33 until now companion cats and large cats in zoos were reported positive due to human-to-cat transmission with the former displaying respiratory signs 34 among other sars-cov-2 infected animals dogs displayed minor susceptibility whereas livestock including pigs chickens and ducks displayed no susceptibility 33 in line with this two companion dogs of covid-19 patients one old age pomeranian with several pre-existing conditions and an adult german shepherd tested positive for viral rna in nasal and oral swabs with the latter demonstrating higher viral rna loads 35 dog viral genomic rna matched with respective patient transmitters the potential for reservoir and onward transmission by cats or dogs is presently unknown and requires investigation 35 recently non-human primate models including young and aged cynomolgus macaques and young rhesus macaques were investigated as potential animal models of covid-19 363738 all sars-cov-2-infected macaques displayed productive infection with clinical signs ranging from asymptomatic in cynomolgus macaques to moderate disease in rhesus macaques 363738 only rhesus macaques displayed transient respiratory disease and weight loss 37 peak early viral replication in the respiratory tissues was followed by a rapid decline although aged cynomolgus and young rhesus macaques continued to shed the virus for prolonged periods viral antigen was detected in nasal epithelium ciliated epithelial cells type i and type ii pneumocytes bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells and some macrophages 363738 injury to these cell types correlated with diffuse alveolar damage alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial necrosis alveolar edema hyaline membrane formation infiltration of neutrophils macrophages and lymphocytes and interstitial pneumonia 363738 while non-human primate models fail to recapitulate severe disease and critical condition observed in covid-19 patients they may be useful for the evaluation and licensure of preventive and therapeutic strategies 363738 a dna immunogen expressing full-length s immunogen provided optimal protection in sars-cov-2 rhesus macaque challenge model compared to soluble constructs and smaller fragments of s immunogens 39 protection efficacy correlated with reduced viral replication in upper and lower respiratory tracts and neutralization antibody titers non-human primate models however come at an increased expense 39 nhc and its orally available prodrug eidd-2801 are ribonucleoside analogs with broad spectrum antiviral activity against multiple rna viruses including the current sars-cov-2 sars-cov-1 mers-cov venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev influenza ab ebola ebov and chikungunya chikv viruses 33 in vitro low micromolar concentrations of nhc induced a potent antiviral effect towards sars-cov-2 ec50 008-03 m mers ec50 015 m and sars-cov-1 ec50 014 m propagated in calu-3 cell lines and primary human airway epithelial cultures 33 in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with eidd-2801 significantly reduced lung viral loads and improved pulmonary function in sars- and mers-cov mouse models however therapeutic improvement diminished with a delay in treatment initiation time 33 thus an early intervention with eidd-2801 may significantly improve the clinical outcome of covid-19 patients which deserves future investigation mechanism of action moa of nhceidd-2801 is by targeting viral rna-dependent rna polymerase vrdrp to induce error catastrophe beyond the error threshold allowed to sustain rna virus quasispecies 33 nhc incorporation as a c or a u in an anti-sense genome or positive-strand genomicsubgenomic mrna results in increased nucleotide transitions a to g g to a c to u u to c and therefore non-synonymous substitutions a positive correlation between the increased transition rate the frequency of non-synonymous mutations and therapeutic efficacy was observed in mice while moa of remdesivir rdv is via chain termination it can generate resistance see below resistant mutants of rdv are still inhibited by nhc 33 remdesivir rdv is a prodrug of the c-adenosine nucleoside analog 1-cyano 4-aza-79-dideazaadenosine c-nucleoside with broad spectrum antiviral activity against filoviruses paramyxoviruses pneumoviruses and covs including sars-cov mers-cov mouse hepatitis virus mhv oc43 229e porcine and bat cov strains 454647 rdv similar to other nucleoside analogs favipiravir ribavirin and eidd-2801 is converted from its pro-form to the active triphosphate form which inhibits vrdrp by non-obligate rna chain termination 48 rdv is incorporated into nascent viral rna chains by the vrdrp to result in chain termination 49 it displayed potent in vitro antiviral activity towards sars-cov-2 with an ec50 of 077 m in vero e6 cells 45 in vitro remdesivir also displayed potent antiviral activity towards sars-cov-1 ec50 0069 m and mers-cov ec50 0074 m at low micromolar concentrations 47 in non-human primate nhp model of ebov disease intravenous iv administration of 10 mgkg of rdv resulted in persistent active concentration of 10 m in blood which conferred 100 protection against ebov infection effective serum concentration of rdv is therefore likely achieved in nhp and human models in a mouse model of sars-cov-1 disease prophylactic and early therapeutic treatment with 1 dpi caused a reduction in lung viral replication with no defects in pulmonary function 47 therapeutic treatment at 2 dpi also reduced lung viral replication although it did not improve the pulmonary function 47 similarly in a humanized dpp4 transgenic mouse with improved pharmacokinetics for nucleotide prodrugs ces1c hdpp4 prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with rdv reduced lung viral replication and weight loss and improved pulmonary function 50 furthermore in this mouse model rdv provided superior antiviral activity against mers-cov compared with lpvrtv-ifn- combination see below 50 in both sars- and mers-cov disease models although therapeutic treatment initiated after peak lung viral replication and lung damage led to reduced viral loads it failed to reduce lung pathology or clinical disease in a macaque model of mers-cov disease prophylactic treatment successfully reduced viral loads and lung pathology whereas therapeutic treatment during peak viral loads reduced viral loads and lung pathology in 2 out 6 animals 51 hence clinical benefit of rdv is likely limited to prophylaxis and early therapy before viral loads reach high titers 51 resistant variants to rdv were identified through serial passage of mhv in the presence of increasing concentration of rdv which bore two mutations in vrdrp f480lv557l 49 both mutations also conferred resistance in sars-cov-1 indicative of conserved mechanism of action moa towards covs however sars-cov-1 resistance to rdv came with a fitness cost in vivo resulting in attenuated pathogenesis in a mouse model 49 case reports describing successful use of rdv for covid-19 treatment exist and rdv is the most promising drug so far for covid treatment 5253 many randomized clinical trials rcts are presently evaluating the safety and antiviral activity of rdv in patients with mild to moderate or severe covid-19 nct04257656 nct04252664 nct04292730 nct04292899 nct04280705 16 rdv is not currently fda-approved and must be procured for compassionate use only for children 18 yo and pregnant women expanded access or clinical trial enrollment 16 however fda has recently issued an emergency use authorization eua for emergency use of rdv for the treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients upon review of data from the gilead-sponsored open-label trial nct04292899 and an rct carried out by niaid nct04280705 54 ivermectin is an fda-approved anti-parasitic drug that has been known to exhibit broad spectrum antiviral activity against hiv veev 55 dengue virus denv 56 yellow fever virus yfv japanese encephalitis virus jev west nile virus wnv tick borne encephalitis virus tbev 57 and influenza 15 ivermectin targets both viral and host factors for instance ivermectin is known to inhibit classical nuclear transport of viral proteins eg denv ns5 relying on importin  heterodimer 58 as viruses usurp host nuclear transport machinery for transport of viral and cellular factors targeting host machinery is an attractive antiviral approach as the genetic barrier for resistance is much higher for the host compared to the virus 59 on the other hand ivermectin also acted as an uncompetitive helicase inhibitor of flavivirus ns3 helicase and exhibited antiviral effect against all flaviviruses tested 57 recently ivermectin has been found to exhibit antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 ec50 2 m at low micromolar concentration in vitro with no cytotoxic effects 60 although it specifically inhibited viral genome replication potential moa of this finding remains to be investigated by structure-based ab initio drug design combined with virtual screening and high-throughput screening of drugs including the fda-approved drugs clinical trial drugs and others two compounds namely n3 and ebselen were identified to have antiviral activity towards sars-cov-2 61 ebselen and n3 displayed in vitro antiviral activity by inhibiting sars-cov-2 main protease mpro with ec50 values of 467 m and 1677 m respectively 61 non-covalent binding and irreversible covalent modification of mpro were proposed moa of ebselen and n3 respectively therapeutic efficacy of n3 and ebselen against sars-cov-2 needs to be investigated in animal models either alone or in combination therapy lopinavir lpv and ritonavir rtv are fda-approved hiv-1 protease inhibitors that also appear to inhibit 3clpro activity in vitro 6263 lopinavir has poor bioavailability but it is more potent in inhibiting hiv-1 than ritonavir 64 as part of hiv medication lopinavir is used in combination with ritonavir which inhibits the lopinavir metabolizing enzyme cytochrome p450 3a4 and improves its bioavailability 65 lpv but not rtv was shown to have antiviral effect towards sars-cov mers-cov and 229e-gfp with ec50 concentrations of 171 m 8 m and 66 m respectively however lpv displayed no effect towards mers-cov in vero cells but in huh7 cells 63 similarly lpv but not rtv also demonstrated antiviral effect towards sars-cov-2 logec50 261 m in vitro furthermore lpvrtv in combination with ifn- displayed no synergistic antiviral activity against mers-cov compared to ifn- alone ec50  160 vs 175 iuml respectively in calu-3 cells the same study also demonstrated near similar ec50 for lpvrtv ec50 85 m and lpv 116 m suggesting similar activity as observed for sars-cov-1 despite in vitro antiviral activity against mers-cov prophylactic or therapeutic administration of lpvrtv  ifn- in a mouse model failed to reduce the virus titer prevent body weight loss  pulmonary function  inflammatory lung disease in contrast in a common marmoset model of severe mers-cov disease lpvrtv treatment resulted in reduced lung  extrapulmonary tissue viral loads and improved the clinical radiological and pathological features compared to untreated and mycophenolate mofetil-treated marmosets the miracle trial mers-cov infection treated with a combination of lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1b is presently investigating the efficacy of combination therapy of lpvrtv  ifn- compared to placebo in mers-confirmed hospitalized patients provided with standard supportive care 66 in a non-rct comprising sars-cov-1 patients efficacy of lpvrtv in combination with ribavirin was compared to ribavirin and steroids lpvrtv with or without ribavirin treatment induced a milder disease course in terms of diarrhea fever and chest radiographs and a reduction in the number of patients undergoing ards and death 62 notably the clinical benefit of lpvrtv was only demonstrated in patients that received initial treatment with lpvrtv that is the treatment initiated at the time of sars-cov-1 diagnosis currently the efficacy of lpvrtv with or without ribavirin is also being evaluated in sars-cov-2 patients under randomized control trials 16 although the minimum attainable serum concentration of lpvrtv is less than the minimum in vitro ec50 of sars-cov-2 lpvrtv with or without ribavirin at 400 mg  100 mg twice daily is part of the recommended treatment for covid-19 patients in china 16 an open-label rct reported no significant benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir 400100 mg twice daily in sars-cov-2 patients than the standard care in terms of time to clinical improvement mortality at 28 days and throat swab viral loads at various time points 67 furthermore gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea appeared more common in the lpvrtv group than in the standard care group 67 although delayed treatment initiation may partially explain the lack of clinical benefit of lpvrtv a subgroup analysis did not find reduced time to clinical improvement for patients who received lpvrtv within 12 days in singapore 5 of 18 earlier sars-cov-2 patients on supplemental oxygen were treated with lpvrtv the fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days in 3 of 5 patients whereas 2 patients developed progressive respiratory failure four of 5 patients developed nausea vomiting andor diarrhea and 3 had abnormal liver function 68 in korea one patient treated with lpvrtv starting day 10 of illness had reduced viral loads which eventually remained undetectable 69 two case studies comprising chinese patients also reported improved clinical outcomes upon combination therapy with lpvrtv  arbidol  shufengjiedu capsule sfjdc a traditional chinese medicine and lpvrtv 800200 mg daily  methylprednisolone 40 mg daily  ifn-2b 10 million iu daily  ambroxol hcl 7071 it is difficult to interpret the outcomes of these studies due to additional drug therapies varied time points of initial therapy varied degree of severity of illnesses and lack of control or placebo treatment given the significant drugdrug interactions and potential adverse effects hepatotoxicity cautious review of co-administered drugs and monitoring is required prior to use with lpvrtv 64 with the above data lpvrtv has limited advantage over the standard care for sars-cov-2 patients 59 more importantly whether an early therapy initiation leads to improved clinical outcomes compared to rescue andor salvage therapy warrants investigation 16 another second-generation hiv-1 protease inhibitor darunavir demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 ec50 300 m 72 darunavir treatment inhibited sars-cov-2 replication by 280-fold compared to non-treated control 72 an rct of darunavircobicistat is currently underway in china 16 chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that is being investigated as a potential therapeutic for sars-cov-2-infected patients 16 chloroquine prevents endosomal acidification required for s protein conformational changes and thereby blocks fusion of viral and cellular membranes 16 in addition chloroquine also interferes with glycosylation of viral entry receptors chloroquine demonstrated potent in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 ec50 113 m at low micromolar concentration in vero e6 cells 456273 this concentration is within the ec50 range reported for sars-cov-1 ec50 188 m and mers-cov ec50 30 m in vero e6 and huh7 cell lines respectively 63 these findings have prompted the use of chloroquine in numerous clinical trials with covid-19 patients gao et al reported that thus far results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting a virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course according to the news briefing 74 severe adverse reactions to chloroquine phosphate were not noted in the aforementioned patients although these preliminary results were promising drug supply issues and cardiotoxicity concerns limited the use of chloroquine in the us 64 an alternative to chloroquine known as hydroxychloroquine is being pursued for the effective treatment of covid-19 patients hydroxychloroquine ec50 072 m exhibited a 76-fold greater potency than chloroquine ec50 547 m in sars-cov-2-infected vero cells 75 in contrast chloroquine ec50 65  32 m exhibited approximately a 5-fold greater potency compared to hydroxychloroquine ec50 34  5 m in sars-cov-1-infected vero cells 73 a non-randomized clinical trial comprising 36 patients 20 hydroxychloroquine and 16 control aged above 12 and pcr for sars-cov-2 was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of hydroxychloroquine viral clearance in nasopharyngeal swabs was considered the primary endpoint by day 6 70 1420 and 125 216 of hydroxychloroquine and control patients respectively had viral clearance 76 in the same study addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine in 6 patients resulted in superior viral clearance 66 100 compared with hydroxychloroquine alone 814 57 76 in another prospective trial 30 randomized patients were split in a 11 fashion and treated with hydroxychloroquine daily for 5 days  the standard care supportive care ifn and other antivirals or the standard care alone 77 no difference in virological clearance was noted with 867 and 933 clearance observed for the hydroxychloroquine  the standard care group and the standard care group respectively limited sample size and cardiotoxicity concerns call for additional studies before adopting this regimen for therapy an observational study of effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine reported a lack of higher or lower risk of intubation or death among patients 78 there are several rcts presently examining the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients 1664 cov infections are typically associated with attenuated innate interferon induction and delayed pro-inflammatory response in hae cultures sars-cov-1 mers-cov and hcov-229e infections resulted in no earlier transcriptional induction of interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines at 3 6 and 12 hours post infection hpi 79 in calu-3 cells unlike mers-cov sars-cov-1 and -229e the infection caused slightly higher induction of ifn- at 30 hpi 79 mers-cov however is highly sensitive to the antiviral effects of ifn unlike sars-cov-1 in vitro antiviral activity of ifn- ec50  137 unitsml is 16- 41- 83- and 117-fold higher than of ifn- 2b ifn- ifn-universal type 1 and ifn-2a respectively 79 like mers-cov sars-cov-2 is highly sensitive to the antiviral effects of recombinant type i ifn in vero cells with a 3040-fold reduction in viral titers 80 although sars-cov-2 blocked early induction of type i ifn a significant induction of ifn and downstream stat1 phosphorylation was noticed by 48 hpi in calu-3 cells 80 the reduced capacity of sars-cov-2 to interfere with induction and action of type i ifn are attributed to the loss of orf3b and truncationchanges in orf6 respectively 80 for sars-cov-1 orf3b and orf6 disrupt irf3 phosphorylation and karyopherin function respectively resulting in the attenuated induction of type i ifn and blocked nuclear transport of stat1 80 in common marmosets infected with mers-cov clinical improvements with ifn- were similar to the lpvrtv ones described above 81 similar to in vitro findings loss of type i ifn signaling had no significant impact on sars-cov-1 disease in vivo indicative of its insensitivity to the antiviral effects of type i ifn 82 an interventional study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lpvrtv in adult hospitalized patients with sars-cov-2 infection is being pursued in china 64 due to the lack of clinical trial data and conflicting in vitro and in vivo data interferons are not currently recommended for sars-cov-2 treatment 64 arbidol umifenovir is a more promising repurposed drug which targets the s proteinace2 interaction thereby inhibiting viral fusion and entry 16 although not fda-approved it is currently approved in russia and china for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and has in vitro antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 ec50 1030 m 83 a non-randomized study of 67 covid-19 patients indicated that treatment with arbidol for a median duration of 9 days was associated with lower mortality 0 036 vs 16 531 and higher discharge rate compared with patients who did not receive it 84 there are ongoing rcts that are currently evaluating arbidol for covid-19 treatment in china ribavirin is a guanosine analog with anti-viral effects against several viral infections including respiratory syncitial virus rsv hepatitis c virus hcv herpes simplex virus hsv-1 ribavirin displayed no antiviral effect towards mers-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro at concentrations below 100 m in vero e6 cells 45 another study reported conflicting findings where ribavirin displayed antiviral effects logec50 999 m towards mers-cov replication in vero e6 cells 85 vero cells are comparably inefficient at converting ribavirin into its mono- and tri-phosphate forms therefore not a relevant cell line to study the antiviral effects of nucleoside analogs including ribavirin 86 a separate study identified better responsiveness of mers-cov-infected llc-mk2 cells to the antiviral effects of ribavirin ec50 1633 gml compared to vero cells ec50 4145 gml 87 similarly sensitivity of sars-cov-1 to ribavirin also appears to be cell line-dependent with higher concentration ec50 50 gml reported to be effective in vero cells 87 however these concentrations exceeded the attainable serum concentrations in humans and therefore ribavirin use may not be effective towards cov infections in human 64 a combination of ifn- and ribavirin was previously reported to have synergistic and additive effect towards sars- and mers-cov infections respectively this combination also reduced virus replication downregulated host inflammatory response and improved clinical outcome in mers-cov-infected macaques 88 however in a small-scale clinical trial comprising 5 critically ill mers patients with multiple comorbidities delayed initiation of combination therapy on or after the 19th day of admission resulted in fatal outcome in all patients 89 in addition ribavirin usage is limited in patients with respiratory disorders as it can lead to a marked fall in hemoglobin levels and anemia 64 in line with this a meta-analysis on sars-cov-1 and mers-cov patient case studies has found limited if any efficacy of ribavirin in outcomes of patients with highly pathogenic coronavirus respiratory syndromes due to the lack of in vitro efficacy toxicity profile and poor clinical outcomes ribavirin was not considered a promising candidate for further evaluation by the who research and development plan for sars-cov-2 64 nitazoxanide 2-acetyloxy-n-5-nitro-2-thiazolyl benzamide is an fda-approved broad-spectrum anti-parasitic compound effective against intestinal protozoal and helminthic infections specifically giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium parvum 90 recently this compound has been shown to have a broad spectrum antiviral activity against multiple viruses including influenza virus 91 rotavirus 92 astrovirus 93 norovirus 94 japanese encephalitis virus jev 95 rubella virus 96 zika virus zikv 97 hepatitis c virus hcv 98 and hepatitis b virus hbv 99 nitazoxanide displayed potent antiviral activity towards covs mhv-a59 bovine coronavirus strain l9 bcov-l9 and human enteric coronavirus 4408 hecov-4408 propagated in mouse astrocytoma dbt and fibroblast 17cl-1 cells at a low micromolar concentration ec50 03 gml 100 similarly llc-mk2 cells nitazoxanide and its active metabolite tizoxanide displayed potent antiviral activity against mers-cov ec50 092 and 083 gml respectively 99 effective concentration of nitazoxanide against sars cov-2 grown in vero e6 cells is within the range observed for other viruses ec50 212 m 45 current research indicates potential mechanism of antiviral activity through the induction of the interferon response via activation of protein kinase r or disruption of the unfolded protein response 101 clinical trials have successfully demonstrated its effectiveness in treating influenza virus norovirus and rotavirus hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus in a phase 2b3 study for the outpatient management of influenza a treatment dose of 600 mg nitazoxanide by mouth bid was associated with a 173hr reduction in time to alleviation of symptoms when compared with placebo 102 in a phase 2 rct comprising hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory illnesses that are mainly caused by respiratory viruses nitazoxanide failed to reduce the time to hospital discharge or the time to symptom alleviation 103 although nitazoxanide displayed in vitro antiviral activity towards sars-cov-2 prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy studies in sars-cov-2 animal models are necessary to determine its benefit to the clinic homoharringtonine is a plant alkaloid known to exhibit potent anti-viral effects against herpesviruses varicella zoster virus or vzv hsv-1 pseudorabies virus or prv coronaviruses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus or pedv mhv rhabdoviruses vesicular stomatitis virus or vsv and rabies virus and other viruses hepatitis virus newcastle disease virus and echovirus 1 46 omacetaxine is a semi-synthetic form of homoharringtonine that is fda-approved for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia it targets the phosphorylated form of eif4e s209 resulting in the degradation of phosphorylated eif4e to inhibit protein translation resulting in loss of proteins mcl-1 and c-myc required for the survival of leukemia cells 46 interestingly homoharringtonine has displayed antiviral effects towards sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells at a much lower effective concentration ec50 210 m than remdesivir and lpv 17 antiviral effect of hht on viral infections is presumably associated with its action on phosphorylated eif4e repurposing hht for sars-cov-2 treatment may represent an attractive strategy and deserves further investigation emetine is an alkaloid derived from ipecac and is fda-approved for the treatment of ameobiasis emetine was demonstrated to have anti-viral effects towards a wide range of dna and rna viruses including bovine herpes virus-2 hsv-2 human cytomegalovirus buffalo poxvirus zikv ebov hiv-1 newcastles disease virus or ndv pestes des petits ruminants virus rift valley fever virus influenza and rabies virus 46101 in particular it has antiviral effects towards hcov-oc43 hcov-nl43 sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 mers-cov and mhv-a59 in vitro at low micromolar concentrations 46101 emetine therefore is a broad spectrum cov inhibitor emetine inhibits viral protein translation by blocking the 40s ribosomal protein s14 in host cells additional mechanisms of emetine include blocking hiv reverse transcriptase inhibiting viral polymerases trypanosomes killing through dna intercalation and lysosomal malfunction emetine inhibited mers-cov entry into dpp4-expressing huh75 cells possibly by affecting lysosomal function 101 corticosteroids are used to mitigate the host inflammatory response which contributes to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in severe pneumonia cases however the benefit of these agents outweighs adverse effects that include delayed viral clearance and enhanced risk of secondary infection 64 presently the data on corticosteroid use in sars-cov-1 mers-cov and sars-cov-2 patients are inconclusive and confounding with no data from rcts in an uncontrolled and non-randomized study 95107 888 of sars-cov-1 patients treated with high-dose methylprednisolone recovered from progressive lung disease after the first week of illness 104 two studies documented evidence of possible adverse effects from corticosteroids use in sars-cov-1 patients 105106 in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial patients that received corticosteroids within the first week of illness documented delayed viral clearance with significantly higher viral rna loads in plasma during second and third week of illness 105 in another retrospective case-controlled study patients with psychosis who also had a familial history of psychosis received higher cumulative doses of steroids than patients without psychosis 106 while one report documented an increase in the composite endpoint of icu admission or death 107 another report demonstrated decreased mortality in critically ill patients 108 among mers-cov icu patients those that received corticosteroid therapy n  151309 documented delayed clearance of viral rna with no difference in 90-day mortality after accounting for time-varying exposure 109 finally a recent observational study indicated a reduced risk of mortality with the receipt of corticosteroids in sars-cov-2 patients with ards 110 given the adverse effects and a lack of consistent proven benefit clinicians must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of corticosteroid use on an individual patient level 64 tocilizumab is an fda-approved humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits il-6 receptor in membrane-bound or soluble form it was originally approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra but has been used in patient therapy of cytokine-release syndrome crs following chimeric antigen receptor t cell car-t therapy 16 il-6 is a key driver of dysregulated inflammation that contributes to pulmonary pathology and organ damage observed in covid-19 patients 66 theoretically antibodies targeting its receptor could dampen il-6 signal transduction and downstream inflammation thus improving clinical outcomes in a limited cohort of 21 covid-19 patients receipt of tocilizumab resulted in clinical improvement in 91 of patients as assessed by fever resolution chest tightness relief lung opacity resolution on ct improved respiratory function and no drug reactions 111 in 562 of patients lymphocyte and c-reactive protein crp levels returned to normal within 5 days 111 a recent study conducted single cell rna-seq in patient blood cell populations isolated longitudinally at various stages beginning tocilizumab treatment with 12 hr 5th and 7th day from two severe patients 112 in monocytic subpopulation a significant downregulation of processes contributing to inflammatory storm was noted upon tocilizumab treatment 112 like tocilizumab sarilumab is another il-6 receptor antagonist fda-approved for ra treatment currently rcts of tocilizumab in combination with favipiravir nct04310228 and sarilumab nct04315298 are being tested in rcts the use of convalescent plasma cp from patients recovered from viral infections has been in practice for more than 100 years and has been used successfully for sars-cov-1 mers-cov ebov and h1n1 influenza 113 theoretically cp obtained from recovered patients contain a large quantity of neutralizing antibodies nabs capable of clearing virus and virus-infected cells 114 in this regard nab titer in cp and cp therapy initiation time are critical factors that needs to be considered 114 firstly in sars- and mers-cov patients the duration of nabs is short-lived with a decline within 3-4 months after disease process therefore only plasma from recently recovered patients remains to be effective for cp therapy secondly in sars-cov patients improved outcome was observed upon cp therapy before 14 days post onset of illness dpoi compared to rescue andor salvage in a recent pilot clinical trial comprising 10 severe covid-19 patients given maximal supportive care and antiviral agents one dose of cp 200 ml transfusion median time of transfusion 165 dpoi resulted in negative viral rna levels with an improvement in clinical symptoms pulmonary function and paraclinical criteria increased lymphocyte counts oxygen saturation and decreased crp 114 no serious adverse reactions were noted among cp treated patients 114 these findings also point that inflammation and overreaction of the immune system that contribute to ards and ali in severe patients can be alleviated by cp therapy 114 in summary sars-cov-2 is a highly transmissible cov that led to the current pandemic and disruption of human activity there is presently a limited understanding of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis mostly extrapolated from sars-cov-1 and mers-cov studies while these studies are useful development of an animal model that faithfully recapitulates sars-cov-2 pathogenesis in humans will allow identification of viral and host factors critical for covid-19 furthermore animal model allows researchers to carry out the immediate task of developing and testing antiviral interventions that will eventually control covid-19 in humans in the present summary we detailed the current understanding of sars-cov-2 a result of incredible efforts of researchers worldwide  susceptibility of tree shrew to sars-cov-2 infection yuan zhao junbin wang kuang 1 jingwen xu mengli yang chunxia ma siwen zhao jingmei li haiting long kaiyun ding jiahong gao jiansheng liu haixuan wang haiyan li yun yang wenhai yu jing yang yinqiu zheng daoju wu shuaiyao lu hongqi liu xiaozhong peng  since sars-cov-2 became a pandemic event in the world it has not only caused huge economic losses but also a serious threat to global public health many scientific questions about sars-cov-2 and covid-19 were raised and urgently need to be answered including the susceptibility of animals to sars-cov-2 infection here we tested whether tree shrew an emerging experimental animal domesticated from wild animal is susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection no clinical signs were observed in sars-cov-2 inoculated tree shrews during this experiment except the increasing body temperature above 39  particular in female animals during infection low levels of virus shedding and replication in tissues occurred in all three age groups each of which showed his own characteristics histopathological examine revealed that pulmonary abnormalities were mild but the main changes although slight lesions were also observed in other tissues in summary tree shrew is not susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection and may not be a suitable animal for covid-19 related researches  the manifestation caused by sars-cov-2 infection is known as covid-19 since the first case of sars-cov-2 infection reported in wuhan china it has been about five months it causes a pandemic with more than three million confirmed cases and nearly 230 thousand deaths in addition to huge economic losses to the world 1  nevertheless it is widely considered to be controllable according to the experiences from china and other countries however there are still some critical aspects that need to be further investigated in patients such as cytokine storm immunopathogenic damages tropism of sars-cov-2 and other sources of sars-cov-2 infection besides bat and pangolin that are regarded as the origin of sars-cov-2 2 3 4  from these points of view studies of animals become essentially important in fact several animal models of covid-19 have been recently reported in murine 5  hamster 6  ferret 7  and non-human primate 8 9 10 11  which recapitulate covid-19 from different aspects in terms of susceptibility to sars-cov-2 in addition to these experimental animals domestic animals and pets are also investigated 12  cats as a popular pet could be an important source of sars-cov-2 infection due to their close relationship with human beings the tree shrew also known as tupaia belangeris is genetically demonstrated to be close to primates 13 14 15  therefore it is being developed to be an experimental animal that could be an alternative to primates in biomedical research due to its unique characteristics 16  in fact tree shrew has been used for several animal models of virus infections including hepatitis b 17  influenza virus 18 19 20  and zika virus 21  however tupaia model of high pathogenic viruses has not been reported yet including sars-cov-2 several reports show that sars-cov-2 may originate from wild animals 2 3 4  replication of sars-cov-2 in tree shrews is still unknown in this study in order to determine the possibility of tree shrew as a covid-19 model we tested the susceptibility of tree shrew to sars-cov-2 infection we found that sars-cov-2 had limited replication and shedding in tree shrew and cause mild histopathology but no typical symptom is observed in infected tree shrew as reported in covid-19 patients tree shew tupaia belangeri chinensis were bred in the institute of medical biology chinese academy of medical sciences after quarantine and before infection animals were transferred to absl-3 facility and housed in the isolated ventilation cages with 12-hour light and 12-hour dark all animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of institute  procedures in this study are outlined in figure 1  total 24 tree shrews were used in this study and divided into three groups with consideration of gender and age including young 6 months to 12 months adult 2 years to 4 years and old 5 years to 7 years groups each group contains half male and half female animals after baseline data and samples were collected right before virus inoculation each of tree shrew was inoculated with 1 ml 10 6 pfu sars-cov-2 nasally 500uleach nostril clinical signs were recorded daily including behavior drinking and eating breathing feces and so on body temperature was also monitored every other day post viral inoculation at the same time points nasal throat and anal swab and blood samples were collected viral genomic rna in these samples was quantified by rt-qpcr using virus-specific primers and probes on day 14 post viral inoculation six animals were anesthetized bled and necropsied after gross lesions were recorded tissue samples were harvested for analysis of viral loads and histopathology rnasednase-free h2o was used to elute rna from the column 75 l of each rna was analyzed in each well of 384-well plate by one-step rt-qpcr using gene-specific primers and probe as described before 8  tissue samples of heart liver spleen lung kidney weasand stomach small intestine rectum pancreas brain spinal cord uterus penis testis cecum were harvested and fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 5 m of sections followed by haematoxylin and eosin he staining slides were scanned with 3dhistech and inspected by the experienced pathologist using the manufacture provided software caseviewer during the period of this study we couldnt observe any other clinical sign besides change of body temperature after sars-cov-2 inoculation body temperature of tree shrew was monitored every other day among three ages of virus-inoculated tree shrews all young tree shrews except ts30 showed increasing body temperature there are 5 young tree shrews 2 males 3 females with peak body temperature on 6 or 8-day post inoculation dpi followed by gradual decline the peaks of body temperatures in two female ts31 ts34 and one male ts28 young tree shrews were above 39  figure 1a  in addition among old tree shrews one male ts1 and three female ts8 ts10 and ts12 had the peak body temperature 39  on 4 or 6 dpi however only one adult female ts20 showed the peak body temperature 392  on 6 dpi  figure 1b  c  these results indicated that youngold tree shrews and female tree shrews showed higher sensitivity to sars-cov-2 infection as compared to adult and male tree shrews on 6 dpi we could detect genomic rna of sars-cov-2 in 5 nasal swabs 3 throat swabs 2 anal swabs and one serum sample from young tree shrews in 2 nasal swabs from adult tree shrews and in 2 nasal swabs 1 anal swab from old tree shrew table 1  notably four samples nasal throat anal swabs and blood collected from young tree shrew ts27 all showed virus rna positive the highest copy number of viral genomic rna was 10 592 ml in nasal swab from the young tree shrew ts27 on 8 dpi there were four young three adult and four old tree shrew with viral rna positive in some of samples the highest level of virus shedding was still from the young tree shrew ts28 on 12 dpi the young tree shrews showed the decreasing virus shedding and only the animal ts27 had rna-positive throat swab in contrast increasing number of old tree shrews had detectable viral rna in nasal throat and anal swabs table 1  from these findings we deduced that young tree shrew was more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection than adult and old tree shrew however old tree shrew and adult tree shrews gave longer duration of virus shedding than young tree shrews moreover we noticed that more male animals of adult and old tree shrews showed virus shedding than females in order to determine viral load in tissue samples we necropsied 8 animals from 3 ages of tree shrews on 14 dpi sixteen major tissues were collected from each animal viral genomic rna was quantified as described in methods in three young tree shrews ts26 ts27 and ts28 we could detect viral rna from only lungs in ts26 and ts27 but not in any tissue from ts28 although these animal had higher number of viral genomic copy numbers at the earlier stage of sars-cov-2 infection in contrast in the adult tree shrew ts16 six tissues were rna positive with the highest number 10 908 ml in pancreas the female adult tree shrew ts14 had viral rna-positive uterus in addition to lung and pancreas the other four necropsied tree shrews showed viral rna-negative results in all 16 tissues table s1  to determine the host response to sars-cov-2 infection we examined sixteen tissues from each of 24 tree shrews necropsied on 14 dpi and 16 dpi it is clinically reported that old covid-19 patients show high morbidity and mortality which is thought to be associated with the comorbidities 25 firstly more young and old tree shrews showed increasing body temperature than adult tree shrews  figure 1  secondly young tree shrews had more severe virus shedding at the early stage of virus infection than the other animals and old tree shrews had a longer duration of virus shedding than others  table 1  one of young male tree shrew ts27 didnt have significant increasing body temperature but virus shedding from nasal throat anal and serum was detected on 6 dpi these results indicated the asymptomatic infection of sars-cov-2 in young tree shrews although sars-cov-2 infection didnt cause severe disease in all three ages of tree shrews viral replication and mild histopathological changes were still observed in this study particularly we found the severe lung abnormality of histology in one adult tree shrew which may be caused by immunopathological responses such as cytokine storm 28 table 3  these results should further be confirmed via nucleic acid in situ hybridization immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescent staining in conclusion tree shrew is not as susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection as the reported animal models of covid-19 though limited replication of sars-cov-2 and mild histopathology was detected and observed in some tissues in addition commercial reagents and completely domesticated tree shrews are very limited therefore tree shrew is not a suitable experimental animal for covid-19 related studies however it should be very important to investigate whether wild tree shrews in nature are infected by or asymptomatic carrier of sars-cov-2 none declared  total 24 tree shrews tupaia

evaluating the evidence krishna sriram ph  d paul insel a   m d  background concerns have been raised regarding the safety of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs in patients with covid-19 based on the hypothesis that such medications may raise expression of ace2 the receptor for sars-cov-2 we conducted a literature review of studies n12 in experimental animals and human subjects n11 and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of aceis and arbs on ace2 expression we prioritized studies that assessed ace2 protein expression data measured directly or inferred from ace2 activity assays the findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ace2 expression in response to treatment with aceis or arbs controlsham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies those studies that report increases in ace2 expression tend to involve acute injury models andor higher doses than typically administered to patients data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of aceisarbs does not increase ace2 expression  medrxiv preprint 14 han sx he gm wang t et al losartan attenuates chronic cigarette smoke exposure-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats possible involvement of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 toxicology and applied pharmacology 2010 may 152451100-7 15 wsten-van asperen rm lutter r specht pa et al acute respiratory distress syndrome leads to reduced ratio of aceace2 activities and is prevented by angiotensin-1-7 or an angiotensin ii receptor antagonist  there has been much recent debate regarding the use of ace inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs in covid-19 patients 1 2 3 4 5  thus prompting concern among patients and health care providers the basis of this concern involves whether aceisarbs increase expression of ace2 the primary cellular receptor for the sars-cov-2 virus and thereby may increase severity of the infection here we review key literature regarding this possibility by assessing studies conducted in experimental animals primarily rats and humans we focus our discussion on studies for which ace2 protein data are available as tissue ace2 mrna expression appears to only weakly correlate with protein expression as shown from data in the human protein atlas 6 proteinatlasorg results from human renal samples 7 and animal studies discussed below eg 8 9   we focused our assessment on studies that evaluated ace2 levels in tissuescells involved in infection by sars-cov-1 or sars-cov-2 data from 12 animal studies are summarized in table 1  which shows the effect of aceiarb use on ace2 protein expressionactivity in animals primarily in rats we used conversion factors based on the principles of allometric scaling to evaluate doses in animals relative to their use in humans 10  for studies in which this was relevant we used the hed human equivalent dose assuming a 60 kg human 10  for doses of aceiarbs we obtained recommended doses for humans using approved labelling from the food and drug administration fda website fdagov these recommended human doses are provided in table 2  for most of the drugs the maximum doses indicated in table 2 are seldom achieved in humans such that treatment of animals with equivalent or larger doses especially in models of acute dosing as in refs 15 and 19 discussed in table 1  raise concern about their relevance to aceiarb administration to patients including in the setting of covid-19 in summary 3 studies 8 11 19 in animals reported an increase in all treatment groups of ace2 protein expressionactivity with aceiarb treatment but in one such study 8 combined arbacei treatment did not show this effect the other two studies reported relatively small effects  40 increase in ace2 protein expression in controlsham animals all of these studies used high doses of aceisarbs as noted above by contrast 6 studies 9 12 14 16 17 20 found little or no change in ace2 expression with aceiarb treatment in 3 studies 13 15 19  treatment with aceiarb had no effect or a decrease in ace2 protein expressionactivity in controlsham animals increased ace2 expression was only observed following experimental exposure such as lung injury mi etc in nearly all studies that reported an increase in ace2 doses of aceisarbs used were greater than equivalent doses typically administered to patients we identified only one study 13 in which aceiarb use increased ace2 protein expression at doses typical of human use albeit these changes only occurred after exposure to acute injury subtotal nephrectomy overall the studies with experimental animals do not provide consistent evidence for an effect of arbacei administration on ace2 protein expression especially in contexts that model drug administration in humans evidence of changes in ace2 protein in human subjectspatients  table 3  are derived from studies that assessed ace2 protein concentration or enzymatic activity in urine or serumplasma of the 10 studies summarized in table 3  7 showed no effect of arbacei use on ace2 protein levels one study 26 documented a small increase in serum ace2 attributable to use of aceis among type-1 diabetic patients but found no effect from use of arbs another study 23 found a slightly larger proportional decrease in urinary ace2 in patients with type-2 diabetes using aceisarbs but did not distinguish between effects from use of aceis or arbs in one study 22 the investigators observed that subjects using the arb olmesartan had increased ace2 levels but several other arbs and aceis had no effect besides these quantitative data other results regarding ace2 protein expression generated from immunohistochemical analysis in kidneys 31  indicated no acei-dependent effect together these results imply a lack of association between ace2 protein expression and the use of arbs or aceis and support the idea that aceisarbs are unlikely to raise ace2 and be harmful in the context of covid-19 infection what would constitute strong supportive evidence for the hypothesis that aceiarb usage is a risk factor in the setting of sars-cov2 infection findings to help support that hypothesis would include 1 replication of a prominent effect in multiple animal studies and models 2 evidence that tissues with low expression of ace2 have prominent increases in its expression and activity following aceiarb treatment 3 data documenting that increases in ace2 expression in response to aceiarb treatment enhance the ability of the sars-cov-2 virus to infect cells 4 findings from human studies of statistically significant relationships between aceiarb usage and ace2 expressionactivity 5 epidemiological data showing that covid-19 patients administered aceisarbs have increased morbidity and mortality ideally with a dose-response relationship for such outcomes how well do the available data provide such evidence 1 the hypothesis that ace2 expression increases with aceiarb use is not supported by the plurality of available data from animal studies 2 there is no available evidence for de novo expression of ace2 expression in response to aceisarbs in tissues with low expression 3 the affinity of sars-cov-2 for ace2 is very high 4-fold greater than sars-cov-1 32  it is unclear if small or modest perturbations in ace2 expression impact the infectivity of sars-cov-2 moreover ace2 levels may decrease with age 3334 and diabetes 35  yet elderlydiabetic subjects are more vulnerable than younger individuals to covid-19 36  modest changes in ace2 expression may not meaningfully impact on the high infectivity of sars-cov-2 in host tissues 4 data from human studies suggest that treatment with aceisarbs produces little or no effect on urinary or circulating ace2 levels as a caveat changes in ace2 levels in serum or urine may not reflect changes in tissue 5 epidemiological studies have not assessed outcomes in matched groups of patients infected with sars-cov-2 who have or have not been taking aceisarbs based on the data summarized above we conclude that current evidence especially from human studies  table  3  does not support the idea that treatment with aceis or arbs produces pathophysiologically relevant increases in ace2 protein abundance the hypothesis that the use of these drugs increases sars-cov-2 virus infectivity andor severity of covid-19 is therefore not supported by the available evidence it would thus seem prudent for patients to continue receiving these medications as recently

common worldwide and impact human and animal health with important economic consequences although most symptoms of respiratory virus infection are related to airway inflammation and focused on the respiratory tract extra respiratory organs are also targeted by these viruses including the central nervous system bohmwald et al 2018 the recent pandemic of coronavirus disease emerging in december 2019 covid-19 has been accompanied by a prevalence of olfaction alteration indeed approximately 60 of patients infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 that is the cause of covid-19 suffered from mild hyposmia to total loss of olfactory capacities anosmia spinato et al 2020 the origin of these alterations remains to be established olfaction starts with olfactory sensory neurons osn located in the olfactory epithelium oe present in the most dorsal part of the nasal cavity the oe along with the underlying lamina propria constitutes the olfactory mucosa osns have cilia in direct contact with the environment in order to detect odorants they are therefore accessible to respiratory viruses and some of these viruses are able to infect the osn and reach the central nervous system by following the olfactory nerves which project to the olfactory bulbs bryche et al 2019b forrester et al 2018 interestingly sars-cov-1 netland et al 2008 was described as a virus able to use this olfactory pathway ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was characterized as the main entrance receptor for sars-cov-2 letko et al 2020 similarly to sars-cov-1 sars-cov-1 was described as being able to enter the central nervous system in mice transgenic for human ace2 netland et al 2008 in this model the brain infection starts from the olfactory bulbs and while the authors did not look for a potential infection of the olfactory mucosa it may be that sars-cov-1 could infect olfactory sensory neurons reaching the brain through the olfactory bulbs where these neurons project forrester et al 2018 if sars-cov-2 infection follows the same pathway anosmia following sars-cov-2 infection may correlate with the encephalopathies observed in some covid-19 patients roe 2020

al 2020 anosmia in covid-19 patients provided impetus to study the expression profile of ace2 in the nasal cavity several studies show that ace2 is present in the oe but expressed in sustentacular cells the supporting cells surrounding the olfactory neurons rather than in the olfactory neurons themselves bilinska et al 2020 fodoulian et al 2020 however a recent study suggested that sars-cov-2 could infect olfactory sensory neurons in hamsters sia et al 2020 in the present work we focused on the pathological impact of two different sars-cov-2 strains on the nasal cavity and the central

we observed that a large proportion of the oe was infected at 2 dpi which decreased at 4 dpi and subsequently disappeared fig 2

fig 1
c in order to identify which cells were infected with sars-cov-2 in the oe we performed double staining of the olfactory mucosa with omp and ck18 specific markers of mature osns and sustentacular cells respectively while most of the cells infected with sars-cov2 expressed ck18 as well we were not able to find any viral antigen in omp expressing cells these results show that sars-cov-2 infects sustentacular cells but not osns fig 2 interestingly we observed staining of omp ck18 sars-cov-2 as well as hoechst in the lumen of the nasal cavity indicating that part of the oe containing infected and non-infected cells was desquamated in response to sars-cov-2 infection in order to understand the extent of the damage of the osns following sars-cov-2 infection we examined the preservation of the osn cilia layer which contains all the transduction complex allowing the detection of odours dibattista et al 2017 we performed immunohistochemistry against golf fig 3
a b a specific g protein from this complex jones and reed 1989 we quantified the percentage of septal olfactory epithelium containing golf staining in the apical part of the oe fig 3
c and scored globally the quantity of golf staining in the oe fig 3
d while the golf signal was completely preserved in control animals it quickly diminished in sars-cov-2-infected animals without any clear improvement from 2 dpi to 10 dpi we observed a small recovery of the golf signal only in the septal part of the oe 14 dpi with the ucn19 virus we finally examined the presence of immune cells in the olfactory mucosa using iba1 as a specific marker of monocytemacrophage lineage bryche et al 2019a fig 4
a in control animals iba1 cells were mainly localized in the lamina propria and exhibited a ramified morphology with many processes fig 4
b which is typical of a resting phenotype mori et al 2002 we measured the presence of iba1 cell fig 4
c and scored the presence and shape of iba1 cells in the oe and the lamina propria separately fig 4
d while iba1 cells were mostly absent from the oe and moderately present in the lamina propria in control animals their presence was drastically increased up to 4 dpi in infected animals both in the oe and the lamina propria fig 4
a b furthermore iba1 cells were mostly of amoeboid shape which is typical of an activated state at 2 to 7 dpi fig 4
b we also observed iba1 cells in the lumen of the nasal cavity in the cellular aggregates containing sars-cov-2 fig 4
a immune cell infiltration gradually diminished this reduction was first observed at 10 dpi in the oe but was not seen in the lamina propria before 14 dpi at 14 dpi it reached the mock level both in the oe and the lamina propria for both virus strains fig 4
c d in the present study we focused on the impact of sars-cov-2 in the nasal cavity and central nervous system using the golden syrian hamster as a model we chose to work with 2 different isolates of sars-cov-2 with the potential to obtain slightly different strain behaviour we explored the kinetic of the impact of these two different isolates due to the difficulty of designing experiments during the covid-19 pandemic we examined only one animal per virus strain and per time point overall our results are globally consistent for both viruses and the kinetics of the different measured parameters were always following consistent evolution from 2 dpi to 14 dpi while these results require confirmation with larger animal groups they provide a qualitative overview of the impact of sars-cov-2 on the nasal cavity which could explain the anosmia observed in covid-19 patients indeed according to our results sustentacular cells are rapidly infected by sars-cov-2 and this infection is associated with a massive recruitment of immune cells in the oe and lamina propria which could induce a rapid disorganization of the oe structure by causing immunopathology this hypothesis is consistent with elevated level of tnf observed in oe samples from covid-19 suffering patients torabi et al 2020 however further experiments are required to identify the importance of the damage directly induce by the virus replication this disorganization is followed by a massive destruction of the oe which is released in the lumen of the nasal cavity taking away most of the cilia layer of the osns in the absence of these cilia the olfactory transduction is not functional and thus the olfactory capacity of the animals should be impaired until the oe regenerates supplementary behavioural experiments would be required to demonstrate an anosmia in the infected hamsters however most odours recognition behavioural tasks rely on hungry or thirsty animals witt et al 2009 and thus may be biased by the impact of sars-cov-2 on animal feeding behaviour at 14 dpi the thickness of the oe is already recovering to approximately 50 of the mock condition and some functional cilia reappear such kinetics is consistent with the observed recovery of anosmia in covid-19 patients indeed recent studies highlight a relatively fast recovery 15 days dellera et al 2020 meini et al 2020 compatible with the observed partial recovery of the oe in hamsters 14 dpi sars-cov-2 is more deadly in men than women jin et al 2020 but this is not clear yet if the anosmia affects both gender equally dellera et al 2020 meini et al 2020 however the recovery of olfaction seems longer in women dellera et al 2020 meini et al 2020 as we only studied female hamsters more experiments are needed to decipher a gender impact of sars-cov-2 in the oe we identify sustentacular cells as the main target cells of sars-cov-2 in the oe this observation is consistent with the expression pattern of ace2 mainly present in these cells along with the facilitating protease tmprss2 bilinska et al 2020 fodoulian et al 2020 two recent reports indicate that olfactory neurons in hamster sia et al 2020 and respiratory cells in ferret ryan et al 2020 may be the target of sars-cov-2 but these studies did not focus on the nasal cavity and they did not use double staining to clearly identify the infected cells in the oe we observed that sars-cov-2 can infect other non-neuronal cells in the nasal cavity notably in the epithelium covering the lumen of stenos gland which is however poorly described in the literature bryche et al 2019b further studies are required to clearly identify the other non-neuronal cells infected by sars-cov-2 in the nasal cavity which may facilitate the systemic infection of other cell types and tissues lower in the respiratory airways double staining to co-localize ace2 with sars-cov-2 presence would also improve our understanding of the importance of ace2 in sars-cov-2 cellular susceptibility we did not observe any presence of the virus in the brain notably in the olfactory bulbs where osns projects and in the piriform cortex where the olfactory signal is integrated we also focused on the hypothalamus which contains ace2 expressing neurons mukerjee et al 2019 as well as on the respiratory centres of the brainstem as the latter are suspected to be infected in covid-19 patients suffering from heavy respiratory disorders gandhi et al 2020 our lack of virus detection in the central nervous system may be due to the low number of animal examined but nevertheless we can rule out a systematic and important infection of the brain following sars-cov-2 infection in hamster this is consistent with a recent review of the literature which failed to indicate any central nervous manifestation of sars-cov-2 presence in human central nervous system romoli et al 2020 however the neurotropic ability of sars-cov-2 remains controversial wang et al 2020 interestingly sars-cov-1 has been shown to be neurotropic only using ace2 humanized mice the osns of these mice must also express ace2 as it is under the control of k18 ubiquitous promoter netland et al 2008 sars-cov-1 may thus infect osns expressing ectopic ace2 and the observation of presence of the virus in the brain may not be relevant for a more physiological model in our model we observed a fast desquamation of the oe following sars-cov-2 infection of sustentacular cells further studies are required to decipher whether it could be an anti-viral strategy to limit access of the virus to the brain through the olfactory pathway and to which extent the recruitment of immune cells contributes to this process through immunopathological mechanisms globally we present here the first data focusing on the impact of the sars-cov-2 in the nasal cavity our results could explain the high prevalence of anosmia observed in covid-19 patients and will need to be confirmed by analysis of human oe

of 2019 a novel coronavirus cov disease covid-19 identified in wuhan hubei province china in patients with pneumonia was found to be caused by a previously unknown betacoronavirus the outbreak rapidly spread to other provinces in mainland china and despite great efforts the epidemic continued to spread from china to europe north america and other asian countries the world health organization who announced that the severe acute respiratory syndrome cov 2 sars-cov-2 epidemic was a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 and on 11 march 2020 the who director general characterized covid-19 as a pandemic httpwwweurowhointenhealth-topicshealth-emergenciescoronavirus-covid-19newsnews2020012019-ncov-outbreak-is-an-emergency-of-international-concern httpswwwwhointdgspeechesdetailwho-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020 currently the number of people diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection is increasing by approximately 10000 cases a day as of 17 april 2020 approximately 2074529 cases had been diagnosed as covid-19 and 139378 deaths had occurred 1 further recent studies reported the detection of sars-cov-2 rna in various clinical specimens suggesting other transmission routes for this virus besides respiratory secretions 24 unfortunately to date no vaccines or antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection by regulatory agencies researchers are fervently working to develop vaccines specifically for this virus as well as potential treatments for covid-19 although many clinical trials are ongoing there are no specific therapeutic agents approved for covid-19 developing sars-cov-2-specific antiviral drugs from scratch could take years drugs that have already been approved by the us food and drug administration fda have the potential to reach patients more quickly during the sars outbreak in 2003 screening of approved drugs identified lopinavir-ritonavir a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 aspartate protease inhibitor as effective against sars-cov replication 5 the antiviral activity of lopinavir-ritonavir against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov both in vitro 6 and in an animal model 7 has been reported and case reports suggest that the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin and interferon alpha results in virologic clearance and survival 8 9 chloroquine cq a widely used antimalarial with immunomodulatory effects 10 was found in a recent study to inhibit the growth of sars-cov-2 in vitro 11 however this finding has not been strongly supported by clinical studies of approximately 100 sars-cov-2-infected patients 12 13 a derivative of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine hcq sulfate was first synthesized in 1946 by adding a hydroxyl group to cq resulting in a compound found to be much less toxic than cq in an animal study 14 in autoimmune diseases hcq sulfate works by reducing inflammation 15 however recent reports have also shown heart risk concerns with the use of cq and hcq sulfate for covid-19 treatment emtricitabine-tenofovir truvada is a prescription medicine for hiv approved by the us fda for preexposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of hiv infection in adults and adolescents as a nucleotide analogue it is reported that the active triphosphate form of this tenofovir diphosphate inhibits activity for rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp of hiv and hepatitis b virus hbv 16 17 still even these existing drugs will need rigorous testing for efficacy and safety and ultimately ramped-up production before they can be deployed widely against covid-19 generally immunocompromised patients are more susceptible to bacterial fungal viral and parasitic infections than healthy persons due to their inability to mount successful immune responses this can be caused by impairment or weakening of the immune system by a number of conditions including diseases eg diabetes or hiv infection malnutrition and the use of certain medications it has become apparent that sars-cov-2 infection also affects immunocompromised individuals more severely a majority of covid-19 patients who were clinically diagnosed are older than 60 years and have underlying complications including heart disease diabetes hypertension or cancer indicating that age and reduced immune activity are the critical risk factors or determinants for covid-19 morbidity and mortality we have recently established a ferret model for sars-cov-2 infection and transmission that highly recapitulates aspects of the human infection 18 elevated body temperatures and virus replication were readily detected in sars-cov-2-infected ferrets sars-cov-2-infected ferrets shed the virus through nasal washes and in saliva urine and fecal specimens sars-cov-2 was transmitted readily to naive direct-contact ferrets but less efficiently to naive indirect-contact ferrets 18 further acute bronchiolitis was observed in infected lungs in this report we evaluated the efficacy of oral administration of lopinavir-ritonavir hcq sulfate and emtricitabine-tenofovir for sars-cov-2 infection in ferret infection models we also treated ferrets with azathioprine an immunosuppressive drug and evaluated the replication kinetics of sars-cov-2 while most drug treatments reduced clinical symptoms cs none of them led to a significant reduction of in vivo virus titers in ferrets thus a drug candidate study in a robust preclinical animal model should greatly facilitate testing the efficacies and safety of therapeutic treatments for covid-19 patients in order to determine the antiviral efficacies of lopinavir-ritonavir hydroxychloroquine hcq sulfate or emtricitabine-tenofovir for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov-2 antibody-free ferrets 10group were inoculated with 1058 50 tissue culture infective doses tcid50ml of an nmc-ncov02 strain through the intranasal in route fig 1 at 1 day postinfection dpi with sars-cov-2 ferrets were administered lopinavir 24 mgkg of body weight-ritonavir 6 mgkg hydroxychloroquine sulfate 125 mgkg or emtricitabine 6 mgkg-tenofovir 9 mgkg daily via oral gavage for 14 days fig 1 in addition to test the effect of immunosuppression on viral infection and clinical outcome a group n  10 of ferrets was also treated with phosphate-buffered saline pbs as a control or azathioprine an immunosuppressive drug 10 mgkg for 7 days prior to sars-cov-2 infection fig 1 while all groups of sars-cov-2-infected ferrets showed elevated temperatures at 4 to 6 dpi the lopinavir-ritonavir- or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited mild fever compared with the pbs-treated group fig 2a as with the pbs-treated group the hydroxychloroquine sulfate- or azathioprine-treated group showed 7 body weight loss at 8 dpi while the lopinavir-ritonavir- or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed a 4 change in body weight on average fig 2b to compare clinical features of sars-cov-2 infection following treatment with each drug we developed an arbitrary scoring method to generate clinical symptom values based on 20-min observations of cough rhinorrhea and reduced activity and compared these cs values among the ferret groups as described in table 1 the average cs value of pbs-treated control ferrets was 35 at 2 dpi remained relatively high 5 for 3 to 6 dpi and returned to normal less than 1 by 11 dpi table 1 the lopinavir-ritonavir-treated ferrets showed the reduced overall cs values less than 5 that peaked at 4 to 5 dpi and resolved by 10 dpi table 1 the hcq sulfate-treated ferrets also showed reduced cs values at 6 to 8 dpi compared with those of the pbs-treated group but overall clinical symptoms were similar to those of the pbs-treated control group table 1 although the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated ferrets initially demonstrated clinical symptoms similar to those of the pbs-treated control group their overall cs values were relatively low at 3 to 8 dpi and clinical symptoms were ultimately resolved by 9 dpi finally the azathioprine-treated immunosuppressed ferrets also showed cs values similar to those of the pbs-treated control group but this groups clinical symptoms lasted slightly longer than those of the pbs-treated control group table 1 these results collectively showed that the lopinavir-ritonavir- hcq sulfate- or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the pbs-treated control group the overall clinical symptoms of immunosuppressed ferrets were similar but persisted slightly longer than those of pbs-treated control ferrets to evaluate the antiviral activity of each drug against sars-cov-2 we measured infectious virus titers in nasal washes from drug-treated ferrets fig 2c sars-cov-2 was isolated from all infected ferrets regardless of drug treatment from 2 dpi to 6 dpi with similar virus titers 275 to 32 log10 tcid50ml at 8 dpi the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated ferrets exhibited reduced virus titers compared with those of the pbs-treated control group although infectious virus was not detected in ferrets of the pbs- or antiviral-drug-treated groups at 10 dpi three of four azathioprine-treated ferrets were positive for virus even at 10 dpi fig 2c suggesting delayed virus clearance in the upper respiratory tracts of immunocompromised ferrets because gastrointestinal involvement has been documented in coronavirus infections of animals and humans 19 we also collected fecal specimens and performed quantitative real-time pcr qrt-pcr to determine whether any of the drug treatments affected sars-cov-2 shedding in the gastrointestinal system fig 2d the results showed that the viral rna was present in fecal specimens of all groups from 2 to 8 dpi with peak viral rna copy numbers observed at 4 to 6 dpi however there was no statistical difference in viral rna copy numbers among the groups during the experimental period by 10 dpi viral rna copy numbers declined in all drug-treated ferrets to further evaluate virus titers in tissues three ferrets from each group were euthanized at 4 and 8 dpi and virus titers were measured in nasal turbinate and lungs at 4 dpi all groups of ferrets showed high virus titers of more than 30 log10 tcid50g in nasal turbinate tissues and the virus was also isolated from their lung tissues fig 3 at 8 dpi while all nasal turbinate tissues were positive for virus the azathioprine-treated group showed a much higher virus titer 30 log10 tcid50g than those of the other groups fig 3a at 8 dpi the azathioprine-treated group still had detectable virus titers in their lung tissues whereas the rest of groups were negative for the virus fig 3b to compare the serum neutralization sn antibody titers among drug-treated groups blood was collected from each group of ferrets at 10 14 and 21 dpi at 10 dpi the pbs-treated control and drug-treated groups demonstrated sn titers greater than 40 fig 4 the antiviral-treated groups showed sn titers similar to those of the pbs-treated control group until 14 dpi but they exhibited lower sn titers at 21 dpi than the pbs-treated control group fig 4 it is noteworthy that the azathioprine-treated immunosuppression group showed geometric mean sn titers of 336 and 475 at 10 and 21 dpi respectively suggesting the continuously reduced sn antibody response of the immunosuppressed group in this study we evaluated the antiviral efficacies of three fda-approved drug candidates against sars-cov-2 infection using a ferret infection model which has previously proven to be highly susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection 18 20 although several clinical trials continue to evaluate these drug candidates most of the enrolled patient populations are considered heterogeneous with regard to the duration and severity of illness at enrollment further given the rapid spread of covid-19 around the world there are relatively higher mortality rates in some regions and in certain age groups therefore the use of highly susceptible animal models and controlled experimental settings should be an effective approach prior to human clinical trials to evaluate the in vivo antiviral effects of potential therapeutics ferrets treated with antivirals showed relatively reduced overall clinical scores compared with those of the pbs-treated control group which displayed high overall clinical scores of the three drugs the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed a noticeable reduction in overall clinical scores 4 and a shorter duration 8 dpi of clinical symptoms although attenuation of the overall clinical scores was observed in lopinavir-ritonavir- and hcq-treated groups at some time points their clinical durations were comparable with those of the pbs-treated control group these results suggest that treatment with emtricitabine-tenofovir a nucleotide analogue that inhibits rna-dependent rna polymerase activity may be the most likely candidate to reduce clinical symptoms including the cough and morbidity of sars-cov-2-infected hosts while the lopinavir-ritonavir protease inhibitor and a cqhcq sulfate autophagy inhibitor have been shown to be effective against sars-cov mers-cov or sars-cov-2 in in vitro culture 5 several reports have already described no benefit for clinical improvement of covid-19 patients furthermore hqc has been reported to be associated with a number of side effects including a heart rhythm problem severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage thus these existing fda-approved drugs still need rigorous testing for efficacy and safety in an animal model prior to clinical trials of covid-19 patients since the emergence of sars-cov-2 in china in december 2019 the number of cases has rapidly increased as the disease has spread globally the increase in the number of cases is alarming and specially compounded by the possibility of viral transmission from asymptomatic individuals several studies indicate that asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus to persons in close contact 21 22 therefore although clinical symptoms were attenuated in ferret groups treated with antiviral candidates we also evaluated virus titers in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts using nasal washes and stool samples respectively from sars-cov-2-infected ferrets regardless of antiviral candidate treatment sars-cov-2 was detected at more than 2 log10 tcid50ml until 6 dpi and there was no statistical difference between the pbs-treated control group and the antiviral-drug-treated groups however the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed relatively low virus tiers and shortened periods of virus shedding in nasal wash specimens compared with those of the other groups currently the role of sn antibody in the pathogenesis and disease clearance of sars-cov-2 is unclear wu et al 23 recently reported that the sn antibody levels in covid-19 patients were variable depending on the immune status of the patient and that about 30 of patients failed to develop high sn titers after sars-cov-2 infection although the disease durations of these patients were comparable to those of others this suggests that the sn antibody titer may be closely associated with immune activity rather than with the virus titer and disease duration in patients interestingly we found that the antiviral-treated groups showed lower sn antibody titers than the pbs-treated control group it is possible that as the antiviral treatment reduced the overall clinical symptoms of sars-cov-2-infected ferrets it might evoke weak immune responses and thereby lead to reduced neutralizing antibody responses nevertheless further immunological studies are needed to understand the detailed mechanisms of the low sn antibody titers in antiviral-treated ferrets while covid-19 is typically characterized by respiratory symptoms gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in some cases moreover there is evidence of viral rna in the stools of sars-cov-2 patients emtricitabine-tenofovir has reportedly shown antiviral efficacy in the gastrointestinal tract as well as in the respiratory tract 24 however qrt-pcr analysis of stools revealed no statistical difference in virus titers in stools among the pbs-treated control and the antiviral-treated groups suggesting that none of the tested antiviral candidates significantly diminished gastrointestinal sars-cov-2 replication in infected ferrets in conclusion although there may be some discrepancies in drug efficacy between animals and humans these results of a preclinical ferret infection study should aid in the selection of antiviral treatments of covid-19 patients this also suggests that a robust preclinical animal model for sars-cov-2 infection is valuable in order to identify antiviral drugs for future human efficacy trials a sars-cov-2 strain nmc-ncov02 was propagated in vero cells in dulbeccos modified eagle medium dmem gibco grand island ny supplemented with 1 penicillin-streptomycin gibco and tpck tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin 05 gml worthington biochemical lakewood nj in a 37c incubator supplemented with 5 co2 for 72 h propagated virus was stored at 80c as the working virus stock for animal studies the 50 tissue culture infective dose tcid50 was determined through fixation and crystal violet staining ten ferrets were treated orally with azathioprine 10 mgkg celltrion daily for 7 days prior to sars-cov-2 infection and treatment continued until 14 days postinfection dpi to reduce the immune response as a control pbs in the same volume was administered to 10 ferrets to confirm the immunosuppressed status of ferrets blood samples were collected from azathioprine-treated ferrets and the percentage of lymphocytes was assessed at 7 and 4 days preinfection and at 7 14 and 21 dpi the reduction in lymphocyte numbers in azathioprine-treated ferrets compared with lymphocyte numbers in the pbs control group was confirmed see fig s1 in the supplemental material for treatment with candidate antiviral drugs groups of ferrets 10group were administered lopinavir 16 mgkg-ritonavir 4 mgkg abbott hydroxychloroquine sulfate 25 mgkg elyson or emtricitabine 6 mgkg-tenofovir 735 mgkg gilead daily via oral gavage starting at 1 dpi of sars-cov-2 infection and continuing until 14 dpi groups of 10- to 12-month-old female ferrets 10group seronegative for sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 were intranasally inoculated with 1058 tcid50ml of nmc-ncov02 under anesthesia the body weights and temperatures of infected ferrets were monitored every other day until 14 dpi nasal washes and stool specimens were collected every other day from the inoculated ferrets blood was collected at 10 14 and 21 dpi to measure the serum neutralization titer three ferrets per group were euthanized at 4 and 8 dpi and nasal turbinate and lungs were collected to measure tissue virus titers and examine lung histopathology virus titers in nasal washes and tissues were determined by 50 tcid50 assessment in vero cells while the virus titers in stool specimens were measured with quantitative real-time pcr qrt-pcr briefly total rna was extracted using trizol reagent thermo fisher scientific or an rneasy kit qiagen and cdnas were generated

filardi s morano   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has abruptly reached pandemic proportions sars-cov-2 is a member of the betacoronavirus family as well as sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus since the beginning of 2020 the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has dramatically increased worldwide leaping to more than a million by march 2020 1 although the majority of covid-19 patients develop mild to moderate clinical features 2 severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure leading to high death rate may develop notably marked sex differences have emerged in covid-19 prevalence and prognosis in particular the age-specific risk of disease is reported to be significantly higher in males than in females except under the age of 50 years moreover the age-specific risks of death and hospitalization is at least two fold higher in males than in females among all age ranges 3 furthermore patients with advanced age and underlying pathologies mainly hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease cvd are more prone to experience severe form of the disease 4 even though the overall mortality considerably varies among countries the fatality-rate by age groups displays very similar patterns rising consistently in the 6069-year age group 5 importantly the presence of comorbidities further increases mortality in a sample of 355 patients who died of covid-19 in italy the prevalence of diabetes was 355 5 not so differently from covid-19 the spread of diabetes has known no boundaries and the number of affected people has reached nearly half a billion worldwide 6 the number of deaths attributed to diabetes and its complications was around 42 million in 2019 6 notably more than 65 of diabetic patients are over 65 years old 7 thus although with extremely different connotations covid-19 and diabetes are two pandemics that share the burden of a wide diffusion in the elderly population and a dramatic impact on global mortality and economic health resources this short review is focused on some open questions emerging from the effort to fully understand the link between covid-19 and diabetes mainly in the context of possible harmful or beneficial effects of commonly used drugs in patients with diabetes on the course of covid-19 infection diabetes is reportedly a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide a conceivable link between diabetes and infectious diseases has been postulated in particular lower respiratory tract infections are known to be rather common and severe in the elderly with type 2 diabetes t2d 8 although evidence suggests that diabetes is unlikely to significantly increase the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection a higher risk of worse covid-19 progression and outcomes has been observed 9 the mechanisms underlying this association are not completely clear yet but the exacerbated pro-inflammatory cascade and the impaired immune response in diabetic patients with covid-19 are suspected to be crucially involved in particular increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as leukocyte and neutrophil count pro-calcitonin c-reactive protein ferritin and circulating cytokines that trigger the cytokine storm namely il-6 il-8 il-2 receptor tnf- have been detected in diabetic patients with severe covid-19 compared to patients without diabetes 10 furthermore an altered immune response in diabetic patients possibly due to impaired lymphocyte neutrophil and monocytemacrophage function has been long hypothesised especially in the presence of poorly controlled glycaemia 11 12 higher concentrations of d-dimer and fibrinogen hallmarks of severe forms of covid-19 have been also reported in patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes suggesting that these patients might be more prone to develop coagulation abnormalities in the course of the infection known to be significantly associated with worse prognosis 10 13 in a recent retrospective study involving chinese patients n  904 with moderate severe or critical disease the major risk factors for mortality and poor outcomes were evaluated among the enrolled patients 15 n  136 had diabetes including t2d type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes overall diabetes increased the odds of in-hospital death and poor prognosis diabetic patients were older and had significant alterations of several laboratory parameters associated with poor prognosis compared to patients without diabetes in particular they had higher levels of d-dimer while female diabetic patients had increased ldh and neutrophil count compared to non-diabetic patients cvd was more common in men with diabetes than in non-diabetic men notably in multivariable regression analysis insulin therapy was independently associated with poor prognosis c-reactive protein was the only independent risk factor for either mortality or poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 and diabetes 14 besides this further research is also needed to clarify whether hypoglycaemia might also contribute to adverse outcomes and increased mortality in covid-19 patients with diabetes 15 patients with diabetes have high prevalence of high blood pressure and are at increased risk of cvd 16 hence the treatment of hypertension largely includes drug classes that have demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events such as angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs 17 since ace converts angiotensin i into angiotensin ii a potent vasoconstrictor and sodium-retentive agent the blockage of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas leads to an effective reduction in blood pressure ace shows homology with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptor to which the transmembrane spike glycoprotein on the surface of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 binds allowing the internalization of the virus by the alveolar cells and other cell types 18 ace2 which is clearly not a direct target of ace inhibitors is a ubiquitous mono-carboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin ii into the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic angiotensin-17 contrasting its potent vasoconstrictor sodium-retentive pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects indeed angiotensin-17 binding to the mas receptor induces nitric oxide release protecting against tissue injury 19 another known substrate of ace2 is angiotensin i which is converted into angiotensin-19 20 21 the latter is in turn converted into angiotensin-17 by ace therefore competing with angiotensin ii for its binding 22 limited animal and in vitro studies have reported an upregulation of ace2 induced by arbs and to a far lesser extent by ace inhibitors predominantly in the heart and in the kidney the effect is partly explained by an increase in local levels of angiotensin ii induced by arbs but not by ace inhibitors 20 indeed arbs block angiotensin ii type 1 at1 receptors and consequently increase the availability of the substrate angiotensin ii which upregulates ace2 21 based on this assumption it has been speculated that the treatment with arbs and ace inhibitors might favour the entry of sars-cov-2 into the lung cells therefore increasing the risk for adverse outcomes and severe forms of covid-19 infection conversely a beneficial effect of a background therapy with arb on the course of the disease has been supposed two complex mechanisms might support this hypothesis firstly angiotensin ii by binding to its receptor at1 might enhance the shedding of trans-membrane ace2 promoted by adam17 a disintegrin and metalloprotease therefore releasing soluble ace2 locally the soluble form of ace2 is unable to mediate sars-cov-2 internalization as it is no longer annexed to the cell membrane 21 secondly the up-regulation of ace2 probably induced by arbs might not necessarily have negative effects as sars-cov-2 internalization in the lung cells inevitably induces the downregulation of ace2 the increase in its substrate angiotensin ii a potent vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory agent might contribute to an exacerbation of lung injury indeed in animal models of lung injury a clear association between the activation of the angiotensin ii-at1 signalling and the severity of lung damage has been observed while the detrimental effects of this cascade are counterbalanced by the activation of the ace2-angiotensin-17-mas receptor axis 23 specifically in models of sepsis or acid aspiration which frequently cause acute lung injury and ards ace2 knockout mice experienced a more severe tissue damage characterized by marked inflammatory cell infiltration increased vascular permeability lung oedema and bleeding compared to wild-type mice similarly angiotensin ii type 2 at2 receptors knockout mice had a more marked lung damage in the same models the injection of recombinant human ace2 protein into ace2 knockout mice considerably decreased the severity of lung injury 24 in line with these findings the pre-treatment with recombinant human ace2 was able to reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue injury in a mouse model of respiratory syncytial virus infection 25 evidence from clinical studies is still rather limited in patients with ards recombinant human ace2 increased angiotensin-17 and decreased angiotensin-ii concentrations even though the study was prematurely discontinued for the lack of clinical improvement 26 overall evidence from animal models suggests a conceivable pneumo-protective role of both ace2 and at2 receptor in the context of lung injury a loss of pulmonary ace2 might therefore have harmful effects exacerbating inflammation and promoting respiratory distress and fibrosis in the same way the activation of ace angiotensin ii and at1 receptor axis might exert detrimental effects worsening lung damage the rationale of raas inhibition is therefore counterbalancing these effects by reducing angiotensin ii and increasing ace2 notably arb and ace inhibitors attenuated lps-induced lung injury in several preclinical studies 2731 recently milne et al analysed gene expression of ace2 ace agtr1 encoding for at1 tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 requested cofactor for the internalization of sars-cov-2 and adam17 in a large number of healthy lung tissue samples collected from patients undergoing lung resection for cancer a significant association between use of ace inhibitors and reduced ace2 gene expression was observed differently the use of arbs was not linked to relevant changes in ace2 expression but was significantly correlated to increased ace and decreased agtr1 expression 32 although these findings are quite in contrast with data from animal studies it should be highlighted that gene expression rather than protein concentration was analysed and that the collected tissue samples did not exhibit lung injury or ards covid-19 results in severe lung damage and an imbalance of the raas system in this context cannot be excluded recently in a pilot study covid-19 patients were found to have higher levels of circulating angiotensin ii compared to healthy subjects and a correlation between angiotensin ii concentration and the severity of the disease was observed as well 33 thus the effects of ace inhibitors and arbs might be very different in extremely damaged context and should be therefore explored in animal models of covid-19 mounting evidence from recent clinical studies suggests that raas inhibitor use is not related to an increased risk of covid-19 infection or poor outcomes in a retrospective cohort study of 18472 patients screened for covid-19 test positivity was not significantly associated with ace inhibitor or arb therapy 34 similarly in a us study no relationship emerged between prior ace inhibitor or arb use and the increased likelihood of a positive sars-cov-2 test result adjusting for relevant confounding factors 35 in an italian community-based casecontrol study no association was found between ace inhibitor or arb treatment and covid-19 infection although the use of these drugs was rather frequent due to high prevalence of cvd 36 overall these findings excluded an increased risk of covid-19 infection in patients already treated with raas inhibitors other studies have evaluated the link between covid-19 progression and raas inhibitor therapy in a recent korean population-based cohort study involving 5179 covid-19 patients the use of ace inhibitors or arbs was not associated with a higher mortality risk after adjustment for confounders 37 in a recent systematic review including a total of n  23565 covid-19 patients from different countries ace inhibitor or arb use was not associated with increased severity of covid-19 illness 38 interestingly in a meta-analysis of more than 19000 covid-19 patients from seven cohort studies and five casecontrol studies the use of raas inhibitors was not linked to a higher risk of covid-19 infection severity or mortality whereas mortality risk was significantly lower in patients treated with ace inhibitors or arbs compared to those treated with other antihypertensive drugs 39 taking together data from observational studies indicates that raas inhibitor therapy is unlikely to have a negative impact on the course of the infection however whether patients with covid-19 might take advantage of initiating these drugs or not in terms of disease progression and outcomes should be explored in clinical trials which are still ongoing cvd is a well-known major complications of diabetes the risk of developing cvd is 2- to fivefold higher in patients with t2d than in non-diabetic patients mainly due to diabetes-related coronary atherosclerosis 40 in addition diabetic cardiomyopathy may occur independently of coronary artery disease likely developing from t helper 1 driven responses within the cardiomyocyte 41 42 besides the common clinical features of covid-19 cardiovascular damage may occur in nearly 12 of patients 43 being a cause of major concern due to a high related mortality the mechanisms underlying this complication are largely unknown the direct viral damage and the destabilization of coronary plaques reportedly are suspected to play a consistent role notably in a sample of 187 patients with covid-19 guo et al observed that the presence of background coronary heart disease or cardiomyopathy was associated with frequent occurrence of myocardial damage highlighted by a marked increase in serum troponin t in the course of the disease 44 accordingly mortality was considerably higher among patients with myocardial injury and concomitant cvd 694 than in patients without cvd 375 remarkably a considerable percentage of patients displaying myocardial injury had diabetes 30 compared to patients without myocardial injury 89 myocardial injury may therefore contribute to the poorer outcomes observed in diabetic patients with covid-19 45 of note patients with myocardial injury were more prone to develop malignant arrhythmias ards coagulopathy and acute kidney injury which explained high mortality 44 importantly ace inhibitors and arbs were broadly used in patients with myocardial injury but mortality did not significantly differ between treated and non-treated patients although consistent evidence excluding harms or suggesting benefits of raas inhibitors on covid-19 patients with hearth injury is lacking most arbs were able to increase ace2 expression in the hearts of animal models of arterial hypertension 46 even in this pathological context the possible effects of these drugs should be further elucidated as the down-regulation of ace2 in cardiomyocytes and in blood vessels induced by sars-cov2 internalization might exacerbate myocardial injury and endothelial dysfunction compromising heart function in patients with diabetes and underlying cvd 20 47 in addition patients with t2d have high rate of lipid alterations and statins are the first line therapy for dyslipidaemia remarkably evidence from preclinical studies suggests that statins might modulate ace2 expression in several tissues including the heart it has been observed that atorvastatin increased ace2 protein expression in the heart and in the kidney of rabbits with atherosclerosis 48 in another study diabetic rats displayed significantly lower expression of ace2 and impaired systolic and diastolic function compared to control rats and the combined treatment with insulin and fluvastatin was associated with higher levels of ace2 compared to non-treated diabetic rats 49 ace2 is a multi-substrate enzyme and is a targeted by several molecules although extremely limited there is evidence in animal studies that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ppar- agonists which are insulin-sensitizer drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes t2d might increase the expression of ace2 in different tissues in an animal model of hypertension the insulin-sensitizer rosiglitazone modulated the ace2angiotensin-17angiotensin ii axis in aortic tissue and lowered blood pressure by increasing the expression of ace2 50 similarly in high fat diet fed rats an animal model of obesity pioglitazone increased the expression of ace2 in insulin-sensitive tissues liver adipose tissue and skeletal muscle likely through the modulation of renin-angiotensin system 51 ace2 is widely distributed in human tissues and remarkably its expression was found to be even lower in the lung than in other sites 4 hence other mediators are thought to play a role in facilitating sars-cov-2 infection the priming by the serine protease tmprss2 is requested for the binding of ace2 and the internalization of sars-cov-2 tmprss2 cleaves the s protein in s1 and s2 subunits a necessary step for membrane fusion and viral internalization which contextually drags ace2 into the alveolar cells 18 in light of this both antibodies targeting s-protein and tmprss2 inhibitors might prevent sars-cov-2 entry in lung cell 18 individuating other possible candidate co-receptors is therefore of great importance for the development of new therapeutic strategies to contrast the infection dpp4 is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface exopeptidase with important metabolic functions it mainly regulates the bioactivity of gut-derived hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide gip they stimulate insulin secretion in response to oral glucose administration known as the incretin effect 52 the dpp4 inhibitors dpp4i are commonly used drugs for the treatment of t2d they prevent the degradation of incretins by inhibiting the catalytic activity of dpp4 as a result -cell insulin secretion is potentiated and glycaemia is significantly reduced independently of its catalytic function dpp4 displays inflammatory and immune functions 53 indeed it is expressed mainly by t-lymphocytes and is involved in their activation and proliferation 54 interestingly pro-inflammatory factors significantly increase dpp4 expression in circulating immune cells 55 unlike sars-cov and sars-cov-2 which binds to ace2 to entry into lung cells dpp4 is the functional receptor for mers-cov 56 hence several mouse and human monoclonal antibodies preventing protein s binding to dpp4 have given promising results for the treatment of mers 57 of note it has been recently reported that dpp4 shares patterns of expression with ace2 in the lung precisely in alveolar type 2 cells the main target of sars-cov-2 58 vankadari et al have recently set up a docking model of dpp4 and the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein 59 they predicted several dpp4 residues that might be involved in the interaction with sars-cov-2 s1 domain of the spike protein also targeted by other coronaviruses that enter the host cells through the functional receptor dpp4 however further validation is needed to draw conclusions and to establish whether the possible adhesion between dpp4 and spike protein may play a role in sars-cov-2 infection consequently there are some important issues to be addressed before claiming possible beneficial effects of dpp4 modulation on covid-19 60 according to data from chen et al in patients with diabetes and moderate-severe covid-19 the use of dpp4i did not significantly impact on mortality and clinical outcomes 14 the presence of diabetes considerably influences the course of covid-19 infection being a risk factor for poor outcomes in limited preclinical studies ace2 expression was found to be modulated by several players in different tissues most of them are largely employed in the treatment of diabetes such as antihypertensive and to a considerably lesser extent insulin-sensitizers and statins in light of this the potential harmful or protective effects of these treatments in covid-19 infection might be an interesting soil for further research to date data supporting that these drugs clearly interfere with sars-cov-2 access in lung cells or in other tissues are completely lacking it should be stressed that in the absence of evidence from consistent clinical studies the discontinuation or the adoption of these therapies in the attempt to influence the course of the infection is strongly discouraged  journal pre-proof in

declared that covid-19 was a fast-evolving pandemic iii  as of may 26 2020  it is estimated that 5406282 people have been infected with covid-19 and 343562 people have died globally iii  multiple clinical trials are currently underway for prevention or intervention in the disease progression 3  in parallel it is also equally essential to carry out basic research on sars-cov-2 to support the efficient development of therapeutic agents for this models that can faithfully reproduce the behavior of the virus and reproduce the pathology of covid-19 are required here we briefly review relevant cell lines organoids and animal model animals an in vitro cell model for sars-cov-2 research is essential for understanding the viral life cycle for amplifying and isolating the virus for further research and for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic molecules this section lays out the cell lines used to replicate and isolate sars-cov-2 as well as organoids that can be used to examine the effects of sars-cov-2 infection on specific human tissues table 1a figure 1  in humans airway epithelial cells highly express the putative sars-cov-2 entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and transmembrane serine 12  they reported that the viral rna copies in the culture supernatants of these cells were 100 times higher than those of vero e6 cells suggesting that it would possible to isolate higher titer virus using tmprss2-overexpressing vero e6 cells organoids are composed of multiple cell types and model the physiological conditions of human organs because organoids have the ability to self-replicate they are also suitable models for large-scale screening in drug discovery and disease research 13  besides the lung damage caused by pneumonia sars-cov-2 affects several

 the complex pathophysiology of the disease will only be understood by figure 1  one of the works that set the pace for discovery of animal models was by zhou et al who conducted sars-cov-2 infection experiments using hela cells that expressed ace2 proteins taken from multiple animal species from mice to humans 11  interestingly sars-cov-2 could use all ace2 proteins except for mouse ace2 therefore bao et al used transgenic mice that express human ace2 25  the team found that such mice after sars-cov-2 infection showed weight loss virus replication in the lungs and interstitial pneumonia 25  in the search of alternative small animal models molecular docking studies were performed on the binding between ace2 of various mammals and the s protein of sars-cov-2 with the finding

pandemic and as of 12 june 2020 has caused more than 74 million cases and over 418000 deaths the highly dynamic and rapidly evolving situation with covid-19 has made it difficult to access accurate on-demand information regarding the disease online communities forums and social media provide potential venues to search for relevant questions and answers or post questions and seek answers from other members however due to the nature of such sites there are always a limited number of relevant questions and responses to search from and posted questions are rarely answered immediately with the advancements in the field of natural language processing particularly in the domain of language models it has become possible to design chatbots that can automatically answer consumer questions however such models are rarely applied and evaluated in the healthcare domain to meet the information needs with accurate and up-to-date healthcare data in this paper we propose to apply a language model for automatically answering questions related to covid-19 and qualitatively evaluate the generated responses we utilized the gpt-2 language model and applied transfer learning to retrain it on the covid-19 open research dataset cord-19 corpus in order to improve the quality of the generated responses we applied 4 different approaches namely tf-idf term frequency -inverse document frequency bidirectional encoder representations from transformers bert bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for biomedical text mining biobert and universal sentence encoder use to filter and retain relevant sentences in the responses in the performance evaluation step we asked two medical experts to rate the responses we found that bert and biobert on average outperform both tf-idf and use in relevance-based sentence filtering tasks additionally based on the chatbot we created a user-friendly interactive web application to be hosted online and made its source code available free of charge to anyone interested in running it locally online or just for experimental purposes overall our work has yielded significant results in both designing a chatbot that produces high-quality responses to covid-19-related questions and comparing several embedding generation techniques  coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 22  as of 12 june 2020 more than 74 million cases have been recorded resulting in over 418000 deaths 44  the sudden global outbreak of covid-19 made millions of people quarantined due to the social distancing measures additionally the covid-19 pandemic caused a historic rise in mental health problems such as depression post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide due to the state-wise quarantine people are isolated and stressed and may develop long-term psychological consequences beyond the quarantine period 36 16 21  therefore most of the time people rely on online and web-based resources for getting news and updates concerning covid-19 given that currently many web sources do not hold the accurate information about the pandemic and the misinformation campaigns are running rampant 39  it is critically important that people and patients receive accurate up-to-date and useful information regarding covid-19 online communities forums and social media provide potential venues to search for relevant questions and answers or post questions and seek answers from other members however due to the nature of such sites there are always a limited number of relevant questions and responses to search from and posted questions are rarely answered immediately to address these issues we propose to develop a chatbot enhanced by neural language models that is able to automatically answer questions related to covid-19 through conversational interactions a conversational chatbot is a software which is able to conduct a conversation via text andor other means there are different taxonomies for the type of conversational chatbot based on how the natural language conversations are generated there are two main categories script chatbot and intelligent chatbot the entire interaction in a script chatbot is based on a pre-determined model that determines what the chatbot can and cannot do the script is usually a decision tree that is manually crafted by domain experts to determine which specific path to take given a response to one question task it is usually very labor-expensive and nongeneralizable to develop conversation decision trees the intelligent chatbot is built using artificial intelligence ai and natural language processing nlp techniques that automatically generate natural language on the back end with the advancements in ai and nlp the functionality and the performance of modern chatbots have been dramatically improved however these techniques are rarely applied and evaluated in the healthcare domain to meet the information needs with accurate up-to-date and interactive healthcare information the outbreak of covid-19 has motivated us to develop a chatbot with advanced nlp techniques and evaluate the approach in automatically answering questions related to covid-19 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study of such kind our contributions are  we applied and compared the performance of four embedding generation approaches namely tf-idf term frequency -inverse document frequency 18  bidirectional encoder representations from transformers bert 42  biobert bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for biomedical text mining 28  and universal sentence encoder use 14 for refining the automatically generated answers  we proposed a qualitative evaluation guideline for automatic question-answering for covid-19  we assessed the performance of the proposed hybrid approach for automatic question-answering for covid-19  we built a web-based chatbot using the language models that facilitate question-answering for users this paper is organized as follows we will proceed by discussing the related work and the efforts in section 2 section 3 will be dedicated to materials and section 4 to the proposed approach we will report the chatbot evaluation strategy and the experimental results in sections 7 and 6 respectively finally we will also discuss a webbased chatbot with the proposed model and future work in section 7 and conclude the work in section 8 recent neural language models of dialogue generation offer great promise for generating responses for intelligent chatbots the lstm long short-term memory sequence-to-sequence seq2seq model is one type of neural generation model that maximizes the probability of generating a response given the previous dialogue turn 37 19 41  xlnet uses a context of the word for predicting the next word where the context word is constrained to two directions backward or forward 45  sam is a technique self-attentive associative memory where two memories are wired into a single sequential model capable of both memorization and relational reasoning 26  in the gpt-2 domain lee and hsiang 29 have fine-tuned gpt-2 for generating patent claims klein and nabi 25 have applied gpt-2 in conjunction with bert for automatic question generation purposes zhang sun et al developed a large and tunable neural conversational model dialogpt using gpt-2 48  lee shu et al developed recipegpt for automatic generation of cooking recipes by fine-tuning gpt-2 on a large cooking recipe dataset 27  we are unaware of the work which applied gpt-2 model for transfer learning purposes on cord-19 in regard to the work related to comparing pretrained ai models jin et al made some efforts conducting probing experiments and comparing bert elmo 31  and biobert sharma and daniel 40 compared the performance of bert networks to that of flair 12  in the general ai-based chatbot domain serbal et al 38 have applied deep reinforcement learning for building a conversational ai chatbot adiwardana et al 11 have developed a multi-turn open-domain chatbot trained end-to-end on data mined social media conversations yin et al 47 have developed a deep learning based chatbot for psychological therapy purposes semantic similarity of texts on the other hand has been studied for a long time and recent breakthroughs allowed for development of new models such as bert biobert and universal sentence encoder use today one of the state-of-the art conversational ai models is gpt-2 gpt-2 is a pretrained model so we have applied transfer learning utilizing cord-19 for retraining purposes the resulted chatbot gave irregularly long responses that would not be typical of a human we have therefore decided to further filter the responses via applying embedding generation algorithms and models such as tf-idf bert biobert and use and then using semantic similarity approaches such as cosine similarity and inner product in other words we first let a human ask a question and make gpt-2 come up with an answer we the further processed the response with additional filters and ultimately applied an embedding generation model for finding the sentences that are most relevant to the question cosine similarity is one of the most commonly used approaches in calculating semantic similarity of texts therefore it is naturally employed in nlp tasks many nlp applications need to compute the semantic similarity between two short texts its flexibility allows one to apply it under virtually any settings as long as documents can be represented as vectors besides finding cosine similarity is usually not a time-consuming task and can be done really quickly therefore it is also commonly used for benchmarking purposes 49  our study has produced a chatbot that is both performant and extensible additional layer of filters have shown success in classifying sentences the chatbot is also able to be retrained and readjusted to the new data in case there are new discoveries or scientific achievements related to covid-19 furthermore chatbot responses have been annotated by medical experts and the results were consistent across the annotators the white house office of science and technology policy alongside with the coalition of leading research groups has released a covid-19 machine readable dataset -covid-19 open research dataset cord- 19 2 it consisted of over 128000 scholarly articles regarding covid-19 sars-cov-2 and related coronaviruses including over 59000 with full text and called researchers globally to develop text and data mining tools for finding answers to the questions within this content in support of the ongoing covid-19 response efforts worldwide 30  we used cord-19 to train a language model that would automatically answer questions related to covid-19 the chatbot would not only help improve information acquisition but also serve as a knowledge base for covid-19 we harvested the data from the initial commercial use subset of cord-19 containing 9000 scholarly articles in the form of json files we extracted the abstract and the main body of the article from every json file combined them together and used as a corpus for retraining the language model  we applied a hybrid approach for generating responses gpt-2 was used to generate the answer to the question then an additional filtering step was applied for pruning the irrelevant sentences from the answer and subsequently semantic similarity methods were employed to retain the sentences that are most semantically similar to the question such hybrid approach to the response generation produced high quality answers to covid-19-related questions figure 1 illustrates the pipeline of the proposed approach gpt-2 has a transformer-based 43 architecture which in many ways is similar to open ai gpt model 34 33  there are a total of 4 different gpt-2 models that were released by openai 124 million 124m 355 million 355m 774 million 774m and 15 billion 15b parameters 4 models while the model with 15 billion parameters showed the best results in the original paper 34  in our experiments we found that it was difficult to fine-tune and use for the transfer learning purposes besides the training was unbearably slow even if run on tpus tensor processing unit provided by google colaboratory 20 which we used as our training ground we therefore utilized 774m model and ran transfer learning for 2500 iterations with the batch size of 8 after 2000 iterations the loss was not decreasing so we let the language model train for the additional 500 iterations and stopped the training the batch size of 8 was chosen due to the memory limitations of google colaboratory as for the optimizer we used adam 23 and set the learning rate of 00001 1e-4 adam is an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments 23  it is highly memory-efficient and has shown good results in retraining our chatbot we have also tried sgd 24  yet adam has shown the better performance and hence we have released the adam-based retrained model the original gpt-2 was written in tensorflow 10 and this is the version we used that said for retraining purposes we applied the tpu-trainable version of the gpt-2 32  as for the hardware google colaboratory provided us with cloud tpus and training capabilities it came 25 gb ram and since we connected the colab to google drive 20 we had enough storage to do transfer learning the link for downloading the model is available on our github page 17  the gpt-2 responses are usually very lengthy and for the most part the answer is not relevant to the question to prune the responses generated from gpt-2 we first chunked the answer into the list of sentences using pythons built-in module for dealing with regular expressions re 6 and then for each answer in the list of answers performed the following regexstring operations 1 eliminated redundant spaces 2 eliminated extra punctuation marks specifically    and  3 removed redundant parentheses and square brackets 4 further split the sentence into separate sentences if it contained a period   steps 2 and 4 once again employed re module while for steps 1 and 4 just the built-in string operations were sufficient hence no built-in or external module was used these operations have significantly improved the quality of the answer and allowed us directly passing them to the pretrained models for generating embeddings semantic similarity is a metric that quantifies the degree to which two texts or text documents are similar to each other the two approaches we have used include cosine similarity and inner product the difference between the two is that cosine similarity pays attention to only the angle between the vectors while the inner product cares about both the angle and the magnitude that said if one has the normalized data both approaches are nearly equivalent to put each sentence in a vector representation we tested and applied four different approaches for generating embeddings  tf-idf 7  a simple tf-idf based embedding-generation method in all cases the similar strategy was applied for filtering sentences the following equation defines the embedding generation process where s  s 1  s 2     s n  q and denotes the list of sentences obtained by performing the split based on regexstring manipulation plus the question emb denotes one of the embedding generation approaches ie tf-idf bert biobert or use and q denotes the question being asked e denotes the embeddings generated for the list of sentences in other words the list of sentences is passed to the embedding generation function and the feature matrix is returned once the embeddings were generated we have applied cosine similarity and inner product for ranking the sentences inner product was used only with use since its embeddings were approximately normalized the following equation shows the ranking process where e 1  e 2     e n  e q  e and sim is a function that finds the cosine similarity or the inner product between two embeddings for every sentence embedding e 1  e 2     e n  the approach calculates the cosine similarity to the question embedding e q  m is a similarity matrix where every column denotes the similarity vector for a particular sentence the similarity vector contains the similarity values of the particular sentence with respect to all the sentences including itself the last columnsimilarity vector in the matrix has the similarity measures with respect to the question embedding finally we ranked the sentences based on their similarity scores selected top five most similar sentences using pythons numpy 5 package and concatenated them into a single unified answer we show an example responses in the form of a human-bot conversation generated by the gpt-2 language model as follows  what do we know about vaccines and therapeutics of covid-19  because of their critical role in viral pathogenesis and host defense against infections several drugs have been developed against covid-19 with this in mind we present evidence that drugs that inhibit pro-inflammatory responses eg il-6 have the potential to inhibit covid-19 infection and viral replication in nonhuman primates after administration up to 12 days following infection because of their critical role in viral pathogenesis and host defense against infections several drugs have been developed against covid-19  what do we know about covid-19 risk factors  however covid-19 is now a threat to global health security according to the latest world health organization report a large number of travel is seen as one of the major causes of covid-19 spread  what is known about transmission incubation and environmental stability of covid-19  for example a number of reports have suggested that animal and human hosts may have provided the necessary environment for the transmission of covid-19 in people and poultry in fact all known animal hosts that have been associated with animal-to-human transmission of covid-19 are wild birds including chickens geese mule deer herons and turkey in fact all known animal hosts that have been associated with animal-to-human transmission of covid-19 are wild birds including chickens geese mule deer herons and turkey the dialogue shows a consistent pattern in generating responses response to the first question regarding the vaccines and therapeutics states that several drugs have been developed against covid-19  furthermore it says that drugs that inhibit pro-inflammatory responses eg il-6 have the potential to inhibit covid-19 infection and viral replication in nonhuman primates  regarding the response to the second question concerning the risk factors it addressed the question directly by stating that a large number of travel is seen as one of the major causes of covid-19 spread  as for the third question about transmission incubation and environmental stability of covid-19 it has mentioned that large number of travel is seen as one of the major causes of covid-19 spread and additionally talks about animal-to-human transmission  in all cases sentences were highly readable and understandable that said in some cases the same sentences were repeated due to how the hybrid approach was implemented this can be avoided which we discuss in the section 7 in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches as well as the overall performance of the chatbot it is crucial to have a question dataset that both are frequently asked and related to covid-19 for this purpose we decided to use 12 questions from the kaggles covid-19 open research dataset challenge cord-19 15  most of the questions included the term covid-19 but others did not in which case we appended the term to the end of the question table 1 presents all 12 questions for every one of the 12 questions we generated five different answers by applying four different embedding generation techniques resulting in a total of 240 answers therefore the response for every question was generated exactly 5 times using the same technique this ensured a fair and consistent distribution of both the questions and the approaches across the dataset we made all of the answers publicly available on github 1 we then asked two experienced medical experts to evaluate the quality of these responses by assigning different relevance scores according to the categories in table 2  having 5 categories allowed for a flexibility and diversity of opinionsjudgements as well as a broad range of scores that ultimately gave us a better way to evaluate our approaches the evaluation was done primarily by averaging the scores for a particular approach  what has been published about information sharing and inter-sectoral collaboration of covid-19 what do we know about vaccines and therapeutics of covid-19 what do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions of covid-19 our annotation process had two phases in the first phase we let the annotators evaluate the test subset of the responses generated by the language model the test subset was comprised of 20 questions we then computed the iaa inner annotator agreement which was approximately equal to 0389 due to having 5 categories we used pearson correlation coefficient for computing the iaa as opposed to cohens kappa etc low correlation value led us to having a meeting with both annotators where we discussed why the they had different scores on the particular responses to questions finally both annotators reached the agreement and gave same scores for every question in the test subset of 20 once the agreement was reached we then let the annotators evaluate the remaining 220 questions note that we evaluated our model based on the 240 responses and included initial subset where both annotators agreed on the judgement this was done for the sake of fairness and consistency  description points the answer partially or fully answers the question andor makes clear attempts to do so and is related to the question 5 well-formed the answer makes a logical sense and is somewhat related to both the question and covid-19 yet it does not partially or fully answer the question 4 informative the answer is not related to the question but provides some information about covid-19 and makes a logical sense 3 acceptable the answer makes some logical sense and is weakly related to the question or covid-19 but is mostly difficult to understand 2 poor the answer is totally unrelated to the question or covid-19 andor does not make a logical sense 2 6 empirical results 61 performance by approach table 3 lists the evaluation results of different approaches it shows the approach the average scores based on the approach for each annotator and the overall average across the annotators the first annotator rated bert as the best approach with the average score of 4167 biobert shows slightly worse performance with a score of 4133 than bert the tf-idf approach performs well with a score of 3967 yet it could not outperform either bert or biobert use has the worst performance out of all embedding generation techniques with the score of 3683 out of 5 the second annotator similarly gave the highest average score to bert 4283 use was the second best with the score of 4083 followed by biobert with approximately the same score of 4067 the tf-idf approach has yielded the worst results rated 38 in general the results are consistent between two annotators with an inner annotator agreement score of 0521 which was calculated using the pearson correlation models from the bert family showed the best performance in automatically answering covid-19 questions with bert slightly outperforming biobert 4225 vs 4100 -average scores being the best the tf-idf approach and use show roughly similar performance 3884 vs 3883  yet inferior to bert and biobert all four approaches on average can be considered to be in the well-formed category with bert and biobert being close to the relevant category the overall average was 4023 well-formed it should be noted that all 3 of these questions seem to be rather short in length the responses to question  7 on the other hand has the worst average score and interestingly both annotators have given the same score of 2667 that said the question is also one of the shortest questions in length therefore the length does not seem to always have a correlation with the score hence the performance to further analyze why responses to the question  7 had the lowest average score we determined whether the terms of the question are present in the dataset terms inter-sectoral collaboration and information sharing were both present in cord-19 therefore it is likely that the issue stems from the model itself and not the dataset according to the scores we also find that the terms in the question has some correlation with the score for example the questions that featured words strongly linked to covid-19 such as virus in question  3 vaccine in question  11 and risk in question  9 had higher average response scores than those that did not eg question  10 the project had several limitations first due to hardware constraints and the difficulty of fine-tuining we have not used the larger 15b gpt-2 model that could potentially yield better results in generating responses second the question pool was also limited and comprised of 12 questions additionally we have tried only 4 specific embedding generation approaches which might not be a fair representation of all such techniques in the domains of ai and nlp in order to make the language model more accessible to the general audience for automating the response generation we built a web-based chatbot using the trained gpt-2 with options of tf-idf bert biobert and use approaches please find the released code on our github  the application is powered by pythons flask 9 package and gives a simple and user-friendly interface for the interactive communication with the chatbot please note that the health information generated by the chatbot is for general research purposes only it is not a diagnostic tool nor is it a substitute for medical advice or treatment for specific conditions although our work has demonstrated the feasiblity of using language models for automatically answering covid-19 questions much can be done in the further research at first we would like to explore why certain questions had the higher scores than others secondly other approaches for generating embeddings for sentences such as biowordvec 46  could potentially improve the performance of the chatbot and can be another avenue for exploration from the dialogue presented in section 4 it is clear that gpt-2 could generate duplicate sentences that may be irrelevant to the question in that case the same sentence might be repeated in the final answer one could incorporate an additional simple step of eliminating duplicate sentences which could potentially improve the quality of the answers adding an additional third layer of filtering can also be tested and checked whether it improves the quality of the responses additionally the gpt-2 model can always be further retrained on a new corpus which could potentially improve the result the 15b gpt-2 model could also be applied for retraining purposes finally given that a larger gpt language model gpt-3 was recently released 13  we believe that it is feasible for the chatbot with the capable hardware to explore the realm of possibilities with this model which could also evolve into an interesting future work in this paper we applied the gpt-2 language model to automatically answer questions related to covid-19 and quantitatively evaluate the proposed approach to refine the responses generated by gpt-2 we compared four different embedding generation techniques namely tf-idf bert biobert and use we utilized the collected corpus from the cord-19 task to pretrain the gpt-2 model and evaluated the automatically generated answers on twelve questions from the cord-19 the results were evaluated by two medical experts in general the results are consistent between two annotators the empirical results show that bert achieved the best performance in automatically answering covid-19 questions we also built a web-based chatbot using the trained gpt-2 model and opensoured the code this work was supported by nih

 since december 2019 humanity has been having to deal with the emergence of a severe and acute respiratory coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by the strain of coronavirus referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the respiratory problems caused by this pathogen is well known but the ophthalmological implications of the syndrome have not yet been well described coronavirus disease is not a new pathology three human coronaviruses have been known to exist since the mid-1960s human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov 19 in 2004 human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 a novel human coronavirus to date was reported in a 7-month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis 10 11 the coronaviridae family of viruses consist of enveloped viruses with a large plus-strand rna genome 2732 kb that is capped and polyadenylated each serology type is characterized by a specific host range and genome sequence the most pathogenic of these four types of coronaviruses is sars-cov which causes a life-threatening pneumonia 1214 this virus is likely to reside in animals and can affect humans through zoonotic transmission 15 16 coronaviruses have been identified in mice rats chickens turkeys swine dogs horses rabbits cats and humans they can cause a variety of health problems in humans including gastroenteritis respiratory tract problems 17 18 and conjunctivitis 10 11 1931 the authors of a recent study concluded that one-third of patients with covid-19 had ocular abnormalities a frequent manisfestation in patients with more severe disease and that although there is a low prevalence of sars-cov-2 in tears it is possible to transmit the disease through ocular secretions 31 therefore taking into consideration that there are more reports in the literature associating coronavirus and ophthalmic problems the aim of this narrative review is to summarize from an ophthalmological perspective the pathogeny the portal of entry and implantation of the virus at the conjunctiva its ophthalmic implications ocular complications prevention in the ophthalmology context and possible treatment of the ocular disease the relationship between covid-19 and the ocular surface conjunctiva corneal epithelium and tear film as a potencial portal of entry and as a transmission mechanism is currently under discussion due to the high transmission rate of the disease this article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors in general coronaviruses are able to cause a wide range of upper respiratory infections common cold alphacoronavirus hcov-229e alphacoronavirus hcov-nl63 betacoronavirus hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 whereas other betacoronaviruses such as sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are responsible for more aggressive lower respiratory problems considered to be atypical pneumonias the different infection sites are likely to be related to the presence of a viral surface spike composed of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 glycoprotein that has a human receptor in the lower respiratory tract known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 both sars-cov and mers-cov have this surface spike glycoprotein 3234 from the genetic point of view sars-cov-2 is about 70 similar to sars-cov and therefore it is capable of using the same cell entry receptor ace2 to infect human cells 35 36 however the sars-cov-2 glycoprotein spike binds to ace2 human receptors at a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity than sars-cov 37 once sars-cov-2 enters the alveolar epithelial cells its fast replication rate triggers a strong immune response causing cytokine storm syndrome hypercytokinemia and subsequence pulmonary tissue damage in general hypercytokinemias consist of a group of disorders that produce an elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines these cytokines are an important cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure 3840 one analysis of the first 99 cases of sars-cov-2 revealed that a cytokine storm occurred in patients with severe covid-19 of whom 17 had ards among the latter patients 11 deteriorated very rapidly and died of multiple organ failure 41 in addition the number of t cells cd4 and cd8 are decreased in patients infected with sars-cov-2 suggesting a decreased immune function that subsequently allows a secondary infection that could worsen the respiratory failure 42 both viral diseases and immune problems can lead to ocular manifestations such as conjunctivitis uveitis retinitis among others it is difficult to determine the pathogeny of the ophthalmic involvement however since the virus has been cultured from conjunctival secretions 43 covid-19 ophthalmopathy is more likely to be related to the own virus infestation rather than the secondary immune reaction that the infection may cause it is known that sars-cov-2 can be transmitted through direct or indirect contact with mucous membranes in the eyes mouth or nose 28 44 45 and that the respiratory tract should not be considered the only route of transmission in fact recent studies associate the enteric symptoms of covid-19 such as diarrhea nausea vomiting 46 47 with invaded ace2-expressing enterocytes 48 with the oralfecal route being another potential portal of entry additional studies are required to test different portal of entries proposed theories include 30direct inoculation of the conjunctiva from infected dropletsmigration of upper respiratory tract infection through the nasolacrimal ducthematogenous infection of the lacrimal gland our analysis of some of the studies included in this narrative review see table 1 revealed that the most common ophthalmologic sign related to coronavirus infection was inflammation of the conjunctiva conjunctivitis among the studies reviewed six were performed in animals feline murine canine and bird experimental models 1921 2426 and the other 11 in humans 10 11 22 23 2731 the first time that conjunctivitis was associated to a human coronavirus was in 2004 in a 7-month-old child 10 11 then in 2005 22 23 due to the great interest in understanding the clinical manifestations of coronavirus during the first sars-cov crisis however it is not until this new 20192020 outbreak that conjunctivitis has once again been associated to a coronavirus outbreak and taken to be a sign of covid-19 in a retrospective study vabret et al investigated hcov-nl63 infection in hospitalized children diagnosed with respiratory tract infection 23 of the 300 samples analyzed 28 93 were positive for hcov-nl63 the medical reports of 18 patients with hcov-nl63positive samples were retrospectively examined and the following symptoms noted fever 61 n  11 patients rhinitis 39 n  7 lower respiratory tract illness bronchiolitis pneumonia 39 n  7 digestive problems diarrhea and abdominal pain 33 n  6 otitis 28 n  5 pharyngitis 22 n  4 and conjunctivitis 17 n  3 23 xia et al reported a prospective interventional case series involving 30 patients with confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia 28 tear and conjunctival secretions were collected for reversetranscription pcr rtpcr assay the authors demonstrated that sarscov-2 were present in the tears and conjunctival secretions of coronavirus pneumonia patients with conjunctivitis however no virus was detected in the tears or conjunctival secretions of patients without conjunctivitis these results could possibly indicate that tear and conjunctival secretions are not a common route of coronavirus transmission given that the majority of covid-19 patients do not manifest conjunctivitis nevertheless this route of transmission could not be completely eliminated in such patients 28 as ophthalmologists we should be aware of this finding because any sign of conjunctivitis in the clinical setting should be considered to be a possible coronavirus conjunctivitis especially when accompanied by other respiratory tract problems or fever a study carried out by loon et al in 2004 demonstrated the presence of sars-cov rna in tears 49 tear samples collected from 36 suspected sars-cov patients were sent for rt-pcr analysis for the presence of sars-cov sars-cov rna was identified in three of these patients 49 in contrast there have been studies which have assessed both tears and conjunctival scrapes from 17 patients with confirmed sars-cov infection with no positive results from the rt-pcr analysis 50 51 the authors propose three explanations of these results 1 low sensitivity of rt-pcr on ocular surface secretions 2 if there is viral shedding in ocular tissue the window period may only last a short period of time 2 the possibility that sars-cov does not exist in ocular tissues regarding the severity of the covid-19 disease patients with ocular symptoms are more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin c-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms 31 another interesting detail regarding the ocular implication of this infection is that the human eye actually has its own intraocular reninangiotensin system and ace2 receptors have been found in the aqueous humor 52 as previously explained the main receptor for sars-cov-2 is the ace2 receptor which indicates that aqueous humor could be a target in covid-19 infection more studies exploring the hypothesis of sars-cov-2 ocular manifestation through the ace2 receptor need to be performed the study of ocular manifestations in animals could improve our current understanding of eye disease in humans therefore in the following section ocular manifestations associated with coronavirus infections in animals are discussed earlier studies have reported an association between coronaviruses and ocular problems in animal models for example feline infectious peritonitis fip is caused by a feline coronavirus fcov vasculitis is a common feature in fip and ocular manifestations include pyogranulomatous anterior uveitis coroiditis with retinal detachment and retina vasculitis with perivascular cuffing by inflammatory cells 5356 these manifestations are more common in the non-effusive dry form than in the effusive wet form of the disease also it can be present without other systemic signs of fip 26 the treatment of uveitis associated with fip has been described large fibrin clots in the anterior chamber were treated with intracameral injections of 25 g tissue plasminogen activator however cats with mild uveitis responded only to topical therapy 26 a murine coronavirus the mouse hepatitis virus mhv has shown involvement of the posterior pole of the eye the mhv neurotropic strains are of particular importance in animal model studies in the ophthalmology field the two main strains are jhm jhmv and a59 mhv-a59 both of which were isolated from a paralyzed mouse as a result of extensive demyelination and encephalomyelitis 57 jhmv-infected mice were subsequently utilized for intravitreal inoculation to study the mechanisms of virus-induced retinal degeneration 58 this model is known as the experimental cov retinopathy ecor model and it is used to examine genetic and host immune responses that may contribute to retinal disease 30 in the ecor model the infection has two phases namely inflammation in the early phase and retinal degeneration in the late phase following inoculation the presence of the virus in the retina and retina pigment epithelium will result in the infiltration of immune cells and release of proinflammatory mediators after the first week of infection viral clearance is achieved however retinal and retinal pigment epithelial cell autoantibodies are subsequently produced resulting in progressive loss of photoreceptors and ganglion cells as well as thinning of the neuroretina 59 in this case the autoimmune process is the cause of the majority of the retinal damage mhv-a59 models on the other hand have been used to create viral-induced optic neuritis this line of research is based on the increasingly popular hypothesis that viral-induced inflammation is the likely etiology of multiple sclerosis shindler et al inoculated mhv-a59 intracranially into mice inducing meningitis focal acute encephalitis and most importantly optic neuritis 60 inflammation of the optic nerve was detected as early as 3 days after inoculation with the peak incidence at 5 days axonal loss was highlighted by the significant decrease in axonal staining compared to control optic nerves 30 days after inoculation 60 it is important to note that in animal models coronaviruses affect not only the anterior surface of the eye thus we should be careful as ophthalmologists and prevent any possible ocular transmission of the disease it is important to learn more about the transmission mechanism to the eye and try to understand the pathogeny of the virus in the ocular tissues we have clear knowledge of retinal and optic nerve problems related to coronavirus in animals and the implications thereof consequently we should be meticulous when examining patients who have tested positive for covid-19 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge there is no evidence of human coronaviruses causing intraocular ophthalmic problems such as uveitis retinitis and optic neuritis as observed in animals the number of patients visiting the clinic should be strictly limited and there should be a strict timetable of appointments to prevent any agglomeration of patients in the clinic waiting room 29 61 online platforms such as the hospitals official website should be used telephone assistance could be useful in helping the patient distinguish between urgent and not-urgent ocular problems recommending treatments for non-urgent diseases reminding patients of the use of personal protection equipment ppe before coming to the clinic and answering questions on possible symptoms relative to covid-19 61 a triage system is also important to identify patients with fever respiratory symptoms andor acute conjunctivitis or who have recently traveled to outbreak areas online ordering and delivery of prescribed medication especially for chronic medication for chronic eye diseases such as glaucoma is also recommended 61 the number of accessible entry points to the hospitalclinic should be reduced and checkpoints set up at the hospital entrance the temperature of patients should be controlled and patients should be screening for covid-19 symptoms and contact history with confirmed or suspected covid-19 patients within the past 14 days patients should be provided with a mask if they do not bring one from home and social distancing in the registration and waiting area should be practiced patients with conjunctivitis or other similar infections should be seen in a separate clinic and there should be a separate waiting area patients should be tested more than two times for sars-cov-2 rna in the conjunctival sac and tears inside the clinical examination room the number of people should be limited 1 doctor and 1 patient per room with the exception of visually impaired patients patients with communicationmobility difficulties or small children the room should be well ventilated and the instruments used should be disinfected immediately after each patient visit infection control training should be provided to all clinical staff installation of protective shields on slit lamps frequent disinfection of equipment and provision of eye protection for staff should be implemented in all clinics universal masking hand hygiene and the correct use of ppe should be promoted 29 direct ophthalmoscope examination is not recommended and could be replaced by slit light lenses optical coherence tomography oct or fundus photography 61 preoperative infection screening of the inpatients is recommended especially before any surgical procedure general anesthesia should be avoided and local anesthesia is preferable to avoid contamination any emergency operation of a covid-19positive patient should be performed in a negative pressure operating room if such a surgical area is not available the patient should be referred to another qualified hospital equipped with such an operating room operations on healthy patients can be performed in a space with a positive pressure laminar flow as is standard practice 61 infection control training for all staff is necessary the taking of temperature and the query-and-questionnaire procedure before entering the hospital also applies to the staff strict hand hygiene is required and gloves should be changed regularly one pair of latex gloves should not be used for long periods of time 61 according to current evidence human coronavirus can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days 62 therefore reducing the viral load on surfaces by disinfection is very important the world health organization recommends cleaning environmental surfaces with water and detergent and applying commonly used disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite 63 bleach is typically used at a dilution of 1100 of 5 sodium hypochlorite resulting in a final concentration of 005 64 it has also been suggested that a concentration of 01 is effective in 1 min it therefore seems appropriate to recommend a dilution 150 of standard bleach in the coronavirus setting in case of small surface desinfection ethanol 6271 has shown an efficacy against coronavirus 62 64 other biocidal agents such as 00502 benzalkonium chloride or 002 chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective 65 duan et al found that irradiation with ultraviolet light for 60 min on several coronaviruses in culture medium resulted in undetectable levels of viral infectivity we speculate that some ocular spray disinfectants that contain hypochlorous acid usually applied to treat blefaritis in order to reduce bacterial and viral load on the skin and eyelashes could be used as a measurement of prevention for the facial area where many other chemical agents cannot be applied little evidence exists on the treatment of the viral conjunctivitis associated with covid-19 some antiviral systemic drugs have been used during this outbreak such as umefenovir lopinavir ritonavir 43 but not specifically for the ocular problem chen et al reported the possibility that ribavirin eye-drops could help the ocular symptom treatment 43 cheema et al recently treated one patient who presented with pseudodendritic keratoconjunctivitis with oral valacyclovir 500 mg orally three times per day and moxifloxacin 1 drop once daily to the right eye based on a presumed diagnosis of herpetic keratoconjunctivitis this patient however turned out to have a positive sars-cov-2 conjunctival swab result 67 the most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is human adenovirus hadv accounting for up to 75 of all conjunctivitis cases and affecting people of all ages and demographics as a coronavirus it can also cause systemic infections in the form of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease hadv causes lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea as well as latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells despite it being the most common ophthalmological viral infection there is no us food and drug administration-approved antiviral for treating hadv keratoconjunctivitis therefore managing viral persistance and dissemination constitute a challenge some treatment modalities have been investigated such as systemic and topical antivirals in-office povidone-iodine irrigation immunoglobulin-based therapy anti-inflammatory therapy and immunotherapy other posible therapeutic options are sialic acid analogs cold atmospheric plasma n-chlorotaurine and benzalkonium chloride 68 although viral conjunctivitis can cause discomfort to patients it is not a life-threatening condition therefore all the treatment efforts in patients testing positive for sars-cov-2 are destined to be vital problems rather than serious threats to the eye itself treatment for viral conjunctivitis is mostly supportive and the majority of cases are self-limited nonetheless it is important that ophthalmologists to decrease the possible viral load on the conjunctiva and decrease the potential of transmission through tear and eye secretions some of the general ophthalmic recommendations for viral conjunctivitis could apply to covid-19 patients in terms of reducing both the transmission rate and possible complications these include hygienic measures frequent hand washing especially when eye drops need to be applied or contact lens are worn avoiding touching or rubbing the eyes changing pillowcases sheets towels regularly not sharing personal items etc more studies should be conducted to establish a specific antiviral ocular treatment aimed at reducing the viral load if present on the conjunctiva of patients and reducing the transmission rate from the ophthalmological perspective however it is very difficult to determine a treatment when so many doubts still remain regarding the ophthalmic implications of sars-cov-2 infection 69 70 our review of the literature reveal that some studies suggest that ocular symptoms commonly appear in patients with severe covid pneumonia and that it is possible to detect viral rna from the conjunctival sac of these patients apparently conjunctivitis is not a frequent manifestation of the coronavirus disease in patients with non-severe covid-19 despite conjunctivitis generally being a self-limited and benign condition it is an important route of viral transmission and therefore prevention is the most important aspect to remember as ophthalmologists to protect our patients and ourselves  development of remdesivir repositioning as a nucleotide analog against covid-19 rna dependent rna polymerase mohammad babadaei mahdi anwarul hasan yasaman vahdani samir bloukh

replication of a piece of virus rna that could one day serve as a vaccine enayatkhani et al 2020 although well-developed dna sequencing devises has let to rapid genetic sequencing vaccine development is costly complex and time intensive plotkin et al 2017 this includes finding a viral sequence that while providing memory to the immune system does not lead to an acute inflammatory reaction achieving this goal requires laboratory experimentation on animal models before subjecting humans in addition once the vaccine is discovered it is not possible to dispatch the sample quickly and easily worldwide therefore pharmaceutical companies have generally found it more profitable to invest in drugs that are used for chronic medical conditions the cov as in case of influenza may undertake mutations and therefore would require continuous vaccine development with having a considerable number of people worldwide infected with covid-19 scientists have identified a number of cases

dalbavancin and monensin antibiotics also prevent viral replication andersen et al 2020 currently the bsaas are treatment or pyrophylaxis candidates against sars-cov-2 senanayake 2020 furthermore a combination of bsaas can be applied against a wider range of viruses such as those that are not yet well recognized or drug-resistant viruses wang cao et al 2020 potential clinical trials are currently being conducted on these drugs and their results will be published soon li  de clercq 2020 senanayake 2020 perhaps in a near future bsaas will be used to treat covid-19 patients although a number of bs have been reported to date in this review we focused on the rdv as a potential compound that has been assessed on the animal models and reaches the clinical phase against mers -cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 covs are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold virus to the cause of sars cascella et al 2020 paules et al 2020 the structure of cov has a common rna genome and is classified as enveloped viruses mackie 2003 sars-cov-2 originating in china and the city of wuhan is believed to be a member of the corona family which has infected many people to date lai et al 2020 despite the emergence of the virus in china it is spreading rapidly to other parts of the world lai et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 similar cases have been reported in other countries such as thailand south korea japan taiwan australia and the united states and even more recently in iran velavan  meyer 2020 zhu et al 2020 the disease can be spread through close contact with the infected person handling contaminated equipment and airborne outbreaks velavan  meyer 2020 most people with hypertension diabetes respiratory problems and weak immune systems are at the higher risk to infection and the likely death from it fang et al 2020 covs have four types of proteins including spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n hasan et al 2020 s protein is attached to the virus membrane and play an important role in binding and entry into the host cell hence targeting this protein with various drugs and inhibitors is one potential approach to combat these types of viruses chatterjee 2020 lai  cavanagh 1997 woo et al 2010 sars-cov-2 has proteins on its surface that mediate viral infection by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor batlle et al 2020 chen  hao 2020 therefore one promising way to stop infection by sars-cov-2 is to find a compound that blocks the receptor and consequently prevent the infection by preventing the interaction of s protein with ace2 receptor andersen et al 2020 joshi et al 2020 the cov also has 16 unstructured protein nsp 1-16 encoded by orf1a1b which act as important co-factors for activation of viral replication enzymes guo et al 2020 figure 1 although a recent research in china suggests bat as the potential source of the virus there are ongoing researches to clarify the exact origin of the virus guo et al 2020 figure 1 researches into the origin of sars outbreaks have led to the discovery of many bat viruses sars-cov-2 belongs to this category of sars-related viruses fung et al 2020 the two genome sequences of rhinolophus sinicus show 80 similarity with sars-cov-2 the third genome of the rhinolophus affinis virus ratg13 resembles 96 similarity with sars-cov-2 andersen et al 2020 to have better sense of this variation it is similar to the rate of mutation observed over ten years in the human h3n2 influenza virus strain wang et al 2020 rdv gs-5734 as a nucleotide analogue was originally developed to treat ebola tchesnokov et al 2019 the laboratory assessments has shown that rdv is effective against sars-cov ju et al 2020 and mers-cov gordon et al 2020 viruses therefore it can be used as a potential anti-viral agent against sars-cov-2 khan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the mechanism of rdvs anti-viral function is based on the blockage of viral rna transcription as revealed in molecular examinations using different recombinant viral polymerases jordan et al 2018 sarma et al 2020 tchesnokov et al 2019 warren et al 2016 siegel et al 2017 reported that gs-5734 can be used as a potential candidate for the treatment of ebola and emerging cov agostini et al 2018 reported that cov is susceptible to the rdv targeting the viral polymerase and the nsp14 exoribonuclease exon they compared the sensitivity of wt and exon - virus to rdv which exon - virus showed a greater decrease in viral titer in the presence of gs-5734 relative to wt virus and the determined ec50 value for exon - virus was around 0019 m whereas the ec50 value for to the wt was determined to be 0087 m figure 2ai this increased inhibition of exon - virus by gs-5734 figure 2aii indicated that gs-5734 is integrated into viral genome and can be excluded by exon agostini et al 2018 also it was shown that the type of cov concentration of antiviral drug type of anti-viral drug and incubation time can play an important role on the inhibition of virus infection figure 2biiii tchesnokov et al 2019 declared that the significant inhibition of ebola virus rna polymerase can be attributed to the anti-viral effect of rdv brown et al 2019 also reported that rdv stimulate its anti-viral effects through inhibition of rna polymerase in human cov oc43 hcov-oc43 figure 3ivi lo et al 2019 also displayed that rdv prevent nipah virus infection in monkeys furthermore to assess the reduction of mers-cov infection in vivo sheahan et al 2020 demonstrated that rdv stimulate superior antiviral function against mers-cov in cell culture and animal models as compared with other conventional anti-viral agents figure 4 furthermore they found that rdv was the only therapeutic agent which remarkably decreased pulmonary infection furthermore gordon et al 2020 and de wit et al 2020 revealed that rdv derives anti-viral effects against mers-cov though inhibition of rna polymerase as with sars-cov investigations treated by rdv similar outcomes were observed for mers-cov along with limited weight loss increased pulmonary activity and decreased virus replication sheahan et al 2017 the kinetics of sars- or mers-cov proliferation in animal models is significantly different compared to that in humans in animal sars-cov or mers-cov proliferation in the lung tissue reaches to the maximum at 2 dpi and mortality is stimulated at 710 dpi douglas et al 2018 sheahan et al 2017 thus the therapeutic window to control infected animal model prior to the peak of cov proliferation is less than 2 days in human mers-cov replication in the lung tissue reaches the maximum at 710 days after the onset of infections and the disease severity increases to death within 21 days choi et al 2016 oh et al 2016 thus the time for therapeutic handling is substantially divergent in humans and experimentally infected animal models although applying rdv led to a reduction in mers-cov pathogenesis and pronounced decrease in viral dose therapeutic handling did not thoroughly reduce infection furthermore at high levels of cov rdv is unable to sustain viral viability and pulmonary cells functionality despite of remarkable decrease in viral loads these outcomes are the same as those reported for sars-cov where therapeutic platforms were launched after the peak of virus titer and lung injury did not show any progress in resultant outcomes sheahan et al 2017 since sars- and mers-cov infections are controlled by both covs and host immune system modulators therefore early handling of antiviral therapeutics either solely or in combination with other therapeutic drugs and based on the stage of the disorder progression can inhibit virus proliferation and immunopathology switch on repairing systems or control the pulmonary homeostasis arising viral disorders have resulted in meaningful catastrophic pandemics genetic exploration in animal models have shown a pronounced mutation of viral genome in the case of cov and have even pointed out some viruses indistinguishable to ongoing and past pathogenic strains in animals ge et al 2013 woo et al 2006 therefore in the absence of fda-approved therapeutics for reducing the human cov infection useful broad-spectrum therapeutic platforms against well-known epidemic and zoonotic strains probably pave a way for diminishing the current epidemic diseases in the case of cov patients were received off-label anti-viral drugs as well as immunomodulators either solely or combined to reduce severe disease symptoms zumla et al 2016 however due to the lack of patient therapeutic consistency and verified standard efficiency measurement is a complicated process although interferon does not result in improved clinical consequence in mers-cov patients morra et al 2018 a fixed dose combination of lopinavirritonavir-interferon  is efficient to reduce mers-cov infections arabi et al 2018 muralidharan et al 2020 sheahan et al 2020 showed that rdv stimulated superior anti-viral function against mers-cov both in vitro and in vivo in comparison with lopinavirritonavir-interferon  nucleosidenucleotide analogues inhibit virus replication by blocking the activity of the polymerase enzyme in the virus chhikara et al 2020 menndez-arias et al 2014 the usage of nucleosidenucleotide analogues is a major step in the treatment of patients infected with covs due to the appropriate antiviral response chhikara et al 2020 however the application of these drugs may lead to genetic variation and subsequent mutation emergence hence the safety of rdv and its broad-spectrum anti-viral activity should be considered before suggesting them as potential alternative candidates for clinical development over the recent years animal model progression of rdv seems to orient primarily on cov respiratory infections sheahan et al 2020 clinical trials in selective patient populations with cov or cov-like diseases are needed to examine the efficacy of the developed drugs regarding safety data for rdv some necessary studies in covid-19 patients should be conducted to proceed the clinical trials studies over cov-like diseases will probably require the enrollment of a large number of infected patients there is currently no approved antiviral drug against sars-cov-2 to treat hospitalized patients moreover clinical trials over covid-19 patients seems to be complicated due to several factors such as inability to apply a placebo underlying diseases and evaluating anti-viral drug efficiency if the synergistic activity of rdv and other anti-viral agents in cell cultures is approved by the current phase 3 clinical trials in patients with sars-cov-2 the outcome may propose a way for developing and performing clinical trials of the relative integration to rdv monotherapy and other anti-viral drug monotherapy for treating patients hospitalized with covid-19 ongoing and future perspectives are trying to determine the resistance of different covs to rdv both in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate whether the mutational strains behave in a same way as wild types due to the emergence of a new respiratory infections such as the sars-cov-2 progression of animal studies and subsequent preclinical and clinical trials are required to explore the activity of rdv some preclinical explorations are ongoing to examine the potential of the rdv against the sars-cov-2 given application history of rdv in treating a wide range of infections as well as the outcomes from clinical trials in patients with sars-and mers-cov reinforces the rationale for additional trials of rdv against a wider range of infectious including covid-19 the ongoing studies in sars-cov-2 supported by the who is expected to furnish potential data corresponding to rdv application in treating covid-19 other similar investigations may be envisioned with respect to the increasing identifications of the importance of covs as a driving force of covid-19 apart from the potential progression of rdv for treating sars- and mers-covs the emergence of other viral illnesses may pave the way for clinical trials of rdv derivatives  the contact activation system as a potential therapeutic target in patients with covid19 joseph shatzel j emma deloughery p christina lorentz u erik tucker i joseph aslan e monica hinds t david gailani jeffrey weitz i owen mccarty j andras gruber   patients with coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 may succumb to a systemic cytokine release syndrome which has prompted therapeutic trials of biologic agents targeting interleukin il6 tocilizumab sarilumab and other inflammatory mediators a singlearm study of tocilizumab in 20 patients with severe or critical covid19related pneumonia undertaken during the outbreak in china reported a reduction in oxygen requirements and improvement in pulmonary imaging in 75 and 90 of patients respectively
1
 the us food and drug administration has since approved a phase 3 clinical trial of tocilizumab actemra genentech in patients with covid19 with pneumonia

 dysregulated coagulation with hypercoagulability is common with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 infection and can progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation dic a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with severe sarscov2 infection found that 714 of patients who ultimately died from covid19 developed overt dic compared with only 06 of survivors on admission nonsurviving patients presented with higher ddimer levels and prolonged prothrombin times and activated partial thromboplastin times compared with surviving patients
3
 furthermore recent retrospective analyses have suggested that anticoagulation with heparin may improve clinical outcomes in patients with critical covid19
4
 and autopsy reports from patients who died from severe covid19related respiratory failure note intraalveolar fibrin accumulation suggesting a loss of vascular integrity
5

 pathologic upregulation of inflammation and coagulation in response to sarscov2 infection has led to significant enthusiasm for mobilizing clinical trials targeting either pathway
6
 in this paper we propose that targeting contact activation is a rational target for clinical trials in patients with covid19 at risk for respiratory compromise based on i animal models showing that inhibiting contact activation prevents pathologic host inflammatory responses to certain infections or bacterial challenge ii clinical rationale that inhibiting contact activation may be safe in critically ill patients and is unlikely to provoke significant bleeding or compromise the immune system and iii several contact activation inhibitors are in clinical development and are potentially available for rapid clinical trial implementation the molecular complex of contact activation composed of factor xii fxii factor xi fxi prekallikrein and highmolecularweight kininogen serves as a central node linking the coagulation and inflammation pathways figure 1 contact activation not only leads to thrombin generation but also upregulation of the kallikreinkinin system kks thrombin generation may also upregulate the kks through feedback activation of fxii via thrombininduced fxi activation kallikrein induces the generation of bradykinin which interacts with the reninangiotensin system and induces the release of inflammatory cytokines leading to complement activation and enhanced fibrinolysis as outlined below knockout or selective inhibition of components of the contact activation system inhibits both fibrin generation and systemic inflammation in animal models recent clinical trials suggest that inhibition of fxi attenuates thrombosis with little effect on hemostasis although the effect of inhibiting fxi in humans with infection is unknown
7

 several studies have evaluated the effects of fxi knockout in murine models of bacterial challenge fxi knockout mice develop a less severe coagulopathy and lower serum cytokine levels than wildtype mice when challenged with listeria monocytogenes plasma inflammatory markers including il6 and hepatic mrna encoding il6 and il10 were significantly attenuated correlating with improved survival 30 vs 67
8

 likewise in a cecal ligation and puncture model designed to mimic polymicrobial peritoneal sepsis fxi knockout mice experienced less consumptive coagulopathy than wildtype mice
9
 prothrombin times increased significantly in wildtype mice but remained unchanged in fxideficient animals mice that lacked fxi clearly developed a less pronounced coagulopathy and relatively attenuated inflammatory response compared with wildtype controls and this translated directly to a significant survival advantage 46 vs 13 this experimental model was later replicated to further define the changes in inflammatory cytokine levels and coagulation profiles in fxi knockout mice compared with wildtype mice fxideficient mice demonstrated significantly lower plasma levels of il1 il6 il10 and tumor necrosis factor tnf during the infection survival at 7 days was also significantly higher in the fxi knockout mice 39 vs 6
10

 however pharmacologicl inhibition of fxia or deficiency of fxi has the potential to impair hemostasis which may already be compromised during some infections therefore inhibition of other components of the contact activation complex have been evaluated the murine monoclonal antibody 14e11 which binds to the a2 domain of fxi and selectively disrupts reciprocal activation of fxi and fxii without affecting activation of fxi by thrombin or fix activation by fxia had beneficial effects in the cecal ligation and puncture model described above including significantly improved survival 80 vs 45 on postmortem organ evaluation only 40 of 14e11treated mice had evidence of hepatic vascular microthrombi as compared with 75 of the control group levels of inflammatory cytokines including tnf and il6 were significantly lower in the 14e11treated mice
11
 administration of 14e11 to l monocytogenesinfected mice also improved survival
8

 similarly preclinical studies have evaluated the role of fxii in health and disease fxii knockout mice are protected from experimentally induced thrombosis in numerous models while displaying normal hemostatic capacity
12
 upregulated fxii activation is the cause of certain forms of hereditary angioedema and leads to excess bradykinin generation complement activation increased vascular permeability and edema the monoclonal antibody 3f7 that inhibits the activity of fxiia has been shown to be protective against bradykinin generation and edema in mouse models of hereditary angioedema and to prevent bradykinin generation in plasma from humans with hereditary angioedema
13
 the recombinant version of the antibody csl312 is currently under clinical development for treatment or prevention of hereditary angioedema
14
 finally ixodes ricinus contact phase inhibitor a dual inhibitor of fxia and fxiia isolated from the saliva of i ricinus ticks has been shown to be attenuate thrombosis in animal models without apparent detriment to hemostasis
15
 the effect of simultaneous inhibition of fxia and fxiia in humans remains unknown systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs can emerge after a variety of serious insults including trauma blood loss amniotic fluid or fat embolism and severe viral or bacterial infections and can lead to organ failure and death inhibition of contact activation may attenuate development of sirs and reduce mortality antibodymediated inhibition of fxiia improved outcomes in a baboon model of lethal escherichia coli challenge
16
 rapidly developing fatal hypotension after infusion of cultured e coli was attenuated with 1 in 5 20 survival in the group that received a fxiia inhibitory antibody c6b7 a later study demonstrated that baboons pretreated with c6b7 before e coli exposure also exhibited reduced complement activation neutrophil degranulation and levels of tissuetype plasminogen activator tpa and il6 compared with untreated controls
17

 more recent nonhuman primate work by silasi et al
18
 investigated the effects of the recombinant monoclonal antifxi antibody 3g3 ab023 a humanized variant of the mouse antifxi antibody 14e11 discussed above in baboons that received an intravenous lethal dose of inactivated s aureus all animals given prophylactic 3g3 survived to 7 days as compared with none in the untreated control arm administration of 3g3 reduced the consumptive coagulopathy as reflected by shorter partial thromboplastin times and resulted in fewer respiratory complications less tachypnea and reduced fever as compared with untreated controls serum biomarkers of endorgan dysfunction were also significantly decreased upon postmortem analysis no microvascular thrombi were detected in the lungs kidneys and livers of the 3g3treated baboons and organs appeared normal on histopathologic evaluation in contrast extensive microvascular thrombosis and organ damage were detected in untreated animals
18

 inhibition of reciprocal fxi and fxii activation with 3g3 resulted in a marked blunting of the cytokine storm usually associated with bacteremia and sepsis plasma levels of il6 il8 monocyte chemoattractant protein1 granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor and il1 were lower in fxiinhibited nonhuman primates treated animals also displayed decreased contact prekallikrein fibrinolytic tpa and complement cascade activation reflected by lower levels of circulating c3b and c5b9 terminal complement complex
18
 a more recent preliminary study with 5c12 an antibody that directly inhibits fxiia in the same baboon model of lethal sirs yielded results similar to those observed with 3g3
19

 while the contact activation system of coagulation leads to thrombin generation and appears to contribute to the development of thrombosis it seems to be mostly dispensable for hemostasis epidemiologic data suggest that individuals with congenital fxi deficiency are largely protected against venous and arterial thrombosis while usually having only a mild bleeding diathesis with little or no spontaneous bleeding and the bleeding with hemostatic challenge trauma major surgery often does not require treatment importantly congenital fxii deficiency while rare is not associated with abnormal bleeding
12
 the relative safety of reducing fxi activity in humans was demonstrated in a prospective clinical trial of an antisense oligonucleotide that reduced plasma fxi levels in surgical patients partial reduction in fxi levels was an effective method for prevention of postoperative venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective knee arthroplasty and was associated with a trend for less bleeding than traditional anticoagulation
20
 similarly antibodymediated inhibition of fxia was associated with a trend for less bleeding than that observed with lowmolecularweight heparin in a large prospective trial of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing elective knee arthroplasty
21
 in a phase 1 trial ab023 appeared to be safe without any notable drugrelated adverse effects in healthy volunteers
22
 while recent retrospective analyses have suggested anticoagulation with heparin products may improve clinical outcomes in patients with covid19
4
 selective targeting of contact activation may offer a more refined approach with no impact on hemostasis and would likely be associated with fewer bleeding complications however the safety of inhibiting the contact activation system in patients with bacterial or viral infections has not been assessed innate immunity does not appear to be compromised in humans with congenital fxi or fxii deficiency although fxi deficiency has been associated with nasal infections in holstein cattle
23
 epidemiologic studies of humans with fxi deficiency reported identical rates of hospitalization for pneumonia and pneumoniarelated outcomes as controls with normal fxi levels to our knowledge there are no reports linking human fxi deficiency with an immunocompromised phenotype
24
 thus while contact activation appears to contribute to proinflammatory and procoagulant pathways in humans the absence of fxi does not seem to significantly compromise host defense or hemostasis it should be noted that results from a study of a mouse model of pneumonia conflict with this premise thus stroo and colleagues
25
 
26
 showed that administering streptococcus pneumoniae or klebsiella into the lungs resulted in more inflammation and higher mortality in fxideficient mice than in wildtype mice while raising a cautionary note these findings may represent a speciesspecific effect like that observed in holstein cattle it is reassuring that the aforementioned epidemiologic study found no increase in the frequency of pneumonia in fxideficient humans compared with those with normal fxi levels furthermore in those with pneumonia there was no significant difference in severity or shortterm mortality
24
 we posit that a strategy directly targeting fxii or targeting the link between fxii and fxi will not produce the same effect as complete deficiency of fxi and importantly leave the hemostatic function of fxi intact however it will be important to monitor the response when directly targeting or eliminating the function of the kks in patients with pneumonia multiple agents targeting fxi and one targeting fxii have been evaluated in earlyphase clinical trials inhibitors of fxi under evaluation include ionisfxi rx a fxi antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits hepatic synthesis of fxi maa868 abelacimab a monoclonal antibody that binds the catalytic domain of both fxi and fxia osocimab bay1213790 a monoclonal antibody that only binds the catalytic domain of fxia bay1831865 a monoclonal antibody that binds the a3 domain of fxi and prevents fxiamediated activation of fix and jnj70033093 and bay2433334 which are smallmolecule inhibitors of fxia more selective inhibitors of contact activation upstream of fxia include ab023 3g3 a monoclonal antibody that binds fxi and inhibits its activation by fxiia and fxii activation by fxia and csl312 a monoclonal antibody that inhibits fxiia
14
 
27

 preclinical data and rationale exist for preventing the activation of fxi and fxii while preserving some of the hemostatic fxi activity in patients with covid19 to our knowledge of these drugs only ab023 3g3 has been tested in infection models and has shown promise in preventing the systemic inflammatory response clinical decompensation and death in a nonhuman primate model of lethal bacterial challenge by targeting the reciprocal activation of fxi and fxii ab023 breaks the connection between activation of fxii by foreign surfaces that may get exposed during bacterial and viral infections thereby downregulating activation of fxi and the kks moreover selectively inhibiting the pathologic interaction between fxii and fxi to prevent deleterious thrombin and kallikrein generation would still preserve the hemostatic function of fix activation by thrombininduced fxi activation therefore fxi activation by fxiia by virtue of its position as an interface between contact activation and thrombin generation may represent a unique target to safely prevent or treat covid19related inflammatory complications including the cytokine response and the coagulopathy and to reduce associated mortality the world is in the midst of a pandemic the time course and resolution of which is unclear in such times it is the responsibility of the scientific and medical community to quickly develop welldesigned clinical trials rationally based on preclinical and clinical data we propose the fxii  fxi axis as a rational therapeutic target a potential clinical trial could include prophylaxis against decompensation in covid19 patients with severe disease as evidenced by a reduction in the need for ventilator treatment shorter time to ventilator weaning or reduced progression to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation the hemostatic safety and potential effects on the innate immune response will need to be monitored as part of this novel approach in addition to these clinically relevant end points which may free up vital resources the available preclinical data suggest that inhibition of contact activation has the potential to improve survival in patients with sarscov2 infectioninduced severe covid19 ag cul dg eit aronora vanderbilt university medical center and oregon health sciences university may have a financial interest in this study jjs and jiw are consultants for aronora inc the remaining authors declare nothing to report jjs wrote the manuscript ag conceived the concept ag cul eit mth and ojtm developed contact activation inhibitors ag dg epd ja jiw and ojtm provided critical input for the manuscript all authors read and approved the manuscript authors of this work were supported by grants from the national institutes of health national institute of general medical sciences gm116184 ojtm national heart lung and blood institute hl101972 ojtm hl140025 dg hl128016 and hl106919 ag cul and eit national institute of allergy and infectious diseases ai088937 ag cul and eit and national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ns077600 ag cul and eit  hiv and shifting epicenters for covid-19 an alert for some countries emile doungmo goufo f yasir khan qasim chaudhry ali   it is in december 2019 that a new pneumonia today known as coronavirus disease 2019 or shorlty covid-19 locally started off in the chinese city of wuhan as of 30 may 2020 the world recorded almost 596 million cases of covid-19 reported worldwide in about 188 countries nations and territories among those reported cases almost 366000 people have succumbed to the disease fig 1
and fig 8
 but fortunately almost 252 million people have recovered it is only on 11 march 2020 that the world health organization who declared the covid-19 a pandemic maybe this unprecedented situation since the 1918 spanish flu pandemic 1 would have been different if the alert call from li wenliang 2 was taken into consideration on time by chinese authorities hence the worldwide epicenter of the disease has since hit several countries from china to usa via italy spain and uk fig 2
to fig 4
and fig 6
 it has now moved to the southern hemisphere country of brazil with the winter season fig 4 highly contagious covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and has been proven to spread easily when cold winter conditions are met in fact some research made recently 3 have shown that the sars-cov-2 can easily spread in communities that live in places where the temperature is relatively low around 5 to 11 degrees celsius all associated with low specific of around 3 to 6 gkg and absolute humidity of around 4 to 7 gm
3 as southern hemisphere moves to the winter season there are worries to feel for two particular countries whose the number of deaths keeps rising chile and south africa fig 5
and fig 7
 more worries for south africa as the country stands not only as the current most covid-19 affected country in africa but also the most hiv affected country moreover the alarming situation in brazil should be a huge concern for south africa as both countries face similar precarious social issues as shown in table 1
 recent statistics 4 5 show that covid-19 mostly kills people with pre-existing diseases such as diabetes high blood pressure tuberculosis and also hiv hence this motivated us to study in this paper a combined hiv-covid-19 model is order to start another alert call for those concerned countries at risk as commonly done in mathematical epidemiology for other type of diseases 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 we start by formulating the model and clarifying the assumptions that will be used throughout in this section a simple system modeling the temporal dynamics of the corona virus 2019-ncov combined to hiv within human population is described as we dont have yet all the answers on the real dynamics and spread of the new 2019-ncov we focus on people who are already covid-19 infectious symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals we assume the people population np to be constant and divide it into four different compartments according to their status with respect to the diseases hence at the t we denote by spspt the fraction of the people population that are susceptible by icict the fraction of the people population that is covid-19 only infectious by ihiht the fraction of the people population that is hiv only infectious by ihcihct the fraction of the people population that is dually infectious with hiv and covid-19 we assume that the covid-19 infection process originates from a reservoir or a source of infection called  with animals pangolin or bats etc with a total population of nrnrt that can be divided into two different compartments the susceptible to covid-19 srsrt and covid-19 infectious irirt we assume that individuals in the susceptible compartment are recruited into the people population at a rate p which is constant infections with covid-19 of those individuals happen at a rate of c due to sufficient contact with infected animals in  and they then move to the compartment of covid-19 infectious individuals ic moreover infections with hiv happen at a rate of h due to sufficient contact with infected individuals and therefore susceptible individuals move to the compartment of hiv infectious individuals ih people who are infected with covid-19 only either recover thanks to their own immunity and are moved at a rate of  into the compartment of susceptible individuals or are infected with hiv due to sufficient contact with infected individuals at the fraction rate of h with   0 1 recall 16 that  is taken as such because we expect an eventual drop of sexual intercourse principal known cause of hiv transmission of people who are infected with covid-19 due to the disease they then move into the compartment ihc of dually infectious with hiv and covid-19 the disease covid-19 kills people at the rate of c people who are infected with hiv only either die due to the disease or get the infection with corona virus at the rate of h due to sufficient contact with infected source they then move into the compartment ihc of dually infectious with hiv and covid-19 here we take   1 since people infected with hiv have a lower immune system and therefore are highly susceptible to catch covid-19 individuals with both hiv and covid-19 can recover from covid-19 thanks to own immunity and are moved at a rate of  into the compartment of individuals infected with hiv only or die from covid-19 at the rate of c here we take   1 because of the high probability of mortality within the people in ihc with both hiv and covid-19 compared to individuals infected with covid-19 only furthermore individuals with both hiv and covid-19 can also die hiv at a rate of h here we take   1 because of the high probability of mortality within the people in ihc with both hiv and covid-19 compared to individuals infected with hiv only we denote by h the rate at which death due natural causes occurs we assume that susceptible animals in  are recruited into the population nr at a rate of r which is constant we assume that those animals can die the rate of c or can become infected with covid-19 at a rate of r due to sufficient contact with infected animals and then move to the compartment of covid-19 infectious ir based on the above setting the dynamics of the system is given by the transfer diagram as depicted in fig 10

 our aim here in this section is to look at the conditions under which there exists a backward bifurcation for the model 10 recall that this type of bifurcation happens when a stable dfe and a stable endemic equilibrium exist together for some values of the basic reproduction number rc less than one hence we have to find conditions for which endemic equilibrium espicsrir we pose0picchsp0csphcic0rcrsr0rsrcirwhich yieldsspphcchchhc

 the numbers of victims and fatalities due to hiv and the new coronavirus remain a fateful scourge around the world the combination of both will certainly be explosive for most affected countries we especially think of southern hemisphere countries getting out the summer and moving into the winter season it is urgent for those countries like south africa and chile to be alerted while it is still time to react efficiently indeed the world has ignored the first alert made before the pandemic by the young and now late chinese doctor li wenliang and this is paper serves as a covid-19 alert for southern hemisphere countries like chile and south africa that are moving into the winter season and seeing to be heavily hit by the pandemic as winter moved to the southern hemisphere we also observed the epicenter of the new coronavirus shifting there to brazil which shares similar features such as favellas townships poverty promiscuity with south africa and chile we have then used a generalized simple mathematical model of hiv-covid-19 together with graphs curves and tables to compare the pandemic situation in countries that were once the epicenter of the the disease such as china italy spain united kingdom and united states of america we managed to show conditions for existence of stable equilibria and of different bifurcation forward and backward scenarios for the model the fractional generalized covid-19 model has been solved numerically and a predicted prevalence for the covid-19 has been provided there is a ground to be concerned for southern hemisphere countries now since it happens that all those countries that were once epicenter were in their winter season during their status of epicenter of the covid-19 and opted to ease the lockdown only after the peak of the disease was reached the epicenter is now in brazil in full winter season and we observe its health system and emergency services overcrowded by a large number of covid-19 patients and deaths recent data show an increasing number of infections in chile and south africa the combination with hiv cannot help moreover still far from seeing the disease reaching its peak in the country south africa who has just enter into the winter season opted to reopen the countrys activities and schools this is exactly the opposite of what was observed in western countries recall that south africa stands now as the most covid-19 affected country in africa and is it going to be the next epicenter in weeks to come when winter conditions favorable to the spread of the new coronavirus will be comfily installed the answer is certainly affirmative seeing the social conditions in townships all over the country the country has however started imposing social distanciation wearing a face mask in public services hiring of more health workers and targeted community tests will this be enough as the country chose to reopen most of it economic sectors as from the 1 june 2020 which coincides with beginning of its winter season we can now ask whether the lockdown that started on the 26 march 2020 was at the right moment the coming months will tell us lastly another worrying alert is the fact that winter is still going to move to europe and we may see again the epicenter shifting towards the north unless a cure or vaccine is found by then again the future months will tell us

novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was recently identified in patients with an acute respiratory syndrome covid-19 to compare its pathogenesis with that of previously emerging coronaviruses we inoculated cynomolgus macaques with sars-cov-2 or mers-cov and compared with historical sars-cov infections in sars-cov-2-infected macaques virus was 5 excreted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs and detected in type i and ii pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and mucous glands of the nasal cavity in sars-cov-infection lung lesions were typically more severe while they were milder in mers-cov infection where virus was detected mainly in type ii pneumocytes these data show that sars-cov-2 can cause a covid-19-like disease and suggest that the severity of sars-cov-2 infection 10 is intermediate between that of sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 infection in macaques results in covid-19-like disease with prolonged virus excretion from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs main text  following the first reports of an outbreak of an acute respiratory syndrome 2019 coronavirus disease or in china in december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified 1 2 as of march 14 2020 over 140000 cases were reported worldwide with over 20 5400 deaths surpassing the combined number of cases and deaths of two previously emerging coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov 3  covid-19 is characterized by a range of symptoms including fever cough dyspnoea and myalgia in most cases 2 in severe cases bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity is the most common chest ct finding 4  similar to the 20022003 outbreak of sars severity of covid-19 disease is associated with 25 increased age andor a comorbidity although severe disease is not limited to these risk groups 5  however despite the large number of cases and deaths limited information is available on the pathogenesis of this virus infection two reports on the histological examination of the lungs of three patients showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage dad pulmonary oedema and hyaline membrane formation indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards as well as 30 characteristic syncytial cells in the alveolar lumen 6 7  similar to findings during the 20022003 outbreak of sars-cov 8  the pathogenesis of sars-cov infection was previously studied in a non-human primate model where aged animals were more likely to develop disease 9 10 11 12 13  in the current study sars-cov-2 infection was characterized in the same animal model using cynomolgus macaques and compared with infection with mers-cov and historical data on 35 sars-cov 9 10 12  first two groups of four cynomolgus macaques both young adult 4-5 years of age and aged 15-20 years of age were inoculated via a combined intratracheal it and intranasal in route with a sars-cov-2 strain from a german traveller returning from china no overt clinical signs were observed in any of the infected animals with the exception of a serous nasal discharge in one aged 40 animal on day 14 post inoculation pi no significant weight loss was observed in any of the animals during the study by day 14 pi all remaining animals seroconverted as revealed by the presence of sars-cov-2 specific antibodies against the s1 domain and nucleocapsid proteins in their sera fig s1  as a measure of virus shedding nasal throat and rectal swabs were assayed for virus by rt-qpcr and virus culture in nasal swabs detection of sars-cov-2 rna peaked by day 2 pi in young adult animals and day 4 pi in aged animals and was detected up to at least day 8 pi in two out of 5 four animals and up to day 21 pi in one out of four animals fig 1a  overall higher levels of sars-cov-2 rna were detected in nasal swabs of aged animals compared to young adult animals sars-cov-2 rna detection in throat swabs peaked at day 1 pi in young adult and day 4 pi in aged animals and decreased more rapidly over time compared to nasal swabs but could still be detected intermittently up to day 10 pi fig 1b  low levels of infectious virus could be 10 cultured from nasal and throat swabs up to day 4 and 2 respectively table s1  sars-cov-2 rna could only be detected in a rectal swab from 1 animal on day 14 pi and no viral rna could be detected in whole blood at any time point throughout the study upon autopsy of four macaques on day 4 pi two had foci of pulmonary consolidation in the lungs  fig 2a  one animal aged 17 years in the right middle lobe representing less than 5 of the 15 lung tissue a second animal young adult 5 years had two foci in the left lower lobe representing about 10 of the lung tissue  fig 2a  the consolidated lung tissue was well-circumscribed redpurple level and less buoyant than normal the other organs in these two macaques as well as the respiratory tract and other organs of the other two animals were normal virus replication was assessed by rt-qpcr on day 4 pi in tissues from the respiratory digestive 20 urinary and cardiovascular tracts from endocrine and central nervous systems as well as from various lymphoid tissues virus replication was primarily restricted to the respiratory tract nasal cavity trachea bronchi and lung lobes with highest levels of sars-cov-2 rna in lungs fig  1c  interestingly in three out of four animals sars-cov-rna was also detected in ileum and tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes fig 1c  25 the main histological lesion in the consolidated pulmonary tissue involved the alveoli and bronchioles and consisted of areas with acute or more advanced dad fig 2b  in these areas the lumina of alveoli and bronchioles were variably filled with protein-rich oedema fluid fibrin and cellular debris a moderate number of alveolar macrophages and fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes  fig 2c -e there was epithelial necrosis with extensive loss of epithelium from 30 alveolar and bronchiolar walls hyaline membranes were present in a few damaged alveoli in areas with more advanced lesions the alveolar walls were moderately thickened and lined by cuboidal epithelial cells type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia and the alveolar lumina were empty alveolar and bronchiolar walls were thickened by oedema fluid mononuclear cells and neutrophils there were aggregates of lymphocytes around small pulmonary vessels moderate 35 numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the bronchial walls and a few neutrophils in the bronchial epithelium regeneration of epithelium was seen in some bronchioles visible as an irregular layer of squamous to high cuboidal epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei there were occasional multinucleated giant cells syncytia free in the lumina of bronchioles and alveoli fig 2f  and based on positive pan-keratin staining and 40 negative cd68 staining originated from epithelial cells fig 2f inset  sars-cov-2 antigen expression was detected in moderate numbers of type i pneumocytes and a few type ii pneumocytes in foci of dad fig 2g fig s2  the pattern of staining was similar to that in lung tissue from sars-cov-infected macaques positive control sars-cov-2 antigen expression was not observed in any of the syncytia in the upper respiratory tract there was focal or locally extensive sars-cov-2 antigen expression in epithelial cells of mucous glands in the 5 nasal cavity septum or concha of all four macaques without any associated histological lesions  fig 2i  in order to assess the severity of infection with sars-cov-2 compared to that with the previously emerged mers-cov young adult cynomolgus macaques 3-5 years of age were inoculated with mers-cov via the in and it route all animals remained free of clinical signs at day 21 pi all 10 remaining animals n2 seroconverted as revealed by the presence of mers-cov specific antibodies in their sera by elisa mers-cov rna was detected in nasal fig 3a  and throat swabs fig 3b  from days 1 to 11 pi with peaks on days 1 and 2 pi respectively low levels of mers-cov rna were detected in rectal swabs on days 2 and 3 pi data not shown 15 upon autopsy of four macaques at day 4 pi three out of four macaques had foci of pulmonary consolidation characterized by slightly depressed areas in the lungs representing less than 5  of the lung tissue table 1  similar to sars-cov-2 on day 4 pi mers-cov rna was primarily detected in the respiratory tract of inoculated animals fig 3c  infectious virus titres were comparable to sars-cov-2 but lower compared to sars-cov infection of young adult 20 macaques table 1  in addition mers-cov rna was detected in the spleen table 1  consistent with the presence of virus in the lower respiratory tract at day 4 pi histopathological changes characteristic for dad were observed in the lungs of inoculated animals fig 3d  the alveolar septa were thickened due to infiltration of few neutrophils and macrophages and moderate type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy in the alveolar lumina there were 25 increased numbers of alveolar macrophages and occasionally small amounts of oedema fluid with fibrin and few neutrophils fig 3d  few syncytial cells were seen in the alveolar lumina interestingly mers-cov antigen was not detected in tissues on day 4 pi in any part of the respiratory tract therefore four young adult macaques were included at an earlier time point day 1 pi on day 1 pi there was multifocal expression of viral antigen predominantly in type ii 30 pneumocytes and occasionally in type i pneumocytes bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells and few macrophages fig 3d  in summary we inoculated young adult and aged cynomolgus macaques with a low passage clinical isolates of sars-cov-2 which resulted in productive infection in the absence of overt clinical signs increased age did not affect disease outcome but there was prolonged viral shedding 35 in the upper respiratory tract of aged animals prolonged shedding has been observed in both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov patients 14 15  interestingly sars-cov-2 in our model peaked early in the course of infection similar to what is seen in patients 14  this earlier peak in virus shedding for sars-cov-2 is more similar to influenza virus shedding 16 than sars-cov where shedding peaked around day 10 post onset of symptoms 15  and may explain why case 40 detection and isolation may not be as effective for sars-cov-2 as it was for the control of sars-cov 17  also all four macaques expressed sars-cov-2 antigen in mucous glands of the nasal cavity at day 4 pi which was not seen for sars-cov 9 10 11 or mers-cov infections this manuscript in this animal model viral tropism for the nasal mucosa fits with efficient respiratory transmission as has been seen for influenza a virus 18  sars-cov-2 was primarily detected in tissues of the respiratory tract however sars-cov-2 rna was also detectable in other tissues such as intestines in line with a recent report 19 5 two out of four animals had foci of dad on day 4 pi the colocalisation of sars-cov-2-antigen expression and dad provides strong evidence that sars-cov-2 infection caused this lesion the histological character of the dad including alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial necrosis alveolar oedema hyaline membrane formation and accumulation of neutrophils macrophages and lymphocytes corresponds with the limited pathological analyses of human covid-19 cases 6 10 7 in particular the presence of syncytia in the lung lesions is characteristic of respiratory coronavirus infections whereas mers-cov primarily infects type ii pneumocytes in cynomolgus macaques both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 also infect type i pneumocytes injury to type i pneumocytes can result in pulmonary oedema and formation of hyaline membranes 20  which may explain why hyaline membrane formation is a hallmark for sars and covid-19 7 10 but   immunogenicity of a dna vaccine candidate for covid-19 trevor

weiner b kate broderick e   covid-19 known previously as 2019-ncov pneumonia or disease has emerged as a global public health crisis joining severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in a growing number of coronavirus-associated illnesses which have jumped from animals to people there are at least seven identified coronaviruses that infect humans in december 2019 the city of wuhan in china became the epicenter for an outbreak of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 was isolated and sequenced from human airway epithelial cells from infected patients12 disease symptoms range from mild flu-like to severe cases with life-threatening pneumonia3 the global situation is dynamically evolving and on 30 january 2020 the world health organization declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern pheic and on 11 march 2020 it was declared a global pandemic as of 1 may 2020 there are 3321402 people confirmed infected and 237180 deaths4 infections have spread to multiple continents human-to-human transmission has been observed in multiple countries and a shortage of disposable personal protective equipment5 and prolonged survival times of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces6 have compounded this already delicate situation and heightened the risk of nosocomial infections advanced research activities must be pursued in parallel to push forward protective modalities in an effort to protect billions of vulnerable individuals worldwide currently no licensed preventative vaccine is available for covid-19 to address the urgent need for a medical countermeasure to prevent the further dissemination of sars-cov-2 we have employed a synthetic dna-based vaccine approach synthetic dna vaccines are amenable to accelerated developmental timelines due to the ability to quickly design multiple candidates for preclinical testing scalable manufacturing of large quantities of the drug product and the possibility to leverage established regulatory pathways to the clinic synthetic dna is temperature-stable and cold-chain free important features for delivery to resource-limited settings7 specifically for the development of a covid-19 vaccine candidate we leveraged prior experiences in developing vaccine approaches to sars-cov8 and our own experience in developing a mers-cov vaccine ino-4700910 as well as taking advantage of our vaccine design and manufacturing pathway previously utilized for the zika vaccine candidate gls-570011 which was advanced to the clinic in under 7 months ino-4700 and gls-5700 vaccines are currently in clinical testing prior work has demonstrated that a dna approach for sars and mers can drive neutralizing antibody nab responses and provide protection in challenge models810 our previous studies indicated immunization of small and large animal models with dna vaccines encoding mers-cov spike s protein provided protection against disease challenge with the matched virus in subjects immunized with ino-4700 mers-cov s protein dna vaccine durable neutralizing antibodies nabs and t cell immune responses were measured and a seroconversion rate of 96 was observed and immunity was followed for 60 weeks in most study volunteers9 ino-4700 phase 12a testing is continuing in south korea and a larger phase 2 study is being planned to begin in the middle east both areas which have been most affected by mers infections the sars-cov-2 spike is most similar in sequence and structure to sars-cov spike protein12 and shares a global protein fold architecture with the mers-cov spike protein fig 1 allowing us to build on our prior vaccine construct design10 unlike glycoproteins of hiv and influenza the prefusion form of the coronavirus trimeric spike is conformationally dynamic fully exposing the receptor-binding site infrequently13 the receptor-binding site is a vulnerable target for nabs in fact mers nabs targeted at the receptor-binding domain rbd tend to have greater neutralizing potency than other epitopes14 a recent report demonstrated that an anti-sars antibody could cross-react to the rbd of sars-cov-215 these data suggest that the sars-cov-2 rbd is an important target for vaccine development recent data has revealed sars-cov-2 s protein binds the same host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as sars-cov s protein12 here we describe the design and initial preclinical testing of covid-19 synthetic dna vaccine candidates we show the expression of the sars-cov-2 s antigen rna and protein after in vitro transfection of cos-7 and 293t cells respectively with the vaccine candidates we followed the induction of immunity by the selected immunogen in mice and guinea pigs measuring sars-cov-2 s protein-specific antibody levels in serum and in the lung fluid and antibody functionality through competitive inhibition of ace2 binding pseudovirus and live virus neutralization the ino-4800 vaccine induces cellular and humoral host immune responses that can be observed within days following a single immunization including cross-reactive responses against sars-cov the data demonstrate the immunogenicity of this covid-19 synthetic dna vaccine candidate targeting the sars-cov-2 s protein supporting further translational studies to advance the development of this candidate in response to the current global health crisis four spike protein sequences were retrieved from the first four available sars-cov-2 full genome sequences published on gisaid global initiative on sharing all influenza data three spike sequences were 100 matched and one was considered an outlier 986 sequence identity with the other sequences after performing a sequence alignment the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein sequence was generated and an n-terminal ige leader sequence was added the highly optimized dna sequence encoding sars-cov-2 ige-spike was created using inovios proprietary in silico gene optimization algorithm to enhance expression and immunogenicity the optimized dna sequence was synthesized digested with bamhi and xhoi and cloned into the expression vector pgx0001 under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal the resulting plasmids were designated as pgx9501 and pgx9503 designed to encode the sars-cov-2 s protein from the three-matched sequences and the outlier sequence respectively fig 2a we measured the expression of the encoded sars-cov-2 spike transgene at the rna level in cos-7 cells transfected with pgx9501 and pgx9503 using the total rna extracted from the transfected cos-7 cells we confirmed expression of the spike transgene by rt-pcr fig 2b in vitro spike protein expression in hek-293t cells was measured by western blot analysis using a cross-reactive antibody against sars-cov s protein on cell lysates western blots of the lysates of hek-293t cells transfected with pgx9501 or pgx9503 constructs revealed bands approximate to the predicted s protein molecular weight 140142 kda with slight shifts likely due to the 22 potential n-linked glycans in the s protein fig 2c in immunofluorescent studies the s protein was detected in 293t cells transfected with pgx9501 or pgx9503 fig 2d in summary in vitro studies revealed the expression of the spike protein at both the rna and protein level after transfection of cell lines with the candidate vaccine constructs since candidate design it has been observed that newly published sars-cov-2 spike protein sequences match pgx9501 with 999 amino acid sequence identity supplementary data 1 pgx9501 was therefore selected as the vaccine construct to advance to immunogenicity studies due to the broader coverage it would likely provide compared with the outlier pgx9503 pgx9501 was subsequently termed ino-4800 the immunogenicity of ino-4800 was evaluated in balbc mice post-administration to the tibialis anterior muscle using the cellectra delivery device16 the reactivity of the sera from a group of mice immunized with ino-4800 was measured against a panel of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov antigens fig 3a analysis revealed igg binding against sars-cov-2 s protein antigens with limited cross-reactivity to sars-cov s protein antigens in the sera of ino-4800 immunized mice we measured the serum igg binding endpoint titers epts in mice immunized with pdna against recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein s1  s2 regions fig 3b c and recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein receptor binding domain rbd fig 3d e epts were observed in the sera of mice at day 14 after immunization with a single dose of ino-4800 fig 3c e we developed a neutralization assay with a pnl43lucr-e-based pseudovirus displaying the sars-cov-2 spike protein neutralization titers were detected by a reduction in relative luciferase units rlu compared with controls which had no decrease in rlu signal balbc mice were immunized twice with ino-4800 on days 0 and 14 and sera was collected on day 7 post-second immunization the pseudovirus was incubated with serial dilutions of mouse sera and the sera-virus mixture was added to 293t cells stably expressing the human ace2 receptor ace2-293t for 72 h neutralization id50 average titers of 922 were observed in ino-4800 immunized mice fig 4a b no reduction in rlu was observed for the control animals neutralizing titers were additionally measured against two wildtype sars-cov-2 virus strains by prnt assay sera from ino-4800 immunized balbc mice neutralized both sars-cov-2wh-09human2020 and sars-cov-2australiavic012020 virus strains with average nd50 titers of 975 and 1281 respectively table 1 live virus neutralizing titers were also evaluated in c57bl6 mice following the same ino-4800 immunization regimen sera from ino-4800 immunized c57bl6 mice neutralized wildtype sars-cov-2 virus with average nd50 titer of 340 table 1 we assessed the immunogenicity of ino-4800 in the hartley guinea pig model an established model for intradermal vaccine delivery1718 one hundred micrograms of pdna was administered by mantoux injection to the skin and followed by cellectra delivery device on day 0 as described in the methods section on day 14 anti-spike protein binding of serum antibodies was measured by elisa immunization with ino-4800 revealed an immune response in respect to sars-cov-2 s1  2 protein binding igg levels in the sera fig 5a b the endpoint sars-cov-2 s protein binding titer at day 14 was 10530 and 21 in guinea pigs treated with 100 g ino-4800 or pvax control respectively fig 5b we next evaluated antibody neutralizing activity following intradermal ino-4800 immunization in the guinea pig model guinea pigs were treated on days 0 14 and 28 with pvax or ino-4800 and sera samples were collected on days 35 or 42 to measure sera neutralizing activity against pseudovirus or wildtype virus respectively sars-cov-2 pseudovirus neutralizing activity with average nd50 titers of 5735 was observed for the ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs table 1 wildtype sars-cov-2 virus activity was also observed for the ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs with nd50 titers 320 by prnt assay observed in all animals table 1 the induction of antibodies capable of inhibiting spike protein engagement of host receptor is considered relevant for sars-cov-2 vaccine development we therefore examined the receptor inhibiting functionality of ino-4800-induced antibody responses we recently developed an elisa-based ace2 inhibition assay as a surrogate for neutralization the assay is similar in principle to other surrogate neutralization assays which have been validated for coronaviruses19 as a control in our assay we show ace2 can bind to sars-cov-2 spike protein with an ec50 of 0025 gml fig 6a balbc mice were immunized on days 0 and day 14 with 10 g of ino-4800 and serum igg was purified on day 21 post-immunization to ensure inhibition is antibody-mediated we compared inhibition of the spike-ace2 interaction using serum igg from a nave mouse and from an ino-4800 vaccinated mouse fig 6b we repeated the receptor inhibition assay with a group of five immunized mice and demonstrating that ino-4800-induced antibodies competed with ace2 binding to the sars-cov-2 spike protein fig 6c and supplementary fig 1 ace2 binding inhibition was further evaluated in the guinea pig model sera collected from ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs inhibited binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein over range of concentrations of ace2 025 gml through 4 gml fig 6d furthermore serum dilution curves revealed sera collected from ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs blocked binding of ace2 to sars-cov-2 in a dilution-dependent manner fig 6e sera collected from pvax-treated animals displayed negligible activity in the inhibition of ace2 binding to the virus protein the decrease in od signal at the highest concentration of serum is considered a matrix effect in the assay ace2 is considered to be the primary receptor for sars-cov-2 cellular entry and blocking this interaction suggests ino-4800-induced antibodies believed important to prevent host infection in summary humoral immunogenicity testing in both mice and guinea pigs revealed the covid-19 vaccine candidate ino-4800 was capable of eliciting functional blocking antibody responses to sars-cov-2 spike protein lower respiratory disease lrd is associated with severe cases of covid-19 the presence of antibodies at the lung mucosa targeting sars-cov-2 could potentially mediate protection against lrd therefore we evaluated the presence of sars-cov-2 specific antibody in the lungs of immunized mice and guinea pigs balbc mice and hartley guinea pigs were immunized on days 0 and 14 or 0 14 and 28 respectively with ino-4800 or pvax control pdna bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid was collected following sacrifice and sars-cov-2 s protein elisas were performed in both balbc and hartley guinea pigs which received ino-4800 we measured a statistically significant increase in sars-cov-2 s protein binding igg in bal fluid compared with animals receiving pvax control fig 7ad taken together these data demonstrate the presence of anti-sars-cov-2 specific antibody in the lungs following immunization with ino-4800 we assayed t cell responses against sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov s antigens by ifn- elispot groups of balbc mice were sacrificed at days 4 7 or 10 post-ino-4800 administration 25 or 10 g of pdna splenocytes were harvested and a single-cell suspension was stimulated for 20 h with pools of 15-mer overlapping peptides spanning the sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov spike protein day 7 post-ino-4800 administration we measured t cell responses of 205 and 552 sfu per 106 splenocytes against sars-cov-2 for the 25 and 10 g doses respectively fig 8a higher magnitude responses of 852 and 2193 sfu per 106 splenocytes against sars-cov-2 were observed on day 10 post-ino-4800 administration additionally we assayed the cross-reactivity of the cellular response elicited by ino-4800 against sars-cov observing detectable albeit lower t cell responses on both day 7 74 25 g dose and 140 10 g dose sfu per 106 splenocytes and day 10 post-administration 242 25 g dose and 588 10 g dose sfu per 106 splenocytes fig 8b interestingly no cross-reactive t cell responses were observed against mers-cov peptides fig 8c representative images of the ifn- elispot plates are provided in supplementary fig 2 we proceeded to identify the t cell populations which were producing ifn- flow cytometric analysis on splenocytes harvested from balbc mice on day 14 after a single ino-4800 immunization revealed the t cell compartment to contain 004 cd4 and 032 cd8 ifn- t cells after stimulation with sars-cov-2 antigens supplementary fig 3 we performed epitope mapping on the splenocytes from balbc mice receiving the 10 g ino-4800 dose thirty matrix mapping pools were used to stimulate splenocytes for 20 h and immunodominant responses were detected in multiple peptide pools fig 9a the responses were deconvoluted to identify several epitopes h2-kd clustering in the receptor binding domain and in the s2 domain fig 9b interestingly one sars-cov-2 h2-kd epitope phgvvflhv was observed to be overlapping and adjacent to the sars-cov human hla-a2 restricted epitope vvflhvtyv20 in summary t cell responses against sars-cov-2 s protein epitopes were detected in mice immunized with ino-4800 the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and associated covid-19 disease has become a global pandemic with a significant morbidity and mortality toll currently there are no covid-19 vaccines available and global dissemination of sars-cov-2 may continue until there is a high level of herd immunity within the human population here we have described the preclinical development of a synthetic dna-based covid-19 vaccine ino-4800 to combat this emerging infectious disease synthetic dna vaccine design and synthesis was immediately initiated upon public release of the sars-cov-2 genome sequences on 11 january 2020 our data support the expression and immunogenicity of the ino-4800 synthetic dna vaccine candidate in multiple animal models humoral and t cell responses were observed in mice in guinea pigs we employed clinical delivery parameters and observed sars-cov-2 s protein binding antibody titers and blocking of ace2sars-cov-2 s protein interaction in serum samples from ino-4800-treated animals nabs were also measured in both species halting a rapidly emerging infectious disease requires an orchestrated response from the global health community and requires improved strategies to accelerate vaccine development in response to the 20192020 coronavirus outbreak we employed a synthetic dna medicine platform the design and manufacture of this synthetic dna vaccine represents a plug and play process in which we insert the target antigen sequence into a highly characterized and clinically tested plasmid vector backbone pgx0001 the construct design and engineering parameters have been optimized for in vivo gene expression and previously applied to mers ebov zika and lassa dna vaccine constructs which are all undergoing clinical testing79112122 based upon our previous experience developing a vaccine against mers coronavirus and previous published studies of sars vaccines sars-cov-2 s protein was chosen as the antigen target the sars-cov-2 s protein is a class i membrane fusion protein which the major envelope protein on the surface of coronaviruses initial studies have already been performed which indicate sars-cov-2 interaction with its host receptor ace2 can be blocked by antibodies23 in vivo immunogenicity studies in both mouse and guinea pig models revealed levels of s protein-reactive igg in the serum of ino-4800 immunized animals in addition to full-length s1  s2 and s1 ino-4800 immunization induced rbd binding antibodies fig 3 a domain known to be a target for nabs from sars-cov convalescent patients2425 we further demonstrate the functionality of these antibodies through neutralization of sars-cov-2 wild-type virus and pseudovirus table 1 and competitive inhibition of sars-cov-2 spike protein binding to the ace2 receptor in the presence of sera from ino-4800 immunized animals fig 6 importantly anti-sars-cov-2 binding antibodies were detected in lung washes of ino-4800-immunized mice and guinea pigs fig 7 the presence of these antibodies in the lungs has the potential to protect against infection of these tissues and prevent lrd which is associated with the severe cases of covid-19 in addition to humoral responses cellular immune responses have been shown to be associated with more favorable recovery in mers-cov infection26 and are likely to be important against sars-cov infection27 here we showed the induction of t cell responses against sars-cov-2 as early as day 7 post-vaccine delivery rapid cellular responses have the potential to lower viral load and could potentially reduce the spread of sars-cov-2 and the associated covid-19 illness we believe synthetic dna medicine platform has several synergistic characteristics which position it well to respond to disease outbreaks such as covid-19 as mentioned previously the ability to design and immediately synthesize candidate vaccine constructs means that in vitro and in vivo testing can potentially begin within days of receiving the viral sequence the dna plasmid manufacture process allows for scalable manufacture of drug product which has the potential to circumvent the complexities of conventional vaccine production in eggs or cell culture additionally we have published on the stability profile afforded to these products through the use of our optimized dna formulation7 the stability characteristics mean that our dna drug product is non-frozen and can be stored for 45 years at 28 c room temperature rt for 1 year and 1 month at 37 c while maintaining potency at temperatures upwards of 60 c in the context of a pandemic outbreak the stability profile of a vaccine plays directly to its ability to be deployed and stockpiled in an efficient and executable manner in this study we observed seroconversion after a single intradermal administration of the ino-4800 in guinea pigs fig 6 whether a single immunization will be sufficient in humans will be investigated in clinical trials although vaccine-induced immunopathology has been raised as a potential concern for sars and mers vaccine candidates and possibly for sars-cov-2 vaccines these concerns are likely vaccine-platform dependent and to-date no evidence of immune pathogenesis has been reported for mers dna vaccines in mice or non-human primate models10 or sars dna vaccines in mice8 lung immunopathology characterized by th2-related eosinophilia has been reported for whole inactivated virus iv recombinant protein peptide andor recombinant viral vector vaccines following sars-cov challenge2832 and more recently in a mers-cov challenge model33 however in the majority of studies protective efficacy without lung immunopathology has been reported for sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines8103440 it is important to note the majority of studies demonstrating cov vaccine-induced immunopathology utilized the balbc mouse a model known to preferentially develop th2-type responses the dna vaccine platform induces th1-type immune responses and has demonstrated efficacy without immunopathology in models of respiratory infection including sars-cov8 mers-cov10 and rsv41 sars-cov-2 animal challenge studies will assess ino-4800-mediated protection against disease and vaccine-enhanced disease here we report functional neutralization of ino-4800 immune sera using a sars-cov-2 pseudovirus assay fig 4 table 1 and prnt assay against two wild-type sars-cov-2 strains table 1 as well we show that ino-4800 induced antibodies block sars-cov-2 spike binding to the host receptor ace2 using a surrogate neutralization assay fig 6 this study highlights the immunogenicity of ino-4800 and further animal studies will test protection against infection in summary these initial results describing the immunogenicity of covid-19 vaccine candidate ino-4800 are promising and it is particularly encouraging to measure functional antibodies and t cell responses in multiple animal models this study supports the further evaluation of ino-4800 as a vaccine candidate for covid-19 hek-293t atcc crl-3216 and african green

disclosed with lesions at routine slaughter to have skin test reactors at follow-up test andrew byrne w damien barrett philip breslin jamie madden m james okeeffe eoin ryan   post-mortem pm confirmation of infection of mycobacterium bovis has been extensively studied in cattle herds including the presence of pathology visible lesions and the culturing of the pathogen byrne et al 2017 milne et al 2019 shittu et al 2013 murray et al 2012 as part of bovine tuberculosis control programs such post-mortem data are important for confirming the quality of the antemortem testing occurring during large scale control programs olea-popelka et al 2012 frankena et al 2007 lahuerta-marin et al 2016 furthermore slaughterhouse surveillance data at a population level gives a good independent indicator of underlying trends infection over time especially during times of changes in the application use or type of antemortem tests being employed abernethy et al 2013 more et al 2018 the presence of lesions has been used as an additional metric of infection to estimate the performance of antemortem tb tests used to disclose infected cattle courcoul et al 2014 mccallan et al 2017 karolemeas et al 2012 lahuerta-marin et al 2018 possibly most importantly pm surveillance discloses cases that may have been otherwise missed via antemortem testing programs humphrey et al 2014 garcia-saenz et al 2015 lahuerta-marin et al 2016 pascual-linaza et al 2017 willeberg et al 2018 animals with confirmed lesions found at routine slaughter lrs also known as factory lesion cases can result in herd restrictions disease breakdowns which have significant impact on farmers once a lesion is found the herds trading status is immediately suspended if lesions are confirmed via laboratory means histology culture herds trading status move to withdrawn and normal trading cannot be returned until two clear tests are achieved good et al 2017 there has been limited work to assess the variation in the follow-up testing following the disclosure of a lesion in an ante-mortem test negative animal and the variation in follow-up disclosure of skin test positive animals but see olea-popelka et al 2008 it is important from an epidemiological policy and disease control program perspective to understand how follow-up disclosure of infection might vary across different herd enterprise types or sizes and how policy changes could be tailored to differing contexts or events here we use a dataset on herd breakdowns in ireland from 2005 to 2019 to explore the variation in and risk to follow-up skin test reactor disclosure after a herd breakdown was initiated due to the finding of a lesion at slaughter this paper was developed from a need for a rapid response to a changing resource laboratory capacity in ireland during an extraordinary event - the pandemic of covid-19 the requirement for laboratory capacity for testing for sars-cov2 virus causative agent of covid-19 had an acute impact on m bovis confirmation rates this reduced capacity had a direct effect on the policy for restrictionsde-restrictions and therefore an interim policy was required based on risk profile at herd-level our work highlights how timely epidemiological data analytics capacity at the heart of government policy making can help inform decision making during extraordinary events the outcome was a binary response reactors disclosed yesno and was modelled using a logit distribution temporal trend analysis was undertaken by modelling time as both a continuous linear predictor and as a categorical variable for each year of the study in separate logistic models as there were multiple observations per herds obs per group min  1 avg  17 max  13 random effects re models were fitted to

test reactors on lrs follow-up 1812 of herds without a breakdown within 3 years had reactors on lrs follow-up whereas 3070 of herds which had a bd of 5 reactors disclosed reactors on lrs follow-up there was a significant increase risk of a herd disclosing reactors if they experienced a breakdown during the previous 3-year window univariable logit model 2 df 4  8616 prob  2  0001 this was primarily driven by larger previous bds table s3 there was no significant difference in the disclosure of reactors during a follow-up test between herds without previous breakdown within 3 years and

were significantly lower risk of disclosing reactors at follow-up relative to dairy herds risk of disclosing reactors at follow-up increased with increasing herd size fig 2 for example very large herds 137 cattle were 238 95ci 201280 times the odds of reactor disclosure relative to small herds 32 cattle controlling for confounders over time there was a decreasing trend in the risk of disclosing reactors aor 096 95ci 094097 there was increasing risk associated with the number of reactors disclosed during herds previous breakdown for example having a large breakdown 5 reactors during the previous 3 years was associated with increased risk of disclosing reactors at lrs follow-up relative to zero-reactor breakdowns aor 210 95ci 168262 controlling for confounders our model suggested that herds that did not experience a breakdown within the last 3-years were at higher risk aor 142 95ci 124163 relative to herds which had a previous zero-reactor breakdowns ie lrs initiated breakdowns without additional reactors disclosed at follow-up bovine tuberculosis remains a priority statutory disease in cattle herds in ireland which requires rapid evaluation of data to inform policy decisions more 2019 the present study demonstrated that there were characteristics of herds associated with additional reactors being disclosed after an ante-mortem negative animal was found to have post-mortem evidence of m bovis infection at post-mortem surveillance these characteristics herd size herd type and btb history are readily available within national databases allowing for refinement of follow-up policy and resource attribution in near real time the risk of disclosure of additional ante-mortem test positive animals was increased in larger herds in dairy and suckler herds relative to beef or other herds and herds with a history of infection these three variables have been identified as important risk factors for btb generally at a herd-level allen et al 2018 skuce et al 2008 but have also been reported to be associated with increased recurrence risk eg wolfe et al 2010 karolemeas et al 2011 and prolonged breakdown length milne et al 2020 doyle et al 2016 recurrence in herds may be related to environmental exposure or buying in trade behaviour and biosecurity practices palisson et al 2016 milne et al 2019 it may also suggest that the clearance of infection from previous breakdowns might not be robust olea-popelka et al 2008 studied herds attested clear which disclosed reactors after the discovery of a factory lesion in ireland 12-years prior to the current study the percentage of herds disclosing a standard reactor across that study was 197 while the present study suggested 190 of herd disclosed 1 standard reactors furthermore there was evidence in the present study that this percentage declined from 2013 to 2018 as fig 1 demonstrates the proportion declined from approximately 22 to 14 the present study confirmed a previous finding that beef herds are significantly lower risk of disclosing additional reactors post-lrs relative to dairy and suckler herds olea-popelka et al 2008 dairy herds were significantly higher risk than either suckler or beef herds herd-size could be related to the intensity of agriculture being undertaken within farm and may correlate on inward movement of animals depending on enterprise type olea-popelka et al 2008 skuce et al 2012 herd history over the previous 3-years was important when previous breakdowns were large in the present study 5 reactors olea-popelka et al 2008 found that the number of years a herd tested negative was not associated with reactor disclosure after lrs when the lesioned animal was not present in the herd at last breakdown interestingly our present study found that herds which experienced a breakdown caused by lrs zero-reactor breakdowns within 3-years were lower risk than herds who remained tb clear during the previous 3-years this may suggest that some herds could have greater risk of repeating lrs breakdowns lrs presence has been found to be a risk factor for breakdown recurrence doyle et al 2017 though we are not aware of data that suggests that repeated lrs breakdowns could cluster within herds at an animal level lrs presence has been associated with older cattle those that have moved between herds and have been residing in herds which had recent breakdowns eg 3 yrs lahuerta-marin et al 2016 clegg et al 2016 at a herd level lrs disclosure have been associated with higher risk herds which can experience long duration breakdowns that buy in animals and are situated in high risk geographic regions shittu et al 2013 milne et al 2020 a limitation of this study was that animal level data and animal movements introductions were not used to model our outcome which limits the amount of variation explained by our model however this was deemed acceptable as the primary purpose of the model was to inform on follow-up risk from a limited number of herd-level characteristics that could be informative to policy makers during a period of unprecedented challenge  the covid-19 outbreak in ireland griffin et al 2020 the present study was undertaken in response to a rapidly changing policy environment where capacity to undertake post-mortem confirmation surveillance was impacted by a major event the covid-19 pandemic which negatively affected laboratory capacity the study demonstrated that a rapid response via epidemiological assessment of key parameters could inform on emergency policy response  lungs as target of covid-19 infection protective common molecular mechanisms of vitamin d and melatonin as a new potential synergistic treatment virna martn gimnez margarita felipe inserra carlos tajer d javier mariani len ferder russel reiter j walter manucha   facing a lack of a specific treatment against the lethal covid-19 pandemic its rapid advance and taking into account that an adequate immune response is crucial to overcome this viral infection the need arises to explore pharmacological existing and known agents that reinforce or enhance the immune system activity the physiopathology of covid-19 infection and the main cause of death in patients infected with this virus consist of an exacerbated inflammation with infiltration of immune cells necrosis and hyperplasia of affected tissue especially in the lung level this results in impaired pulmonary oxygen exchange causing severe pneumonia 1 2 3 some systemic alterations also are observed mainly in patients over 60 years which include disturbance of normal plasma levels of lymphocytes thrombocytes c-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase enzyme 4 of particular interest is that older adults are at a higher risk of death 5 angiotensin ii plasma levels were found significantly elevated in infected patients and were directly proportional to the viral load and lung damage observed 6 hence there are close connections between covid-19 and renin-angiotensin system ras it has been shown that covid-19 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors ace2r to invade human lung epithelial cells and to initiate the infection at the same time ace2 produces anti-inflammatory antioxidant anti-fibrotic and anti-hyperplasia effects since cause the degradation of angiotensin ii ang ii at lung level by ace2ang1-7mas receptor signaling pathway the counter-regulatory ras axis with actions opposite to classical ras axis aceang iiat1 receptor pathway the increase in the degradation of ang ii prevents its toxic over-accumulation which would provoke the acute respiratory distress syndrome often present in covid-19 infection therefore ace2 has an antagonistic dual action in this viral infection also the expression of ace2 is lower in males than in females and also lower in older adults than in young people which could influence the susceptibility of elderly males to death by covid-19 infection 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 to highlight this group of patients has a worse prognosis when they are associated in addition to the elderly condition with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases diabetes hypertension and obesity all of them with stimulated ras it has also been reported that ras is involved in the regulation of proliferation inflammation and fibrosis of lung tissues in several pulmonary pathologies independently of covid-19 infection such as acute lung injury asthma pulmonary arterial hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis among others 14 in this context it is known that vitamin d and its metabolites enhance immunity to a great variety of respiratory pathogens in vitro moreover many clinical trials have been demonstrated a strong association between vitamin d deficiency and increased risk of developing respiratory infections and that its supplementation reduces the events related to respiratory tract infections 15 16 17 18 other clinical trial results showed that vitamin d supplementation markedly reduces the rate of moderate and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary cop disease exacerbations in patients with basal 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels lower than 25 nmoll but not in patients with higher levels 19 it was observed that vitamin d decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections by three main mechanisms the maintenance of tight junctions to prevent the infiltration of immune cells in lungs and other respiratory tissues the kill of some viruses through the stimulation of antiviral mechanisms and the reduction in synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the modulation of the immune system avoiding the development of pneumonia 20 in this sense it is known that vitamin d metabolites modulate the secretion and expression of several chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as type 1 interferon ifn-1 cxcl8 cxcl10 tnf-alfa and il-6 in different viral infections 21 the antiviral effects of vitamin d through the modulation of the immune system have also been recently suggested in fact vitamin d deficiency may be associated with a higher risk of getting influenza other respiratory viral infections dengue hepatitis herpesvirus and even human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection in cell culture studies vitamin d has antiviral efficacy especially facing enveloped viruses therefore it would be effective against covid-19 although the antiviral mechanisms of vitamin d have not been completely established they may be related to the ability of vitamin d to up-regulate the anti-microbial peptides human beta-defensin 2 and ll-37 cathelicidin 2223 also the evidence shows that melatonin influences both directly and indirectly the immune system state 24 simultaneously melatonin has also been suggested as an antiviral hormone the effects are exerted through different mechanisms related to melatonins anti-oxidation immunomodulation and anti-inflammation actions 25 a recent study proposed the use of melatonin for the treatment of covid-19 using repurposed drugs this represents an attractive drug strategy using currently available drugs this would reduce the time and costs in comparison with de novo drug development the antioxidant properties of melatonin would make it an appropriate candidate drug to relieve the clinical symptoms of patients infected with covid-19 although melatonin cannot interrupt the replication or transcription of this virus the administration of melatonin may prolong the survival time of infected patients which indicates the possibility that the immune system of these patients recovers due to elimination of the virus since melatonin indirectly targets several human coronavirus cellular vital points such as ace2 bcl2l1 jun and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa b kinase subunit beta ikbkb 26 melatonin has also demonstrated its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in mice infected with a respiratory syncytial virus where it reduced the levels of tnf-alfa significantly nitric oxide no malondialdehyde mda and hydroxyl radical oh whereas it increased glutathione peroxidase gsh and superoxide dismutase sod activity therefore melatonin reversed all altered inflammatory and oxidative parameters of this respiratory viral infection which suggests it also may be useful in the treatment of covid-19 infection 27 additionally another study that suggested the use of melatonin in the management of covid-19 infection has also highlighted the high safety profile of this hormone which encourages even more so its clinical application 28 it is also known that with advancing age not only causes a decline in immunity but also in melatonin and endogenous vitamin d production therefore this could also explain the greater susceptibility of older adults to death by covid-19 infection 29 it could also be hypothesized that there is a lower infection rate in older women because more of them are undergoing treatments for bone diseases that incorporate vitamin d supplements although there is no scientific evidence that supports this all this evidence supports the beneficial effects of vitamin d and melatonin as being helpful against lung pathologies in pulmonary infection by covid-19 where there is also exacerbated inflammation oxidation and other similar pathophysiologic mechanisms this information suggests using analyzing both these natural compounds and well as their possible synergism to overcome this pandemic that affects many people around the world while searching for definitive treatment or vaccine continues additionally it is essential to assess the potential relationship between both compounds and the renin-angiotensin system as a mechanism of cell entry of covid-19 to establish potential treatments that avoid the first step in this viral infection it has been suggested that the deficiency of vitamin d is usually associated with the hyper responsiveness of airways impaired pulmonary functions worse control of asthma and perhaps resistance to steroids pulmonary epithelial cells have a high expression of 1 alpha-hydroxylase level which allows the local synthesis of 1 25-dihydroxy vitamin d the active form of vitamin d also called calcitriol in the lungs calcitriol inhibits the production and secretion of many cytokines from bronchial smooth muscle cells such as growth factor derived from platelets rantes regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted and matrix metalloproteinases which leads to a reduction in smooth muscle cell proliferation and lung inflammation moreover vitamin d stimulates the synthesis of interleukin 10 by cd4cd25foxp3 t-regulatory cells and dendritic cells at the same time vitamin d inhibits the activation of dendritic cells by a downregulating expression of cd8086 and cd40 as co-stimulatory molecules and stimulates the expression of many anti-infective molecules 3031 1 25-dihydroxy vitamin d supplementation suppresses the recruitment of eosinophil and lymphocyte into the airways decreases il-4 production from t cells and inhibits the migration of t cells attenuating the inflammatory response 32 vitamin d may also be useful as an adjuvant for other therapies such as allergen immunotherapy whose beneficial effects were improved by simultaneous 1 25-dihydroxy vitamin d administration to a mouse model of asthma 33 vitamin d and dexamethasone treatment administration to cultured cd4 regulatory t cells from steroid-resistant asthmatic patients increased the synthesis of il10 to levels similar to those found in steroid-sensitive patients treated only with dexamethasone 34 in a similar in vitro model of steroid resistance it was observed that vitamin d caused the inhibition of t cell proliferation when dexamethasone alone could not suppress cell proliferation 35 the high serum levels of ige and eotaxin found in an asthmatic rat model were also significantly reduced by the treatment with vitamin d 36 in asthmatic mice vitamin d treatment also decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells in airways the serum levels of il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf  and il 1 and the expression of bcl 2-associated x apoptotic protein caspase 3 casp3 high mobility group box 1 protein hmgb1 tlr4 nf b and phosphorylated nf b p65 likewise vitamin d elevated il10 serum levels reducing the inflammatory and apoptotic response in these mice 37 in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to pollutant particulate matter vitamin d suppressed the synthesis of 8-isoprostane 8-iso il-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulated by this pollutant agent vitamin d caused a rise in the expression of g6pd antioxidant pathway gene and the levels of oxidized glutathione which suggest that vitamin d can protect the lungs and airways in asthmatic pathology through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects facing air pollutant exposure 38 in a murine model of pulmonary inflammation induced by bleomycin calcitriol reduced early lung inflammation by attenuating immune cell infiltration repressing pulmonary inflammatory cytokines secretion blocking nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa b nf-b p65 inhibiting phosphorylation of pulmonary p38 mapk and protein kinase b akt attenuating -smooth muscle actin a marker for epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the lungs which promotes fibrosis and decreased transforming growth factor-beta 1 tgf-1 up-regulated and smad phosphorylation 39 calcitriol also caused a reduction of approximately 40 in neutrophil recruitment to lungs in an animal model of acute lung injury considerably inhibiting this pathological condition this anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin d may be mediated by the inhibition of il-8 secretion at the lung level 40 the administration of vitamin d to neonatal rats with lung injury induced by hyperoxia as a model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia caused attenuation of this lesion via several protective actions such as preserving pulmonary structure integrity decreasing inflammation by downregulating tlr4 activation reducing the deposition of the extracellular matrix and inhibiting lung cell apoptosis 41 vitamin d has also shown to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of airway cystic fibrosis since it reduced the expression of cd279 pd-1 on cd4 and cd8 t cells moreover vitamin d decreased the frequency of cd8 t and mucosal-associated invariant t cells that co-express the cd38 activation markers and human leucocyte antigen d-related therefore vitamin d treatment would prevent lung damage progression associated with airway cystic fibrosis 42 the oxidative stress that causes tobacco smoke worsens the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in this sense vitamin d has also been proposed as a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant able to improve the prognosis of this lung pathology in smoking patients 43 in fact it has been observed that patients with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have lower plasma levels of vitamin d than healthy patients suggesting a possible correlation between a deficient antioxidant defense and development of this pulmonary disease 44 of central interest to our revision some years ago our group raised the discussion on a world pandemic of vitamin d deficiency as a possible explanation by cellular inflammatory response activity ras-induced 45 the original discussion involved a significant number of pathologies -mainly cardiovascular- but with a similar inflammatory basis at present with the central focus on the acute pulmonary inflammation caused by covid-19 the irish longitudinal study on ageing tilda 2020 reinforces the idea that an adequate supplementation of vitamin d especially in older people may be beneficial for vulnerable population groups during this covid-19 pandemic outbreak 46 graphical abstract therapeutic potential of melatonin at the respiratory system level is mediated among other mechanisms by blockade of nuclear factor-appa beta nf- overexpress of c-fos and down-regulate of matrix metalloproteinases-3 mmp-3 which modulates pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokines 47 moreover the protective role of melatonin in pulmonary hypertension is due to its antioxidant anti-fibrotic and vasodilator properties 48 it has also been suggested that pretreatment with melatonin in a murine model of asthma reduces the accumulation of collagen in the airways possibly through the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 which modulates tissue remodeling therefore melatonin would be expected to exert an anti-inflammatory effect at the level of the airway 49 melatonin has also been useful in the protection of pulmonary tissue during acute lung injury in rats due to its ability to eliminate free radicals and block the activation of nf-kappa b 50 5-hydroxy-2-isobutyl-streptochlorin his a novel derivative of melatonin with enhanced anti-inflammatory properties inhibits the penetration of immune cells into the lung and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6 in a murine model of acute lung injury these anti-inflammatory effects of his were mediated by the modulation of the signaling pathway-dependent of interferon- and toll-like receptors moreover his inhibited the secretion of il-1 by blocking the activation of nlrp3 inflammasome independent of mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species 51 the lung surfactant lipid peroxidation is induced by the production of oxygen radicals from stimulated phagocytes responsible for the development and progression of acute lung injury in this sense melatonin alone or combined with other antioxidants markedly reduced lipid peroxidation of this pulmonary surfactant 52 intratracheal administration of melatonin provoked a marked reduction of lung lesions and recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to lungs during acute pulmonary injury furthermore melatonin inhibited the nlrp3 inflammasome activation through the suppression of extracellular histone release 53 it has been suggested that melatonin inhibits pulmonary fibrosis in animal models through the decrease in the migration of fibroblasts as a consequence of the reduction in the activity of chloride channels mediated by protein kinase c 54 in an animal model with pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin melatonin provoked a significant reduction in edema and lesions at the lung level likewise melatonin treatment lowered the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 which produces eicosanoids whose role is crucial in the development of pulmonary fibrosis besides melatonin caused a decrease in interstitial tissue percentage volume and an increase in the alveolar space percentage volume 55 melatonin attenuated the pneumonitis and lung fibrosis caused by radiation exposure through a decrease in inflammatory cell infiltration collagen deposition edema and vascular and alveolar thickening in the lungs 56 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis causes the progressive loss of pulmonary function due to tissue cicatrization interesting it has been reported that melatonin and its metabolites can modulate many pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis such as transforming growth factor  wnt catenin interleukin 17a vascular endothelial growth factor fibroblast growth factors platelet-derived growth factor renin-angiotensin system endothelin 1 and impaired caveolin 1 function causing protective effects on lungs 57 by removing free radicals melatonin may adequately modulate autophagy pathways and apoptosis which are key mechanism in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 58 additionally the utilization of melatonin in the treatment of animals with induced hepatopulmonary syndrome was effective in the reduction of lung fibrosis levels vasodilation and oxidative stress 59 melatonin also ameliorates pulmonary lesions associated with inflammation and oxidative stress caused by nitrogen mustard in rodents since it acts as a powerful antioxidant that eliminates both reactive nitrogen and oxygen species and as a potent anti-inflammatory agent 60 61 62 the pretreatment with melatonin combined or not with quercetin in rats with hypoxia-induced by sodium nitrite considerably reduced the plasma levels of il-6 tnf- and crp heat shock protein 70 extracellular hsp70e and vegf additionally melatonin enhanced the histopathological changes in the lungs of these animals also suggesting powerful protective effects of melatonin at the pulmonary level 63 melatonin has a potent pulmonary protective effect in rats with lung injury induced by phosgene and this protective mechanism can be associated with the elimination of free radicals and the inhibition of p38 mapk activation and inos expression 64 pretreatment with melatonin is effective in reducing lung damage in patients subjected to chemotherapy melatonin with cyclophosphamide decrease lipid peroxidation restoring the glutathione levels and superoxide dismutasecatalase activities furthermore the mentioned association could reduce the typical histological abnormalities in the lungs of patients with chemotherapy 65 melatonin has also inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 hif-1 proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna and nuclear factor-b nf-b in a murine model of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension this molecule also suppressed the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and the concentrations of phosphorylated akt and kinases 12 modulated by extracellular signal provoked by hypoxia in an in vitro model these results also suggest significant antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin at the pulmonary level 66 postnatal administration of melatonin reduced the pathological vascular remodeling and the cardiovascular response to hypoxia in neonatal lambs with pulmonary hypertension on the other hand melatonin increased angiogenesis in these animals these effects enhance the pulmonary vascular function and structure in the neonatal period under conditions of chronic hypoxia 6768 melatonin also markedly inhibited the pulmonary injury induced by hepatic ischemiareperfusion in rats through its anti-inflammatory properties achieved the reduction in apoptosis of lung cells by blocking of jnk p38 and nf-b activation and stimulating of nrf2 activation 69 in mice with induced lung ischemia-reperfusion melatonin pretreatment achieved a reduction of the damage in lung parenchymal and a decrease in the expression of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1 tnf- and ikk- apoptotic markers such as baxbcl-2 and cleaved casp3 and tunel positive cells were also inhibited in addition melatonin pretreatment increased the expression and activity of cellular antioxidant systems superoxide dismutase glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase 70 in an animal model of neurogenic pulmonary edema melatonin attenuated the dysfunction of the alveolar-capillary barrier by inhibiting the disruption of tight junction proteins such as zo-1 and occludin furthermore it caused a downregulation of myeloperoxidase and interleukin il -1 as well as provoked an inhibition of the activation of matrix metallopeptidase 9 in addition the melatonin treatment considerably decreased casp3 activity and the number of positive lung cells in the tunel assay therefore melatonin treatment enhanced the prognosis of neurogenic pulmonary edema due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects 71 melatonin also exerted its anti-inflammatory antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects in a murine model of lung aging significantly reducing the expression of apoptosis markers such as bax bad aif inflammatory markers such as il-1 tnf- ho-1 nfb2 and the oxidative damage to rna measured as the production of 8-hydroxyguanosine 72 it is well documented that melatonin prevents chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by attenuating nlrp3 inflammasome and il-1 responsible for the inflammation of airways during this pathology additionally melatonin caused an increase in silent information regulator 1 sirt1 expression which mediates the mentioned anti-inflammatory effect and other additional protective mechanisms such as the attenuation of apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress 7374 melatonin caused a decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation of airways and lungs and reduced the chronic cough induced by particulate matter 25 m in a pig model 75 additionally it has been demonstrated that environmental pollution in the form of particulate matter 25 m stimulated the melatonin synthesis at lung level in order to protect lung tissues from the damage provoked by the inhalation of polluted air 76 the administration of ramelteon an agonist of melatonin receptor in an animal model of lung injury induced by ventilation and notably decreased the pulmonary edema malondialdehyde concentrations the levels of proinflammatory cytokines the activation of nf-b the expression of inos and apoptosis in lung cells moreover ramelteon treatment markedly elevated the expression of intracellular protective heat shock protein 70 hsp70i in lung cells and the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid these results suggest that the protective effects of melatonin on lung disease are mainly mediated by a melatonin receptor 77 it was documented that exposure to nicotine in pregnant rats caused significant changes in the lungs of their offspring at a structural and biochemical level in this regard melatonin treatment reduced the altered parameters by a lowering in the number of alveolar macrophages and mast cells as well as in the levels of malondialdehyde 78 melatonin also significantly reduced the oxidative stress and injury of lungs exposed to radiation through the suppression in the infiltration of neutrophils cd11bly6g and macrophages cd11bcd11c- and the down-regulation of nlrp3 inflammasome in macrophages accompanied with a reduction in the release of il-1 and the activity of caspase-1 or casp1 by the up-regulation of mir-30e levels 79 melatonin treatment decreased lung injury in rats exposed to chromium by up-regulating sirt1 which promotes the deacetylation of the transcriptional co-activator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- coactivator-1 pgc-1 at the same time this caused a rise in the expression of crucial antioxidant target genes and the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 nrf2 these findings indicate that melatonin exerts anti-inflammatory antioxidant and anti-apoptosis effects in the attenuation of lung injury provoked by chromium exposure through sirt1pgc-1nrf2 signaling pathway 80 it has also been determined that melatonin was able to mitigate the lung damage induced by carbon tetrachloride by the elimination of free radicals the increase in the antioxidant ability of pulmonary tissues and the induction of an effective anti-inflammatory response 81 melatonin also reduced the increased levels of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase in the pulmonary tissue of diabetic rats moreover it attenuated the bronchial hyperplasia and reduced the cleaved-caspase 3 expression which was significantly increased in these animals 82 graphical abstract of special interest a clinical trial about the use of melatonin in the prophylaxis of covid-19 infection among healthcare workers is carrying out clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04353128 moreover many other human trials have demonstrated the efficacy of melatonin in the reduction of elevated levels of circulating cytokines in multiple inflammatory pathologies suggesting that melatonin would also useful in the treatment of covid-19 infection by decreasing plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines 83 84 85 86 87 88 furthermore other clinical trials showed that melatonin is effective against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 89 and multiple newborn diseases associated with increased oxidative stress at lung levels and in many other organs due to its important antioxidative properties 90 it is known that there is a strong interaction between melatonin and ras 9192 in this regard melatonin treatment caused a reduction in at1 expression and normalized the ang ii levels in a model of renal disease 93 it is also known that there is a local pineal ras that modulates the synthesis of melatonin in this regard it has been indicated that ang ii acts on the at1 receptors located in pineal gland cells to regulate the expression and activity of tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme which is involved in the synthesis of melatonin it has also been demonstrated that the antioxidant anti-inflammatory and antiapoptosis effects of melatonin are opposite for ang ii 94 it has reported that patients with chronic renal disease secrete lower nocturnal melatonin concentrations than healthy patients this altered secretion may be related to increased nocturnal intrarenal ras activation and kidney damage in patients with this renal disease this fact reinforces the existence of a close antagonistic interaction between ras and melatonin 95 in this regard it is known that reactive oxygen species are crucial in the activation of intrarenal ras also it has been shown that antioxidant treatment with melatonin ameliorates the intrarenal ras over-activation and renal injury in a 56 nephrectomized rat model of chronic kidney disease 9396 despite the lack of studies that specifically show a relationship between melatonin and ras at the lung level the existing evidence of this relationship in other organs such as the kidney suggests the possibility of similar behavior at the respiratory level concerning vitamin dras interaction the participation of ace2ang1-7masr signaling pathway in the neuroprotective effects of vitamin d in the brain has recently demonstrated in hypertensive rats 97 and it has found that vitamin d acts as a cofactor in the attenuation of incident atrial fibrillation by raas inhibition 98 furthermore the re-establishment of normal vitamin d levels in patients with d hypovitaminosis provokes blockade of peripheral ras 99 exacerbated activation of ras at the hepatic level causes liver dysfunction and increases the risk of developing diabetes mellitus in this sense it has been found that calcitriol modulates the altered up-regulation of the liver ras in conditions of insulin resistance 100 vitamin d is a potent suppressor of renin production thus low plasma levels of vitamin d are associated with an increase in the synthesis of renin which results in an over-activation of ras and an increased production of ang ii and vice versa 101102 it has been demonstrated that vitamin d deficiency also results in overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzymes ace and ace2 103 it has also been observed that vitamin d receptor-null mice develop more serious induced acute lung injury than wild-type mice with increased levels of pulmonary ang ii and renin pretreatment of vitamin d receptor-null mice with losartan reduced the severity of the pulmonary injury indicating that vitamin d via its receptors attenuates acute lung injury by blocking ras 104 moreover if vitamin d deficiency is chronic the uncontrolled ras over-activation for extended periods may induce pulmonary fibrosis through the exacerbated and accelerated increase in extracellular matrix deposition in lung tissues 105 graphical abstract the combined supplementation of vitamin d with melatonin could offer an attractive synergistic alternative for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary infection by covid-19 these molecules modulate the same signaling pathways that relate to anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory antioxidant anti-fibrotic as well as anti-apoptotic effects in many tissues with special focus at the lung level both natural compounds are highly safe for clinical use they have many shared underlying mechanisms that allow them to exert potentiating actions aimed at strengthening the immune system and preparing the body to overcome the severe pathological consequences of covid-19 infection and if there is an infection reduce its high mortality rate there exist many therapeutic objectives when evaluating the efficacy of vitamin d and melatonin in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 infection however ras ends up being the bottleneck a central signaling pathway because it constitutes a common meeting point for this triad ras stimulation with the consecutive inflammatory storm favors the infection evolution and outcome of this complex new pathologic entity as previously suggested the global deficiency of vitamin d as a result among others of cultural changes could respond mechanistically at least in part to higher inflammatory processes as a consequence of lack of brake that vitamin d exerts typically on the ras system during healthy conditions 45 as a perspective it would be of interest to carry out clinical trials to evaluate the therapeutic utility of the vitamin dmelatonin combination both in healthy patients and those infected with covid-19 and to compare the effects of its joint administration versus their individual administration in this regard it would be specially interesting adequately to define both melatonin and vitamin d supplementation regime used taking into account both group and individual features of patients that will participate of these studies since not considering these aspects may lead to obtain heterogeneous and controversial results that could affect their general applicability 106 however with the central focus on acute lung inflammation caused by covid-19 a longitudinal study suggest adequate vitamin d levels in vulnerable groups during this pandemic outbreak by covid-19 46 the last findings showed that the degree of protection against infections increases as vitamin d levels increase but this relationship has not allowed establishing an adequate cut level yet still an observational study reported that 38 ngml are appropriate values to decrease the risk of acute viral respiratory infections 107 on the other hand some authors suggest maintaining a serum vitamin d level at least 30 ngml or even maintaining it in a range of between 40 and 60 ngml to reduce infectious processes moreover recently dr alipio has provided substantial information to physicians and health policymakers specifically it concluded that vitamin d supplementation improves the clinical course of patients infected with covid-19 based on the increased probability of having a mild result when the serum level of vitamin d increases while a serum decrease in vitamin d is associated with worse clinical evolution 108 the same recommendation was reinforced by grant and colleagues who suggested that vitamin d supplementation could reduce the risk of covid-19 infection 109 also rhodes and collaborators have proposed vitamin d supplementation at least for those in the northern hemisphere who are at higher risk of severe illness and death 110 the same is recommended by the united kingdom association of dietitians 111 and editorials in international scientific rigors finally although there are some controversies regarding the effectiveness of vitamin d and melatonin in clinical studies such contradictions are the consequence of experimental designs with many errors the latest findings -with better designs- begin to show robust evidence of benefits so melatonin on the one hand and vitamin d on the other would be complicit endogenous as physiological responders andor exogenous drugs in therapeutics treatment which could alleviate the pathological process even before the infection develops this work was supported by grants from the research and technology council of cuyo university 1013039501100007351secyt mendoza argentina and from 1013039501100003074anpcyt

le goffic philippe marianneau nicolas meunier  anosmia is one of the most prevalent symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection during the covid-19 pandemic however the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated the initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium oe mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells the olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier in the present study we explored the impact of sars-cov-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden syrian hamsters we observed massive damage of the oe as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of sars-cov-2 resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection these damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs we observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the oe and lamina propria of infected animals which may contribute to the desquamation of the oe the oe was partially restored 14 days post infection anosmia observed in covid-19 patient is therefore likely to be linked to a massive and fast desquamation of the oe following sustentacular cells infection with sars-cov-2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the oe and lamina propria  respiratory viruses are very common worldwide and impact human and animal health with important economic consequences although most symptoms of respiratory virus infection are related to airway inflammation and focused on the respiratory tract extra respiratory organs are also targeted by these viruses including the central nervous system bohmwald et al 2018  the recent pandemic of coronavirus disease emerging in december 2019 has been accompanied by a prevalence of olfaction alteration indeed approximately 60 of patients infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 that is the cause of covid-19 suffered from mild hyposmia to total loss of olfactory capacities anosmia spinato et al 2020  the origin of these alterations remains to be established olfaction starts with olfactory sensory neurons osn located in the olfactory epithelium oe present in the most dorsal part of the nasal cavity the oe along with the underlying lamina propria constitutes the olfactory mucosa osns have cilia in direct contact with the environment in order to detect odorants they are therefore accessible to respiratory viruses and some of these viruses are able to infect the osn and reach the central nervous system by following the olfactory nerves which project to the olfactory bulbs forrester et al 2018 bryche et al 2019a  interestingly sars-cov-1 netland et al 2008  was described as a virus able to use this olfactory pathway ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was characterized as the main entrance receptor for sars-cov-2 letko et al 2020  similarly to sars-cov-1 sars-cov-1 was described as being able to enter the central nervous system in mice transgenic for human ace2 netland et al 2008  in this model the brain infection starts from the olfactory bulbs and while the authors did not look for a potential infection of the olfactory mucosa it may be that sars-cov-1 could infect olfactory sensory neurons reaching the brain through the olfactory bulbs where these neurons project forrester et al 2018  if sars-cov-2 infection follows the same pathway anosmia following sars-cov-2 infection may correlate with the encephalopathies observed in some covid-19 patients roe 2020 and further highlights the need to unravel the cellular basis of the observed anosmia golden syrian hamsters have been successfully used as a model of sars-cov-1 infection roberts et al 2005 and have also been recently shown to be a good model for sars-cov-2 as well sia et al 2020  indeed the expression profile of ace2 the entry receptor for sars-cov-2 is very similar in hamsters and humans luan et al 2020  anosmia in covid-19 patients provided impetus to study the expression profile of ace2 in the nasal cavity several studies show that ace2 is present in the oe but expressed in sustentacular cells the supporting cells surrounding the olfactory neurons rather than in the olfactory neurons themselves bilinska et al 2020 fodoulian et al 2020  however a recent study suggested that sars-cov-2 could infect olfactory sensory neurons in hamsters sia et al 2020  in the present work we focused on the pathological impact of two different sars-cov-2 strains on the nasal cavity and the central nervous system of the golden syrian hamster viral strains were isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from patients suffering from respiratory infection suspected of covid-19 and submitted to molecular diagnosis nasopharyngeal flocked swabs were suspended in utm media copan italy  and kept at 4c for less than 48 hours a volume of 400 l was homogenized and microfiltered 05 m

immunohistochemistry analysis of the olfactory mucosa tissue sections was performed as described previously in mice bryche et al 2019a  briefly the whole animal head was fixed for 3 days at room temperature in 4 paraformaldehyde pbs then decalcified for one week 10 edta -ph 73 at 4c the nasal septum and endoturbinates were removed as a block and post-fixed overnight at 4c in 4 paraformaldehyde pbs and further decalcified for 3 days the same procedure was applied with cortex and brainstem but without decalcification blocks and tissues were cryoprotected with sucrose 30 cryo-sectioning 14 m was performed on median transversal sections of the nasal cavity perpendicular to the hard palate in order to highlight vomeronasal organ olfactory mucosa stenos gland and olfactory bulb the brain was cryo-sectioned 14 m in the coronal plane sections were stored at -80c until use non-specific staining was blocked by incubation in 2 bovine for histology some sections were rehydrated then stained in hematoxylin h-3404 vector laboratories for 30s and washed with water slides were then transferred in an acid-alcohol solution 05 hcl in 70 ethanol for 10s and washed in water then immersed in eosin sigma ht110316 for 15s and washed again in water finally slides were gradually dehydrated and mounted in eukitt sigma 25608-33-7 nissl staining was performed on some sections following conventional histological procedures including immersion in 01 cresyl violet solution for 10 minutes images were taken at x100 magnification using a dmbr leica microscope equipped with an olympus dp-50 ccd camera using cell f software olympus soft imaging solutions gmbh osis munster germany we measured the oe thickness the osn cilia quality based on golf staining and the immune cell infiltration of the olfactory mucosa based on the iba1 staining on 6 images per animal taken from 3 different slides spread along the nasal cavity for the oe thickness 10 measurements along the oe septum were performed for each image as previously described francois et al 2016  the percentage of apical oe with a preserved g olf staining and the percentage of iba1 cells infiltration in the oe were measured using imagej to threshold specific staining all values were averaged per animal we also globally estimated the impact of sars-cov-2 on the oe on these parameters by comparing mock-infected animals with sars-cov-2 infected animals we evaluated 1 the integrity of the structure of the oe using he staining 2 the preservation of the osn cilia using g olf signal in the apical part of the oe 3 the presence and shape of iba1 cells in the oe and in the underneath lamina propria a ramified iba1 cells is considered representative of a resting state while an amoeboid shape is linked to an activated state in the oe mori et al 2002  for each parameter we used a scale ranging from 0 to 10 scored on three sections of the olfactory mucosa spread along the nasal cavity per animal this evaluation was performed by three experienced investigators blinded to the animal treatment scores were averaged per animal between investigators we used a cohort of 12 hamsters to examine the impact of two different isolates of sars-cov-2 ucn1 and ucn19 on the nasal cavity from 2 to 14 day post infection dpi through nasal instillation while the olfactory epithelium was well preserved in control animals we observed massive damage of the olfactory epithelium in sars-cov-2-infected animals as early as 2 dpi fig 1a  the nasal cavity lumen was filled with cellular aggregates and most of the olfactory epithelium was strongly disorganized in the most affected oe zones axon bundles from the olfactory sensory neurons under the olfactory epithelium were almost in direct contact with the environment fig 1b  as an objective measure of olfactory mucosa damage we first measured the septal olfactory epithelium thickness fig 1c and we then scored the overall lesions of the oe fig 1d  most of the oe had disappeared at 4 dpi after which point it started to recover but had not reached pre-infection thickness at 14 dpi when our measurements stopped the results were similar for both viruses  we then examined the cellular localisation of sars-cov-2 in the nasal cavity by immunohistochemistry using an antibody raised against the nucleocapsid protein of the virus we observed that a large proportion of the oe was infected at 2 dpi which decreased at 4 dpi and subsequently disappeared  fig 2a and supp fig 1a b  the virus was also present in the vomeronasal organ supp fig 2a  and in the stenos gland supp fig 2b  at 2 dpi and 4 dpi we also examined various areas of the brain we could not find any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs supp fig 3a  in the olfactory cortex piriform cortex and olfactory tubercle hypothalamus hippocampus and in the brainstem where we mainly focused on the respiratory control centres the ventral respiratory column and the nucleus of the solitary tract supp fig 3b  the virus presence in the nasal cavity followed a kinetic similar to its presence in the lungs supp fig 1c  in order to identify which cells were infected with sars-cov-2 in the oe we performed double staining of the olfactory mucosa with omp and ck18 specific markers of mature osns and sustentacular cells respectively while most of the cells infected with sars-cov2 expressed ck18 as well we were not able to find any viral antigen in omp expressing cells these results show that sars-cov-2 infects sustentacular cells but not osns fig 2  interestingly we observed staining of omp ck18 sars-cov-2 as well as hoechst in the lumen of the nasal cavity indicating that part of the oe containing infected and non-infected cells was desquamated in response to sars-cov-2 infection  in order to understand the extent of the damage of the osns following sars-cov-2 infection we examined the preservation of the osn cilia layer which contains all the transduction complex allowing the detection of odours dibattista et al 2017  we performed immunohistochemistry against g olf fig 3a b  a specific g protein from this complex jones and reed 1989  we quantified the percentage of septal olfactory epithelium containing g olf staining in the apical part of the oe fig 3c and scored globally the quantity of g olf staining in the oe fig 3d  while the g olf signal was completely preserved in control animals it quickly diminished in sars-cov-2-infected animals without any clear improvement from 2 dpi to 10 dpi we observed a small recovery of the g olf signal only in the septal part of the oe 14 dpi with the ucn19 virus  we finally examined the presence of immune cells in the olfactory mucosa using iba1 as a specific marker of monocytemacrophage lineage bryche et al 2019b  fig 4a  in control animals iba1 cells were mainly localized in the lamina propria and exhibited a ramified morphology with many processes fig 4b  which is typical of a resting phenotype mori et al 2002  we measured the presence of iba1 cell fig 4c and scored the presence and shape of iba1 cells in the oe and the lamina propria separately fig 4d  while iba1 cells were mostly absent from the oe and moderately present in the lamina propria in control animals their presence was drastically increased up to 4 dpi in infected animals both in the oe and the lamina propria fig 4a b  furthermore iba1 cells were mostly of amoeboid shape which is typical of an activated state at 2 to 7 dpi fig 4b  we also observed iba1 cells in the lumen of the nasal cavity in the cellular aggregates containing sars-cov-2 fig   4a  immune cell infiltration gradually diminished this reduction was first observed at 10 dpi in the oe but was not seen in the lamina propria before 14 dpi at 14 dpi it reached the mock level both in the oe and the lamina propria for both virus strains fig 4c d  and  in the present study we focused on the impact of sars-cov-2 in the nasal cavity and central nervous system using the golden syrian hamster as a model we chose to work with 2 different isolates of sars-cov-2 with the potential to obtain slightly different strain behaviour we explored the kinetic of the impact of these two different isolates we identify sustentacular cells as the main target cells of sars-cov-2 in the oe this observation is consistent with the expression pattern of ace2 mainly present in these cells along with the facilitating protease tmprss2 bilinska et al 2020 fodoulian et al 2020  two recent reports indicate that olfactory neurons in hamster sia et al 2020 and respiratory cells in ferret ryan et al 2020 may be the target of sars-cov-2 but these studies did not focus on the nasal cavity and they did not use double staining to clearly identify the infected cells in the oe we observed that sars-cov-2 can infect other nonneuronal cells in the nasal cavity notably in the epithelium covering the lumen of stenos gland which is however poorly described in the literature bryche et al 2019b  further studies are required to clearly identify the other non-neuronal cells infected by sars-cov-2 in the nasal cavity which may facilitate the systemic infection of other cell types and tissues lower in the respiratory airways we did not observe any presence of the virus in the brain notably in the olfactory bulbs where osns projects and in the piriform cortex where the olfactory signal is integrated we also focused on the hypothalamus which contains ace2 expressing neurons mukerjee et al 2019 as well as on the respiratory centres of the brainstem as the latter are suspected to be infected in covid-19 patients suffering from heavy respiratory disorders gandhi et al 2020  our lack of virus detection in the central nervous system may be due to the low number of animal examined but nevertheless we can rule out a systematic and important infection of the brain following sars-cov-2 infection in hamster this is consistent with a recent review of the literature which failed to indicate any central nervous manifestation of sars-cov-2 presence in human central nervous system romoli et al 2020  however the neurotropic ability of sars-cov-2 remains controversial wang et al 2020  interestingly sars-cov-1 has been shown to be neurotropic only using ace2 humanized mice the osns of these mice must also express ace2 as it is under the control of k18 ubiquitous promoter netland et al 2008  sars-cov-1 may thus infect osns expressing ectopic ace2 and the observation of presence of the virus in the brain may not be relevant for a more physiological model in our model we observed a fast desquamation of the oe following sars-cov-2 infection of sustentacular cells further studies are required to decipher whether it could be an anti-viral strategy to limit access of the virus to the brain through the olfactory pathway and to which extent the recruitment of immune cells contributes to this process through immunopathological mechanisms globally we present here the first data focusing on the impact of the sars-cov-2 in the nasal cavity our results could explain the high prevalence of anosmia observed in covid-19 patients and will need to be confirmed by analysis of human oe  covid-19 preclinical models human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transgenic mice cathleen lutz leigh maher charles lee wonyoung kang   coronavirus cov which belongs to the subfamily coronavirinae family coronavirdiae and order nidovirales has repeatedly crossed species barriers and some have become important human pathogens 1 in december 2019 a highly pathogenic novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 emerged as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 this virus which likely originated from bats then transmitted intoamong humans 1 has affected 212 countries and territories around the world causing over 35 million confirmed cases of human infection and over 250000 deaths in just a few short months 2 it is known that the species specificity host tropism and transmission capacity of the virus are determined by the viral envelope spike s protein mediating the receptor-binding affinity to the host receptor therefore to elucidate the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 and develop vaccines and treatments for covid-19 appropriate preclinical animal models that not only express human angiotensin-converting enzyme ace2 a functional receptor of sars-cov-2 but also can recapitulate the symptoms is immediately required 3 4 here we describe the role of ace2 in covid-19 and the urgent need of translational research using human h ace2 transgenic tg mice which are not only susceptible to the covid-19 infection but to varying degrees also demonstrate the symptoms observed in human patients infected with this pandemic disease ace2 known as ace-related carboxypeptidase or angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue aceh is a monocarboxypeptidase that is expressed in the lung arteries heart kidney brain and intestines 5 6 and is an essential component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas 7 the raas is a hormone system leading to the regulation of blood pressure water balance electrolytic homeostasis vascular resistance and heart remodeling 8 the classical pathway of raas is initiated when circulating blood volume is decreased the juxtaglomerular cells lining the afferent arterioles located proximal to the renal glomeruli recognize this change and secrete renin into blood circulation renin cleaves angiotensinogen into angiotensin i ang i in the liver the circulating ang i is hydrolyzed to ang ii by ace that is primarily located in the pulmonary and renal vessels ang ii activates the angiotensin type i receptor at1r to initiate a vasoconstrictor response and stimulate aldosterone synthesis in the adrenal gland then both circulating blood volume and blood pressure are increased when aldosterone induces the renal tubes to initiate sodium and water retention 9 10 in raas ace2 directly hydrolyzes ang ii to yield ang17 or converts ang i to ang19 eventually creating the vasodilator ang17 which is the most crucial product of ace2 ang17 binds to the g protein-coupled mas receptor masr which leads to the cellular signaling that opposite to the vasoconstrictor effects of ang ii does not stimulate aldosterone secretion fig 1 6 9 11 12 it is now recognized that the raas is far more complicated than the initial understanding of its classical function 13 the imbalance between the levels of ang i ang ii and ang cleavage peptides ang19 leads to vasoconstriction and impairs vascular reactivity as a key enzyme in controlling the balance of players in raas ace2 plays a critical role in cardio-renal and pulmonary disease 14 15
 ace2 has been implicated as a functional cellular receptor for both sars-cov the pathogen of sars which caused more than 8000 cases of infection and 774 deaths in 37 countries from 2002 to 2003 16 and sars-cov-2 17 there have been abundant studies conducted to prove the essential role of ace2 in the pathogenesis and severity of sars-cov 1824 and leveraging this rich knowledge is highly beneficial and useful to elucidate the uses of ace2 in the sars-cov-2 infection considering the similarity in both viral structure and pathogenesis between the two viruses 25 viral binding ability of sars-cov to ace2 is known as the most crucial factor that supports the viral replication in the host and determines the infection efficiency in different species including human mice rats and palm civets 2630 although the species responsible for transmission remains unclear 31 32 several studies have shown that as sars-cov did sars-cov-2 also originated from the bat and may also contain partial genes from another intermediate species the pangolin scale anteater with high conservation in the genome which encode the spike proteins the receptor-binding motif rbm in the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 is nearly identical to the one from the virus isolated in the pangolin 3335 by aligning the sequence of amino acids aas in viral rbd to aas in ace2 five residues in hace2 including k31 e35 d38 m82 and k353 were identified as the key aas for interacting with viral rbm of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 36 37 mainly k31 and k353 were virus binding hot spots that play critical roles in the cross-species and human to human transmissions 36 38 39 recently the ace2 binding affinity to the rbd of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 was evaluated in forty-two mammals based on hot spot aas in the ace2 of each of the species the protein complex structure simulation study supported the possibility that pangolin ace2 might have a better affinity to sars-cov-2 because the n82 of pangolin ace2 could contact closer to the viral rbd than m82 of hace2 40 the major clinical characteristics of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 patients are the deterioration of lung function and the apparent loss of lung repair capacity 41 42 ace2 is expressed primarily in alveolar epithelial type ii cells which produce surfactant to prevent collapse of the alveoli in order to maintain normal gas exchange in the lung 17 43 the interaction between ace2 and the rbd of the viral spike protein leads to endocytosis of virus particles through internalization with ace2 and establishes sars-cov infection 44 leading to cell damage 45 46 although the catalytic pocket of ace2 was not blocked by binding to rbd sars-cov infection notably downregulated the ace2 expression at the transcriptional and posttranslational level 2023 this is validated by both in vitro and in vivo studies challenged with recombinant spike protein of sars-cov cell culture downregulated ace2 expression levels 47 and injection of sars-cov spike into mice decreased ace2 expression levels leading to a worsened lung injury fig 1 47 48 furthermore inflammation which is excessively produced by infections of both sars-cov-2 25 and sars-cov 46 4953 can suppress ace2 transcription 54 55 resulting in the raas activation this activation contributes to the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ards or acute lung injury and more severe inflammatory reactions 48 this suggests that direct viral interaction and the subsequent inflammation contribute to the ace2 downregulation thusly ace2 potentially could serve to protect the lung from injury 56 however there are concerns about normalization or upregulation of ace2 expression levels in patients because that would enable both a heightened level of infectivity of sars-cov-2 as well as clinical illness severity 57 indeed the pathogenic events caused by these viral infections have been recognized as highly complex and not fully understood 58 so solely targeting the ace2-mediated pathways alone may not be able to fully answer the questions regarding diversity of symptoms studies elucidating the pathogenesis and evaluating the efficacy of potential therapeutics and vaccines must be immediately conducted by utilizing the appropriate preclinical model k18-hace2 tg mice also known as b6cg-tgk18-ace22prlmnj were developed by mccray et al in 2006 66 67 the purified dna fragment containing the hace2 coding sequence and 5 and 3 genomic regions of the human k18 gene shown to be required for driving high-level epithelial cell-specific expression was injected into pronuclei of zygotes from the intercross of c57bl6j  sjlj f2 parents to generate transgenic embryos table 1 the mice were then backcrossed onto a c57bl6 background the hace2 mrna expression was detected in several tissues including the lung liver kidney and colon and a very low but measurable mrna level of hace2 was found in the brain 66 intranasal inoculation with sars-cov caused the development of rapidly fatal disease with the outcome correlated by the copy number and hace2 mrna level the mice with the high hace2 expression level tg lines 1 and 2 succumbed from day 3 to 5 post-infection pi whereas in the tg line 3 which showed a lower hace2 expression died 5 to 7 days pi viral replication was found in the lungs of both k18-hace2 tg and non-tg mice however the viral titers were lower and clearance much faster in the non-tg mice k18-hace2 tg mice began to lose weight by 3 to 5 days following sars-cov infection becoming lethargic with labored breathing and all died within 7 days table 1 66 similar to the patients symptoms the lung was most obviously the organ majorly affected by sars-cov infection in k18-hace2 tg mice showing significant inflammatory reactions ifn-gamma cxcl-1 cxcl-10 il-6 il-1beta etc hemorrhage epithelial cell damage and congestion of alveolar septum fig 2 66 67 one of the more interesting findings regarding these mice was the heavy viral infection in the brain with increased inflammatory cytokines cxcl-1 cxcl-10 il-6 il-1beta etc fig 2 postulated to be a major factor in the aspiration pneumonia observed in k18-hace2 tg mice and occasionally in infected patients as well 66 in fact there were several studies that detected virus in the brain of patients infected with sars-cov 46 50 72 some patients who survived this viral disease displayed the neurologicalpsychological sequelae that are presumed to be the side effects of either a corticosteroid therapy or a severe lung infection 7275 further intensive investigation of sars-cov-induced neurological disease was a challenge due to the difficulty in obtaining infected brain tissues derived from patients 67 therefore the k18-hace2 tg mouse was used to discover the pathogenic mechanism of sars-cov including viral entry into the central nervous system cns the spread of the neuronal infection and the cause of lethality 67 by detecting viral antigens in the different regions of the mouse brain and observing time-dependently the neuronal infection of sars-cov was revealed to initiate from the olfactory bulb spreading into the brain thoroughly 2 to 3 days after intranasal inoculation of the virus and induced neuronal loss 67 the brain of the patient infected with sars-cov exhibited neuronal necrosis glial hyperplasia and edema while the viral infection mainly affected neurons 46 50 72 which is consistent with studies showing a distinguished neuronal tropism of sars-cov in infected k18-hace2 tg mice 59 66 based on these sars studies which utilized the k18-hace2 tg mice some possible mechanisms including the high regional infection of the cardiorespiratory center in the medulla oblongata and the extreme inflammatory reactions that resulted in a cytokine storm were also suggested 67
 in 2006 tseng at al developed the hace2 tg mouse lineages ie ac-12 ac-22 ac-50 ac-63 and ac-70 expressing hace2 under the cag promoter a composite promoter consisting of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer the chicken -actin promoter rabbit globulin splicing and polyadenylation sites to drive high levels of gene expression in eukaryotic expression vectors 59 the plasmid containing hace2 cdna coding sequence was injected into pronuclei of zygotes from the c57bl6j  c3hhej f1 table 1 either c56bl6 or balbc mice were used for backcrossing each mouse line showed different expression levels of hace2 mrna the ac70 tg line which is supremely susceptible to sars-cov infection expressed a high level of hace2 mrna in overall organs ie spleen stomach heart muscle brain kidney lung intestine and liver and showed clinical illness including lethargy labored breathing persistent weight loss leading to immobility and 100 mortality within 4 to 8 days following infection table 1 59 68 among the tissues examined the lung and brain were the primarily affected organs in the infected ac70 tg mice and viral replication in the lung and brain showed notably different kinetics while the viral titers reached the maximum level in the lung 1 to 2 days pi then gradually decreased the viral titers in the brain were first detected on day 2 then rapidly increased on day 3 and remained at high levels until the death of the host the inflammatory cytokine levels were correlated with the level of viral replication in the lung and brain following intraperitoneal injection which caused a low-level viremia in ac70 tg mice the virus was detected in the brain but not in the lung suggesting that the sars-cov could disseminate into the cns by a mechanism independent from the one of lung infection 59 other tg mice lines ac22 and ac63 were used to investigate resistance to lethality following sars-cov infection as compared to ac70 infected ac22 and ac63 tg mice recovered even though the mice suffered from a severe clinical illness during the progression of the disease 59 68 although the hace2 expression levels in both the lung and brain are lower in ac22 than in ac70 the pattern of viral yield and the pulmonary pathologies in the lung following the sars-cov infection showed subtle dissimilarity between the two lines however both viral replication and inflammatory response in the brain of infected ac22 were significantly lower than those of ac70 another finding in this comparison study showed the t cell loss in ac70 tg mice was much more distinct than that in ac22 tg mice which was similar to the severity of t cell loss correlated with the poor outcome in the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infected patients 52 7680 hfh4-ace2 tg mice also known as b6jcg-tg foxj1-ace21rbammnc with airway-targeted overexpression of human ace2 were generated by menachery et al in 2016 the expression cassette consisting of hfh4 foxj1 lung ciliated epithelial cell-specific promoter elements and the coding region of ace2 cdna in a ptg1 vector was injected into the pronuclei of zygotes from c3h  c57bl6 f1  c3b6f1 table 1 the founder mice were crossed to c3b6 and the hace2 expression in each mouse was confirmed by pcr the hfh4-ace2 mice expressed hace2 not only in the lung but also in the brain liver kidney and gastrointestinal tract indicating the broader organ distribution of hfh4-mediated expressions than expected initially with sars-cov urbani strain challenge all hfh4-hace2 mice rapidly lost more than 20 bodyweight and died within 4 to 5 days with robust viral replication in both the lung and brain found at the endpoint table 1 the anti-sars human antibody 22715 protected hfh4-hace2 mice from death by sars-cov infection these mice were used to evaluate the possibility of human infection and transmission of wiv1-cov which is a sars-like virus identified by metagenomics studies and an isolated replication virus from the horseshoe bat known to be an animal reservoir of sars-cov 69 in previous research wiv1-cov was revealed to have a broad species tropism and use ace2 orthologs also it could replicate at a low level in a549 a human lung cancer cell line 81 furthermore the robust wiv1-cov infection was confirmed in the well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial hae cell meaning that some sars-like viruses which have not yet been found as well as wiv1-cov might not need an intermediate species to infect humans therefore it was critical to investigate the pathogenesis and observe symptoms of wiv1-cov infection in animal models expressing hace2 compared to sars-cov infection in hfh4-hace2 mice wiv1-cov infection showed attenuated symptoms such as a lesser amount of weight loss with delayed death in limited mice as well as lower viral titer which contrasts the finding of a similar titer level following infection in primary hae cell culture this suggests that the wiv1-cov spike protein can bind to hace2 but additional adaptations will possibly be required to cause the epidemic disease 69 this example demonstrates the additional use of hace2 tg mice for validation of potential epidemical viral strains showing the beneficial impact of hace2 tg mice which can provide the knowledge needed for the prevention and management of future cov outbreaks the hace2 tg mouse which had the hace2 gene introduced into the mouse genome was developed by yang et al in 2007 69 the hace2 cdna was inserted into the pegfp-n1 plasmid and the hace2 expression mediated under mouse ace2 promotor resulting in the likelihood of mimicking the human condition more closely after the verification of hace2 expression the fragment containing the mouse ace2 driving the hace2 coding sequencing was injected into the pronuclei of the zygote from icr mice table 1 the hace2 expression was observed in the lung heart kidney and intestinal tracts in this hace2 tg model in contrast to the previous hace2 tg mice models including k18-hace2 a70 and hfh4-ace2 although severe diffuse interstitial pneumonia and broad extrapulmonary organ damage were seen 69 similar to that observed in some patients infected sars-cov 8284 these mice did not die by sars-cov infection table 1 the reason for this milder disease progression and recovery could be due to lower hace2 expression levels since the death rate of sars in 2003 was about 10 70 and that of covid-19 is about 7 2 this more resistant hace2 tg mice still with significant pathologic symptoms is useful in understanding the pathogenesis of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 several vaccine candidates for sars-cov were shown to induce neutralizing antibodies as well as being effective in protecting young mice or hamsters from the viral challenge 8592 the hace2 tg mouse k18-hace2 was used to test the protective ability of a recombinant sars-cov which is deleted in envelope e protein rsars-cov-e or deleted in e and several group-specific protein genes rsars-cov-e6-9b against the sars-cov-mediated fatal respiratory disease these rsars-covs showed protective effects against challenge with sars-cov by inducing both anti-virus t cell and antibody responses and improved survival rate 93 recently sars-cov-2 mrna-1273 the inactivated recombinant-spike protein of sars-cov-2 was undergoing testing in clinical phase i open-label dose-ranging clinical trial nct04283461 to mainly determine the safety and efficacy 57 since the virus can generate more subclasses the efficacy safety host immunization and potential to deter viral replication of sars-cov-2 should be evaluated in more vaccine candidates to accomplish this desperate need use of a hace2 tg mouse model will help to discover potential vaccines with desirable properties and move toward the next phase of vaccine development several strong therapeutic candidates most were previously used for the treatment of viral disease 9497 have been rapidly applied to clinical trials for covid-19 based on their anti-viral effects validated in cultured cells 96 97 for instance remdesivir gs-5734 which has been recognized as a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug against rna viruses 97 such as sars and mers-cov 98 was shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 viral infection in a human liver cancer cell line huh-7 97 remdesivir was recently approved by the fda for emergency use in severe covid-19 patients 99 and will further be evaluated for efficacy when given to patients earlier in their disease course currently there are eight clinical trials in progress in the usa nct04315948 nct04292730 nct04280705 nct04302766 china nct04252664 nct04257656 and france nct04314817 nct04315948 to assess the expanded treatment approaches and potential combinational treatments of remdesivir and to get the approval from the fda considering the complicated and hidden pathogenic mechanisms and evolution of sars-cov-2 an in vivo study should be simultaneously and immediately conducted to provide more comprehensive data that can predict the therapeutic and adverse responses in sars-cov-2 infected patients the hace2 tg mice may provide highly beneficial data particularly that associated with the severity of covid-19 because clinical illness or mortality cannot be investigated using cultured cells or non-transgenic mice moreover hace2 tg mice can facilitate developing and evaluating the potential therapeutic strategy targeting the hace2-mediated pathogenic pathways the soluble recombinant human ace2 rhace2 has been attracting attention as a competitive interceptor that can bind to rbd of the sars-cov or sars-cov-2 before the viral rbds attach to the full-length hace2 which is bound to the cell membrane 100 several in vitro studies have shown that the soluble form of ace2 blocked the sars-cov replication in vero-e6 cells 101 102 and the extracellular domain of human ace2 fused to human igg1-fc could neutralize the sars-cov-2 103 if an appropriate form of rhace2 can be provided it would be a new therapeutic compound used to inhibit sars-cov-2 binding to ace2 and to diminish viral infection and viral replication in the host 100 however the beneficial effect of rhace2 has not yet been tested in animal studies or human clinical studies therefore hace2 tg mice would be a useful animal model that can expedite the process of developing this new approach subsequent to migration and mutation sars-cov-2 has been evolving into subclasses tang et al reported that two major lineages l-type and s-type of sars-cov-2 co-exist by phylogenetic analysis of 103 genomes with sars-cov-2 the s-type was indicated as the ancestral subclass and the l-type was characterized to have a higher frequency than s-type 104 the co-infection of these two subclasses was observed in one patient usa20200121a gisaid id epiisl404253 but it was not clear whether the co-infection increased the severity or not 104 more recently three subclasses ie a b and c subclasses were identified based on the distinguishable aa changes by character-based phylogenetic network analysis of 160 sars-cov-2 genomes 105 understanding the pathogenesis of each viral subclass consisting of special residues determining host affinity or disease severity is important for developing vaccines and treatment as described before the clinical symptoms in hace2 tg mice following sars-cov infection were quite similar to that in patients hace2 tg mice will potentially provide significant knowledge about viral dissemination and pathogenic impact of sars-cov-2 subclasses in infected hosts also it will lead to essential knowledge that supports further transgenic animal models for enhancing or investigating the permissiveness and infection of sars-cov-2 106 in a previous study using mouse models aged mice have shown more severe pathological lesions and a higher mortality rate than young mice following sars-cov infection and young mice required more mutations and passages than aged mice to produce the mouse-adapted sars-cov strains 107112 age is known as one of the factors that determine disease severity in sars and covid-19 57 113 therefore investigating the pathologic severity of sars-cov-2 associated with age in young and old hace2 tg mice is immediately required to understand the difference of symptoms in infected patients and establish a disease-control strategy also in covid-19 most of the patients with lethal symptoms were revealed to have pre-existing medical comorbidities such as pulmonary disease chronic kidney disease diabetes mellitus obesity body mass index  30 cardiovascular disease and hypertension 114119 there have been various animal models developed for investigating these diseases including inbred strains of mice with genetic manipulations that predispose them to disease 120123 other manipulations and environmental exposures can be used to study the effects of comorbidities such as cigarette smoke- or drug ie bleomycin-induced pulmonary disease 124 125 paraquat-induced acute renal failure 126 repeated low-dose cisplatin treatment-induced chronic renal failure 127 streptozotocin-developed type i diabetes mellitus 128 and high fatsucrose dites-induced insulin resistance which is closely linked with type ii diabetes melilitus obesity and cardiovascular disease 129 130 the chemicaldiet-induced disease methods can be applied to hace2 tg mouse models before infecting the sars-cov-2 to elucidate the association between comorbidity and the symptoms or pathogenesis of covid-19 moreover the further development of breeding together tg mice that develop comorbidities and express hace2 will facilitate the discovery of the impact and mechanism of each comorbidity on the severity of symptoms in covid-19 this knowledge will help us to be ready prevent and protect people from an undesirable pandemic disaster like covid-19 sars-cov-2 has a higher binding affinity to hace2 than to that of other species and the recent cryo-electron microscopy studies demonstrate that it showed even a higher affinity than sars-cov 131 the transgenic mouse model that expresses hace2 has been proven to mimic the symptoms of human disease by sars infection we have comprehensively reviewed the currently established hace2 tg mouse models and the studies utilizing these mice also arguments were presented that show the urgent demand for investigations of covid-19 treatments and prevention significantly require the use of hace2 tg mice in conclusion along with the efforts in all medical and scientific fields the hace2 tg mice are a critical translational animal model that would greatly

with no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available the virus was able to 29 infect millions of people to date close to half a million patients succumbed to the viral disease 30 covid-19 the high need for treatment options together with the lack of small animal models 31 of infection has led to clinical trials with repurposed drugs before any preclinical in vivo 32 evidence attesting their efficacy was available we used syrian hamsters to establish a model 33 to evaluate antiviral activity of small molecules in both an infection and a transmission setting 34 upon intranasal infection the animals developed high titers of sars-cov-2 in the lungs and 35 pathology similar to that observed in mild covid-19 patients treatment of sars-cov-2-36 infected hamsters with favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin 37 resulted in respectively a mild or no reduction in viral rna and infectious virus micro-ct scan 38 analysis of the lungs showed no improvement compared to non-treated animals which was 39 confirmed by histopathology in addition both compounds did not prevent virus transmission 40 through direct contact and thus failed as prophylactic treatments by modelling the pk profile 41 of hydroxychloroquine based on the trough plasma concentrations we show that the total lung 42 exposure to the drug was not the limiting factor in conclusion we here characterized a hamster 43 infection and transmission model to be a robust model for studying in vivo efficacy of antiviral 44 compounds the information acquired using hydroxychloroquine and

antiviral 66 treatment could be beneficial and prevent or alleviate symptoms in addition antiviral drugs 67 could be used as prophylaxis to protect health care workers and high-risk groups however a

with viral rna being detected in the lungs from day 1 273 pi and reaching a maximum level of 7 log10 rna copiesmg tissue at 4 days pi fig 1a  a 274 similar kinetic profile was found in the ileum and stool samples albeit at lower levels of 2-3 275 log10 rna copiesmg of tissue titrations of homogenized lung tissue contained infectious 276 particles from 1 day pi and reached levels of 5 log10 tcid50mg tissue from day 2 pi onwards 277 fig 1b  which is in line with the viral rna levels infected animals displayed a slight weight 278 loss of about 5 by day 2 pi which was completely resolved by day 4 pi fig 1c  infiltrates and lung consolidation on day 3 pi fig 1d  analysis by he staining of lungs of 286 infected hamsters at day 4 pi showed signs of bronchopneumonia and peribronchial 287 inflammation which were not present at the day of inoculation fig 1e  288 next we treated hamsters with antiviral molecules for four consecutive days starting one hour 290 before intranasal infection with sars-cov-2 at day 4 pi a micro-ct scan was performed 291 after which the animals were sacrificed and organs were collected for quantification of viral 292 rna infectious virus titers and lung histopathology fig 2a  twice-daily treatment with 293 favipiravir was done orally with a loading dose of 600 mgkgday at day 0 pi and 300 mgkgday 294 from day 1 pi onwards favipiravir-treated hamsters presented a decrease of 09 log10 rna 295 copiesmg lung tissue compared to untreated infected hamsters  fig 2b  a lesser effect was 296 observed in the ileum and stool of treated animals fig 2b  a modest reduction in infectious 297 titers of 05 log10 tcid50mg was observed in the lungs of favipiravir-treated animals fig 2c  298 treatment with favipiravir caused over 5 weight loss at day 3 and 4 pi which is slightly more 299 than that of the untreated animals fig 2d  this could be due to the effect of administering a 300 relatively high volume of compound per os which was at the limit of 10 mlkg day or due to 301 some toxicity of the molecule despite the very modest reduction in viral load no obvious 302 change improvement or worsening of the rather subtle radiological and histological lung 303 pathology could be observed in favipiravir-treated hamsters fig 2e-g  quantification of 304 micro-ct-derived biomarkers support these observations and quantify a relatively small 305 burden of radiological lung consolidation upon infection that does not change with favipiravir 306 treatment fig 2f  307 hcq sulphate was tested alone or in combination with azithromycin at a dose of 50 mgkgday 308 equivalent to 39 mgkg hcq base administered intraperitoneally once daily when in 309 combination azithromycin was given orally once daily at a dose of 10 mgkgday treatment 310 with hcq alone resulted in a very modest reduction of 03 log10 viral rna copiesmg lung and 311 no reduction in viral rna load in the ileum or stool compared to untreated infected hamsters 312  fig 2b  when combined with azithromycin no additional reduction of viral rna was observed 313 in the organs of infected animals fig 2b  virus titrations of the lungs also revealed no 314 significant reduction after treatment with hcq alone or in combination with azithromycin fig  315   2c  the weight loss of the animals treated with hcq follows along the lines of the untreated 316 animals with  5 weight loss during the whole experiment while the combination treatment 317 with azithromycin caused a slightly greater weight loss at day 1 and 2 pi from which the animals could partially recover fig 2d  similarly no radiological improvement was observed 319 between non-treated animals and animals treated with hcq or hcq in combination with 320 azithromycin which was confirmed by quantification of micro-ct-derived biomarkers of lung 321 pathology fig 2e-g  fig 1  this indicates that 335 the fecal-oral route only marginally contributes to the transmission sars-cov-2 between 336 hamsters thereby confirming the results of a previous study 18  we therefore continued by 337 focusing on transmission of the virus via direct contact only 338 using the transmission model we investigated the prophylactic potential of hcq and favipiravir 339 against sars-cov-2 sentinel hamsters received a daily dosage for 5 consecutive days with 340 either hcq or favipiravir starting 24 hours prior to exposure each individual sentinel hamster 341 was co-housed with an index hamster that had been intranasally inoculated with sars-cov-342 2 the day before fig 3a  index hamsters were sacrificed 4 days pi and sentinels 4 days post 343 exposure after which the viral loads in lung ileum and stool were determined index hamsters 344 had 7 log10 viral rna copiesmg in the lungs whereas untreated sentinel hamsters had 4 log10 viral rna copiesmg in the lungs fig 3b  even though the variability between 346 individual hamsters in the sentinel groups was more pronounced than in the index groups no 347 reduction in viral rna was observed in either favipiravir-or hcq-treated sentinel hamsters 348 also in ileum and stool the viral rna levels were not reduced by compound treatment the 349 infectious viral loads in the lungs were also not reduced by treatment with either compound 350 fig 3c  which is in line with the viral rna data in contrast to index hamsters sentinel 351 hamsters did not lose weight but gained around 8 of body weight by day 4 pi sentinels that 352 received hcq or favipiravir treatment gained less body weight than the untreated sentinels 353 5 and 2 respectively fig 3d  pathology scores derived from micro-ct scans of 354 hamsters revealed multifocal pulmonary infiltrates and consolidations in some but not in all 355 hamsters fig 3e 3f  also micro-ct-derived biomarkers showed no difference in lung 356 pathology between untreated and treated sentinel hamsters fig 3g  further confirming that 357 hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir failed to prevent sars-cov-2 infection in a transmission 358 model 359 based on the measurement of trough concentrations of hcq at sacrifice n14 a mean  sd 361 trough plasma concentration of 84  65 ngml 0251  019 m was found fig 4a  this is 362 comparable to the plasma trough concentrations that were detected in cynomolgus macaques 363 treated with a dosing regimen of 90 mgkg on day 1 pi loading dose followed by a daily 364 maintenance dose of 45 mgkg 14 and in patients 3-5 days after starting treatment with 200 365 mg three times daily 14  the peak viral load in the lungs was not significantly associated with 366 plasma hcq concentrations in individual hamsters fig 4b  suggesting that a higher hcq 367 exposure did not result in a more pronounced reduction of viral infection 368 according to equation 1 a whole blood concentration of 1804  139 m was calculated fig  369   4c  subsequently applying equation 2 this resulted in a total lung concentration of 9018  370 6942 m indicating that the lung tissues achieved hcq concentrations above the reported in 371 vitro ec50 values ranging from 072 to 1731 m with a median value of 451 m and an interquartile range of 544 25-75 29  to estimate 90 of inhibition of viral replication ec90 373 the ec90 was equated to 3 times the ec50 resulting in a target lung concentration of 1353  374 1631 m in this case the efficacy target at trough would be reached when applying this 375 dosing regimen ie 50 mg hcq sulphatekgday however it is important to note that the 376 total lung tissue concentrations described above consist of both intracellular and interstitial 377 hcq concentrations as the in vivo antiviral mechanisms of action of hcq against sars-378 cov-2 has not been clarified yet and might not be exclusively by inhibition of endosome 379 acidification 30  hcq concentrations were calculated in cytosolic lung tissue in the endosomal-380 lysosomal compartment of cells and in the interstitial compartment assuming that cytosolic 381 hcq concentrations are only 6 of total tissue concentrations a total cytosolic lung tissue 382 concentration of 541  417 m was calculated this value was in line with the median in vitro 383 ec50 value but is well below the estimated ec90 value also the interstitial concentration was 384 calculated to be 541 m in contrast the endosomallysosomal hcq concentration was 385 calculated to be 19 mm which is much higher than the estimated ec90 in a previous study we showed that wild-type syrian hamsters are highly susceptible to sars-388 cov-2 infections 16  here we further characterized the hamster infection model to allow the use 389 of this model for antiviral drug evaluation in agreement with previous studies upon intranasal 390 inoculation we observed that the virus replicates efficiently to peak levels 6 log10 tcid50mg 391 in the lungs on day 4 pi which is supported by radiological and pathological evidence 392 although the virus was also present in the ileum and stool of infected hamsters levels were 393 significantly lower 25 log10 copiesmg besides serving as efficient replication reservoirs of 394 sars-cov-2 the hamsters also efficiently transmit the virus to co-housed sentinels 15 18  here 395 we demonstrated that the virus is mainly transmitted via direct contact and only to a limited 396 extent via the fecal-oral route the variability observed in the virus titers in the lungs of the 397 sentinels is probably due to differences in the infection stage of the animals 398 besides hamsters a variety of other animals have been tested for their permissiveness to 399 sars-cov-2 of which ferrets and non-human primates were the most sensitive ones 31-35  in 400 ferrets infectious sars-cov-2 was only detected in the nasal turbinate and to a lesser extent 401 in the soft palate and tonsils but not in the lungs 35  although in a different study infectious 402 virus in the lungs of ferrets was detected levels remained close to the limit of detection 33  this 403 indicates that ferrets support sars-cov-2 replication albeit to a lesser extent than hamsters 404 in sars-cov-2-infected macaques both rhesus and cynomolgus virus levels were the 405 highest in nasal swabs and the lungs 3234  sars-cov-2 infection resulted in moderate transient 406 disease in rhesus macaques whereas cynomolgus macaques remained asymptomatic but 407 did develop lung pathology as seen in covid-19 34  although aged macaque models may 408 represent the best models for studying more severe covid-19 disease 36  both the high costs   rising evidence of covid-19 transmission potential to and between

covid-19-has been detected in domestic dogs and cats raising concerns of transmission from to or between these animals there is currently no indication that feline-or canine-to-human transmission can occur though there is rising evidence of the reverse to explore the extent of animal-related transmission we aggregated 17 case reports on confirmed sars-cov-2 infections in animals as of 15 may 2020 all but two animals fully recovered and had only mild respiratory or digestive symptoms using data from probable cat-to-cat transmission in wuhan china we estimated the basic reproduction number r0 under this scenario at 109 95 confidence interval 105 113 this value is much lower than the r0 reported for humans and close to one indicating that the sustained transmission between cats is unlikely to occur our results support the view that the pet owners and other persons with covid-19 in close contact with animals should be cautious of the way they interact with them  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2-the virus that causes coronavirus disease covid-19-has been detected in domestic dogs and cats raising concerns of transmission from to or between these animals in late march 2020 a report from hong kong indicated two of nineteen dogs and one of nine cats from households with confirmed human covid-19 cases or persons in close contact with confirmed patients tested positive for the virus 1 2  and in belgium a cat in a household with a confirmed covid-19 case was determined to be infected 3  from april through the beginning of may an additional six cases of covid-19 among domestic cats were confirmed in belgium france spain and united states 4  while there is currently no indication that feline-or canine-to-human transmission can occur there is some evidence of possible human-tofeline or human-to-canine transmission 2 5  animal-to-animal transmission also appears plausible in a recently published preprint 6 on infections in cats in the original epicenter of covid-19-wuhan china-researchers examined serological samples from domestic and stray cats samples collected during january and february 2020 among which 15 were positive some positive samples were from cats cared for by human covid-19 cases or cats at a pet hospital but samples from stray cats with no known link to human covid-19 cases were also positive indicating the possibility of sustained feline-to-feline transmission among stray cats domestic animals are not the only ones affected in early april a 4-year-old female malayan tiger cub tested positive for sars-cov-2 in new york and six other tigers and lions at the zoo had symptoms consistent with the illness and were considered presumptive positive cases the virus was likely transmitted to the cats from an asymptomatic zookeeper though whether all the cats were infected by a human keeper or feline-to-feline transmission occurred after initial introduction of the virus to the cats is uncertain in addition in late april the dutch ministry of agriculture nature and food quality notified the world organisation for animal health oie of an outbreak of covid-19 on four mink farms used for fur production three of the farms were epidemiologically linked to each other but the fourth farm had no connection with the previous outbreaks two more infected farms were reported in early may although human-to-mink transmission is considered the probable source of the outbreaks transmission between minks was indicated as the main driver 7  in contrast to infected domestic dogs and cats which are typically asymptomatic or have only a mild course of disease following infection some infected minks suffered from a more severe course involving pneumonia and death 7  experimental evidence 8 9 has classified mustalids mink and ferrets felids cats both domestic and exotic and rabbits as highly susceptible to covid-19 while canids domesticated birds and pigs are less likely to become infected and transmit the disease in the experiments of 8  the authors inoculated infected animals with high viral loads however the majority of serological samples collected from stray and domestic cats showed a relatively weak viral titer 6  similarly the viral titers of an infected dog in hong kong were also weak and the dog was never considered contagious to other dogs or to humans 10  in light of this information rampant transmission of sars-cov-2 among stray cats in wuhan seems unlikely however if sustained transmission among domesticated animals is possible sars-cov-2 may pose a substantial threat to the animal communities themselves there is also a risk that these animals will act as a reservoir for the virus 11  in this paper we attempt to resolve some of the uncertainty around sars-cov-2 transmission potential to and between animals and quantify transmission strength in mathematical terms to do so we 1 aggregated all publicly available records on confirmed cases of covid-19 among animals and 2 estimated the basic reproduction number r0-the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case-among cats using the results of the serological study of zhang et al 6 in our modeling framework from this data and analysis we draw some inferences on transmissibility and discuss their implications for the current covid-19 pandemic we retrieved information on confirmed sars-cov-2 animal cases from publicly available immediate notifications and follow-up reports in the world animal health information system wahis published by the world organization for animal health oie httpswwwoieintwahis2publicwahidphpwahidhomehome the information on infected captive felids at the bronx zoo new york usa was additionally verified by the press releases of the

using the query covid and animals in our modeling framework for the possible sustained chain of transmission among domestic and stray cats in wuhan china 6  we assumed homogeneous mixing and a random independent sampling process in the collection of the serological samples we employed a formula on the final size of the epidemic and estimate the basic reproduction number   given that is the number of positive tests taken among total n samples then the fraction of positives in the entire population can be estimated by using the binomial likelihood  cc-by 40 international license it is made

known link to human covid-19 cases tested positive as well following the modeling framework 1-2 we estimated the basic reproduction number  at 109 95 confidence interval ci 105 113 which suggested the probability of major outbreak at around 79 95 ci 47 121 given this low probability the likelihood that sustained transmission among domestic and stray cats occurred in wuhan china is low in hong kong pets of human covid-19 cases are generally quarantined and tested 13  which favors the detection of mild and asymptomatic cases however in other countries only symptomatic pets are likely to be detected typically no testing is done unless the animals are symptomatic in line with this logic all three cases in hong kong did not show any specific symptoms of covid-19 while cases reported elsewhere exhibited respiratory or digestive symptoms the observed difference in severity of disease for the animals may additionally be explained by the difference in prevalence of the covid-19 human cases-as of 15 may hong kong reported just over one thousand cases while the other countries with domestic animal cases reported 50000 human cases the secondary attack rate of sars-cov-2 from human to pets appears to be low and may also be driven by the infectiousness profile of their owners the government of hong kong reported that about 50 animals including 2 hamsters were tested as of 17 april 2020 however the count of confirmed cases remained the same compared to the earlier numbers 14  a recent preprint 15 reported absence of sars-cov-2 infections among 9 cats and 12 dogs whose owners-veterinary students from the 20-year-old age group-formed a cluster of covid-19 cases in france among 18 infected individuals 2 were confirmed with pcr testing 9 were presumptive cases and 7 were asymptomatic 15  on one hand this may suggest that there was a lower infectiousness of 20-yearold individuals compared to pet owners with a more heterogenous age profile on the other hand the presence of asymptomatic human carriers could also play a role as some studies have shown highlighted the lack of secondary infections in households with asymptomatic index cases 16 17  historical records on the closely related virus sars-cov-1 reveal a similar story during the 2003 outbreak of sars cats and ferrets were experimentally infected with the sars-cov-1 18 but community transmission from humans to domestic animals was documented only once-in the amoy gardens complex in hong kong where two blocks had a high level of contamination and eight cats and one dog tested positive from rectal swabs 19  transmission between animals and from animals to humans in the affected areas was only speculated 20  in contrast animals can be infected even lethally with seasonal influenza virus transmitted from their owner 21  the humanto-animal transmission potential of sars-cov-2 likely lies somewhere between that of sars-cov-1 and influenza 22  our estimate of   109 for transmission between cats is much lower than the estimate of 24 for humans in the same area 23  however our results are subject to a few limitations first the data shared by 6 do not allow us to distinguish the negative serological tests of domestic cats from those of stray cats we therefore assumed domestic cats to be part of the chain of transmission among all cats we also assumed that stray cats were unlikely to be in close contact with humans however some stray cats could be fed by humans and there is a chance that the virus could be transmitted by an infected human to a stray cat by a contaminated feeder or other fomite second we assumed that interventions implemented by the chinese government to halt the epidemic in wuhan in february-march 2020 did not affect the transmission dynamics of the virus among cats third our calculation of the probability of a major outbreak-estimated at 79-relied on the assumption of a homogeneous contact pattern between stray and domestic cats and imposed an exponentially distributed infectious period the use of a heterogeneous contact pattern and for example a gamma distribution for the infectious period would provide more precise results 24 25 26  however incorporation of these factors requires more detailed data on the serological tests and the cat population in wuhan than was available in the preprint by zhang et al  cc-by 40

worldwide that the pet owners and other persons with covid-19 in close contact with animals should pay special attention to the way they interact with them there is no clear evidence that the virus is more than minimally transmissible to and among domestic animals and the sporadic detections that are found are most likely to be only weakly positive therefore most infections in domestic cats and dogs likely came directly from infected humans at the same time scientific evidence continues to indicate that the probability of sars-cov-2 transmission from domestic animals to humans is extremely low  covid-19 knowns unknowns and questions stuart weston matthew frieman b   until the very end of 2019 there were six coronaviruses known to cause disease in humans four of these result in little more than a common cold and are endemic around the world the viruses known as human coronavirus hcov-229e hcov-hku1 hcov-nl63 and hcov-oc43 are of little concern at a global public health level the other two however have caused more widespread concern in 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov emerged in the human population in a matter of months this virus from a bat that transmitted via a palm civet to infect a human in the guangdong province of china infected over 8000 people killing roughly 10 1 in 2003 sars-cov infections stopped and the virus has not been seen since a second epidemic coronavirus known as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged in 2012 like the sars-cov outbreak mers-cov started with a patient suffering pneumonia and came from a zoonotic event this time from a bat via a camel to a human 1 however mers-cov has shown far more limited human-to-human transmission than sars-cov since 2012 there have been roughly 2500 cases of mers-cov mostly confined to regions of the middle east while case numbers are low for mers-cov there is a high case fatality ratio cfr of approximately 35 making this virus one of the deadliest human pathogens coronaviruses that infect humans all appear to have respiratory transmission making them pathogens of pandemic potential the end of 2019 saw the emergence of a novel human coronavirus that is rapidly spreading around the global and has a higher degree of lethality than the endemic coronaviruses though not to the level of sars-cov or mers-cov the virus was initially named 2019-ncov but is now termed sars-cov-2 and causes the disease covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 at the time of writing there have been over 115000 cases and over 4000 deaths the first case of covid-19 was reported to the who by chinese authorities on 31 december 2019 as a result of a patient suffering pneumonia in wuhan city hubei province china over the following days more patients were suspected to be suffering the same disease and by 9 january a novel coronavirus had been detected and the sequence was published online shortly thereafter 2 the 2 months since emergence of sars-cov-2 have demonstrated the rapid pace at which a virus can spread and which science can develop after an initial lag phase cases of covid-19 followed a closely exponential curve the vast majority of cases are at the time of writing still from mainland china however over 100 other countries have reported cases most cases outside china have been associated with travel to that country but more clusters of cases are now being detected without travel history in this article we will discuss what has already been learned about the virus and will then outline 10 key questions and directions of study for this novel coronavirus the novel virus is in the coronaviridae family and therefore shares common features of this family coronaviruses have large 30-kb single-stranded positive-sense rna genomes the genome can be roughly divided into a 5 two-thirds and a 3 third the first two-thirds of the genome code for two large polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab from orf1a and orf1b which are proteolytically cleaved into the nonstructural proteins nsp1 to -16 that are essential for production of new viral genetic material the remainder of the genome codes for the structural proteins and carries the accessory genes that produce virions and alter the host response respectively 1 as the naming may suggest the newly emerged coronavirus is closely related to sars-cov sharing roughly 80 identity at a nucleotide level the closest relative of sars-cov-2 appears to be a virus found in bats known as ratg13-2013 96 identity suggesting that similarly to sars-cov the virus entered the human population from a spillover event either directly from a bat or through an animal intermediate 3 early studies on sars-cov-2 have shown further similarities with its namesake virus in that the spike protein utilizes ace2 as its cell surface receptor 3 4 ace2 is found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs and this receptor utilization influences the tropism of these viruses based on the speed at which the outbreak of covid-19 has developed sars-cov-2 appears to spread easily in the human population many health care workers have been infected and more clusters of cases are being detected with each passing day the reproductive number r0 of the virus is currently thought to be around 3 5 again suggesting the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission that appears to be through respiratory droplets and potentially a fecal-oral route 6 while much can be gleaned from our general understanding of coronavirus biology and some of the early studies on sars-cov-2 many pertinent questions exist for which we will outline 10 here the bat virus termed ratg13-2013 has 96 identity with sars-cov-2 3 strongly pointing toward a shared common ancestor and suggesting that the novel human pathogen originated in bats when the zoonoses first occurred remains an interesting question both sars-cov and mers-cov also have common ancestry with viruses found in bats both of these viruses had an intermediate host for transmission into humans these being palm civets and camels for sars- and mers-cov respectively 1 there has been a suggestion that pangolins may be the intermediate host for sars-cov-2 7 but this remains to be established knowing the intermediate host is an important step for understanding how sars-cov-2 became a human virus and how to potentially curtail further spillover events knowing that mers-cov transmits to humans via dromedary camels has allowed for the development of a camel vaccine to potentially limit spread to humans 8 9 approval for novel vaccines in animal hosts is far easier than in humans moreover knowing the intermediate host allows for measures to be taken to limit human contact with the animal eg not selling meat from these animals in wet food markets which can again help reduce the chances of future spillover events however with the spread of sars-cov-2 being so extensive whether these measures would be effective at limiting human cases of covid-19 may be unlikely since the early stages of the covid-19 outbreak the case fatality ratio cfr has been around 2 to 4 this is a much lower cfr than those seen for sars and mers which are around 10 and 35 respectively however many people remain in severe conditions in hospitals as a result of covid-19 which could see the cfr increase with that said the true burden of disease in the human population is currently unknown a recent report on approximately 44000 chinese patients showed that 81 develop only mild symptoms while 14 develop severe symptoms and 5 become critically ill 10 this study suggests that even among the people with symptoms severe enough to be tested for sars-cov-2 there can still be mild symptoms which may suggest that many other people have symptoms mild enough to not require testing this would make the true case count far larger and by extension the cfr lower early estimates suggested that the true case count may be as much as 10 times higher than was being reported 11 establishing the true disease burden in the human population will take time and retrospective serological survey and is a secondary aspect in relation to controlling the current disease outbreak but it remains an interesting question to be determined moving forward as more cases of covid-19 occur it is becoming established that the most severe cases and mortality are associated with underlying health conditions the most common associated comorbidities are pulmonary disease diabetes and old age 10 interesting questions as to how these comorbidities impact viral pathogenesis are open for investigation more severe sars cases were also associated with age and work in mice has demonstrated this 1214 severe mers is associated with diabetes and other underlying health conditions 15 16 and again work in mice has shown that diabetes can impact the immune response to infection leading to increased pathogenesis 17 it will be interesting to see whether sars-cov-2 infection is similarly impacted four of the seven human coronaviruses are endemic around the world but cause little more than the common cold currently sars-cov-2 is a global epidemic with the potential to be considered a pandemic in one scenario this outbreak may be contained and the virus never seen again like sars-cov alternatively the virus may become an endemic virus with seasonality like influenza and the other human coronaviruses however it is too early to know whether sars-cov-2 spread will be affected by changing weather conditions nearly all cases of covid-19 have been in china where it is winter whether cases will decrease as temperatures increase in the northern hemisphere as is seen for influenza remains to be seen a very important question for understanding sars-cov-2 infection is what systems can be used for study early studies on sars-cov-2 determined that the cellular receptor for the virus is ace2 similarly to sars-cov 3 this knowledge helps to develop an understanding of susceptibility of certain in vitro cell lines to infection with the novel virus the likelihood is that if cells were not permissive for growth of sars-cov they probably will not support growth of sars-cov-2 as more labs around the world start researching the new virus a better understanding of the permissive cell lines will be developed an important step to testing therapeutic options and developing a better understanding of basic aspects of sars-cov-2 virology the more challenging aspect of lab-based research on the novel human coronavirus will be developing small-animal models the early research on receptor usage suggests the virus is not able to infect cells expressing mouse ace2 3 thus making a mouse model potentially challenging whether expression of human ace2 in mouse lungs using adenovirus or mouse adaptation of sars-cov-2 can develop appropriate models as was done for sars-cov 18 is a pressing question whether other small-animal models can be used also needs to be investigated these models will be essential for thoroughly testing therapeutic candidates and vaccine strategies and understanding the pathology of disease as the case count and death toll of the epidemic continue to increase it becomes imperative to identify therapeutic options for covid-19 once in vitro and in vivo systems have been established these tests can proceed drug repurposing may prove to be the best strategy for quick development of novel therapeutic options a novel therapeutic being tested is remdesivir 19 20 which in combination with chloroquine has been found to inhibit sars-cov-2 growth in vitro 21 it was recently announced by the nih that remdesivir would be entering phase 3 clinical trials in humans chloroquine has also been reported to be effective in patients in china 22 a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir is also under investigation in human cases of covid-19 in china many more people will need to be treated with these drugs to determine true efficacy but they are promising leads an effective strategy to contain virus spread is vaccination during the sars-cov and mers-cov outbreaks much research went into developing vaccine strategies 23 however the cessation of the sars epidemic and the minimal human-to-human transmission of mers-cov have curtailed the testing of these interventions in humans with the emergence of sars-cov-2 a new impetus into development of coronavirus vaccines has been generated there are several platforms being used to develop vaccines against sars-cov-2 including spike subunit dna rna whole-virion and nanoparticle vaccines future testing in cells and animal models will determine which is most likely to be successful in humans after an initial push to look for therapeutic and vaccine options to help treat and prevent covid-19 it will be important to better understand the host response to infection and the pathology of disease a prerequisite step will of course be the development of appropriate animal models better understanding of how sars-cov-2 causes pathology and the way in which the host responds may help direct further therapeutic avenues understanding how comorbidities such as diabetes impact the host response to infection will also be important to better understand covid-19 compared to the two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses that have emerged in the 21st century sars-cov-2 appears to spread very well in the human population why this is the case will be interesting to understand sars-cov and sars-cov-2 appear to use the same cell receptor of ace2 suggesting a similar tropism yet the novel coronavirus appears to spread much more efficiently simply based on the number of cases and the speed at which they have emerged whether proteolytic cleavage sites such as a furin site in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 influence this will be important to determine for this outbreak and for the next there are many other coronaviruses that have been found in bats that have potential for spread in the human population 2426 developing an understanding of the difference in the dynamics of spread between sars-cov-2 and the other coronaviruses will provide insights to understand which viruses may pose the most threat for zoonotic transmission and mass spread in the human population leading to the final question the past 18 years have seen the emergence of three novel coronaviruses that have caused significant morbidity and mortality in the human population continued surveillance of viruses in animal populations and understanding the factors that influence zoonotic events are essential for attempts to limit future outbreaks the year 2020 has started with a rapid global epidemic of the virus sars-cov-2 causing the disease covid-19 the virus appears to have transmitted to humans in a zoonotic event from bats there are many questions to investigate regarding all aspects of sars-cov-2 virology and epidemiology these questions range from how the virus emerged to how it spreads and how the disease manifests but most pressingly as the global outbreak continues to grow can we develop effective vaccine and therapeutic strategies to treat not only this epidemic but any future coronavirus spillover events  physiological and pathological regulation of ace2 the sars-cov-2 receptor yanwei li wei zhou li yang ran you   the renin-angiotensin system ras maintains the homeostasis of blood pressure and the balance of fluid and salts 1 the homeostasis of ras is critical for the physiological and pathological regulation in various organs including the heart kidneys and lungs 1 angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 2 is a potent negative regulator of ras which is critical for maintaining the homeostasis of ras 23 the human ace2 gene is located on chromosome xp22 and includes 18 exons functioning as a typical zinc metallopeptidase ace2 protein which contains 805 amino acids is a type i integral membrane glycoprotein containing a single catalytic domain 3 in ras ace2 degrades angiotensin ang ii which is potent in vasoconstriction pro-inflammation and pro-fibrosis and converts it into ang 1-7 which is vasodialatic anti-proliferative and apoptotic 3 besides the systemic effect in blood pressure regulation ace2 has local regulatory effects in the pathological changes in several organs including the heart kidneys and lungs 2 ace2 also regulates the amino acid absorption in the kidney and the gut and modulates the expression of transporters for amino acid 2 ace2 was identified as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which could rapidly cause acute lung failure in humans 4 hence ace2 is vital for the viral entry to the host cells during sars-cov infection coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic as declared by the world health organization on 11 march 2020 5 has accumulated over one million confirmed cases globally as of the early april 2020 6 epidemiological study revealed that covid-19 infected people of all ages 8 the elderly and co-morbid patients are at higher risk of having poor clinical outcomes and prognosis 89 high-throughput sequencing identified the pathogen of covid-19 as a novel betacoronavirus 10 which was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses 11 comparing to sars-cov sars-cov-2 is more infective for causing more than 120 times of infections globally 1051635 confirmed cases of covid-19 as of 4 april 2020 6 vs 8096 sars patients 12 but seems to be less virulent because only parts of the patients showed similar severity as sars-cov infection 8 also the global case fatality rate of covid-19 was 54  569851051635 according to the data on 4 april 2020 6 which was lower than that of sars-cov infection 96  7748096 12 similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 mainly transmits through respiratory droplets and direct contact according to the reported cases 813 also the entry of sars-cov-2 to the host cells requires binding with the receptor via the s-spike on the surface of the virus 10 computational modeling 1014 and viral infection experiments using hela cells that express ace2 protein from humans chinese horseshoe bats civets pigs and mice 15 provided evidence that ace2 is the receptor for sars-cov-2 results in the cryo-em experiments demonstrated that sars-cov-2 had a ten times higher affinity to ace2 comparing to sars-cov which was consistent with the higher efficiency of infection of sars-cov-2 16 these findings indicated that ace2 might be crucial for the human infection of sars-cov-2 and for the progression and prognosis of covid-19 understanding the expression and activity of ace2 under different physiological and pathological conditions may help to predict the susceptibility of sars-cov-2 in different cohorts of people and the clinical outcomes and prognosis of covid-19 patients in the present review we will summarize the regulation and function of ace2 in different physiological and pathological states and discuss the potential implication in sars-cov-2 infection-induced covid-19 organs that express a higher level of ace2 are potential targets of sars-cov-2 infection therefore the distribution and abundance of ace2 in organs may be closely related to the clinical symptoms of covid-19 it is known that ace2 is enriched in the heart kidneys and testes and is also broadly distributed in the lungs liver intestine and brain 2 the lung is the primary target organ of sars-cov-2 infection 8917 most of the hospitalized patients infected with sars-cov-2 developed pneumonia which was typically characterized as ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing in chest computed tomography 817 pathological examination on the biopsy samples obtained from a deceased covid-19 patient revealed diffused alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs 18 an analysis of the single-cell rna sequencing data obtained from 43134 human lung cells revealed that 064  of cells in lungs expressed ace2 and 83  of ace2 was expressed on type ii apical surface of epithelial cells at2 19 other types of cells including type i apical epithelial cells airway epithelial cells fibroblasts endothelial cells and macrophages also express ace2 at lower levels than at2 19 these results indicated that at2 is likely to be the primary target of sars-cov-2 in the lungs 19 in addition to respiratory symptoms the common complications found in patients infected with sars-cov-2 include acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury 917 rectal swabs stool urine and saliva sampled from some covid-19 patients were positive for the sars-cov-2 virus 8 these findings demonstrated the broad distribution of sars-cov-2 in humans whose pattern was similar to the distribution of ace2 an analysis on the single-cell rna sequencing data from human organs revealed that cells that express ace2 included 75  of cardiomyocyte 4  of proximal tubular epithelial cells 24  of bladder urothelial cells 30  of ileum epithelial cells 1  of esophageal epithelial cell and 2  of respiratory tract epithelial cells 20 sars-cov-2 may attack these cells after binding with ace2 the tissue damage and inflammation may cause severe complications that may worsen the clinical outcomes moreover positive detection of the rna of sars-cov-2 in the samples of gastrointestinal tissues and stool from covid-19 patients suggested that fecal-oral transmission might be possible 21 it is noteworthy that the placental villi and the uterus also express ace2 2223 indicating the possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission current reports on clinical observations indicated that this transmission route is possible 24 25 26 but may be low risk 2728 some of the sex hormones affect the homeostasis of ras although the ace2 activity showed no difference between the male and female 29 the males have higher expression levels of ace2 in the lungs compared to the females 19 moreover at least five types of cells in the lungs from the males express ace2 while only two to four types in the females lungs do so 19 consistent with these findings the sars-cov-2 infected males were slightly but not statistically significantly higher than the females 581  vs 419  in a survey included 1099 patients 8 the female sex hormones may affect ace2 29 the aceace2 activity ratio in the male serum is higher than that in the females which may partially attribute to the activation effect of estrogen on ace2 activity 30 during pregnancy the fluctuation of hormones may drastically change the expression of ace2 both in the reproductive system and in other organs 23 the ace2 mrna expression in the uterus of pregnant rats was significantly higher than the one in the unpregnant rats 23 indicating the implication of progesterone in the regulation of ace2 expression 31 similar up-regulation of ace2 expression was also found in the kidneys of pregnant rats 32 these results suggested that pregnant women infected with sars-cov-2 should be watched for severe complications and rapid progression according to the data which collected 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from 552 hospitals in mainland china the average age of the severe patients n  173 was significantly older than the non-severe ones n  926 by seven years 8 among the critically ill covid-19 patients the non-survivors 646 years were older than the survivors 519 years 9 these data indicated that aging might be correlated with the pathological progression and poor prognosis of covid-19 results obtained from the genetic knockout mice model demonstrated that ace2 depletion caused physiological early aging independent of ang 1-7 indicating the regulatory role of ace2 in aging 33 ace2 expression in the lungs may decrease during aging according to the results in aged rats 34 in humans the ace2 activity did not differ from the young and aged males but showed significant difference in the young and aged females 2930 this finding indicated that the effect of aging in ace2 activity might have a gender difference 2930 in a study that included 220 healthy chinese volunteers young chinese females showed significantly higher ace2 activity than aged females 30 however the activity of ace2 in women during aging is controversial as a spanish group reported lower ace2 activity in the young females comparing to the aged females 29 such controversy may due to sample number-induced deviation or race which requires further validation and investigation although children of all ages were susceptible to covid-19 accumulating clinical data indicated lower infection rates and better clinical outcomes in children compared with adults 78 recently a retrospective study analyzed clinical data from 2135 pediatric cases with covid-19 and found that over 90  of these pediatric patients were asymptomatic mild or moderate cases 35 although there currently lacks an explanation to this phenomenon the authors speculated a potential implication of ace2 35 results in the animal studies implied that ace2 expression in adults might be higher than that in children sheep could be used as an animal model for studying the development of ras 36 the expression of ace2 was significantly lower in the neonatal sheep comparing to that in the adult ones 36 this finding seems to indicate that lower ace2 expression might be correlated with the lower susceptibility of children to sars-cov-2 however the expression and activity of ace2 during the development of human children and teenagers are largely unclear 35 according to the latest study on covid-19 126  were current smokers 1371085 and these patients are more severe than never-smokers as indicated by the severe rate smoker 212  29137 vs never-smoker 145  134927 8 these data suggested that cigarette smoking may affect the pathogenesis and progression of covid-19 the ace2 content in the blood of healthy male volunteers was decreased by long term smoking experience 37 the effect of cigarette smoking may attribute to nicotine which could suppress the activity of the ace2ang 1-7mas receptor axis and upregulate the aceang iiang ii type 1 receptor 38 the decreased ace2 level is accompanied by the imbalance of aceace2 and hence the disturbance in ras homeostasis animal experiments have demonstrated that downregulation of ace2 contributes to the pathogenesis of cigarette smoking-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension pah 39 the expression and activity of ace2 may be promptly modulated by diets especially the salt glucose and fat high salt diet increased activity of ace2 in the urine in mice while low salt intake decreased it 40 the activity of ace2 in the urine may reflect the ace2 in the kidneys 40 indeed it has been found that high salt diet increased the aceace2 ratio in the glomeruli which resulted in renal dysfunction via inducing oxidative stress 41 ace2 was also implicated in the hypertension whose pathogenesis was closely correlated with high salt intake high salt intake increased the prevalence of hypertension in human with ace2 rs2285666 tt and rs714205 gg genes 42 in the spontaneous hypertension rat model high salt diet profoundly worsened the symptoms of hypertension and impaired kidneys via decreasing ace2 43 high glucose diet could also up-regulate ace and down-regulate ace2 leading to the imbalance of aceace2 in the heart 44 strikingly the effect of diet could affect the offspring animal experiments using high salt diet-fed pregnant sheep revealed that the suppress effect of high salt diet on ace2 may affect the embryo and last post natal 45 western diet could decrease the methylation of ace2 gene in the kidneys and brain stem of perinatal mice and resulted in autonomic dysfunctions in the male offspring 46 these findings collectively demonstrated the impact of diet on ace2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases and may even affect the offspring since sars-cov-2 mainly transmits via respiratory droplets and that ace2 is mostly distributed on the at2 cells the lung is the most preliminary target organ for sars-cov-2 infection and pneumonia was the most common complication seen in covid-19 patients with the occurrence of 911  8 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is one of the most severe complications in covid-19 patients with the severity rate ranged from 73  to 92  81747 ace2 has well-established protective effects in the lungs 2 ace2 polymorphism was correlated with the severity of ards 2 ace2 knockout mice showed severe ards-like injury pathology in the lungs comparing to the wild type controls 48 these symptoms can be alleviated by treatment of catalytically active but not enzymatically inactive recombinant ace2 race2 protein 48 moreover ace2 was also protective of sars-infection induced acute lung disease 49 the expression of ace2 in the lungs of mice infected with sars-cov was greatly reduced which aggravated the lung failure 49 these results convincingly proved that ace2 is protective against lung injury and may be a therapeutic target for ards shown in covid-19 ace2 mrna expression decreased in the lungs of copd rats model comparing to controls 50 the reduction of ace2 in the copd lungs revealed the dysregulation of ras which may attribute to the up-regulation of et-1 because et-1 increased in the sputum and serum samples of copd patients 51 and et-1 dose- and time-dependently decreased the expression and activity of ace2 in the cell culture of human bronchial epithelial cells 52 recent data showed that covid-19 patients with copd as coexisting disorder were more likely to progress into severe cases 8 which may partially attribute to the decrease in ace2 many pulmonary diseases such as copd are accompanied by hypoxia 53 in the early phase of hypoxia ace2 expression was profoundly elevated in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells later with the elevation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 hif-1 the expression of ace the target gene of hif-1 increased accompanied by decrease of ace2 54 animal experiments demonstrated that similar regulation by hif-1 on ace2 level possibly via mirna let-7b after hypoxia in rats 55 these results indicated that hypoxia and the cellular adaptation to hypoxia could profoundly induce the fluctuation of ace2 in the lungs ras dysregulation is primarily implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of hypertension 56 being the negative regulator of ras ace2 decreases the blood pressure in animal models of hypertension 2 a decrease of ace2 has been reported in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pah 57 similarly ace2 was also decreased in the blood vessel the kidneys and the brain in the hypertension models 5859 since ace2 was protective of tissue injuries in the lungs 48 and heart 60 these results suggested that covid-19 patients with hypertension may be more likely to develop complications and progress into severe cases indeed data in table 1 showed that covid-19 patients with hypertension have a high severity rate 8 besides severe cases of covid-19 have significantly higher systolic pressure comparing to the non-severe cases 145 mmhg vs 122 mmhg 47 this phenomenon may due to the deprivation of ace2 by the sars-cov-2 leading to a drastic decrease of ace2 ace2 is enriched in heart and is known as an essential regulator of heart function 60 suggesting heart may be one of the primary target organs of sars-cov-2 infection patients infected with sars-cov-2 were at higher risk of progressing into severe cases when having coronal heart disease as comorbidity 817 acute cardiac injury is one of the most common complications found in covid-19 patients 1747 according to a retrospective study published in the lancet that included 41 covid-19 patients 12  developed acute cardiac injury 80  of these cases were diagnosed as severe cases 47 therefore coronal heart disease in the covid-19 patients was closely watched both as baseline comorbidity and as complications the pathogenesis and progression of cardiac injury were one of the preliminary factors that determined the clinical outcomes and prognosis of covid-19 patients 1747 the cardiac injury found in covid-19 patients may be at least partially attributed to the fluctuation of ace2 in the rat model of myocardial infarction the infarcted and peri-infarcted regions showed increased ace2 expression comparing to surviving myocardial tissue after three days of infarction 61 after 28 days of infarction the surviving tissue also showed elevated ace2 expression comparing to normal control 61 the up-regulation of ace2 in the heart after myocardial infarction may be triggered by a compensatory protective mechanism 62 however in the lungs of patients with pah the ace2 expression and phosphorylation were drastically decreased 57 therefore the pulmonary function of covid-19 may progressively deteriorate upon the occurrence of cardiac complications the kidneys may be a major target organ of sars-cov-2 infection because laboratory examinations demonstrated that the urine samples from some covid-19 patients were found positive for the virus 8 acute kidney injury is one of the most severe complications in covid-19 patients as sars-cov-2 may infect the renal intrinsic cells such as proximal tubular epithelial cells and directly induce renal dysfunction the occurrence of acute kidney injury as a complication of covid-19 was 7  in 41 cases reported in the lancet and all of them developed into severe cases 47 in a cohort of 1099 covid-19 patients the occurrence of acute kidney injury was 05  and the severity rate was 833  8 in a consecutive cohort study that included 701 covid-19 patients renal dysfunction characterized as elevation in serum creatine blood urea nitrogen the appearance of proteinuria or hematuria showed a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with normal renal function 63 renal dysfunction was an independent risk factor of mortality in hospitalized patients 63 these studies demonstrated that acute kidney injury was one of the most critical complications that occurred in covid-19 patients ace2 is enriched in the kidneys 2 the activity of ace2 in the renal cortex is even higher than that in the heart 2 the expression level of ace2 decreased both in the acute kidney injury 64 and in several models of chronic kidney disease induced by hypertension diabetes and nephrectomy 65 which disrupted the homeostasis of ras in the kidneys and worsened the pathological changes in the kidneys 265 accumulating evidence has also demonstrated that ace2 played a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of renal diseases as reviewed in 65 ace2 knockout could worsen renal dysfunction modeled in ischemiareperfusion 64 and aggravate the fibrotic pathologies in obstructive renal diseases 66 further investigation in the implication of ace2 in the renal dysfunction occurred in the covid-19 patients and in the clinical outcome in the covid-19 patients with chronic kidney diseases as comorbidity is required ace2 modulates the expression of neutral amino acid transporters on the cell surface of epithelial cells including the insulin secretion pancreatic -cells andor growth of pancreatic islet cells 2 ace2 knockout mice showed impairments in the islet dysfunction and abnormality in glucose tolerance 67 the diabetic mice model infected with an adenovirus expressing human ace2 showed an increase in the production of insulin and a reduction in cellular apoptosis in the pancreatic islet 68 moreover ace2 could improve the endothelial function in the pancreatic islet microvascular unit 69 these findings demonstrated that ace2 prevented pancreatic dysfunction in diabetes ace2 was implicated in the diabetic nephrology in the human kidneys with diabetic nephropathy ace2 was profoundly suppressed while ace was increased 70 the ratio of aceace2 was positively correlated with the systolic pressure the fasting blood glucose level serum creatine and proteinuria in the patients 70 race2 showed promising prevention against diabetic nephrology 2 covid-19 patients with diabetes as coexisting disorders had a worse clinical outcome these phenomena may partially attribute to the deprivation of ace2 by sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov-2 binds with ace2 to enter the host cells leading to the systematic deprivation of ace2 race2 has shown a therapeutic effect in pulmonary injury 48 diabetic nephrology and hypertension 2 recently it was found that a human recombinant soluble ace2 hrsace2 which has already been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials effectively reduced the recovery of sars-cov-2 from vero cells and prevented the infection of sars-cov-2 in engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids 71 this progress suggested the therapeutic potential of hrsace2 in covid-19 since ace2 activation has demonstrated a protective effect on pulmonary injury including ards developing ace2 activator as a potential therapy may be a promising approach against covid-19 diminazene aceturate 72 resorcinolnaphthalein and xanthenone 73 were found to activate ace2 in a drug screening test which showed potential as a candidate therapy for covid-19 acei and arb are commonly-used treatments for hypertension the safety and effect of using these drugs on covid-19 patients with hypertension are still unclear animal experiments revealed that these drugs might decrease the systolic pressure in normal rats and up-regulate ace2 74 since the ace2 expression is suppressed in hypertension 56 and may be further deprived by sars-cov-2 virus upon infection the application of arb may be protective for the pulmonary injury under careful blood pressure management ace2 is currently under intensive investigation as it is the receptor of sars-cov-2 the novel coronavirus that causes covid-19 pandemic we summarized the increasingly emerging findings in the covid-19 and discussed the potential role of ace2 in the pathogenesis progression and prognosis of covid-19 the susceptibility of sars-cov-2 in different cohorts seemed to correlate with the ace2 level the distribution of target organs that are susceptible to the sars-cov-2 infection and complications of covid-19 is similar to the one of ace2 the three functions of ace2 which are a peptidase that negatively modulates ras a regulator for the amino acid transport in the kidneys and a receptor for the virus including sars-cov-2 and sars-cov together with the local protective effect on the tissue injury are implicated in the progression and prognosis of covid-19 these findings indicated that targeting ace2 by using hrsace2 or ace2 activator may be a potential therapeutic strategy for covid-19 prescription of drugs that may affect ace2 such as acei and arb in covid-19 patients requires close observation of the blood pressure and the progression of covid-19 the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  jak1 inhibition blocks lethal sterile immune responses implications for covid-19 therapy kathryn tuttle d ross minter katherine waugh a paula araya michael ludwig colin sempeck keith smith zdenek andrysik matthew burchill a beth tamburini a j david orlicky j kelly sullivan d joaquin espinosa m  one sentence summary inhibition of the jak1 kinase prevents pathology and mortality caused by a rampant innate immune response in mice 2 cytokine storms are drivers of pathology and mortality in myriad viral infections affecting the human population in sars-cov-2-infected patients the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome myocardial damage and death however the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in covid-19 remains to be defined here we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses using a mouse model of down syndrome ds with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes ifnrs we demonstrate that these animals overexpress ifnrs and are hypersensitive to ifn stimulation when challenged with viral mimetics that activate toll-like receptor signaling and ifn anti-viral responses these animals overproduce key cytokines show exacerbated liver pathology rapidly lose weight and die importantly the lethal immune hypersensitivity accompanying cytokine storm and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a jak1-specific inhibitor therefore these results point to jak1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses additionally these results indicate that people with ds who carry an extra copy of the ifnr gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21 should be considered at high risk during the covid-19 pandemic  cytokine release syndrome crs or hypercytokinemia often referred to as a cytokine storm has been postulated to drive mortality during severe respiratory viral infections such as influenza 1 -including the 1918 spanish flu epidemic 2 and the h5n1 bird flu 3  as well as during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus epidemic of 2003 sars-cov-1 4 increasing evidence supports the notion that mortality during infections with sars-cov-2 which causes coronavirus disease of 2019  is driven by the exacerbated immune response to the virus leading to a cascade of events involving a cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards often accompanied by myocardial damage and multiple organ failure 5 6  this pathological cascade resembles what is observed in other lethal viral lung infections where the immune response to the virus triggers a primary wave of cytokines including type i and type iii interferons ifns followed by infiltration and activation of diverse immune cells and production of secondary cytokines and chemokines including type ii ifn ifn-g accelerated immune activation and progressive decline of respiratory function 7  importantly many of the cytokines and chemokines involved in the cytokine storm employ janus protein kinases jaks for signal transduction cytokine analysis of covid-19 patients indicate an important role for the magnitude of the cytokine storm in prognosis and clinical outcome levels of c-reactive protein crp and il-6 at the time of hospitalization were reported to be significantly higher in patients who eventually died versus those that survived 5  in a different study patients admitted to intensive care units icus showed significantly higher levels of il-2 il-10 il-7 ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1 g-csf and tnf- relative to non-icu patients 6  using artificial intelligence methods high levels of circulating alanine aminotransferase alt a marker of liver inflammation was associated with progression toward ards 8  altogether these findings support the rationale for combining antiviral treatment and targeted immunosuppression as a therapeutic approach in covid-19 9  accordingly several clinical trials are currently testing the safety and efficacy of inhibitors of il-6 signaling and jakstat signaling furthermore hydroxychloroquine a molecule shown to attenuate toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine production that is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus 10 11  is also being testing in many clinical trials for covid-19 within this context we report here relevant results obtained during studies of the hyperactive immune response in a mouse model of down syndrome ds we recently discovered that trisomy 21 t21 the genetic cause of ds causes consistent activation of the ifn transcriptional response in multiple cell types 12 13 14 15  which is explained by the fact that four of the six ifn receptors are encoded on chromosome 21 ifnar1 ifnar2 ifngr2 il10rb additional investigations of the proteome 16 metabolome 14  and immune cell lineages 13 15 of people with ds demonstrated that t21 causes 1 changes in the circulating proteome indicative of chronic autoinflammation with clear dysregulation of ifn-inducible cytokines 16  2 activation of the ifn-inducible kynurenine pathway leading to elevated production of neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites 14  and 3 widespread hypersensitivity to ifn stimulation across the human immune system 13 15  altogether these results support the notion that ds can be understood in good measure as an interferonopathy whereby increased ifn signaling could account for many of the developmental and clinical impacts of t21 now we report results generated during our investigation of immune responses in the dp161yey mouse strain referred hereto as dp16 17  a widely used mouse model of ds the dp16 strain carries a segmental duplication of murine chromosome 16 that is syntenic to human chromosome 21 encoding 119 genes including the four ifnrs we found that dp16 mice overexpress ifnrs in all   immune cell types tested display hypersensitivity to type i and type ii ifn stimulation overproduce key cytokines and display increased liver inflammation remarkably dp16 mice display lethal immune responses upon challenge with viral mimetic molecules such as the tlr3 agonist poly-ic pic or the tlr78 agonist imiquimod a phenotype that is not observed in their wild type wt littermates or mouse strains carrying triplications of other genomic regions syntenic to chromosome 21 strikingly both the lethal immune phenotype and associated cytokine storm are blocked by treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of the jak1 kinase which also decreases liver pathology overall these results have potential far-reaching significance for the treatment of covid-19 justifying a deeper study of jak inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy to attenuate the cytokine storm and downstream organ failure in this condition while also indicating that individuals with ds should be considered a high-risk population during the covid-19 pandemic in order to model the impact of t21 on chronic innate immune responses in mice we employed the dp16 mouse strain which harbors triplication of a region syntenic to human chromosome 21 including four ifnrs  figure 1a  17  to define the relationship between gene copy number and ifnr protein expression we evaluated surface expression of ifnar1 in peripheral immune cells from dp16 mice by flow cytometry dp101yey and dp17yey mice hereafter referred to as dp10 and dp17 which have three copies of genes that are syntenic to chromosome 21 but are disomic for ifnrs 18  were included as controls  figure 1a  expression of ifnar1 on the surface of cd45 white blood cells was significantly higher in dp16 mice but not dp10 or dp17 animals relative to wt littermates  figure 1b  when different immune cell types were analyzed by flow cytometry ifnar1 expression was significantly higher in all cell types tested  figure 1c  these results are consistent with previous reports of mrna overexpression for all ifnrs in this gene cluster in various tissues of dp16 mice 12 19  to test whether upregulation of ifnrs conferred stronger responses to ifn ligands we stimulated wt and dp16 blood samples with ifn-a and evaluated downstream phosphorylation of stat1 pstat1 by flow cytometry dp16 cells responded more strongly to ifn-a as defined by significantly higher levels of pstat1 relative to wt cells in all immune lineages examined  figure 1d  this widespread heightened response to ifn-a was not observed in dp10 and dp17 cells however t cell subsets from the dp17 strain exhibited more robust pstat1  figure 1e-f  although dp17 mice have only two copies of the ifnr genes this result suggests that some aspect of triplication of the region of chromosome 17 syntenic to human chromosome 21 leads to differential regulation of type i ifn signaling in t cells given that one of the type ii ifn receptor subunits ifngr2 is also encoded on murine chromosome 16 and triplicated in dp16 mice we next investigated the response to ifn-g stimulation indeed dp16 cells responded more strongly to ifn-g stimulation in most cell types examined  figure 1g  overall these results suggest that elevated expression of the ifnrs in the dp16 mouse strain confers increased sensitivity to type i and type ii ifns  since dp16 cells mount enhanced responses to ifn ligands we next investigated the response of dp16 mice to innate immune stimuli known to trigger an ifn response chronic systemic induction of ifn signaling was elicited by repeated administration of the tlr3 agonist polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid pic which is known to produce an acute spike of type i ifn production 1-3 days followed by low but persistent expression of type i ifn ligands and a robust cytokine response in the chronic phase 5-30 days 20  wt and dp16 mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 10 mgkg of pic or an equivalent volume of vehicle sham every other day for up to 16 days with the experiment completed at day 17 remarkably dp16 mice were profoundly sensitive to the treatment which was largely tolerated by wt mice figure   2a  body weight measurements during the course of the experiment revealed rapid weight loss in dp16 mice upon treatment  figure 2b  eventually all but one of the twelve dp16 mice had to be removed from the study for excessive weight loss 15 in contrast wt animals did not lose as much weight and all but three out of nine survived to the end of the experiment figure   2a b dp10 and dp17 mice also tolerated chronic immune stimulation with pic figure 2c-f although pic treatment caused some weight loss in both dp10 and dp17 mice the percentage lost was comparable to wt levels this pic-induced weight loss was clearly dosedependent as mice receiving half the lethal dose 5 mgkg displayed only minor weight loss with no observable differences between dp16 and wt mice  figure s1  in order to determine whether hypersensitivity was restricted to tlr3 agonists or more broadly observed across activation of other pattern recognition receptors we treated the mice with the tlr7 agonist imiquimod topical administration of imiquimod causes ifn production acute skin inflammation systemic inflammation and dehydration and is commonly employed as a model of psoriasis 21  imiquimod treatment caused significant weight loss in dp16 mice despite daily administration of supportive fluids which led to rapid termination of the study in observation of the humane endpoint  figure 2gh  in contrast wt animals receiving identical treatment maintained their weight figure 2gh  altogether these results indicate that the hypersensitivity to ifn stimulation observed at the cellular level in dp16 mice associates with increased sensitivity and lethality to ifn-inducing viral mimetic agents at the organismal level  we next compared the immune response in dp16 mice relative to their wild type littermates during the acute and chronic responses to pic first we measured levels of circulating ifn-a 6 hours after the first injection of pic or sham ifn-a levels were induced by pic with a stronger response in dp16 mice  figure 3a  elevated ifn ligand production in dp16 mice is consistent with a predicted fast-forward loop driven by increased ifnr expression in ds 22  we then measured mrna expression for several ifn-stimulated genes isgs in the spleen of wt and dp16 mice at 24 hours after a single injection of pic or sham this experiment revealed strong induction of isg expression upon pic treatment with several isgs being more significantly elevated in the dp16 mice than in wt animals  figure 3b  next we measured the levels of several cytokines and chemokines in the bloodstream 24 hours after a single pic injection expectedly pic-treated animals showed increased levels of many pro-inflammatory factors regardless of genotype  figure 3c and figure s2a  in this acute phase the most significantly elevated inflammatory markers were ip-10 cxcl10 mcp-1 rantes ccl5 and kcgro cxcl5 figure 3c  on average dp16 mice did not show significant differences in expression of cytokines relative to their wt littermates then we measured circulating cytokines and chemokines during the chronic response we compared serum levels between dp16 mice taken at the time of harvest due to reaching the humane endpoint of 15 weight loss to the levels in the wt littermates that survived to the end of the 17-day experiment at these later stages of chronic inflammation several of these inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in the dp16 animals such as mcp-1 and mip-1a but not in the wt littermates  figure 3d  altogether these results indicate that activation of tlr signaling leads to strong induction of key cytokine and chemokines in our experimental paradigm with several inflammatory markers being more elevated in the dp16 mice although not a single cytokine or chemokine stands out as the sole driver of phenotypes in the dp16 mice the mild over-production of several cytokines could potentially contribute to their exacerbated immune sensitivity  next we investigated markers of liver inflammation and injury the serum levels of the enzymes alanine transaminase alt and aspartate transaminase ast two commonly used markers of hepatocyte injury were significantly elevated upon pic treatment in the dp16 mice reaching concentrations nearly an order of magnitude higher than those observed in their wt littermates  figure 4a  prompted by these results we investigated liver pathology liver tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin he and evaluated by a trained histologist blinded against treatment group and genotype scoring of liver pathology was done with procedures adapted for mice 23 using a validated histological scoring system 24  that included parameters such as cell injury inflammation and reactive changes leading to an overall liver pathology score this analysis revealed that dp16 mice have increased liver pathology even before pic treatment as demonstrated by significantly higher levels of cell injury inflammation and reactive changes relative to their wt littermates figure 4bc  this basal level of liver pathology was not observed in the dp10 and dp17 mice figure 4de  importantly upon treatment with pic the livers of wt animals developed pathology scores comparable or greater than those observed at baseline in dp16 mice including signs of strong recruitment andor expansion of inflammatory cells when pic was administered to dp16 mice all metrics of liver pathology increased leading to significantly higher overall pathology scores relative to both dp16 sham treatment and wt upon pic treatment figure 4b-c  livers from dp10 and dp17 mice that received pic also experienced increases in liver pathology but these changes did not differ from wt mice figure 4de  overall these results indicate that dp16 mice display increased liver inflammation and pathology both at baseline and upon immune activation which could potentially contribute to their heightened sensitivity to ifn-inducing agents  all three types of ifn signaling employ the jak1 kinase for signal transduction in combination with either jak2 or tyk2 figure 1a  therefore we sought to determine whether inhibiting jak1 specifically would block the lethality and pathology caused by pic treatment in dp16 mice to this end we used the jak1-specific inhibitor incb54707 animals received a dose of 60 mgkg of incb54707 or an equivalent volume of methylcellulose used as the vehicle twice daily via oral gavage beginning 24 hours prior to the first pic injection and every day during the course of the experiment remarkably dp16 mice that received the jak1 inhibitor all survived the pic treatment while dp16 animals that received the vehicle and pic experienced weight loss and had to be euthanized  figure 5a  we then analyzed the impact of jak1 inhibition on cytokine production by comparing the dp16 mice treated with pic with and without co-treatment with the jak1 inhibitor importantly cytokine production was strongly abrogated by jak1 inhibition figure 5b and figure s3  lastly we evaluated the impact of jak1 inhibition on markers of liver inflammation and injury indeed the jak1 inhibitor led to a reduction of circulating levels of alt and ast as well as a decrease in overall liver pathology scores  figure 5c  altogether these results indicate that blocking the catalytic activity of the jak1 kinase prevents the lethality associated with a rampant innate immune response in the dp16 mouse model the efficacy of this treatment likely relies on a combination of inter-related effects such as reduced cytokine production and improved liver function  as the covid-19 pandemic rapidly progresses worldwide there is a dire need to identify new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies based on recent data from analyses of inflammatory markers in covid-19 5 6 and prior knowledge about inflammatory responses in other lethal viral lung infections targeted immune-suppression is now appreciated as a potential strategy to prevent ards fulminant myocarditis organ failure and mortality at advanced stages of the condition 9 accordingly clinical trials for diverse immune-suppressants have been started around the world including inhibitors of il-6 and jakstat signaling here we demonstrate a key role for the jak1 kinase in driving cytokine storms and accompanying mortality in a mouse model of lethal anti-viral immune responses jak1 is one of several jak kinases required for mediating inflammatory signaling downstream of a large number of cytokines including all three types of ifn signaling and il-6 25 we show that eliciting the innate anti-viral immune response with tlr agonists is lethal in a sensitized mouse model carrying triplication of four of the six ifn receptors within days the dp16 mice rapidly lose weight and die if unattended concurrent with induction of many prominent cytokines linked to the severity of covid-19-driven pathology such as il-6 tnf- il-10 ip-10 mcp-1 and mip-1 6  furthermore dp16 mice display exacerbated liver inflammation and pathology which together with stronger production of some cytokines may converge into a pathological cascade leading to wasting and death importantly these phenotypes are blocked by jak1 inhibition based on these results we propose here that jak inhibitors are a valid therapeutic approach for attenuating the cytokine storm in covid-19 four jak inhibitors are currently fda-approved for the treatment of diverse medical conditions jakafiruxolitinib a jak12 inhibitor approved for myelofibrosis polycythemia vera and graft-versus-host-disease xeljanztofacitinib a jak13 inhibitor approved for rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis olumiantbaricitinib a jak12 inhibitor approved for rheumatoid arthritis and rinvoqupadacitinib a jak1 inhibitor also approved for rheumatoid arthritis many jak1specific inhibitors are currently being developed and tested in clinical trials for diverse inflammatory and autoimmune conditions including the molecule used in this study we hypothesize that jak inhibitors could be superior agents in terms of attenuating the cytokine storm caused by covid-19 relative to existing anti-il6 agents which consist of injectable monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the interaction between il-6 and its receptor il-6r 26  in contrast jak inhibitors are available as drugs administered orally with very well characterized pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and may provide a more appropriate strategy to transiently tone down the cytokine storm to prevent ards and fulminant myocarditis furthermore jak1 inhibitors not only block il-6 signaling but also other inflammatory pathways involved in the cytokine storm 25  depending on the degree of inhibition of various jak kinases it is predicted that available jak inhibitors will block various aspects of the cytokine storm with potential for varying degrees of therapeutic benefit with regards to its relevance to therapeutic strategies for covid-19 and other conditions associated with cytokine storms this study has several limitations first our mouse model does not fully reproduce the human conditions associated with cytokine storms although pandemic our studies of the dp16 mice were originally driven by our interest in studying immune dysregulation and ifn hyperactivity in ds of note our results are consistent with studies of sars-cov-1 demonstrating that type i ifn signaling contributes to sars-driven pathology and mortality in mice 29  we predict that as has been observed during rsv 30 and h1n1 31 infections people with ds will develop more severe complications upon sars-cov-2 infection including higher rates of hospitalization and mortality we hope these results will encourage special attention to individuals with ds including closer monitoring of

-2 sars-cov-2 emerged in late 2019 27 and has spread worldwide resulting in the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic 28 although animal models have been evaluated for sars-cov-2 infection none have recapitulated 29 the severe lung disease phenotypes seen in hospitalized human cases here we evaluate 30 heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ace2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell 31 cytokeratin-18 gene promoter k18-hace2 as a model of sars-cov-2 infection intranasal 32 inoculation of sars-cov-2 in k18-hace2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung 33 tissues with additional spread to other organs remarkably a decline in pulmonary function as 34 measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity occurs 4 days after peak viral titer 35 and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes 36 neutrophils and activated t cells resulting in pneumonia cytokine profiling and rna sequencing 37 analysis of sars-cov-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune 38 response with prominent signatures of nf-kb-dependent type i and ii interferon signaling and 39 leukocyte activation pathways thus the k18-hace2 model of sars-cov-2 infection 40 recapitulates many features of severe covid-19 infection in humans and can be used to define 41 the mechanistic basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures 42 43 ace2 promoter 1112  while these animals all support sars-cov-2 infection none cause severe 63 disease or lethality thus an animal model is still urgently needed for understanding the biology 64 of severe sars-cov-2 infection and evaluating the efficacy of countermeasures for covid-19 65 the k18-hace2 transgenic k18-hace2 mice in which hace2 expression is driven by 66 the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 k18 promoter 13  were originally developed to study sars-cov 67 pathogenesis and cause lethal infection 9  here we evaluate heterozygous hace2 transgenic 68 mice as a model for severe covid-19 disease after intranasal sars-cov-2 inoculation k18-69 the extra-pulmonary organs examined 132  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is the recently 45 emerged rna virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 pandemic clinical 46 disease is variable ranging from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure and death with a 47 case-fatality rate of 5 the binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to human angiotensin-i 48 converting enzyme-2 hace2 targets the virus to type ii pneumocytes within the lung resulting 49 in injury inflammation and subsequent respiratory distress 12  other covid-19 manifestations 50 eg cardiac dysfunction coagulopathy and gastrointestinal tract symptoms suggest that extra-51 pulmonary sites of infection contribute to disease pathogenesis in some patients 3  52 the development of countermeasures that reduce covid-19 morbidity and mortality is a 53 priority for the global research community and animal models are essential for this effort 54 although several animal species used in laboratory research have been evaluated for 55 susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection none have recapitulated the severe disease seen in 56 hospitalized human cases hamsters ferrets and non-human primates develop mild to moderate 57 viral disease and recover spontaneously 45  conventional laboratory strains of mice cannot be 58 infected efficiently by sars-cov-2 because hace2 but not mouse ace2 supports sars-cov-59 2 binding 67  multiple strategies for introducing hace2 into mice have been developed including 60 1 transient introduction of hace2 via adenoviral viral vectors 8  2 expression of hace2 as a 61 transgene driven by heterologous gene promoters 910  or 3 expression of hace2 by the mouse 62 physiology over the course of sars-cov-2 infection in k18-hace2 mice we measured clinical 134 chemistry and hematological parameters from peripheral blood samples fig 3  plasma levels of 135 sodium potassium and chloride concentrations and the anion gap all trended slightly downward 136 at 7 dpi fig 3a-d whereas plasma bicarbonate noticeably increased fig 3e  possibly as a result 137 of poor gas exchange resulting from lung pathology or decreased respiratory drive other plasma 138 analytes including calcium glucose and blood urea nitrogen were unchanged fig 3f-h  139 hematocrit and plasma hemoglobin levels increased later in the course of infection possibly 140 because of reduced water intake and hemoconcentration fig 3i-j  we also observed a modest 141 prolongation in the prothrombin time at 7 dpi that was preceded by an increase in d-dimer 142 concentrations on 2 and 4 dpi fig 3k-l  143 we next examined the impact of sars-cov-2 infection on pulmonary and cardiac function 144 using a treadmill stress-test to assess exercise tolerance fig 3m  compared to mock-infected 145 controls at 4 dpi a subset of sars-cov-2-infected k18-hace2 mice began to show reduced 146 exercise tolerance as measured by decreased distance travelled however by 5 dpi all infected 147 k18-hace2 mice had substantially reduced exercise tolerance compared to mock-infected 148 animals or their own pre-infection baseline performance fig 3m  149 to examine changes to the biophysical properties of the lung over the course of sars-150 cov-2 infection we mechanically ventilated mice via tracheostomy and performed several forced-151 oscillation tests to determine various respiratory mechanics parameters fig 3n-w  infected 152 animals showed normal lung biomechanics at 2 and 4 dpi but had markedly abnormal values in 153 most parameters at 7 dpi relative to mock-infected controls these abnormalities included 154 reduced inspiratory capacity as well as increased respiratory system resistance and elastance 155 fig 3n-p  collectively these changes resulted in a downward deflection of the pressure-volume 156 loop fig 3r with concomitant decreases in static compliance fig 3q  the shape-describing k 157 parameter fig 3s  and loop hysteresis fig 3t  which together indicate reduced lung compliance 158 and distensibility further analysis using broadband forced oscillation maneuvers 15 revealed that 159 sars-cov-2 infected mice at 7 dpi had relatively normal newtonian resistance fig 3u  which 160 is primarily a reflection of resistance in larger conducting airways in contrast mice at 7 dpi had 161 marked increases in tissue damping fig 3v and elastance fig 3w  these parameters measure 162 the dissipation and storage of oscillatory energy in parenchymal tissue and reflect tissue and 163 peripheral airway resistance and elastic recoil ie tissue stiffness respectively the 164 measurements of mechanical properties of the respiratory system suggest that sars-cov-2 165 infection in k18-hace2 mice predominantly causes disease in the alveoli and lung parenchyma 166 and not in the conducting airways which is consistent with both our histopathological analysis in 167 mice and measurements of pulmonary function in humans with viral pneumonia and respiratory 168 failure including covid-19 16  169 the immune response to sars-cov-2 infection in the lungs an excessive pro-170 inflammatory host response to sars-cov-2 infection is hypothesized to contribute to pulmonary 171 pathology and the development of respiratory distress in some covid-19 patients 17  to evaluate 172 the composition of the immune cell response in sars-cov-2-infected k18-hace2 mice we 173 performed flow cytometric analysis on lung homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid 174 at three time points after intranasal virus inoculation fig 4a-b extended data fig 4  consistent 175 with our histopathological analysis we observed increased numbers of cd45  immune cells in 176 the bal beginning at 2 dpi and in the lung at 4 dpi the cellular infiltrates at 4 and 7 dpi in the 177 lung were composed principally of myeloid cell subsets including ly6g  neutrophils ly6c  178 monocytes and cd11b  cd11c  dendritic cells in the bal fluid monocyte numbers peaked at 4 179 dpi and levels of neutrophils and dendritic cells continued to rise through 7 dpi accumulation of 180 monocytes in the bal fluid coincided with a decrease in the number of tissue-resident alveolar 181 macrophages an observation consistent with scrna-seq analysis of bal fluid of patients with 182 severe covid-19 disease 1819  by 7 dpi we also observed an increase in several lymphoid cell 183 subsets in the lung including nk11  natural killer cells  cd3  t cells cd3  cd4  t cells 184 cd3  cd8  t cells and activated cd44  cd3  cd8  t cells fig 4a  185 extensive changes in cytokine profiles are associated with covid-19 disease 186 progression 20-22  compared to the lungs of uninfected k18-hace2 control mice we observed 187 induction of ifnb il28 ifng cxcl10 cxcl11 and ccl2 mrna over the first week fig 4c with 188 highest expression occurring at 2 dpi for all cytokines except ifng and ccl2 we also measured 189 protein levels in the lungs using a multiplex assay of 44 different cytokines and chemokines fig  190   4d extended data fig 5  although mrna expression was highest at 2 dpi almost all up-191 regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn il-6 cxcl10 cxcl9 ccl5 ccl12 timp-1  192 tnf and g-csf t cell-associated cytokines il-10 ifn and il-2 and myeloid cell- revealed distinct transcriptional signatures associated at 7 dpi fig 5a with overlapping 207 signatures at 2 and 4 dpi hundreds of genes were differentially expressed at all time points 208 compared to mock-infected animals fig 5b  many of these associated with ifn signaling nf-209 kb-dependent cytokine responses or leukocyte activation in agreement with the pca only 449 210 differentially expressed genes were shared at all time points when compared to mock in contrast 211 1975 unique differentially expressed genes were identified between mock to 7 dpi whereas only 212 59 and 152 genes were different between mock and 2 and 4 dpi respectively fig 5c  gene 213 ontology analysis of the top upregulated genes at all time points showed enrichment of gene 214 clusters in cytokine-mediated signaling type i and ii ifn signaling neutrophil activation and 215 pathogen recognition receptor signaling fig 5d  upregulation of gene sets involved in cytokine-216 mediated signaling neutrophil activation cellular responses to type ii ifn and toll-like receptor 217 signaling were most pronounced at 7 dpi fig 5e- and ifit3 versus 7 dpi eg ifnar12 tyk2 irf1 and certain isgs samhd1 oas2 and ifitm1 this 221 suggests a temporally distinct type i ifn response fig 5f  which has been described previously 222 with ifna and ifnb subtypes 28-30  alternatively the differences in ifn and isg signatures at early 223 and late time points could reflect differential signaling contributions of type i and iii ifns as these 224 in this study we found that sars-cov-2 infection of k18-hace2 transgenic mice causes 231 severe pulmonary disease after intranasal sars-cov-2 inoculation k18-hace2 mice rapidly 232 lost weight after 4 dpi and began to succumb to disease at 7 dpi high levels of viral rna and 233 infectious virus were detected in the lungs of infected animals at 2 4 and 7 dpi by rt-qpcr in 234 situ hybridization and plaque assay infection was accompanied by high levels of pro- mild disease is a feature of sars-cov-2 infection in naturally susceptible animals including 243 hamsters ferrets cats and non-human primates 5  this is perhaps unsurprising given that the 244 strongest risk factors for developing severe covid-19 in humans eg old age cardiovascular 245 disease and diabetes are absent in many laboratory animals mild to moderate disease is seen 246 in many rodent models of sars-cov-2 infection including those expressing hace2 via viral 247 vectors or transgenes 8111233  thus the severity of disease we observed following sars-cov-2 248 infection of k18-hace2 mouse is unique as the onset of severe clinical disease in k18-hace2 249 mice occurs days after peak viral infection and is associated with high levels of infiltrating immune 250 cells and inflammatory mediators in the lung immune responses likely contribute to pathogenesis 251 the histopathological changes we observed in the infected lungs of k18-hace2 mice 252 correlate with the impaired pulmonary function pneumocytes become infected early which led 253 to recruitment of leukocytes into the pulmonary interstitium production of proinflammatory 254 cytokines injury to parenchymal cells collapse of the alveolar space and compromise of gas 255 exchange all of which could cause the hypercapnia we observed at 7 dpi this course is 256 remarkably consistent with human disease in which rapid early viral replication is followed by 257 inflammatory responses which are believed to contribute to pathology morbidity and mortality 34  258 a fundamental understanding of the immunological processes that influence covid-19 259 disease is needed to select immunomodulatory interventions that target key cell types or 260 pathways we saw substantial immune cell accumulation in the lungs of k18-hace2 mice an the role of type i ifn in sars-cov-2 pathogenesis in this model warrants further 275 investigation as it has been suggested that a dysregulated type i ifn response contributes to 276 excessive immunopathology indeed in sars-cov infection type i ifn signaling appears pro-277 inflammatory and not antiviral 37  our rna sequencing analysis revealed differences in the type i 278 ifn gene signatures associated with early and late sars-cov-2 infection given that isgs can 279 exert diverse functions apart from their antiviral activities including inflammatory metabolic and 280 transcriptional effects 38  these two early and late isg modules may have different functional 281 consequences following sars-cov-2 infection furthermore how these temporally distinct 282 programs are induced and regulated remains uncertain and may be the result of cell-type 283 specificity kinetics and sensitivity to different type i or iii ifn subtypes 284 the development of severe disease following sars-cov-2 infection is an important 285 feature of the k18-hace2 model although the precise reason for this susceptibility compared to 286 other hace2 transgenic models remains unknown potential explanations include a high number 287 of hace2 transgene insertions httpswwwjaxorgstrain034860 andor the strength and 288 cellular specificity of the k18 promoter human ace2 is expressed in multiple tissues in the k18-289 hace2 mouse 9  which could allow for sars-cov-2 infection of multiple organs while we 290 detected viral rna in several tissues the lung was the most heavily infected and showed the 291 most consistent and severe histopathological changes these findings were anticipated given the 292 known tropism of sars-cov-2 for the respiratory tract and the intranasal route of infection 293 moderate levels of viral rna also were found in the heart kidney and spleen with peak titers at 294 2 and 4 dpi whereas levels in gastrointestinal tract tissues duodenum ileum and colon were 295 lower in the gastrointestinal tract of k18-hace2 mice hace2 was expressed most abundantly 296 in the colon which correlated with infection seen at later time points although hace2 is 297 expressed in the gastrointestinal tract in other hace2-expressing mice productive infection was 298 observed only upon intragastric inoculation or at early time points following intranasal 299 infection 1112  300 we observed dichotomous sars-cov-2 infection in the brain with high virus levels in 301 approximately 40 of mice at 7 dpi and low levels in the remaining 60 of animals infection of 302 the brain also was observed in k18-hace2 mice infected with sars-cov 914 but occurred earlier 303 at 3 to 4 dpi and more uniformly similar to the experiments with sars-cov we did not detect 304 sars-cov-2 in the olfactory bulb which suggests that both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 cross 305 the blood-brain barrier instead of traversing the cribriform plate and infecting neuronal processes 306 near the site of intranasal inoculation 39  notwithstanding this data and unlike sars-cov 307 alterations in smell and taste are features of sars-cov-2 infection in humans 40  suggesting that 308 cell types within the olfactory system may be susceptible to infection or injury more study is 309 needed to clarify the routes sars-cov-2 dissemination throughout the host and particularly how 310 it accesses the brain in some animals and humans 311 while sars-cov-2 lung infection in k18-hace2 mice provides a model for studying 312 severe infection that recapitulates features of covid-19 in humans we acknowledge several 313 limitations the expression of the hace2 transgene is non-physiological in several respects it is 314 driven by a non-native ie the cytokeratin-18 promotor resulting in tissue expression levels that 315 are distinct from endogenously-expressed ace2 ace2 expression in k18-hace2 mice is 316 independent of the complex regulatory systems that governs ace2 levels 41  as such comorbid 317 conditions eg obesity hypertension diabetes that alter ace2 expression in humans 41 likely 318 cannot be modelled faithfully in this transgenic mouse 319 in summary we found that sars-cov-2 infection of k18-hace2 transgenic mice supports 320 robust viral replication in the lung which leads to severe immune cell infiltration

response using genomics and bioinformatics a case study on the emergent sarscov2 outbreak denis bauer c aidan tay p laurence wilson o daniel reti cameron hosking alexander mcauley j elizabeth pharo shawn todd vicky stevens matthew neave j mary tachedjian trevor drew w seshadri vasan s   the world is witnessing increasing instances of emerging and reemerging diseases caused by viruses for instance there have been six public health emergency of international concern pheic declarations by the who since 2009 viz h1n1 swine flu polio west africa ebola zika and the ongoing kivu ebola and sarscov2 coronavirus outbreaks eurosurveillance editorial team 2019 2020 two of these viruses h1n1 and sarscov2 have resulted in pandemics within 10 years who 2020 the sars outbreak of 20022004 the mers outbreaks since 2012 and the current covid19 outbreak since 2019 demonstrate the potential of coronaviruses especially batderived betacoronaviruses zhou et al 2020 to cause pheics with covid19 having escalated to a global pandemic viruses in a new host humans have the potential to evolve rapidly and present quasispecies diversity eigen mccaskill  schuster 1988 which is a hallmark of rna viruses that exist as a cloud of variants due to low fidelity high polymorphism and viral polymerases lacking the capability to correct errors drew 2011 wilke wang ofria lenski  adami 2001 as a result most variants are a random accumulation of errors useful for tracing aetiology but typically without substantial functional change grubaugh petrone  holmes 2020 unlike most other rna viruses coronaviruses express a 3to5 exoribonuclease that enables the highfidelity replication of their relatively large 2632 kb ssrna genome minskaia et al 2006snijder et al 2003 coronaviruses have a moderate mutation rate 080238  103 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the sarscov genome zhao et al 2004 allowing a wider evolutionary space to be explored more deliberately this can complicate the outbreak response in terms of rapid development and evaluation of diagnostics vaccines antivirals and antibody therapies as many diverse strains with unknown functional differences exist figure 1 this is particularly exacerbated by increased movement of people enabled by global air travel animals and goods spreading new viruses across the worlds population and exposing them to huge variations in environment demographics age structure socioeconomic status comorbidities and equitable access to health care the sheer number of these interconnected influencing factors often makes an unfolding situation hard to comprehend fully and challenges the traditional virology and public health disciplines by rendering them less effective in coping with the spread of the virus bioinformatic approaches may be able to better inform epidemiology and responses to transboundary viruses by synthesizing complex information more effectively and systematically enabled by the advances in genomic sequencing technology eg oxford nanopore illumina and the willingness to share the sequenced information in the public domain eg genbank gisaid bioinformatic approaches developed in the human domain have enabled comparative analysis of the emerging genomic diversity of a virus as it spreads throughout a host population for the ongoing covid19 outbreak as illustrated in figure 1 applying in silico approaches can rapidly provide answers to questions like is the first sequenced sarscov2 genome often called the reference genome in gisaid genbank etc closest to the original or true reference strain which entered humans which may not have been sequenced andor which may still be circulating with minimal mutations combined with epidemiological or experimental evidence bioinformatics can help address questions like are there one or multiple circulating strains and are they different to the most virulent ones if yes can we identify the molecular basis finally can synthetic consensus sequences be used to represent the genetic diversity of individual isolates in larger circulating clusters answers to these questions are not just of academic interest they can help inform outbreak response and development and evaluation of diagnostics vaccines and countermeasures for instance outbreak response efforts including vaccine evaluation should focus on the most prevalent circulating strain lest we may end up rejecting acceptable candidates by raising the efficacy threshold too high but it would be desirable to evaluate therapeutics against the most virulent strain however with the field not yet using bioinformatic tools to their fullest potential current data collection practices are not capturing the information necessary for advanced analysis for example pathogen sequences derived from patients are typically not annotated with deidentified disease progression and other clinically relevant information and this in turn hampers the identification of the most virulent strain or associating pathogen properties with genomic modifications here we use bioinformatic analysis to identify emerging trends among the sarscov2 isolates from this we sought to identify the most representative strains for animal models and preclinical research in particular which strains among the emerging australian isolates are good choices for animal model development and which ones are not representative two australian isolates betacovaustraliavic022020 and betacovaustraliasa012020 were sequenced with the miseq platform illumina inc in brief rna was purified from each isolate using a directzol rna miniprep kit zymo research purified rna was reverse transcribed using a taqman reverse transcription kit applied biosystems with random octamers linked to a specific primer sequence followed by secondstrand cdna synthesis using klenow dna polymerase i promega complementary dna was further amplified using primers specific to the sequences added to the random octamers used for reverse transcription with a kapa hifi hotstart kit roche resulting dna was purified using a dna clean and concentrator kit zymo research fragmentation and dualindex library preparation was conducted using a nextera xt dna library preparation kit illumina inc and denatured libraries were sequenced using a 300cycle miseq reagent kit v2 illumina inc sequencing reads were trimmed for quality and mapped to the published reference sequence betacovwuhanhu12019 genbank accession number nc0455122 using geneious 1114 consensus genome sequences for the isolates were generated for analysis all available viral sequences were downloaded from gisaid on 05032020 see appendix s3 elbe  bucklandmerrett 2017 filtering for complete sequences of human origin 187 genomes in total lowquality sequences defined as sequences with an n content greater than 1 were filtered out leaving 178 strains in total we also included one recently reported viral sequence from the european virus archive global refsku 026v03883 and the two australian sequences in the full data set this data set of 181 sequences was aligned against each other using muscle v3831 madeira et al 2019 based on the alignments we could see significant variation at the ends of the sequences figure s1 likely due to sequencing artefacts and errors preventing the full viral genomes from being sequenced to reduce the impact of potential sequencing errors we wrote a custom perl script to trim the sequences such that only positions with 95 coverage were retained this trimming entailed removing the first 101 and last 72 bp from the alignments once trimmed and converting all u to t we identified 54 sequences that were identical to limit the effect of duplicate sequences on subsequent analysis we collapsed these into a single entry these collapsed sequences are summarized in table s1 to validate the methodology we have included sequences from other coronaviruses we chose a mixture of controls as follows 7 sars sequences of human origin genbank accession numbers ay2741193 ay2914511 ay5029231 ay5029321 ay5590831 ay5590841 and ay5590871 10 sars sequences of bat origin accession numbers ky4171421 to ky4171521 4 mers sequences of human origin accession numbers kj4771021 kt0061492 kt0264531 and kt0291391 and 2 mers sequences of bat origin accession numbers mg5968021 and mg5968031 the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated from the above alignments using raxmlng kozlov darriba flouri morel  stamatakis 2019 the evolutionary model used was a general time reversable model with gammadistributed rate heterogeneity and invariant sites gtr  g  i we use this mode since it is the most general model and has been proposed to produce equal trees to optimally selected models abadi azouri pupko  mayrose 2019 the tree was visualized using itol letunic  bork 2019 as a midpoint rooted tree and shows the likely evolutionary relationships between the sampled strains every organism and potentially isolate can have a unique genomic signature based on the composition of their genomic sequence to quantify this signature we determined the kmer frequency counting of all possible strings of length k in the sequence of the virus has emerged as an alternative to phylogenetic trees in other disciplines sims jun wu  kim 2009 the conceptual distance between all isolates can then be visualized by running a principal component analysis pca over all genomic signatures to reduce this highdimensional kmer frequency vector into a twodimensional space jolliffe  cadima 2016 please see appendix s1 for more details of this method custom scripts were used to calculate the kmer frequency for each sequence using a k of 10 sims et al 2009 kmers containing ambiguous bases ie ns were removed we then calculated the relative proportion of each kmer resulting in a frequency vector we used the pca implementation of python scikitlearn to reduce the genomic signatures containing 1048576 10mer proportions into a vector containing two principal components finally custom scripts were used to compare the genomic signatures for all aforementioned coronavirus sequences the evolutionary structure of the 181 isolates as determined by the phylogenetic tree reveals three major clusters c1c3 figure 2 the c1 cluster mainly represents wuhan and isolates captured early on c2 and c3 contain later isolates such as sydney3 australiavic01 and franceidf0372 in c2 and australiansw01 australiaqld013 australiavic02 and usawa1 in c3 the three clusters are separated by distinct mutations table 1 but contain a substantial number of other unique mutations which we define as diversity within the cluster these individual mutations are outside of the established hotspots of diversity wang et al 2020 as shown in figure s4 which are predominantly of concern for pcr primer design rather than aetiology there may also be three additional clusters emerging c46 with c4 capturing the suspected community spread from lombardy narrative genomic analysis of covid19 spread nd c5 regionally mixed asia and north amerika and c6 from australia and asia notably australiansw057 see fully annotated tree in figure s5 this finding is different to tang et al 2020 who postulate two clusters s and l their analysis was only on 103 gisaid isolates and includes betacoronaviruses from bats which roots the tree differently and merges c1 and c2 however as the aetiology is not fully demonstrated especially with the intermediate vector yet unknown artificially rooting the tree by introducing a distant relative may bias the results irrespective of the root placement both trees allow the assessment of individual isolates that are not part of major branches by being genetically divergent offshoots for example sydney2 appears to be an offshoot from wuhanhu1 upon further inspection of the sydney2 strand we discovered a 41bp deletion which overlaps the infectious bronchitis virus ibv motif at the 3 end goebel taylor  masters 2004 inspecting other isolates australiavic01 has also a 10bp deletion within the genomic location of the 41bp deletion figure s3 despite this similarity australiavic01 was placed into c2 and sydney2 in c1 since australiavic01 contains the g26144t mutation indicative of c2 which sydney2 lacks see table 2 for a list of referenced isolates a more systematic sequence analysis revealed that many isolates have deletions in their core genome table s2 while these deletions appear to be specific to each isolate figure s4 their effect on virus structure or function might be pronounced for example australiavic01 and sydney2 may have the ibv motif disrupted with implications for replication while usaca6 and japanai004 may have disruption in the nonstructural protein 1 nsp1 with implications for host gene expression figure s3 while the full impact of these genomic variations can only be confirmed through functional genomics experiments coronaviruses proofreading ability likely lifts them above random accumulation of errors as such having a methodology able to take deletions into consideration when calculating genomic distance is desirable aiming to overcome the limitations of phylogenetic tree approaches we also investigated whether an alignmentfree approach can be used to understand how the genomic content of different sarscov2 isolates changes over time and with respect to each other by also taking deletions into account we therefore calculated the frequency of all possible 10mers across each viral genome followed by principal component analysis pca to reduce the highdimensional kmer vector space into a twodimensional image for visual comparison we first demonstrate the methods ability to faithfully separate distant coronavirus strains by comparing all sarscov2 against 17 sars and 6 mers isolates as shown in figure 3 inset this alignmentfree approach separates the isolates into their three respective clusters of sarscov2 sars and mers this indicates that the genetic distance between the different isolates of the same coronavirus strain is relatively small while there are substantial differences between the different coronavirus virus strains predictably we separated mers isolates into two subclusters reflecting their different host origins human and bat to further investigate how the genomic content of different sarscov2 viruses relates to each other we reran the pca analysis on just the sarscov2 sequences here the genomic signatures of isolates that are likely to be closely related cluster together eg australiaqld01 australiaqld03 samples from close family relations while strains separated by time are far apart eg wuhanhu1 collection date 31122019 and australiansw05 collection date 2822020 of the australian isolates sydney3 and australiansw01 were the closest to wuhanhu1 which is consistent with the phylogenetic results and reflects the fact that these sequences have only mutational changes in their core sequences compared to wuhanhu1 table s2 however this alignmentfree method positions isolates with deletions viz australiavic01 and canadaonvido01 further away from wuhanhu1 than in the phylogenetic tree demonstrating the ability of the kmer method to represent deletions accurately see supplemental table 7 of the 181 isolates we found that singapore4 taiwanntu01 finland1 usail1 and shenzhenszth001 were among the furthest from wuhanhu1 data not shown for both singapore4 and taiwanntu01 this is due to these being shorter than the core sequences so the kmer fingerprint accurately reflects the missing sequences meanwhile usail1 and finland1 contained several ambiguous bases effectively shortening the length of similar sequence so the method correctly places them further from the other isolates while the kmer approach is not as suggestive as phylogenetic trees with respect to visualizing the potential transmission route eg lombardy it may more accurately reflect the fluidity of changes cloud of variants and capture recombination events graham  baric 2010 an example is italyinmi1 which has mutations in common with both sydney3 c1 cluster g26144t and chongqingivdccq001 c3 cluster g11083t making it impossible to definitively place it in the discrete phylogenetic tree it was placed in the c2 cluster figure 2 while the pca plot shows the fluid evolution placing it between the italian and australian isolate figure 3 more generally phylogenetic analysis is based on the presence of shared mutations for example two strains which share most snps are likely to be closely related and therefore exist on neighbouring branches in the phylogenetic tree in comparison an alignmentfree method such as kmer signatures is more concerned with global similarities and difference for example changes averaged across the whole genome rather than at specific locations this can be informative about highlevel similarities between genomes for example evolution of distinct genomic islands with common functions or recombination events while this does not create visually clear clades it offers a more holistic representation of pairwise distances between all isolates together with clinical information this could hence help determine the most virulent strains figure 1 currently the process of determining which isolate to use for animal models is less informed than it could be due to the lack of shared genomic information and readily available bioinformatic methodologies especially towards the beginning of an outbreak for example while china published the genomic sequence of sarscov2 zhou et al 2020 patient samples or virus isolates were not made available and with reverse genetics of a large rna virus taking time thao et al 2020 countries had to wait for imported cases australias doherty institute was the first in the world to isolate the virus australiavic01 and made it available for preclinical animal models to the authors csiro 2020 public health england etc this practical consideration dictated the initial choice however with more isolates to choose from subsequently a more informed approach can be taken figure 1 two questions are pertinent is vic01 an appropriate strain to continue with further development and characterization of the animal model if not what options are more representative and appropriate while nextstrain narrative genomic analysis of covid19 spread nd is a powerful aid in visualizing the available strains in real time it currently relies on phylogeny only and thus may be hampered in its conclusions in this section we offer a static view of the alignmentfree approach for the currently used strains for animal model research that we know of and interpret their likely representativeness with respect to future evolution of the virus according to the phylogenetic tree shown in figure 4a the main clusters are represented by the current animal models that is c1 is represented by germanybavpat1 and human 2019ncov whose core sequence is identical though they seem to be halfway to the c4 cluster suspected lombardy cluster c2 is represented by australiavic01 and franceidf0372 and c3 is represented by usawa1 note that scotlandcvr01 was removed due to its high n content 23 however with phylogenetic methods focusing on the presence of shared mutations rather than the overall genomic similarity eg shared evolved functionality the assumption that current animal models adequately cover the evolutionary space of the actively circulating virus might be misleading as the pca plot indicates figure 4b here the topleft and bottomright areas seem to be underrepresented to join the strainetiology of phylogenetic approaches with the more fluid distance measure of alignmentfree methods we created the consensus sequences of the major and emerging clusters appendix s2 and reran the pca analysis to find more robust and future relevant isolates figure 4b of the existing animal models only usawa1 is close to a consensus c3 all other clusters have different representative isolates viz c1 directly overlaps wuhanhu1 c2 is nearest to zhejiangwz01 c3 directly overlaps australiansw01 c4 directly overlaps switzerland1000477796 c5 directly overlaps vietnamvr0338142 and c6 is nearest to australiansw07 the central location of germanybavpat1 and franceidf0372 may reflect a broad representation across multiple clusters in contrast to canadaonvido01 and australiavic01 which are located further away from the sarscov2 centre marked by the rectangle in figure 4b inset in this outer view the dominant driver for placing isolates away from the centre is missing bases either due to deletions missing sequences at the tails or ambiguous bases the vertical lines hence cluster isolates with a similar number of missing bases for example australiavic01 and canadaonvido01 have 10bp deletions while koreakcdc05 and australiasydney02 have a 40bp shorter sequence and 42bp deletion respectively among the australian strains the genomic distance analysis marks australiasydney2 as a less optimal target for animal models compared to say australiavic01 australiavic02 and australiasa01 in no particular order in this context usawa1 available through bei could also be a good choice due to its central location likely ability to represent especially the newly emerging clusters and comparability of animal models with nonhuman primate studies in the united states which have chosen this on the basis of being readily available clinical observations eg severity of symptoms and mortality if applicable and experimental observations eg growth and titre can refine the choice of isolate for animal model development with further refinement based on observations from animal challenge studies such as shedding of the virus associated histopathology and clinical signs if applicable it is clear that at this early stage of the pandemic our initial questions around the number of circulating strains and their virulence cannot be answered with the currently available epidemiological and clinical data even when applying sophisticated computational analysis tools however we have demonstrated that creating synthetic consensus sequences can be used to demarcate the evolutionary space already claimed by the virus while sarscov2 does have a proofreading exoribonuclease domain in nsp14 its genetic drift remains a point of uncertainty with respect to the longlasting efficacy of a vaccine candidates currently being developed in conclusion joining bioinformatics epidemiological and experimental results can help inform animal model choice for efficient preclinical responses callaway 2020 moving away from purely practical considerations towards a more deliberate approach that assesses current and future characteristics of isolate choices will lead to a better coverage of actively circulating strains figure 1 with more sharing of isolates internationally and information collected about patientdeidentified details of case severity and outcome more sophisticated machine learning approaches can be generated to assist in triaging and treatment choices additional information such as comorbidities socioeconomic and smoking status may also help in anticipating public health demand furthermore releasing the full highthroughput sequencing data sets rather than the consensus sequences would allow a more detailed exploration of the existing quasispecies to further improve isolate selection the authors declare no conflict of

animal models that 47 enable accurate quantifiable and reproducible measurement of covid-19 48 pulmonary disease free from observer bias we first used serial computed 49 tomography ct to demonstrate that bilateral intrabronchial instillation of sars-50 cov-2 into crab-eating macaques macaca fascicularis results in mild-to-moderate 51 lung abnormalities qualitatively characteristic of subclinical or mild-to-moderate 52 covid-19 eg ground-glass opacities with or without reticulation paving or 53 alveolar consolidation peri-bronchial thickening linear opacities at typical 54 locations

and regional lymph nodes 57 petct imaging findings appeared in all macaques as early as 2 days post-58 exposure variably progressed and subsequently resolved by 6-12 days post-59 exposure finally we applied operator-independent semi-automatic quantification 60 of the volume and radiodensity of ct abnormalities as a possible primary endpoint 61 for immediate and objective efficacy testing of

pre-exposure 166 baseline can be longitudinally measured as the percent change in the volume of lung 167 hyperdensity pclh toward standardization across lung volumes pclh can be also be 168 expressed as a percent of total lung volume pclhlv increases in pclh or pclhlv 169 were not seen in the mock-exposed macaques over the entire study figure 8a a key advantage of quantifiable ct chest imaging readout over serial euthanasia 212 studies in addition to potentially reduced experimental animal numbers is the ability not 213 only to evaluate between-group differences but also to compare severity and duration of 214 disease at higher resolution in single animals and even in isolated parenchymal areas 215 sequentially this approach can reduce the error inherent in cross-sectional sampling of 216 individual animals at single timepoints imaging does however introduce its own 217 experimental complexities and limitations as we aimed to evaluate whether pclh or 218 other ct imaging readouts presented in figure 8  could be a useful quantitative readout 219 for radiographic progression in the sars-cov-2 infected lung we chose not to include 220 irradiated inactivated sars-cov-2 in the mock inoculum to avoid antigen-induced 221 inflammation and related radiographic changes for similar reasons and to avoid 222 artificial dissemination of sars-cov-2 we specifically did not perform bronchoalveolar 223 lavage bal to obtain lung samples for downstream cellular molecular and virologic 224 analysis 45 46 and did not perform lung biopsies the frequency of anesthesia and 225 instrument availability pragmatically limit imaging to carefully chosen timepoints during 226 sars-cov-2 pulmonary abnormalities in macaques finch et al 11 a study in particular the extended time required to perform pet imaging resulted in 227 logistical limitations of the number of macaques that could be included in the study 228 finally with complete resolution of radiographic abnormalities by the end of the study 229 period we opted not to euthanize these macaques to be able to perform a re-exposure 230 study in the future thus we cannot correlate radiographic with histopathologic findings 231 future studies should extend our initial findings in several directions first 232 follow-up confirmation of these pilot results in this model of mild-moderate covid-19 233 is needed to further establish quantifiable lung ct as a reliable disease readout and to 234 forge imaging-pathologic correlates in macaques euthanized at peak radiographic 235 abnormality confirmation should enable proof-of-concept evaluation of whether a 236 candidate mcm will indeed significantly decrease peak or auc of pclh or pclhlv 237 compared to untreated infected control macaques data from additional macaques will be 238 used to confirm the sensitivity and relevance of the auc0-8 and auc0-30 for pclh or 239 pclhlv as robust measures of lung changes from ct evaluation 240 in parallel disease severity could possibly be increased in the crab-eating 241 macaque model by optimizing delivery of sars-cov-2 to the most vulnerable lung via 242 aerosol or more distal bronchoscopic delivery with the ultimate goal of using the ct-243 quantifiable volume or radiodensity readouts to model the sick hospitalized human 244 other groups are already evaluating nhps of diverse species as possible covid-245 19 models in these models serial chest ct imaging after intrabronchial instillation of 246 sars-cov-2 could be used to establish a meaningful and quantifiable covid-19-like 247 disease readout that will enable objective evaluation of medical countermeasures and also 248 a comparison of sars-cov-2-induced lung abnormalities in different nhp models the macaques were split into 2 groups of 3 animals each supplementary table 1  315 mock group m macaques received 2 ml of dmem  2 heat-inactivated fbs into each 316 bronchus by direct bilateral primary post-carinal intrabronchial

prior to administering anesthesia 321 glycopyrrolate 006 mgkg was delivered intramuscularly to reduce saliva secretions 322 next each macaque received 10 mgkg ketamine and then 35 gkg dexmedetomidine 323 intramuscularly to reverse anesthesia 015 mgkg atipamezole was administered 324 intravenously all macaques were evaluated daily for health and were periodically 325 table 4  cage-side and physical

cause of human 15 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 the virus 16 rapidly spread globally resulting in a public-health crisis including more than one million cases 17 and tens of thousands of deaths here we describe the identification and evaluation of 18 commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of sars-cov-2 in 19 infected formalin fixed paraffin embedded ffpe cell pellets we identified a suitable rabbit 20 polyclonal anti-sars-cov spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-sars-cov 21 nucleocapsid protein np antibody for cross detection of the respective sars-cov-2 proteins 22 by immunohistochemistry ihc and immunofluorescence assay ifa next we established 23 rnascope in situ hybridization ish to detect sars-cov-2 rna furthermore we established 24 a multiplex fluorescence ish mfish to detect positive-sense sars-cov-2 rna and negative-25 sense sars-cov-2 rna a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication finally we 26 developed a dual staining assay using ihc and ish to detect sars-cov-2 antigen and rna in 27 the same ffpe section these reagents and assays will accelerate covid-19

of human for s priming 7 43 bats are speculated to be the natural reservoir of sars-cov-2 because numerous other 44 betacoronaviruses are of chiropteran origin 8 9  however although the covid-19 pandemic 45 may have begun with a bat-to-human transmission event it appears that close to all human 46 infections trace back to respiratory droplets produced by infected people and fomites respiratory 47 droplet landing sites 10 11 human infections lead to various degrees of disease severity 48 ranging from asymptomatic infection or mild symptoms to fatal pneumonia older patients or 49 patients with chronic medical conditions are more vulnerable to becoming critically ill with poor 50 prognosis 12 the most common symptoms and clinical signs of covid-19 are fever cough 51 liu et al sars-cov-2 detection in ffpe specimens 4 dyspnea and myalgia with medium incubation period of 4 days 13-15 ground-glass opacity is 52 the most common radiologic finding on chest ct upon admission

55 at the time of writing there are no animal models that truly mimic the disease spectrum and 56 pathogenesis of covid-19 however small animals eg human ace2 transgenic laboratory 57 mice 19 cats 20 domestic ferrets 20 21 golden hamsters 22 and nonhuman primates 58 eg rhesus monkeys 23 24 crab-eating macaques 25 are used to study sars-cov-2 59 infection as alveolar damage interstitial inflammation and viral shedding occur in these animal 60 models to various degree it is hoped that further development of these and other animal models 61 will help overcome the current roadblock to

acids using 64 ish within infected but inactivated human or animal model tissues greatly facilitates detection 65 of viral infection and thereby pathogenesis and mcm efficacy studies these techniques become 66 paramount in particular for studies of a potential pathogen that does not cause overt or causes 67 only mild disease such as sars-cov-2 in the currently available animal models viral antigen-68 based immunostaining has been used to detect sars-cov-2 antigen in both post-mortem human 69 and animal tissues 1 16 22 25 however the antibodies used in these studies were produced 70 in-house and therefore are not commonly available identification and characterization of 71 commercially available anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies and ish assays that can be used to detect 72 sars-cov-2 in ffpe tissues are therefore critically needed 73 liu et al sars-cov-2 detection in ffpe specimens 5 here we describe the evaluation of a rabbit polyclonal anti-sars-cov s antibody and a mouse 74 monoclonal anti-sars-cov np antibody that are commercially available and in ihc and ifa 75 recognized respective sars-cov-2 proteins in ffpe specimens we also identify two 76 commercially available
