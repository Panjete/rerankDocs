congenital heart surgery programs are accustomed to the necessity of case selection and prioritization within the confines of a given programs resources whether that be for an urgent or emergent case that bumps an elective case or selecting cases based on limited bed availability while children have been relatively spared from covids clinical impact and the disease has so far had a limited effect on the course of children with congenital heart disease7 case prioritization has drastically changed for congenital heart programs during covid because of a severe restriction of resources these restrictions are due to two causes resources redirected to the care of adult patients with covid and staffing strategies to decrease exposure risk and covid spread in the setting of such limited resources proper prioritization of surgical cases is essential cardiac surgery has inherent immutable risks and substantial potential benefits the indications for surgery are symptomatic improvement and prevention of premature death by its very nature there are no truly elective cardiac surgeries while it may be suitable to delay surgery in some cases eventually these operations will become necessary and further delay could risk a patients quality of life and survivala recent article published jointly in several cardiothoracic surgery journals and promoted on the websites of the european congenital heart surgeons association echsa world society for pediatric and congenital heart surgery wspchs and congenital heart surgeons society chss identified multiple factors that must be taken into account in order to prioritize cases including 1 resource utilization such as anticipated ventilator duration icu stay blood product usage and other supplies that are or may become limited 2 clinical status of the patient and risk of delaying surgery 3 risk of exposure for the patient family and health care staff and 4 comorbidities and complexity of the procedure with implications on the usage of hospital resources 5 in teaching hospitals training may have to be curtailed and the most experienced surgeons used liberally and 6 the safety of the patients social and clinical situation if surgery is delayed a table from that publication is included here table 1 and may help guide us as we begin the recovery phase of pediatric heart surgery8

for patients who require surgery and test positive for covid and do not yet display antibodies the decision-making around timing of surgery becomes even more difficult while ideally surgery should wait until serology testing demonstrates antibodies or at least until symptoms if present resolve this is not always possible furthermore it remains unclear to what degree antibodies provide immunity each such patient must be considered individually considering the risks of waiting and the current albeit continuously changing knowledge regarding the risks of proceeding with surgery based on the covid testing results and presence of symptomsexpanding to pre-covid-19 pandemic levels of congenital heart surgery volume might logically be achieved once one or more of the following have occurred development of a vaccine effective treatment reliable rapid and widely available testing of both staff and patients and decreased infection rate in the community to a low level in the meantime mitigation efforts such as social distancing physical barrier creation frequent hand washing surface cleaning masking and preoperative patient testing will need to continue in the setting of reactivation in terms of case selection the pool of cases will expand from emergent and urgent to high-priority elective operations increasing surgical volume where social distancing is our primary mitigation strategy requires limiting person-to-person exposure and will remain a challenge in the health care environment hospitals were designed to maximize occupancy not to provide social distancing if we are to provide the same volume of service while honoring social distancing institutions may need to consider the addition of routine weekend surgery andor increasing operating room utilization such as adding evening shiftsas the pandemic evolves our work strategies will change with an aim to strike a riskbenefit balance for healthcare providers and patients short of achieving those goals that would permit a pre-covid-19 level of social interaction we will continue to require altered work schedules that will necessarily limit our ability to care for patients this will depend on even more careful individual assessment of patient risk and prioritization table 1shekerdemian ls mahmood nr wolfe kk et al characteristics and outcomes of children with coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 infection admitted to us and canadian pediatric intensive care units jama pediatr 2020stephens eh dearani ja guleserian kj et al covid-19 crisis management in congenital heart surgery world j pediatr congenit heart surg 2020 11 395-400there is no doubt that reliance on telemedicine during reactivation and even post-covid will be a more integral part of health care including the care of patients with congenital heart disease not only does it decrease exposure risk which is critical during this covid pandemic but it provides convenience to our patients and minimizes geographical limitations which will remain an important benefit post-covid in the setting of decreased resources during covid telemedicine has been an important facet of triaging surgical patients and can play an essential role in that manner moving forward challenges remain however regarding telemedicine including understanding its limitations and optimizing its role we must decipher which patients cannot be adequately assessed using telemedicine and would benefit from an in-person visit despite slightly increased risk to the patient and providers we will need to determine how telemedicine technology and providers and patients skills using telemedicine can be improved to allow effective communication and an optimized patient experience we must guard against the implementation of telemedicine reinforcing or propagating health care disparity whether that be access to resources or digital literacy payment structure and credentialing must be examined and altered to support effective telemedicine all of these challenges will be answered in time since it is clear that many aspects of telemedicine are here to stay910

heard the social distancing mandated by this pandemic however has greatly impacted and in most cases halted our normal interactions with these organizations through annual meetings and educational opportunities this has the potential to undermine our sense of community and involvement it is incumbent on our professional organizations to adapt to the rapid changes our world has experienced with increased dependence on electronic opportunities for face time with our peers in addition to the dramatic and essential increase in email and online communication the value of seeing one another and interacting via live video webinars meetings and conference calls now more than ever is pivotal in maintaining our community network undoubtedly the role of virtual meetings and optimizing their delivery will become integral to our specialty at least in the short-term and potentially play a role longer-term even as restrictions are lifted when properly orchestrated these meetings allow for even increased worldwide participation and collaboration which can only help our specialty as our organizations have quickly adapted in the ongoing development of a new normal they will need to critically evaluate how we interact with each other and our organizations going forward it is important for members to understand the constraints being faced by our organizations as with all impacted by this crisis including financial challenges major shifts in staffing models and ever-changing restrictions in the face of an uncertain future the corollary is the necessity for our organizations to be a strong presence for the membership with reassurance that despite these challenges they are working hard to continue to support their mission and membership travel restrictions will remain for an

is the significant risk of resurgence institutions must be vigilant and commit to constant surveillance for indications of covid-19 resurgence in the localregional area and within their institution the institution should make it clear to staff and the community when reopening activities that there is a possibility of resurgence that would require reinstituting restriction measures preparations for this should include strategies to fluidly progress from one stage of reopening to another and then back as need be case volume and prioritization may need to fluctuate depending on the local incidence of covid-19 resurgence models for optimizing staff in the operating room and icu may also need to change depending on local occurrence and resurgence screening protocols should evolve based on hospital protocols and government guidance the shortage of ppe experienced by many institutions during the peak of the pandemic should prompt programs to examine prior data regarding their ppe requirements and to plan sufficient inventory accordingly institutions should consider covid pathways and non-covid pathways to allow non-covid patients to receive treatment despite resurgence the new

at the time of this writing no clear guidelines on treating sars-cov-2 infections have been published and most clinicians seem to be treating them in a manner similar to that of seasonal fluthe purpose of this article is to look at the impact the sars-cov-2 infection is having on hypertensive patients considering the extremely high prevalence of hypertension in society and the fact that hypertension is among the most frequent comorbidities of patients with severe cases of sars-cov-2 infections we believe it is important to look more deeply into the relationship between the two conditionsthe role of angiotensin converting enzymethe angiotensin converting enzyme ace enzyme is an essential component of human metabolism and its dysregulation is associated with a number of different clinical conditions including hypertension many studies were done to assess the potential role of ace in ards development multiple animal models have shown a protective effect of ace ii against ards development 13-15 sars-cov-2 similarly to sars-cov uses the ace ii receptor to invade the alveolar epithelium and can be considered a potential target for future anti-covid-19 therapies 13 16 cardiovascular pathology and ace inhibitorsangiotensin receptor ar blockers lead to increased ace ii levels potentially increasing the risk of sars-cov-2 infections as pointed out by hanff et al 17 there is also some evidence that sars-cov-2 can lead to the downregulation of ace ii and toxic accumulation of angiotensin ii 17 it should also be noted that ace ii is expressed in other organs and tissues as well the fact that ace is expressed in the gut heart and kidney and that sars-cov infections can be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and the virus can often be isolated from the stool cardiac damage and aki speaks in favor of there being a strong correlation between ace expression and covid infection 18overall the exact role of ace enzyme and angiotensin in lung injury in general as well as in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 covid 19 infections is not clear if the models are true and ace ii does have a protective role against ards and ards is the feared complication of covid 19 it would be reasonable to assume ace ii would have a protective effect against covid 19 as the ace ii receptor is used by the virus to infect the alveolar epithelium it raises the issue of whether the availability of the receptor is associated with the severity of clinical findings moreover a large percentage of the population is treated with ace inhibitors and arbs whether those treatments are associated with a change in outcomes of covid 19 infections is currently debated while we recognize the difficulties of performing basic science research especially on animal models in light of the current epidemic we agree with hanff et al and would strongly encourage scientists to keep researching the possible connection between ace receptor angiotensin and ardsace inhibitorsar blockersthe ace inhibitors and ar blockers are currently among the most frequently prescribed medications in the western world they are most commonly used in patients suffering from hypertension congestive heart failure and proteinuria most commonly due to diabetes mellitus they act by reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin system ras if the ras plays a significant role in sars-cov-19 pathogenesis and ards development it would be reasonable to assume that patients treated with ace inhibitorsar blockers would be impacted the animal models suggest that the administration of ace inhibitors and ar blockers leads to an elevated number of ace ii receptors in the pulmonary circulation 19
marin reported that many patients from latin america and spain were intending to discontinue taking their ace inhibitorsar blockers due to fear of the infection 20 despite some animal models showing a potential association between ace inhibition and worsening lung injuries due to sars-cov there has been no clinical evidence to support such an association 21 the european society of cardiology recommends not discontinuing either of the drugs as the potential risks associated with uncontrolled hypertension seem to outweigh the risks of ace inhibition worsening the covid 19 infection 22 danser et al reached the same conclusion 23 french health minister claimed that the use of anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen could worsen covid 19 symptoms 24 although ace ii levels can be increased by the use of nsaids the evidence for an association with the severity of covid 19 symptoms is weak 25 fang et al do however recommend monitoring patients who are taking any of the controversial drugs and when possible choosing alternative treatments 25 despite that most health authorities including the nhs suggest using paracetamolacetaminophen instead as a precautionary measure 26the overall impact of ace inhibition on sars-cov-19 covid 19 pathogenesis is at this point of time difficult to establish the belief that an association between the two exists is mostly based on animal models while the clinical evidence for such association is lacking despite the lack of clinical evidence it appears to be the case that a number of patients plan on discontinuing their long-term therapies believing that this would decrease their risk of contracting andor dying from covid 19 the evidence for a relationship between nsaid use and more severe sars-cov-19 infections is also weak although a possible pathophysiologic link can be hypothesized in this case however many health authorities recommend against using nsaids until further evidence comes to light we believe that a lot more basic science research into the pathophysiology of both coronavirus infections and ards development in general is needed before clearer patterns emerge at this point it may be reasonable to avoid starting new patients on nsaids and ace inhibitorsarbs if it can be avoided when it comes to patients who require those treatments for other conditions discontinuation of them is unlikely to benefit patients as the evidence for exacerbations of their comorbidities is stronger than the evidence for the covid 19 disease severityhypertension and covid 19there have been news reports and expert opinions on patients with hypertension presenting with more severe cases of covid 19 moreover hypertension was among the most frequently reported comorbidities of those patients 10-12 it should be taken into account however that hypertension is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in the western world affecting millions of people fang et al point out that the association between diabetes and hypertension and covid 19 infections is likely due to their association with ace ii enzyme 25 li et al reported a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities among covid 19 patients treated in the icu compared to those who did not require icu treatment 27 they also reported that over 8 of those infected by sars-cov-2 developed cardiac injury 27 chen et al have also reported a similar association 28 the elevated troponin levels seen in icu patients also pointed towards the development of myocardial injury 28 the odds ratio of developing a severe case compared to a nonsevere case for hypertensive patients was 236 with a 95 confidence interval between 146 and 383 29 none of the studies analyzed age as a potential confounder considering that the prevalence of hypertension rises with age and older patients are in general more likely to suffer serious complications of infectious diseases that was addressed by the international society of hypertension who point out that there is no evidence that patients with hypertension are overrepresented among those with severe sars-cov-2 infections when adjusted for age 30it is difficult to assess the impact hypertension has on the outcome of patients infected by sars-cov-2 multiple studies point to a significant association between hypertension and adverse outcomes however the number of potential confounders the main of which is age is vast the previously mentioned association between antihypertensives and severe covid 19 presentations also needs to be taken into account the number of studies that have been published so far is insufficient to properly address all those questions we hope that as more case reports and review articles become available in the literature a clearer pattern will emerge the outcomes of patients with uncontrolled hypertension should be compared to those of normotensive controls of similar baseline characteristics the outcomes of hypertensive patients managed with ace inhibitorsar blockers should be compared to those of hypertensive patients managed with calcium channel antagonistscoronary artery disease congestive heart failure and covid 19besides hypertension other cardiovascular comorbidities were also frequently reported in patients with severe cases of covid 19 considering the significant associations between hypertension and cardiac disease a correlation would be expected moreover there is a significant association between heart failure and pulmonary disease particularly pulmonary hypertension the possible consequences of even mild cardiac damage would be expected to be more significant among patients with pre-existing cardiac disease as li et al reported the cardio-cerebrovascular disease was among the most prevalent comorbidities among patients with severe cases of covid 19 second only to hypertension 171 and 164 respectively 27 zhou et al reported that coronary disease was the third most prevalent comorbidity after hypertension and diabetes 31 chen et al also found that previous history of coronary disease was an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes 28 the proposed mechanism of such findings is that pericytes with high ace ii expression might be the cells targeted by sars-cov-2 32 pericyte injury could then lead to endothelial dysfunction 32 patients with pre-existing heart failure are more likely to have elevated ace ii expression due to the pathophysiology of chf which could then increase the risk of infection 32 he et al found the mortality of critically ill patients infected by sars-cov-2 who develop cardiac injury to be as high as 60 33 they also found an elevation in n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide levels usually a biomarker for congestive heart failure associated with the myocardial injury caused by covid 19considered together these studies point to an association between pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities and adverse outcomes following sars-cov-2 infections the most likely contributing factor to such finding is the observed myocardial damage in a subset of covid 19 patients which patients with pre-existing heart disease are less likely to recover from moreover the increased expression of ace ii with congestive heart failure could explain the increased susceptibility to the virus the ability to address myocardial damage in the icu may prove to be the most important prognostic factor for those patients considering the lack of currently approved treatments aimed at the virus itself it is especially important to ensure that people with such comorbidities are not exposed to it in the first place more research is needed into the exact impact of sars-cov-2 on the cardiovascular system in order to develop both protective and potentially curative strategiescovid 19 caused by sars-cov-19 has been the most talked-about disease of the first half of 2020 the elderly and those suffering from chronic conditions are most at risk for adverse outcomes hypertension was the most frequently reported comorbidity among patients with severe infections followed by diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases possibly related to their expression of ace ii facilitating viral entry into cells the relationship between ace inhibitorar blocker use and the incidence of severe covid-19 has been conflicting and at present where most authorities do not recommend discontinuing long-term ace inhibitorar blocker treatments a concern remains that some patients may be inclined to stop taking the prescribed medicines out of fear another point of contention has been the use of nsaids and a number of public health authorities have released statements claiming no evidence of such association existed nevertheless most recommended choosing alternative drugs if possible pending further investigation into nsaids finally the available evidence clearly points to a correlation between pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities and adverse outcomes with sars-cov-2 infections as severe cases are associated with myocardial damage considering the very high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases it is important to continue researching the association between these conditions and covid-19
 for the podcast associated with this article please visit httpsacademicoupcomeurheartjpagespodcastssince last november almost 55 million confirmed covid-19 infections and 350 000 deaths have been reported1 as evidence is mounting it has become clear that while covid-19 initially affects the airways and lungs the inflammatory storm occurring later during the infection also involves the cardiovascular system and leads to venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism2 heart blocks3 myocardial infarction as well as myocarditis46 and heart failure7 furthermore any cardiac condition seems to represent a major risk factor for an unfavourable outcome of the covid-19 infectionfinally and less apparent initially the lockdown in all affected countries produced extensive collateral damage as patients were afraid to visit hospitals for acute cardiac conditions and were deprived of necessary care as outpatient and elective inpatient services had been cancelled this second focus issue on covid-19 and cardiovascular disease addresses all these issues and starts with the fast track association of hypertension and antihypertensive treatment with covid-19 mortality a retrospective observational study by fei li and colleagues from china they investigated whether the treatment of hypertension especially with reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitorsas suggested initially8would influence the mortality of all patients with covid-19 infection admitted to the huo-shen-shan hospital in wuhan china9 this hospital was designed only for treating covid-19 and opened on 5 february 2020 hypertension and its treatment were stratified according to medical history or medications prior to the infection among 2877 patients 295 had a history of hypertension after adjustment for confounders patients with hypertension had a two-fold increased relative mortality risk as compared with those without hypertension patients with a history of hypertension but without antihypertensive treatment had an even higher risk of mortality compared with those with treatment with a hazard ratio of 217 a quarter of the patients were treated with at least one raas inhibitor while the rest received beta-blockers calcium antagonists or diuretics in those on raas inhibitors mortality was numerically lower but did not reach significance figure 1 thus in this largest cohort published so far on that issue hypertension appears independently associated with mortality from covid-19 furthermore these data do not support the hypothesis that raas inhibitors worsen outcomes among persons with this infection these important findings are put into context of the debate on the role of ace2 and covid-19 in a thought-provoking editorial by luis ruilope from the hospital 12 de octubre in madrid spain10troponins are known risk factors for outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes1112 heart failure13 valvular heart disease14 pulmonary embolism14 and even normal individuals as such it was important also to study this aspect in patients with covid-19 infection in their article entitled characteristics and clinical significance of myocardial injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 bo yang and colleagues from the wuhan university renmin hospital in china investigated this aspect in 671 patients with severe covid-19 infection15 of those 92 died these patients had more comorbidities and more commonly had myocardial injury ie 758 vs 99 than survivors the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i for in-hospital mortality was 092 the optimal cut-off points ie 0026 ngml and high levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i predicted in-hospital death with a hazard ratio of 456 and 125 respectively in multivariable logistic regression older age comorbidities such as hypertension coronary artery disease chronic renal failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a high level of c-reactive protein were predictors of myocardial injury thus risk of in-hospital death among patients with severe covid-19 is predictable by markers of myocardial injury which were associated with an inflammatory response and cardiovascular comorbidities these clinically important findings are accompanied by an editorial by hugo katus from the university hospital heidelberg in germany and colleagues16additionally the covid-19 pandemic affected not only those with the infection but also cardiac patients at large it appears that the recommendations of governmental agencies to stay at home most probably deterred cardiac patients from visiting a hospital when acute symptoms occurred as outlined in the article reduction of hospitalizations for myocardial infarction in italy in the covid-19 era authored by ciro indolfi from the division of cardiology magna graecia university in catanzaro italy and colleagues of the societ italiana di cardiologia and the ccu academy investigators group17 they conducted a multicentre observational nationwide survey on admissions for acute myocardial infarction at italian intensive cardiac care units over a 1-week period during the covid-19 outbreak compared with the equivalent week in 2019 they observed a 485 reduction in admissions compared with the equivalent week in 2019 the reduction was significant for both st-segment elevation myocardial infarction stemi admission with a 265 reduction and non-stemi nstemi with a 654 reduction among stemis the reduction was greater for women with 412 than for men with 178 a similar reduction in acute myocardial infarction admissions was registered in north italy 521 central italy 593 and surprisingly also in southern italy 521 where fewer covid-19 cases were observed thus the covid-19 pandemic has led to a significant collateral damage even in non-covid-19 patients with cardiac disease as outlined in an insightful editorial by m chadi alraies from wayne state university in washington dc usa18 the causes may be multifactorial and may be related to the fact that patients may have been afraid to visit hospital during the pandemic or that fewer plaque ruptures occurred due to the standstill of life during the lockdownfinally a comprehensive review entitled covid-19 from epidemiology to treatment by jose miro and colleagues from the hospital clinicidibaps in barcelona spain reminds us that cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons must be aware now of virus infections in their patients and on their impact in general19 healthcare workers should be educated and trained to tackle the enormous challenge posed by sars-cov-2 and other viruses in wards operating theatres icus and cardiac catheterization laboratories this review provides the necessary knowledge about covid-19 and focuses on relevant aspects on prevention and management for specialists within the cardiovascular fieldas much as patients and the clinical service suffered from the covid-19 pandemic so did research and running clinical trials in particular indeed in most countries any running protocols were stopped which impacted on the recruitment follow-up and eventually the integrity safety and results of such trials this issue is discussed in the current opinion article conducting clinical trials in heart failure during and after the covid-19 pandemic an expert consensus position paper from the heart failure association hfa of the european society of cardiology esc by stefan anker from the charit in berlin germany and colleagues figure 220 for heart failure trials covid-19 may be particularly impactful as patients with heart failure are likely to be at greater risk of infection with covid-19 and the consequences might also be more serious furthermore they are also at risk of adverse outcomes if their clinical care is compromised the authors note that as physicians and clinical trialists it is our moral and ethical duty to ensure safe and effective care is delivered to trial participants without affecting the integrity of the trial many regulatory authorities from different world regions have issued guidance statements regarding the conduct of clinical trials during this covid-19 crisis however international trials may benefit from expert guidance from a global panel of experts to supplement local advice and regulations thereby enhancing the safety of participants and the integrity of the trial accordingly the heart failure association of the european society of cardiology conducted web-based meetings with clinical trialists in europe north america south america australia and asia in this article the authors highlight the challenges this pandemic poses for the conduct of clinical trials in heart failure and offers advice on how they might be overcome with some practical examples while this panel of experts are focused on heart failure clinical trials these discussions and recommendations may apply to clinical trials in other therapeutic

gabriela kuster fro the university hospital basel in switzerland828 kuster et al respond to this comment in a separate manuscript29the editors hope that readers of this issue of the european heart journal will find it of interestwhile the first case of sars-cov-2 causing covid co stands for corona vi for virus and d for disease- initially called 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov may have occurred as early as november of 2019 the earliest reported symptoms have been traced to december 1 2019 1 on december 31 2019 the world health organization who china country office was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in wuhan city hubei province of china an initial evaluation of these cases was undertaken four lower respiratory tract samples including broncho-alveolarlavage bal fluid were collected from patients in wuhan and compared with seven samples collected from patients in beijing who had pneumonias of known cause 2 more than 20000 viral reads from individual specimens were obtained and most matched the genome from lineage b of the genus beta-coronavirus showing greater than 85 identity with a bat sars-like covbetween december 31 2019 and january 3 2020 44 cases of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were reported to the who by national authorities in china on january 11th and 12th of 2020 the chinese national health commission identified the source of exposures at a seafood market in wuhan city huanan seafood wholesale market fig 1 a cohort of forty-one cases caused by sars-cov-2 was reported by huang et al 1 a majority 3073 were men with a median age of 490 years iqr 410580 common initial symptoms included fever 4098 cough 3176 and myalgias or fatigue 1844 all 41 patients had bilateral multi-lobar pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computed tomography ct scans most patients were both leukopenic low white blood cell count and lymphopenic  10  109l on hospital admission d-dimer levels were elevated particularly among patients that required intensive care unit icu-level care median d-dimer level 24 mgl vs 05 mgl a majority of patients had normal procalcitonin levels  01 ngmlthe first confirmed case of covid-19 in the united states was a 35-year-old man in snohomish county washington who presented to an urgent care center after 4-days of cough and subjective fever 3 he had recently returned to washington state after visiting family in wuhan china viral panels for routine respiratory pathogens were negative nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were sent to the center for disease control and prevention cdc following notification of the washington state department of health both swabs were positive for sars-cov-2 progressive bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray a new requirement for supplemental oxygen and persistent fevers on day 6 prompted initiation of treatment with remdesivir see subsequent section on potential treatments under study serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative cultures for bacterial pathogens prompted discontinuation of vancomycin and cefepime rapid clinical improvement was observed over the next 2448 hcoronaviruses belong to the subfamily coronavirineae in the family of coronavitidae of the order nidovirales the subfamily includes alpha coronavirus beta coronavirus gamma coronavirus and delta coronavirus 4 5 the genome is a single-stranded positive-sense rna 30 kb with a 5 cap structure and a 3-poly-a tail the sars-cov-2 virus belongs to the cluster of beta coronaviruses originating most likely from horseshoe bats homotrimers of s proteins make up the spikes on the virus surface and enable binding to host receptors in the case of covid-19 oral-pharyngeal cell angiotensin converting-enzyme ace-2 is the primary receptor of the 20 other known pathogenic coronaviruses 6 of which can infect humans an overwhelming majority are associated with respiratory infections and syndromes of varying severity-the most pathogenic coronaviruses that can cause fatal pulmonary infections and multi-organ system failure are sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 68coronaviruses contain at least 6 open-read frames orfs orfs near the 3 terminal of the genome encode primary structural proteins spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n as mentioned previously s proteins are responsible for attachment to host receptors m proteins contain transmembrane domains that contribute to virus shape curvature and binding to the nucleocapsid the e protein is involved with virus assembly and pathogenesis n proteins package and encapsulate the genomes into virions and antagonize innate proteins and silencing rna 912the trimeric sars-cov-2 surface s protein consists of three s1s2 heterodimers that bind the cellular receptor ace2 and mediate fusion at the viral and cellular membranes through a pre-to-post fusion conformational change the available information obtained by cryo-electron microscopy shows that only one receptor-binding domain binds ace2 and adopts an upward conformation 13 fig 2 moreover binding to the receptor opens up the receptor binding domain of s1 and promotes the release of the s1-ace2 complex and s1 monomers soluble complexes can bind to host cell unoccupied ace2 receptors the available data suggest that the combinant receptor binding domain rbd portion of the sars-cov-2 s protein has evolved to effectively target ace2 the sars-cov-2 s protein is so effective at binding human cells that the scientific community has concluded it is the result of natural selection 1416 the same is true of its backbone and overall molecular structure 17population genetic analyses of 103 sars-cov-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types designated l and s that are well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms snps further the analyses showed near complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date although the l type  70 is more prevalent than the s type  30 the s type is believed to be the ancestral version whereas the l type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan china the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the l type which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly 16 18the unique characteristics of sars-cov-19 as initially determined in december 2019 suggested strongly that humans would not possess herd immunity ie an absence of prior exposure made existing antibodies to sars-cov-19 unlikely this in turn should have signaled alarms about potential infectivity and robust immune and resulting inflammatory responses to infection the burst of inflammatory cells and proteins often referred to as cytokine storm is believed to have been responsible for many deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic h5n1 bird flu outbreaks and the 2003 sars outbreak 19 20 the unique characteristics of the virus to include its stability and large scale of infected people also suggest strongly that there will be second or multiple waves of sars-cov-2 in the coming yearsangiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 is the receptor to which sars-cov-2 binds and invades human cells 21 zou et al constructed a risk map of human organs utilizing single-cell rna sequencing data sets derived from major human physiological systems analysis of the available data identified the organs at risk for sars-cov-2 infection and specific cell types with ace2 expression the most vulnerable organs and cell types are as follows lung type ii alveolar cells heart myocardial cells kidney proximal tubule cells ileum and esophagus epithelial cells and bladder urothelial cells fig 3ace2 receptors are also found in both venous and arterial endothelial cells and in arterial smooth muscle cells 22 the expression of ace2 receptors increases with age but varies little by either sex or race under normal circumstances 23 24the binding of srs-cov-2 to ace2 is a necessary step for virus entry followed by multiplication spread and ultimately the phonotypic expression of disease rna sequencing data from human hearts show that nearly 80 of myocardial cells have positive ace2 expression this finding is of particular relevance in patients with sars-cov-2 viremia 8 and may hold the key to a better understanding of cardiac injury heart failure arrhythmias and circulatory shock in covid-19at the time of this writing there were 972203 confirmed cases of covid-19 50321 deaths and 185 countries or territories with reported cases world health organization situation report  74 april 3 2020 wwwwhoint wwwcdcgov the overall case fatality rate of covid-19 based on published reports is  2040 however the statistics are changing hour-by-hour and day-by-day what is clear and consistent is that morbidity and mortality increase significantly with age rising to  80 for patients between the ages of 7079 and  148 in patients greater than 80 in addition to a recognized impairment in immune response that increases with age comorbid illnesses including heart metabolic and lung disease are also more likely among older persons access to health care may also be impacted by age to varying degrees around the worldthe initial cohort of hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed sars-cov-2 infections included mostly men 30 of 41 73 and approximately one-third had underlying diseases that such as diabetes mellitus 20 hypertension 15 and cardiovascular disease 15 a similar profile of predisposition was reported for mers middle-east respiratory syndrome 25 26li et al performed a meta-analysis of studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic disease among

cox regression analysis cardiac injury was associated with a threefourfold higher risk of death hr 341 95 ci 162716myocarditis is known to occur in a wide range of acute viral infections including adenovirus human immunodeficiency virus hiv epsteinbarr virus and influenza virus to name a few observational data coupled with virologic and molecular diagnostic techniques suggest that enteroviruses including coxsackieviruses parvoviruses and adenoviruses are among the most common causes of myocarditis given the duration of viral shedding in sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 as well as the relatively high density of ace2 receptors expressed in cardiomyocytes one would expect to see cases of myocarditis and myopericarditis chen et al 33 highlighted the potential for sars-cov-2 to be a cause of fulminant myocarditis citing the frequency of cardiac injury and robust inflammatory response cytokine storm as a core pathophysiological mechanism of fulminant myocarditis as with other viral causes of myocarditis the presenting signs symptoms and diagnostic features will vary from chest discomfort and shortness of breath with electrocardiographic st-t wave abnormalities elevated ctni and nt-pro-bnp levels to heart failure and cardiogenic shock an appropriate clinical index of suspicion will be required in addition patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and either ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathies will be the most vulnerable to progressive or precipitous change in ventricular performance and clinical decompensationthe pivotal questions that the medical and scientific communities must answer are why do elevated cardiac biomarkers portend a worse prognosis among patients with covid-19 are they an epiphenomenon of infection severity do they reflect vital organ viral load viremia andor direct myocardial or microvessel invasion of sars-cov-2 might they be a marker of a systemic inflammatory response and a red flag for impending cytokine stormwhile adults have been the most severely affected by covid-19 emerging data show that infants children and adolescents have contracted sars-cov-2 as well 36 in a nation-wide case series of 2143 pediatric patients reported to the chinese center for disease control and prevention there were 731 laboratory-confirmed and 1412 suspected cases the median age was 7 years interquartile range 213 while 90 of cases were considered mild in severity there were severe and critically ill patients as well the proportion of severe and critical cases was greatest for the age group  1 year 106 and 1-5 years of age 73 with critical illness features including ards encephalopathy myocardial injury heart failure and circulatory shock case series from other centers and from other countries have underscored the potential impact of covid-19 on neonates infants children and adolescents 3740 there is also an impact on neonates born to mothers who are infected at the time of delivery 41in addition to early diagnosis and supportive care the american college of cardiology has emphasized the importance of cardiac complications in patients with covid-19 and their optimal management to include assisting other clinical specialties being prepared to treat critically ill patients with advanced medical and mechanical therapies such as ecmo veno-venous and veno-arterial and recommending diagnostic testing such as echocardiography in patients with heart failure arrhythmias electrocardiographic ecg abnormalities or cardiomegaly on chest x-ray acc clinical bulletincovid-19 clinical guidance for the cv care team march 2020 table 1 the expression of ace2 is increased among patients with diabetes mellitus and in patients treated with either ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers 42 while one could postulate that treatment with either an ace-i or arb predisposes patients to sars-cov-2 infection there are insufficient data to make a recommendation to clinicians or patients to either avoid or transition to alternative treatments this position was emphasized recently in a joint statement from the american heart association american college of cardiology and the heart failure society of

remdesivir in adults hospitalized with covid-19 the trial is being conducted at the university of nebraska medical center all potential subjects undergo a baseline physical examination before receiving treatment with either the investigational treatment or placebo in addition to standards of care participants in the investigational treatment group will receive 200 mg of remdesivir intravenously on the first day of enrollment to the study they will receive another 100 mg each day for the duration of hospitalization for up to 10 days clinicians will regularly monitor participants and will assign them daily scores based on a predefined scale of clinical outcomes that consider factors including body temperature blood pressure and use of supplemental oxygen participants also will be asked to provide blood samples and nose and throat swabs approximately every two days that will be analyzed for sars-cov-2 the niaid will expand the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial actt to as many as 75 sites globally and include 440 subjectsconvalescent plasma derived from patients with laboratory confirmed sars-cov2 infection and absent viral shedding could be considered for passive

clinical trials of bacillus-calmette-guerin bcg vaccine have recently been initiated around the world the scientific premise for study is based on prior observations that vaccinated individuals are not only protected from tuberculosis but viral and parasitic infections as wellthe emergence of a new strain of coronavirus sars-cov-2 as a cause of covid-19 represents an unprecedented period in history for the lay medical and scientific communities while each is working closely together and learning from one-another additional efforts are needed the available information derived from case studies show that covid-19 has both direct and indirect cardiovascular effects ranging from cardiac injury to myocarditis arrhythmias respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and veno-venous ecmo and circulatory failure requiring inotropes vasopressors and veno-arterial ecmo clinicians must also be aware that covid-19 can over-shadow acute cardiac events including st segment elevation myocardial infarction 51 or delay treatment given current strains on emergency rooms and emergency medical services they must maintain an appropriate level of balanced full-field vision in the midst of a global event with a dominating presence in everyones mind last at the time of this writing there were 1528 references on the topic of sars-cov-2 and covid-19 cited in pubmed this represents a 1000  publication increase in the past 5 days while the wealth of information no doubt reflects an extraordinary level of interest and commitment to a world-wide health threat we must all be vigilant in our interpretation of the published literature its source level of scientific rigor and potential translation to scientific and clinical advancesthe novel coronavirus disease covid-19 emerged in december 2019 and in less than 3 months evolved to a worldwide pandemic13 this virus has spread rapidly leading to an unprecedented global crisis that shows no signs of abating in the near future as of wednesday april 1 2020 there were more than 911 308 cases and more than 45 000 deaths reported globally4 confirmed cases in the united states were at 206 207 with more than 4542 deaths4 statistical models predict that more than 260 000 hospital beds will be used in the united states by the end of april 20205 the impact of covid-19 on our daily lives work families and overall operations is unprecedented in modern times and the situation continues to change on a day-to-day basis in addition to constantly evolving information there are misconceptions among the public about the pathology etiology transmission treatment and risks associated with covid-19covid-19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the newly discovered pathogen sars-cov-2 a novel rna-dependent rna polymerase betacoronavirus that is thought to derive from bats6 the incubation period for covid-19 is thought to be within 14 days of exposure and transmission occurs from human-to-human contact6 the covid-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes1our understanding of the pathobiology and clinical presentation of the virus and risk factors for morbidity and mortality seen with covid-19 although limited is rapidly increasing see table 1 up to 25 of those infected are asymptomatic this creates challenges to prevention efforts because these asymptomatic carriers are often unaware of their covid-19 status most people infected with the covid-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment older people and those with underlying medical problems such as cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness37 clinical presentation of severe cases of covid-19 is characterized by hypoxia dyspnea and greater than 50 of lung involvement on imaging in critical cases people infected with covid-19 will experience acute respiratory distress syndrome multiple-organ failure shock and death8 at this time there are no specific vaccines or treatments for covid-199 the best way to prevent and slow transmission is to be well informed about the covid-19 virus the disease it causes and how it spreads the world health organization and centers for disease control and prevention cdc are reliable public information sources10early data suggest that those with covid-19 and hypertension or cardiovascular disease have a mortality rate of 2 to 3 times higher than the general covid-19 population suggesting that they are highly susceptible to more severe effects of the disease11 more than 40 of patients hospitalized with covid-19 in china had an underlying cardiovascular disease12 furthermore early reports of profound myocarditis and fatal dysrhythmias suggest a deleterious impact of covid-19 on the cardiovascular systems1214 acute and chronic cardiovascular complications of pneumonia which is common with covid-19 result from various mechanisms including ischemia systemic inflammation and pathogen-mediated damage715 chronic cardiovascular conditions may become exacerbated in the setting of viral infection as a consequence of imbalance between an infection-induced increase in metabolic demand and reduced cardiac reserve15 patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure may be at a particular risk as a result of coronary plaque rupture secondary to virally induced systemic inflammation and rigorous use of plaque stabilizing agents aspirin statins -blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors has been suggested as a possible therapeutic strategy15 procoagulant effects of systemic inflammation may increase the likelihood of stent thrombosis and assessment of platelet function and intensified antiplatelet therapy should be considered in those with a history of previous coronary intervention15 it is not clear yet whether heightened systemic inflammatory and procoagulant activity persist after resolution of the covid-19 infection in addition there has been conjecture that ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ubiquitously used in cardiovascular patients may increase a patients susceptibility to the virus16 however currently the american college of cardiology and american heart association have recommended against preemptively stopping or starting an ace inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in the setting of covid-1931017 with more than 100 million americans having some form of cardiovascular disease there is an urgency to increase awareness among healthcare providers of the potential impact of covid-19 in this high-risk populationthe cdc released general preventive measures for covid-19 infection however socially at-risk persons and those with underlying cardiovascular and chronic conditions bear the burden of an elevated risk for developing severe complications and death918 by april 1 2020 general preventive measures including recommendations for frequent handwashing social distancing and curfews or stay-at-home orders have been sanctioned hospitals and healthcare systems across the united states have suspended elective surgeries procedures and inpatient visits changing the way people seek and receive healthcare facilitated by new legislation many healthcare providers now offer telemedicine and use mobile health technologies in efforts to limit exposure to both patients and healthcare providers19 these options provide protection and ongoing care for many high-risk individuals but are not feasible for allthe american heart association is advising intensified caution to those with underlying heart conditions including persons with diabetes and those with cardiovascular chronic lung and kidney conditions9 additional recommendations from the heart failure society of america and american college of cardiology are noted see table 291017 evidence to guide clinical decision making is being generated at an extraordinary pace hypervigilance and close attention to guidelines are needed during this critical timethere is substantial concern that socially at-risk persons and those with cardiovascular conditions could experience delays in seeking healthcare as a result of self-isolation low health and digital literacy or lack of a primary care medical home19 furthermore persons who already have limited access to healthcare could be further compromised specifically those who are ethnic minorities have a low income and experience food insecurity and housing instability with lack of social support and transportation the increase in self-isolation due to covid-19 particularly among older persons may also accelerate risks for cardiovascular neurocognitive and mental health problems1820 in addition there are concerns that this public health crisis may exacerbate discrimination racism and stigma because of widespread disinformation across social media and other outlets7 assessment of health disparities after covid-19 is warranted to fully understand the burden this pandemic has on at-risk populations including children who have been removed from the school environment as a preventive measureall aspects of healthcare delivery are affected by this pandemic18 the sudden and rapid advancement of covid-19 has created an unanticipated risk to healthcare providers beyond transmission and contraction of the disease frontline healthcare providers are at a higher risk for experiencing anxiety depression and insomnia due to burnout and compassion fatigue8 the accelerating demands for hospital beds personal protective equipment and lifesaving apparatus such as ventilators and continuous renal replacement machines have introduced new financial burdens for otherwise high-resource health systems in the united states although there is close daily monitoring of the ongoing global battle against covid-19 examination of this pandemics impact on healthcare workers and healthcare delivery systems is warranted18 because of many states enforcing stay-at-home orders healthcare providers are challenged with changing modes of practice for uncertain lengths of time healthcare settings across the nation are expeditiously transitioning from in-person to telehealth visits to retain access to healthcare for those with chronic conditions moreover telehealth visits can be used to reduce visits to the emergency departments for non-urgent matters a timely intervention to preserve emergency services for those with severe symptoms if there is a silver lining it may be the acceleration of the adoption of and expanded reimbursement for telehealth broadening the reach and increasing the efficiency of chronic disease care21 efforts to sustain these care improvements will be critical after the rapid spread phase of the pandemicthe covid-19 pandemic is expected to persist for months we must become familiar with reliable sources of information such as the world health organization and cdc9 the multitude of ongoing studies and clinical experience with individuals with covid-19 will provide us with much needed data to illuminate our understanding of the virus its impact and the potential effect of individual risk factors and medications it is unclear at this time how the covid-19 will further impact the physical or mental health of individuals after recovery or overall health disparities among socially at-risk populations as information about covid-19 is rapidly evolving it is imperative that healthcare providers reinforce the general prevention guidelines in addition to recommendations for persons with cardiovascular disease by the american heart association heart failure society of america and american college of cardiology9the novel coronavirus cov that emerged in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 and known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 sars-cov-2 rapidly spread throughout all chinese provinces and subsequently propagated across the globe with more than 700000 cases and  30000 deaths in 202 countries httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports the world health organization who has therefore declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as global pandemic on march 12 2020 europe is now the worlds covid-19 epicenter with italy being the country with the highest number of reported cases and deaths as of march 29 the italian institute of health iss reported 89967 cases and 9200 deaths in italy httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirus which overtook china as the country with most coronavirus-related casualties the pandemic is now propagating across usa where over 100000 cases and 2000 deaths were reported as of march 29 2020 currently sars-cov-2 presents an estimated r0 ranging between 2 and 3 which means that any infected individual may transmit the disease to other 23 people in a susceptible population madjid et al 2020 such as older adults dadamo et al 2020 and those suffering from multiple comorbiditiessars-cov-2 an enveloped positive-strand rna virus that belongs to the -coronavirus -cov family presents  80 nucleotide identity with the sars-like covzxc21 identified in bats and with human sars-cov while nucleotide identity with mers-cov is reduced to  50 chan et al 2020 wan et al 2020 lu et al 2020 sars-cov-2 mainly targets the respiratory tract of mammals including humans thereby inducing a wide spectrum of clinical features ranging from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to interstitial pneumonia or upon progressive alveolar damage severe acute respiratory failure which may require advanced respiratory support and intensive care of two or more organ systems in fact covid-19 may progress towards adult respiratory distress syndrome ards andor multiple organ acute failure eg kidney liver and heart and even death huang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b wu et al 2020a wang et al 2020d although covid-19 is a respiratory disease one third of patients with more severe covid-19 had conjunctivitis wu et al 2020b and some patients showed gastrointestinal symptoms nausea vomiting or diarrhea jin et al 2020 interestingly epithelial cells of several body compartments including oral xu et al 2020a and nasal mucosa hamming et al 2004 respiratory tree and alveoli hamming et al 2004 intestinal mucosa hamming et al 2004 as well as human aqueous humor holappa et al 2015 show high levels of a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is the functional receptor for sars-cov2 lan et al 2020 ace2 is also expressed in coronary and intrarenal endothelial cells and in renal tubular epithelial cells donoghue et al 2000 since ace2 catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin ii a vasoconstrictor into angiotensin 17 ang 17 a vasodilator its extra-respiratory localization has supported hypotheses on the relationship of sars-cov-2 infection with the cardiovascular cv system indeed adult patients affected by cvds arterial hypertension diabetes andor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd show worse clinical outcome following contraction of the viral illness with fatality rate attaining 105 the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team and novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 in patients with covid-19 pneumonia who developed ards acute cardiac injury shock and arrhythmia represent the most common life-threatening complications along with acute kidney injury chen et al 2020b huang et al 2020 wang et al 2020ait has long been known that acute respiratory infections including flu and pneumonias may trigger severe cv disease cvd events and vice versa madjid et al 2020 although experimental evidence on this topic is still at its infancy we will hypothesize and discuss more suggestive cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby sars-cov-2 may lead to detrimental consequences to the cv system we will focus on aging cytokine storm nlrp3inflammasome hypoxemia and air pollution which is an emerging cv risk factor associated with rapid urbanization and globalization we will finally discuss the impact of clinically available cv drugs on the clinical course of covid-19 patients understanding the role played by sars-cov2 on the cv system is indeed mandatory to get further insights into covid-19 pathogenesis and to design a therapeutic strategy of cardio-protection for frail patients zheng et al 2020first reports describing the clinical features of patients affected by covid-19 hinted at a relationship between sars-cov-2-mediated infection and the cv system mainly due to the high inflammatory burden affecting myocardium and vessels table 1 zheng et al 2020 madjid et al 2020 although it is a suggestive causal relationship more translational research should be carefully performed in order to avoid confounding factors and hasty conclusions in order to support it we will mention the clinical evidences as they emergedto best of our knowledge the prevalence and risk of death of severe covid-19 is higher in elderly patients with chronic comorbidities such as arterial hypertension type 2 diabetes cardiac and cerebrovascular disorders and copd wang et al 2020b of note diagnosis of major cardiac complications ie acute myocardial injury and lethal arrhythmias recently emerged from analysis of initial representative populations of covid-19 patients the first report analyzed a cohort of 41 patients median age  49 years 73 men the majority of whom n  27 66 were exposed to huanan seafood and live-animal market huang et al 2020 the original epicenter of covid-19 outbreak underlying comorbidities were reported in 32 of the patients including diabetes n  8 20 cvd n  6 15 and hypertension n  6 15 huang et al 2020 moreover increased blood levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i ctni were reported in 5 patients 12 huang et al 2020 this initial finding cautiously suggests the onset of acute cardiac ischemic injury in covid-19 patients yet measurements of ctni levels should be always associated to electrocardiogram ecg or imaging findings of myocardial ischemia giannitsis and katus 2013 to make a diagnosis intriguingly rising levels of ctni are also independent predictors of mortality in critically ill patients hospitalized with severe pneumonia without evidence of acute coronary syndrome lee et al 2015 in this regard we cannot exclude the onset of transient myopericarditis mimicking acute myocardial infarction in severe covid-19 patients due to cytokine storm inciardi et al 2020 as previously observed in severe ards patients to et al 2010 in fact an increased serum level of pro-inflammatory cytokines for instance interleukin-1 il-1 interferon  ifn and mcp1 was reported in both icu-patients and non-icu patients this observation is consistent with the development of a cytokine storm syndrome as previously reported in sars sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infections de wit et al 2016a second report analyzed a cohort of 99 patients median age  555 67 men the half of which n  49 49 was also exposed to huanan seafood market chen et al lancet 2020b a large percentage of these subjects n  40 40 each suffered of cvd and cerebrovascular disorders which represent the most common chronic comorbidities in this cohort chen et al 2020b cardiac injury was diagnosed by measuring changes in myocardial zymogram which evaluates the activity of metalloproteinases myocardial zymogram results however are at risk of being over-interpreted since the assay is a timp tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases free environment lindsey 2018 since it is not considered a gold standard assay to diagnose acute cardiac injury in hospital setting other established cardiac specific biomarkers should be tested in fact the authors have also reported high circulating levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in 13 13 and 75 76 patients respectively chen et al 2020b which are biomarkers generally used to perform early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction yet since these enzymes are also present in other tissues than the myocardium their diagnostic specificity is limited and their diagnostic sensitivity also suffers from the presence of a sizeable baseline enzyme concentration in the circulation without any cardiac pathology bodor 2016 false-positive results indeed may occur in renal failure muscle fatigue vitamin d deficiency pneumonia asthma malignancies pulmonary embolism hypoxia and smokers in particular 2 of the dead patients presented a long history of tobacco smoke exposure chen et al 2020b which enhances the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular disease as wella third report analyzed a cohort of 138 patients median age  56 543 men with hypertension n  43 312 cvd n  20 145 diabetes n  14 101 and cancer n  10 72 as more common coexisting underlying comorbidities wang et al 2020a while a small fraction of subjects n  7 51 was suffering from cerebrovascular disease wang et al 2020a of note the admission rate to icu n  36 261 was remarkably increased among patients of the same age displaying hypertension n  21 583 cvd n  9 25 and cerebrovascular disease n  6 167 as underlying comorbidities wang et al 2020a finally arrhythmias n  23 167 and acute cardiac injury n  10 72 defined as increased blood levels of hypersensitive ctni were the most common complications arising in icu patients affected by ards n  27 196 and acute kidney injury n  5 36 wang et al 2020aa fourth single-center study analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of 140 hospitalized covid-19 patients median age  57 507 men none of whom was exposed to huanan market ninety patients 643 suffered from at least 1 underlying comorbidity the most common being hypertension n  42 30 followed by diabetes n  17 121 of note a lower fraction of severe covid-19 patients suffered from preexisting arrhythmia n  5 36 and coronary heart disease n  7 5 zhang et al 2020finally a single-center large study conducted on 1099 patients affected by covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 chinese provinces median age  47 581 men confirmed that 237 subjects had pre-existing comorbidities guan et al 2020 such as hypertension n  165 15 diabetes n  81 74 coronary heart disease n  27 25 and cerebrovascular disease n  15 14 guan et al 2020 in this study acute cardiac injury was defined by the increase in circulating levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in 137 and 410 of the patients respectively guan et al 2020 no additional features of acute myocardial infarction were consideredamong different clinical reports a retrospective multicenter cohort study including 191 adult covid-19 patients median age  56 62 men confirmed preexisting comorbidities in almost half of the individuals n  91 48 such as hypertension n  58 30 diabetes n  36 19 and coronary heart disease n  15 8 zhou et al 2020a likewise non-survivors displayed a higher rate of comorbidities as compared to survivors including hypertension 48 vs 23 diabetes 31 vs 14 and coronary heart disease 24 vs 1 zhou et al 2020a in addition to sepsis n  112 59 respiratory failure n  103 54 ards n  59 31 and acute kidney injury n  28 15 the most common secondary outcomes in this cohort of patients were the onset of acute heart failure n  44 23 and acute cardiac injury n  33 17 zhou et al 2020a of note non-survivors presented higher rates of acute heart failure 52 vs 12 and acute cardiac injury 59 vs 1 as compared to survivors moreover laboratory findings showed high levels of nonspecific biomarkers as lactate dehydrogenase creatine kinase and hypersensitive ctni which has an amino acid sequence similar to skeletal troponin c xu et al 2013 and pro-inflammatory biomarkers eg interleukin-6 il-6 and serum ferritin zhou et al 2020a again since measurement of circulating biomarkers is not enough to diagnose acute cardiac injury caused by sars-cov2 with certainty further clinical investigations based on multimodal approach should be encouraged similarly a retrospective multicenter study conducted on a smaller cohort n  150 of covid-19 patients confirmed that risk of death was greater in the presence of cvd of note isolated myocardial injury resulted to be one of the main causes of death in some patients 7 in the presence of high levels of il-6 and c-reactive proteinthe relationship between sars-cov-2 infection and cvd has been further corroborated by a recent descriptive analysis of all the 44672 covid-19 cases diagnosed in china as of february 11 2020 the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team and novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 this study confirmed that a fraction of patients was affected by cvd 142 including arterial hypertension 128 although retrospective studies cannot be helpful to made a causal association it further confirmed that the mortality rate was increased by cvd  105 diabetes  73 chronic respiratory disease  63 and arterial hypertension  6 the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team and novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team 2020 madjid et al 2020do these cvds really make a difference in the worse prognosis of covid-19 patients although italy is the european country with the highest percentage of the population aged 80 or over and with the mortality rate due to covid-19 among the highest in the world madjid et al 2020 it is still unknown whether greater vulnerability to illness depends on higher percentage of older patients meanwhile the iss recently listed the most common comorbidities observed in deceased patients in italy as of march 26 2020 table 2 only 16 of screened patients had no comorbidities while majority of patients presented one 235 two 266 three or more 486 comorbidities finally we can assume that clinical outcome of covid-19 has progressively worsened in most italian elderly patients due to the combined impact of multiple comorbidities and frailtysince cardiometabolic disease is most common in people over 50 and risk of developing it increases as people get older it is conceivable that underlying cv and metabolic comorbidities ie hypertension ischemic heart disease atrial fibrillation stroke and diabetes contribute to unfavorable prognosis in older covid-19 patients in addition 101 patients died because of acute myocardial injury httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirussars-cov-2-decessi-italiathese first independent analyses suggest that besides arising more frequently in individuals suffering from underlying cv comorbidities sars-cov-2 may cause severe myocardial injury even in the absence of ards or multiple organ dysfunctions often leading to death besides local ischemia fatal myocardial damage in covid-19 patients may be due to acute myocarditis unresponsive to conventional therapy recently the autopsy of a male covid-19 patient revealed myocardial infiltration by interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cells xu et al 2020b evidence for severe myocarditis associated to low cardiac output syndrome was even observed in some covid-19 patients in both italy inciardi et al 2020 and china hu et al 2020 these findings are consistent with the reported upregulation of il-6 in the serum of covid-19 patients as chronic il-6 production during viral infection has long been known to boost myocarditis fontes et al 2015 however further investigation about underlying mechanisms is requiredalthough well-known epidemic viruses ie sars-cov mers-cov and flu viruses influenza a or b virus may lead to arrhythmia myocardial infarction and acute heart failure through aberrant systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines we cannot exclude that other factors activated by sars-cov2 exacerbate the cardiac injury characterizing covid-19 herein we will analyze the potential role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 pathway nlrp3inflammasome hypoxemia aging and air pollutionras activity is known to be elevated in lung tissues in fact the endothelium of the pulmonary vessels is an important site of ace and is therefore one of the main sources of systemic ang ii ace2 is also strongly expressed in the lung and upper airway pulmonary ace2 may play a role in regulating the balance of circulating levels of ang iiang 17 of note ang ii contributes to pulmonary vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia an important pathophysiological mechanism useful to prevent shunt in patients with lung injury or pneumonia however the local increase in ang ii levels increases vascular permeability thus promoting the onset of pulmonary edema in ards ras appears crucial in maintaining oxygenation lionetti et al 2005 ace2 knockout mice showed more severe symptoms than wild-type mice kiely et al 1997 imai et al 2005 while overexpression appears protective a correlation between an ace polymorphism and ards severity has been described in humans matsuda et al 2012 in acute lung injury ace ang ii and the at1 receptor function as factors that promote lung injury oudit et al 2009 despite having normal lung structure and function ace2 knockout mice show a very serious pathology in case of ardsacute lung damage compared to wild-type mice since ace2 plays an important anti-inflammatory role ace2 knockout mice are characterized by increased vascular permeability pulmonary edema and neutrophil accumulation in some recent studies ace2 protects against pulmonary vasoconstriction chronic pulmonary lesions and fibrosis moreover ace2 inhibits neutrophil infiltration and lung inflammation by limiting il-17 signaling and by reducing the activity of the stat3 pathway in response to bacterial infection in rats sodhi et al 2019 therefore ace2 has been proposed as a new therapeutic target for acute lung injury chronic lung disease and bacterial pneumonia as well indeed the efficacy of recombinant soluble human ace2 protein on acute respiratory failure is currently being studied in humans in a phase ii clinical trial kuba et al 2013 in addition some drugs have been developed to increase pulmonary ace2 expression such as anti-diabetic glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor glp-1r agonist liraglutide in order to improve lung function by normalizing expression of surfactant protein a and b roman-prez et al 2015 which is reduced in patients with severe viral pneumonia kerr and paton 1999ace and ace2 are highly expressed in the adult kidney even if in different areas ace2 is mainly expressed in the proximal tubule on the edge of the brush while ace seems to be evenly distributed on the apical and the basolateral membrane of the polarized cells of the tubules interestingly both renal development and kidney function are normal in the ace2 knockout mouse crackower et al 2002 however angiotensinogen ace and at1 receptor lack results in a series of alterations in kidney morphology therefore ace2 has a marginal role in regulating renal function at least in the healthy state however the action of ace2 is critical during ras activation in fact ang 17 exerts very limited renal effects in the healthy state but it plays profound beneficial effects in diabetic patients and in other states associated with renal damage for instance ace2 deficiency in mouse models is associated to increased age-related glomerulosclerosis and enhanced ang ii-induced renal oxidative stress leading to greater renal injury in particular downregulation of tubular ace2 is associated with albuminuria or tubular injury in the diabetic kidney where further inhibition of ace2 results in augmented renal damage doan et al 2001 li et al 2005 oudit et al 2006 wong et al 2007 soler et al 2007 hence ace2 is proving to be a protective molecule against kidney disease especially in the context of a negative regulation of classical ras axis deletion of ace2 leads to spontaneous late-onset nephrotic glomerulosclerosis and accelerates diabetic kidney injury indeed glomerular disease and albuminuria occur after pharmacological inhibition of ace2 soler et al 2013note that in several forms of chronic kidney disease and especially in diabetes it has been found that tubular ace2 expression is reduced however other studies showed that glomerular expression of ace2 increases in acute kidney injury it is likely that differential expression pattern of tubular and glomerular ace2 may be an important determinant for determining the progression of kidney disease kuba et al 2013in some cardiac resident cells ie endothelial cells pericytes and cardiomyocytes ace2 is the main enzyme involved in the local clearance of ang ii previous experimental evidences indicate that ace2 is an essential regulator of cardiac function and is involved in the response of various cardiac cells to multiple injuries especially those associated with overactivation of classical ras pathway imai et al 2005 in different experimental models indeed ace2 deficiency induces progressive cardiac fibrosis with aging andor pressure overload moreover ace2 deficiency accelerates post-infarct adverse ventricular remodeling and causes early cardiac hypertrophy in mice these detrimental effects may be prevented or reversed following treatment with ace inhibitors or at1 receptor blockers or sartans on the other hand ang17 peptide treatment can hamper cardiac remodeling and improve myocardial performance and even survival in rodent heart failure models schindler et al 2007 furthermore the use of mas receptor selective ligands such as ave-0991 exerts cardioprotective effects similar to ang17 in ischemiareperfusion ir injury myocardial infarction zeng et al 2012 or hypertension-induced cardiomyopathy models ferreira et al 2007 these observations suggest that the altered balance between ace and ace2 in the cv system is a critical driver for progressive heart disease which can be reverted by inhibiting classical ace or upregulating ace2 pathway however it is still unknown how myocardial ace2 may worsen covid-19 clinical scenario or contribute to vulnerability to sars-cov2 infection at leastpatients with cvds are at higher risk for severe covid-19 and show a worse prognosis in the presence of a systemic inflammatory response and immune system deregulation zheng et al 2020 madjid et al 2020 so far it is unclear whether cardiac ace2 signaling may play a role in cardiac injury yet the following clinical evidences will be helpful to support next focused investigationsfirstly since epithelial ace2 is the gateway of sars-cov-2 entry into cells the attractive hypothesis that sars-cov-2 may directly affect myocardial tissue through ace2 of endothelial cells pericytes or cardiomyocytes cannot be discounted a priori in agreement with this hypothesis preliminary reports provided evidence of symptoms of myocarditis in covid-19 patients xu et al 2020b ruan et al 2020b hu et al 2020 inciardi et al 2020 which is also consistent with the rise of hypersensitive ctni levels even if reports lack histological detection of myocardial inflammation while the myocardial localization of sars-cov-2 remains to be confirmed with certainty we cannot ignore that other viruses such as seasonal flu and parvovirus b-19 cause myocarditis fung et al 2016 however the detection of sars-cov viral rna in 35 of cardiac biopsies performed in patients during the sars outbreak in toronto 2003 is suggestive to support the hypothesis of coronavirus cardiotropism furthermore pulmonary infection with the human sars-cov led to ace2-dependent myocarditis in mice oudit et al 2009 it is therefore conceivable that sars-cov-2 also infects cardiomyocytessecondly the loss of ace2 is associated to increased susceptibility to heart failure while augmented ace2 levels prevent and reverse the heart failure phenotype emerging as a key protective pathway in the heart pathology patel et al 2016 accordingly cvd is associated with decreased baseline levels of ace2 expression chamsi-pasha et al 2014 during its replication sars-cov is able to progressively downregulate ace2 protein expression dijkman et al 2012 it has therefore been hypothesized that the loss of ace2 function may also occur during sars-cov-2 infection garami 2020 henry et al 2020 in particular the binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 might reduce the residual ace2 activity thereby altering the aceace2 balance and generating a ras dysregulation with higher ace andor lower ace2 a combination of phenomena that can result in co-occurrence of lung heart and renal acute failure garami 2020 henry et al 2020 the predominance of the aceang iiat1 axis function compared to the ace2ang17mas counterpart could be responsible of the typical vasoconstrictive pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative effects of ang ii occurring in these conditions that could ultimately evolve to acute heart failure and ards zhang and baker 2017 henry et al 2020 accordingly the ace2 production is dramatically impaired during ards resulting in dominant ace activity wsten-van asperen et al 2011 considering that peripheral ang ii levels were found to be significantly higher in covid-19 patients with respect to healthy subjects and that positively correlated with the viral load and lung injury liu et al 2020b the hypothesis of the ras pathway dysregulation in both lung and cardiac injury during sars-cov-2 infection should be investigated garami 2020 henry et al 2020third the sars-cov-2-dependent ace2 downregulation could trigger monocytemacrophage activation and induce severe lung inflammation contributing to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury up to the onset of respiratory failure sodhi et al 2018 garami 2020 the hypoxemia consequent to severe interstitial pneumonia can stimulate renin secretion and renin gene expression kramer et al 1998 thereby leading to a vicious circle garami 2020 that could enhance cardiac damage in covid-19 patients notably high ang ii levels were associated with hypertension heart failure packer and mcmurray 2017 and diabetes hao et al 2013 which both represent the most common underlying comorbidities in patients more vulnerable to sars-cov-2 infection of course the relationship between virus load onset and magnitude of covid-19 and ace2 downregulation-dependent ras dysregulation in lungs and heart requires a lot more compelling evidence moreover additional studies are mandatory to investigate whether the acute myocardial injury due to sars-cov-2 infection might be related to ace2 expression rather than activityinhibiting the classical ras pathway with ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker arb represents a first-line pharmacological strategy to treat arterial hypertension paz ocaranza et al 2020 which is usually associated with reduced lung function schnabel et al 2011b intriguingly ace2 expression in humans is enhanced by these treatments thomson 2020 whereas the arbs losartan and olmesartan were found to increase by threefold cardiac ace2 expression in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction ami gurwitz 2020 this observation led some investigators to speculate about a mechanistic link between the preexisting use of these drugs and predisposition to sars-cov-2 infection thomson 2020 kuster et al 2020 esler and esler 2020 as described in the ace2 in the heart section however ace2 confers protection against both lung and cardiac injury so that it has also been proposed to use ace inhibitors or arb as therapeutics for treating covid-19 patients prior to ards development gurwitz 2020 although ace inhibitors provide imperfect renoprotection in advanced type 2 diabetes and cv risk remains elevated zoja et al 2011 preliminary evidence from a limited cohort of patients n  187 demonstrated that there was no difference in fatality rate between covid-19 patients pretreated or not with ace inhibitors or arb guo et al 2020a moreover inhibition of classical ras pathway proved to exert a beneficial outcome in patients affected by viral pneumonia by likely reducing the respiratory inflammatory burden and cytokine storm induced by virus infection because of increased ace2 expression henry et al 2018 the effect of these drugs on ace2 levels in the lungs is still unknown and larger clinical studies are required to assess the impact of ace inhibitors and arb on severity of sars-cov-2 infection a recent joint statement of the american heart association american college of cardiology and heart failure society of american recommended not interrupting these medications in covid-19 patients affected by chronic arterial hypertension unless otherwise required by changes in patients conditions madjid et al 2020 indeed these life-saving drugs are difficult to replace since other common anti-hypertensive drugs such as beta-blockers cause bronchoconstriction aggravating lung function in general population schnabel et al 2011a and common calcium-channel blockers may cause cardiac conduction defects impair myocardial contractility and cause peripheral edemawhile the involvement of ace2 in sars-cov-2-induced acute myocardial injury remains controversial there is no doubt that the cytokine storm associated to virus infection is highly detrimental to the heart acute respiratory infections such as those characterizing interstitial pneumonia by sars-cov and mers-cov have long been known to result in major acute cardiac complications which may lead to a 60 increase in short-term fatality rate corrales-medina et al 2013 cardiac complications associated to viral pneumonia include malignant arrhythmias ami and heart failure which likely result from the increased myocardial workload during infections that accelerate myocardial injury or infarction bonow et al 2020 in addition sars-cov-2 has been shown to trigger an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response that besides acute lung injury and ards may ultimately lead to multiple cv complications zheng et al 2020 including ami unstable angina tachycardia heart failure and stroke gorla et al 2018 interestingly sars-cov-2 promotes an aberrant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by alveolar epithelial cells vascular endothelial cells activated monocytes and lymphocytes which express ace2 on their cells surface furthermore sars-cov-2 could also induce lymphocyte death through pyroptosis which would explain why covid-19 patients undergo lymphopenia thereby further contributing to exacerbate organ injury the cytokine hypothesis for cardiac damage postulates that the deleterious effects of chronic cytokine release on myocardium and vascular endothelium may facilitate the onset of ami or heart failure for instance pro-inflammatory cytokines ie interleukin-1 il-1 il-6 and tnf exert a negative inotropic effect on cardiac contractility likewise the sustained activation of inflammatory signaling eg through tnf and il-1 may induce massive cardiomyocyte apoptosis and lead to adverse left ventricular remodeling which favors the onset of acute heart failure additionally the cytokine storm stimulates monocytesmacrophages to release matrix metalloproteinases mmps which boost atherosclerotic plaque growth and rupture favor the secretion of pro-coagulant factors and induce hemodynamic changes thereby increasing the probability for ami to occur mann 2015 newby 2016 toldo and abbate 2018 indeed while short-term il-6 release exerts a cardioprotective effect chronic activation of il-6 signaling leads to autoimmune myocarditis fontes et al 2015 in this scenario underlying cvds are predicted to worsen the outcome of patients with viral infections on the heart as already established for pneumonia and seasonal fluseveral observations support the contribution of deregulated inflammatory signaling in sars-cov-2-induced myocardial injury zheng et al 2020 for instance huang et al observed that plasma levels of inflammatory mediators including il-1 ifn ip10 cxcl10 and mcp1 ccl2 were upregulated in covid-19 patients interestingly this study also showed that cytokine levels were remarkably higher in critically ill patients in particular the serum levels of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf ip10 mcp1 mip1a ccl3 and tnf were higher in icu-patients than those that did not require icu admission thereby suggesting that the cytokine storm is a clinical predictor of mortality huang et al 2020 as ifn is the signature cytokine of the t-helper-1 th1 response rose 2011 these findings suggest that the balance between the pro-inflammatory th1 response and the anti-inflammatory t-helper-2 th2 response is tipped in favor of the former zheng et al 2020 in line with these observations zhu et al reported that hypersensitive ctnt and inflammatory biomarkers eg serum ferritin and il-6 were significantly higher in non-survivors covid-19 patients zhou et al 2020a the high inflammatory burden in severe covid-19 has been further confirmed by another independent study which reported higher levels of serum ferritin il-6 and c-reactive protein in patients who did not survive likely because of fulminant myocarditis ruan et al 2020b of note over-production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was common in sars-cov wong et al 2004 and mers-cov mahallawi et al 2018 patients where acute lung injury was diagnosedfurther investigations are required to elucidate the potential role of the cytokine storm in the pathogenesis of cv complications including cardiomyopathy acute myocardial injury and myocarditis following sars-cov-2 infection and to understand the potential mechanistic relationships between cvd and covid-19 outcomes as discussed in the next paragraph the nlrp3inflammasome might play a triggering role in the cytokine storm induced by sars-cov-2nlrp3 is a prr belonging to the nod nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors nlrs able to recognize both damage-associated molecular patterns damps and pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps schroder and tschopp 2010 such as specific virus molecules stimulating downstream pathways that contribute to the systemic immune response farag et al 2020 nlrp3 inflammasome is a multi-protein platform made up of a sensor protein nlrp3 the adaptor protein asc and a cysteine protease precursor procaspase-1 schroder and tschopp 2010 zhou et al 2011 activated nlrp3 induces the inflammasome assembly interacting with asc that in turn triggers the conversion of the zymogen procaspase-1 into the active caspase-1 franchi and nez 2012 lastly caspase-1 an established inflammatory caspase martinon and tschopp 2007 converts the inactive pro-il-1 and pro-il-18 into active pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 and il-18 epstein and dinarello 1984 finally il-1 stimulates the release of tnf and il-6 whereas il-18 increases circulating levels of ifn- il-13 il-4 il-8 thereby contributing to the immune inflammatory responses both il-1 and il-18 represent key factors of the host defense davis et al 2011viral infection has been always associated with inflammation farag et al 2020 and viroporins seem to play a triggering role rather than viral pamps viroporins are a new class of virus proteins composed of 1520 amino acids that homo-oligomerize forming hydrophilic pores across the organelle membranes thereby increasing the permeability to monovalent and divalent cations ie na k and ca2 wang et al 2011 nieva et al 2012 these structures appear to play a crucial role in the virus infectionlife cycle genome replication and assembly farag et al 2020 paving the way to consider the possibility to target viroporins with antiviral strategies scott and griffin 2015 an increase in intracellular ca2 concentration as well as a reduction in cytosolic k are regarded among the most suitable triggering signals for nlrp3inflammasome activation muoz-planillo et al 2013 horng 2014 okada et al 2014 zhu et al 2017of note viroporins mediate nlrp3inflammasome activation and excessive production of il-1 guo et al 2015 farag et al 2020 to date nlrp3inflammasome activation following a viral infection has been reported for influenza a virus iav hepatitis c virus hcv encephalomyocarditis virus emcv and sars-cov liu et al 2004 ichinohe et al 2010 farag et al 2017 the reported increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels such as il-18 and il-1 not only in the plasma but also in lungs and lymphoid tissues of patients affected by sars mers and more recently by covid-19 is potentially consistent with nlrp3inflammasome activation chen et al 2019 huang et al 2020 it is well known that all coronaviruses encode for viroproteins e and 3a which are responsible at least for replication virulence and nlrp3inflammasome activation ie sars-cov castao-rodriguez et al 2018 chen et al 2019 farag et al 2020 sars-cov proteins e and 3a ic differ for intracellular distribution and biophysical properties protein e locates in the endoplasmic reticulum er-golgi intermediate compartment its functionality is strictly dependent on the lipid environment composition nieto-torres et al 2015 and induces ca2 efflux during sars-cov-2 infection which activates the inflammasome complex leading to the acute proinflammatory response associated with virus pathogenicity on the other hand the detailed targeting of protein 3a remains still elusive castao-rodriguez et al 2018 chen et al 2019 farag et al 2020in addition in vitro studies revealed that also the sars-cov open reading frame 3a orf3a accessory protein which is a strong inducer of the nlrp3inflammasome siu et al 2019 may serve as a viroprotein chen et al 2011 therefore it is plausible that sars-cov-2 may use the same mechanism of action to induce the nlrp3-dependent storm of cytokines and the resulting severe systemic inflammation that often causes fatal outcome it is not surprising that inhibition of the nlrp3inflammasome has recently been put forward as a promising strategy to treat or prevent acute cardiac injury such as ir injury liu et al 2018 toldo and abbate 2018 pasqua et al 2018 likewise targeting nlrp3inflammasome may represent an attractive therapeutic strategy in the treatment of virus-associated diseases such as cvd liu et al 2018 pasqua et al 2018 for instance it has been demonstrated that nlrp3inflammasome activation by hypertension induces a sterile inflammation that results in a chronic low-grade inflammation characterized by an increased activity of nf-b zhu et al 2017 bulln et al 2017 sustained nf-b signaling in turn leads to increased tissue andor circulating levels of proinflammatory mediators such as il-1 and il-18 that induces the activation of immune cells and their consequent detrimental effects on both respiratory tract and heart dalekos et al 1997 rabkin 2009 krishnan et al 2014 based upon these evidences it is reasonable to refer to nlrp3inflammasome as a common pathogenic mechanism included in a vicious cycle that triggers and supports both covid-19 and its most common cv comorbidities such as arterial hypertension in this context targeting nlrp3inflammasome might serve as a therapeutic tool in counteracting the severe systemic inflammation following sars-cov-2 infection while at same time also mitigating the underlying cvd and reducing the mortality rate of hospitalized patients in this regard promising data were provided by a drug recently acquired by novartis namely ifm-2427 which is already under clinical trial mullard 2019in agreement with other pulmonary diseases covid-19 poses a remarkable challenge to health because of hurdled blood oxygenation and oxygen delivery to tissues when the oxygen supply to tissues becomes insufficient to sustain normal function a situation called hypoxia ensues whereas some organstissues can survive short in response to non-severe hypoxia periods for other organstissues hypoxia represents an intolerable hit that may lead to lethal outcomes as myocardium and cerebral tissues are the most endangered heart and brain represent the primary targets of acute respiratory failurethere are several criteria that recommend the transfer of patients to icu one of these is arterial blood oxygen saturation  90 and pao2  60 mmhg smith and nielsen 1999 as the covid-19 pathology mainly concerns lung dysfunction most of these patients may face severe hypoxia for several days and most treatments aim at correcting hypoxia by oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation there are several concerns related to the effects of prolonged hypoxia on the cv systemfirst the hypoxia-driven hyperventilation response mediated by the carotid bodies and aimed at restoring normal oxygenation necessarily implies excessive washout of carbon dioxide which shifts the acid-base balance towards alkalosis such response has been found in healthy subjects even at moderate altitude for periods of time ranging from few days samaja et al 1997 to several months porcelli et al 2017 although often partially compensated by metabolic acidosis alkalosis of either origin represents a common finding in critically ill patients mhle et al 2014 kre et al 2017 although not yet documented alkalosis is expected to damage brain and pulmonary tissue as it enhances oxidant-induced apoptosis in several cell lineages auer 2004 ando et al 2007second chronic hypoxia weakens the myocardial resistance against stress milano et al 2010 acute hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction at last induces histological changes in the right ventricular rv myocardium netzer et al 2017 contributing to increase rv systolic pressure and hypertrophy common features of pulmonary hypertension mclaughlin and mcgoon 2006 in addition to the effects elicited by acute hypoxia chronic hypoxia leads to pulmonary remodeling which include increased pulmonary vessel density increased frequency of small  50 m wall thickness vessels and increased thickness of pulmonary lamina nydegger et al 2018 2019 all changes imputable to excessive stimulation of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells favre et al 2017 chronic hypoxia is well known to contribute significantly to pulmonary hypertension ramchandran et al 2012 and is associated with many pulmonary hypertension-related diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cystic fibrosis diffuse interstitial fibrosis bronchopulmonary dysplasia infiltrative lung tumors congenital hearts defects and ischemic eventsthird at odds with what happens in healthy subjects exposed to altitude hypoxia which is well known to stimulate erythropoiesis piperno et al 2011 goetze et al 2013 systemic hypoxia represses erythropoiesis in ards patients and these often develop severe anemia  8 gdl which correlates with a poor prognosis and may require blood transfusion silver 2005 jenq et al 2018 this clinical scenario is common in icu patients nguyen et al 2003 and it may be attributable to anemia of inflammation whose etiology is scarcely known the physiological response to hypoxia with compensatory increase in hemoglobin requires an increase in iron transport and use in fact it demands stabilization of ferroportin the transmembrane protein that enables iron release from the cells with increased intestinal absorption the degradation of ferroportin is mediated by hepcidin hep that decreases in healthy subjects thereby enabling the compensatory response to hypoxia gassmann and muckenthaler 2015 however hep levels increase in ards patients galesloot et al 2011 despite their hypoxic condition the consequent loss of hep regulation may limit the efficacy of iron-replacement therapies lasocki et al 2010 this mechanism may be relevant in ards and covid-19 patients because iron release into the circulation and deregulated uptake by tissues that use iron may saturate transferrin increase the non-transferrin-bound aliquot of iron with possibly triggering of unspecific oxidative stress injuryfourth although the correction of hypoxia with oxygen therapy remains the major life-saving concern in icu patients excess oxygen delivery or hyperoxia may cause considerable harm ottolenghi et al 2020 in facts hyperoxia caused by breathing mixtures with  40 oxygen markedly elevates reactive oxygen species ros release in the circulation and contributes to tissue injury by oxidative stress nagatomo et al 2012 hyperoxia-induced injury may occur even in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery breathing mixtures containing 40 to 80 oxygen ottolenghi et al 2019 hyperoxia-driven oxidative stress is expected to alter the expression of genes that regulate pathways underlying different responses to oxidative stress terraneo and samaja 2017 intuitively the direction of the alterations driven by hyperoxia is opposite to those elicited by hypoxia however there is evidence that this is not the case in many instances for example the regulation of gene transcription by the hypoxia-inducible factors hifs hifs are well known to respond to hypoxia by acting as transcriptional factors for an array of genes that participate in various cell processes as angiogenesis metabolism cell proliferation control of ros-induced damage and many others giordano 2005 including apoptosis and autophagy ziello et al 2007 gui et al 2016 but recent studies show that hif-1 and hif-2 are indeed up-regulated in the response to hyperoxia as well at least in brain benderro et al 2012 terraneo et al 2017 some types of cancer terraneo et al 2010 2014 and hepatocytes wikenheiser et al 2009 marconi et al 2014 but not in heart gyongyosi et al 2018 although the injury led by hyperoxia has not yet been studied as that led by hypoxia it is established that hyperoxia reduces the expression of angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor vegf signaling and capillary density benderro et al 2012 reduces the anti-apoptotic defense by increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins bax and bad and decreasing the activation of anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl brutus et al 2009 increases neuronal apoptosis concomitantly with decreased protective p-akt and erythropoietin signaling terraneo et al 2017 accumulates oxidized lipids and proteins tatarkova et al 2011 down-regulates neurotrophins that provide tropic support to developing neurons felderhoff-mueser et al 2004 and stimulates ferroptosis a newly discovered iron-dependent form of cell death thereby contributing to brain damage li et al 2017frailty which was labeled as the most problematic expression of population ageing clegg et al 2013 is often confounded with disability or co-morbidity but frailty is assuming separate distinguished features which highlight the presence of a well-defined phenotype that characterizes elders many elders have multi-organ dysfunction with frailty representing a unifying notion in the care of elderly patients that directs attention away from organ-specific diagnoses clegg et al 2013 the concept of frailty is now universally defined as an individuals state of increased vulnerability and susceptibility to adverse health outcomes or death when exposed to a stressor in this case the pulmonary diseases arising from sars-cov-2 infection in the presence of an age-dependent excess of ros and reactive nitrogen species rnsfrailty may be viewed as the result of the disruption of the organisms homeostatic balance that leads to heterogeneous clinical manifestations when the individual is exposed to endogenous or exogenous stressors only a minor but non negligible number of people  65 years old is considered frail the prevalence of physical frailty ranges from 4 to 17 mean 99 with a higher prevalence in persons  80 years old among patients with multiple comorbidities collard et al 2012in the absence of pandemics the prevalence of frailty and cvd increase with age making their coexistence common epidemiological studies suggest that frailty may represent an important prognostic marker for patients with several types of cvds including coronary artery disease heart failure as well as older people undergoing surgical and transcatheter interventions afilalo et al 2014 despite unclear biological underpinnings of frailty and unexplored interaction with heart failure it appears that frailty and cvd share common pathophysiological pathways bellumkonda et al 2017 among cvds ami is a major cause of death morbidity and loss of quality of life in industrialized countries accounting for more than 7 million deaths per year worldwide steg et al 2012 aging is classically regarded to as the greatest risk factor for ami indeed endothelial cell senescence due to increased ros production and dysfunction of nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 nrf2-mediated antioxidant response pathway may compromise endothelial nitric oxide no bioavailability exacerbate inflammatory response and pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases ie ami and stroke in older patients fulop et al 2018 ungvari et al 2019 an excess of ros and rns is central in many pathways leading to cardiac hypertrophy and failure tocchetti et al 2015 accordingly the incidence of ami and the case-fatality mortality rate are markedly higher in elderly patients who are also more prone to develop post-ami heart failure afilalo et al 2014 when compared to younger subjects aged patients are less amenable to receive percutaneous coronary intervention while they are less sensitive to fibrinolytics carro et al 2011 therefore the impaired resilience of the cardiovascular cells to oxidative stressors in the presence of deficiency of relevant anti-oxidant mechanisms ie nrf2-related pathway may lead to sars-cov-2 detrimental consequences to the aged heart and vasculature moreover the correct fine-tuning of the nitroso-redox balance is fundamental for the function of the main components of the excitation-contraction coupling machinery tocchetti et al 2015despite the predominance of older patients with cvd among the population randomized clinical trials have generally focused into young subjects without co-morbidities thereby generating data that cannot be extended to elderly patients this feature has been related to the higher case fatality rate in older vs younger subjects hospitalized with ami individuals aged  75 years old do not benefit from the same pharmacological interventions established for their younger counterparts after ami fleg et al 2011 the lower sensitivity to cv drugs in the elderly depends on age-associated physiological changes in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics together with intrinsic deficits in the signaling pathways to protectionthe reasons for the higher incidenceseverity of ami in elderly subjects are multifactorial and not easy to reconcile with a single triggering event endothelial dysfunction has been regarded as an early mechanism among those leading to the mismatch between oxygen supply and demand that finally culminates in ami moccia et al 2018 in addition aged endothelial cells lose their capability to proliferate and to replace neighboring damaged cells thereby aggravating the impact of coronary endothelium dysfunction moccia et al 2018 consequently aged subjects are more susceptible to develop coronary artery disease since the aging endothelial cells of coronary microcirculation are unable to express cytoprotective pro-survival antioxidant macromolecular damage repair and anti-inflammatory genes due to deregulation of relevant transcription factors pathways such as nrf2 signaling oxidative damage is quite remarkable in microvascular endothelial cells affected by nad depletion and sirtuin 1 dysregulation kiss et al 2019 dampening their angiogenic activity and thus leading to microvascular rarefaction which is an established hallmark of aging valcarcel-ares et al 2012 likewise nrf2 signaling is disrupted during aging also in cardiac myocytes silva-palacios et al 2016 and fibroblasts nacarelli et al 2018 thereby contributing to enhance cardiac vulnerability to oxidative stress it thus appears that the impairment of nrf2 transcriptional activity is key to increase cv risk during aging and could therefore worsen cv damage in older covid-19 patients this scenario could be even worsened when oxygen therapy is required as hyperoxia-induced ros release is postulated to exert a stronger cytotoxic effect on aged vasculature due to its lower resilience to oxidative stress in agreement with these hypotheses a recent study demonstrated that genetic depletion of nrf2 worsened age-related impairment of endothelial no bioavailability and of endothelial monolayer integrity in addition genetic silencing of nrf2 resulted in a dramatic increase in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines fulop et al 2018 also known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype sasp these cytokines include il-1 and tnf ungvari et al 2018 which are recently shown to mediate covid-19-induced cytokine storm enhancing the pro-inflammatory phenotype might represent another mechanism whereby aging-dependent nrf2 dysfunction contributes to exacerbate the detrimental consequences of sars-cov-2 on the cv systemmoreover aging is associated to a significant perturbation of the ca2 signaling toolkit in cardiomyocytes which leads to a dramatic impairment of heart muscle contraction hamilton and terentyev 2019 the higher mortality for ami in these individuals has further been linked to the age-related decline in the endogenous protective mechanism against myocardial ir injury indeed pre- and post-conditioning are powerful interventions aimed to reduce the infarct size by eliciting endogenous cardioprotection in response to one or several brief cycles of sub-lethal myocardial ir that precede or follow respectively a sustained potentially lethal ischemic insult these conditioning protocols recruit a complex cascade of intracellular signaling pathways mainly risk and safe which converge on mitochondria and limit cell death pagliaro et al 2011 although pharmacological conditioning recapitulates the endogenous mechanisms of cardioprotection induced by both pre- and post-conditioning and might be exploited in the therapy of ami these conditioning protocols are barely effective in aged hearts thereby exacerbating ir injury the loss of cardioprotection in elderly people is not irreversible and might be either rescued or preserved by alternative strategies such exercise boengler et al 2009 which also promotes angiogenesis and increases vascular density in aging mouse models of ami bei et al 2015presently there is no experimental evidence-based difference in the clinical management of young vs elderly presumably frail subjects at least for cvd conversely the sharp decrease in the endogenous mechanisms of cardioprotection and angiogenic repair during aging suggests that older subjects should undergo a distinct treatment as compared to younger individuals older patients are left with few if any effective therapeutic methods to alleviate symptoms restore distal perfusion and preserve tissue viability calling for innovative approaches to restore the efficiency of cardioprotective mechanisms with aging for example by pursuing alternative strategies to foster pre-conditioning post-conditioning and endogenous protection boengler et al 2009 as a matter of facts actual strategies and treatments for covid-19 patients are essentially the same for young and elder patients but if cv patients respond differently depending on their age or frailty why shouldnt this occur in covid-19 patients one could however suggest that restoring endothelial function eg at microvascular level or improving vascular health during aging could represent an effective strategy to treat covid-19 in critical patients for instance activation of nrf2 by drugs eg propofol during mechanical ventilation or oltipraz zhou et al 2020c ruan et al 2020a or by epigenetic compounds eg nicotinamide mononucleotide resveratrol histone deacetylase inhibitors csiszr et al 2015 pooladanda et al 2019 kiss et al 2019 could rescue at least partially stress resilience of both endothelial and cardiac cells in aging individuals affected by covid-19 otherwise regular physical exercise and dietary intake of functional foods lionetti et al 2019 has also been shown to activate nrf2 in the myocardium as well as across a variety of tissues and could be advised to frail older people to reduce the risk to develop major cv complications in the case of sars-cov-2 infection mcphee et al 2016 done and traustadttir 2016preliminary evidence has been provided in favor of a relationship between the number of days of exceeding the limits for particulate matter pm 10 ie fine material with an airborne diameter  10 m recorded in the control units of some cities and the number of hospitalizations from covid-19 in northern italy setti et al 2020 the area of this country which suffered the highest number of cases and fatalities the pm is worldwide recognized as an important prompt for cvd as the inhalation of pm is certainly a trigger for multiple cv disorders such as ami heart failure and stroke in urban communities liang et al 2020 inhalation of smaller pm such as pm 25 ie fine material with an airborne diameter  25 m leads to pulmonary inflammation and cardiotoxicity via secondary systemic effects mills et al 2009 as it can easily reach the alveolar space by irritating the alveolar wall up to onset of lung dysfunction xing et al 2016 cohen and colleagues have reported that more than four million deaths are attributable to pm 25 with nearly 60 of these due to cvds cohen et al 2017 this link is emphasized in the countries where air pollution concentration is continuing to rise mills et al 2009 the exposure to pm is still associated with the incidence of coronary events in europe even though the limit value was set at 50 gm3 daily cesaroni et al 2014 the scientific literature reports that air pollution and pm has been associated with a plethora of cv events such as angina ami arrhythmia and heart failure dockery et al 1993 samet et al 2000 peters et al 2001 mann et al 2002 brook et al 2003 bhatnagar 2006 mills et al 2009 hence any comorbidity with other pathologies as obesity and hypertension seems to impact the cvd-associated mortality in adults who are daily exposed to higher levels of pm mazidi and speakman 2018 a time-stratified

and russo 2019 they observed a statistically significant relationship between pm 10 levels and flu for cvd mortality and between flu and temperature for deaths by natural causes in wuhan region china where air quality index is extremely low and the average daily pm concentration is 11560 gm3 similar association between air pollution mainly no2 and cvd mortality during 4-year period 20062009 has been observed albeit no correlation was found directly among pm 10 and cvd liu et al 2015 a positive relationship between pm 25 and influenza-like illness at the flu season reported for the period january 2008december 2014 was then observed via time-series analysis in beijing feng et al 2016both lombardy and wuhan areas are hitherto clusters of the worldwide pandemic of covid-19 with higher number of people deceased in contrast with the rest of the nations italy and china where the virus also spread but with less aggressiveness as to march 27 chen at al provided evidence that avian influenza h5n1 may be subjected to intercontinental transportation via saharian dust chen et al 2010 thus one wonders if air pollution has an impact upon covid-19 spread ciencewicki and jaspers 2007 a position paper of the italian society of environmental medicine proposed that pm could represent a factor that favors long-term persistence of viruses in the atmosphere httpwwwsimaonlusitwpsimawp-contentuploads202003covid19position-paperengpdf indeed only for the lombardy region the number of infected persons before quarantine and lockdown and the mean number of pm 10 exceedancesmonitoring stations results in a r2 correlation of 0974the study concluded that there is a tangible risk that pm may serve as carrier for the viruses in the northern regions of italy whereas further investigation and more solid data are necessary to disentangle this hypothesis to strengthen this hypothesis the exceedance in pm during the period february 1029 2020 and the number of covid-19 cases reported as to march 26 from the italian national institute of health were visually correlated it is clear from this analysis that in the selected provinces in lombardy piedmont and emilia-romagna where the majority of covid19 cases occurred so far the pm 10 exceedances increment was higher while these preliminary data hint at a correlation between air pollution which represents an established risk factor and covid-19 further in-depth retrospective cross-sectional investigations are required keeping in mind the quarantine have drastically reduced the pm concentration in the aforementioned regions httpswwweeaeuropaeuhighlightsair-pollution-goes-down-asas already described in the case of ebola and sars-cov outbreaks kruse 2020 repurposing of clinically approved drugs has been invocated to effectively treat patients who are at greater risk of death for instance the raising hope that lopinavir and ritonavir which are employed as human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitors could display clinical efficacy against covid-19 was recently dashed by the failure of a clinical trial in china cao et al 2020 as reviewed in li and de clercq li and de clercq 2020 clinical trials were already launched in china and usa to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of multiple food and drug administration fda-approved antiviral treatments including the nucleoside analogues favipiravir and ribavirin and the experimental nucleoside analogue remdesivir nct04280705 holshue et al 2020 the list of antiviral agents that were proposed in the fight against covid-19 include oseltamivir pencicloviracyclovir ganciclovir sarilumab galidesivir nitazoxanide rapamycin recombinant interferons and chlorpromazine li and de clercq 2020 guo et al 2020bof note a randomized controlled clinical trial of sarilumab nct04315298 a monoclonal antibody against the il-6 receptor is currently assessing whether the modification of the inflammatory response induced by this treatment could provide benefit in reducing lung inflammation and improving lung function in covid-19 patientsan alternative but not mutually exclusive strategy consists in the identification of a small molecule drug that could be repurposed to inhibit the interaction between virus and target cells gunaratne et al 2018b kruse 2020 as mentioned in section 3 sars-cov-2 entry requires priming of s protein by furin and tmprss2 hoffmann et al 2020 walls et al 2020 coutard et al 2020 a promising report revealed that camostat mesylate an fda-approved drug which blocks tmprss2 activity effectively prevented sars-cov-2 spread in vitro hoffmann et al 2020 in addition once fully surface-exposed s glycoprotein represents a source of accessible epitopes for the production of neutralizing antibodies and thus a target for ongoing vaccine design efforts walls et al 2020 in this line the use of antibody-rich plasma donated by patients who fully recovered from covid-19 is under evaluation to determine if it could shorten the length or lessen the severity of the illnessthis finding opens the way to the repurposing of clinically available drugs interfering with the endocytic pathway mediating sars-cov-2 entry into the target cell eg through inhibition of ph-mediated endocytosis bulk alkalinization of endolysosomal el vesicles or blockade of el proteases for instance fda-approved cardiotonic steroids ouabain and bufalin known for their selective blockage on the nak-atpase can significantly impair mers-cov infection through the endocytic pathway burkard et al 2015 remarkably the lysosomotropic compound chloroquine a cheap and widely available anti-malarial drug was shown to block sars-cov-2 infection in vitro at a clinically relevant concentration wang et al 2020c and according to preliminary reports proved to exert beneficial exerts in covid-19 patients colson et al 2020 mitj and clotet 2020 gao et al 2020 inciardi et al 2020 chloroquine could indeed accumulate within the acidic vesicles and interfere with the el vesicle trafficking golden et al 2015 of note chloroquine which is also employed in autoimmune disorders has the potential to counteract the cytokine storm associated with covid-19 severity liu et al 2020a obviously the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine in covid-19 patients needs to be supported by randomized clinical trials conducted on large cohorts of patients since the margin between the effective therapeutic dose and toxic dose is narrow and chloroquine poisoning has been associated with serious cv disorders frisk-holmberg et al 1983 nevertheless these preliminary evidences endorse the view that the usage of a single compound potentially able to block viral-host cell interaction and attenuate the inflammatory response could provide an effective weapon against the diseasein this view a hint at an alternative therapy against covid-19 is suggested by the cv comorbidities affecting these patients ca2 antagonists have long been used as first line anti-hypertensive drugs due to their ability to block l-type voltage-gated ca2 channels in vascular smooth muscle cells godfraind 2017 oparil et al 2018 ca2 antagonists include dihydropyridines eg nifedipine nicardipine and nimodipine as well as phenylalkylamines eg verapamil and the benzothiazepine diltiazem godfraind 2017 rosenfeldt et al 2018 nifedipine verapamil and diltiazem often used in combination with ace inhibitors or sartans reduce arterial hypertension with quite tolerable side effects godfraind 2017 rosenfeldt et al 2018 furthermore nicardipine is strongly recommended as antihypertensive agent in stroke rosenfeldt et al 2018 whereas verapamil is largely employed to treat both hypertension and ventricular arrhythmia godfraind 2017 it has long been known that ca2 antagonists may block endolysosomal el two-pore channels 12 tpc12 genazzani et al 1997 moccia et al 2003 which play a crucial role in el trafficking patel 2015 at the same concentrations as those reported to block l-type voltage-gated ca2 channels tpcs are gated by multiple agonists including nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate naadp sphingosine and the el phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 35-bisphosphate galione 2019 tpcs-mediated ca2 release recruits el-located ca2-sensitive decoders including calmodulin synaptotagmin vii and arf6 faris et al 2018 to regulate vesicular fusion and trafficking galione 2019 a screening campaign aiming at repurposing fda-approved drugs as novel antiviral compounds recently revealed that classical ca2 antagonists blocked ebola virus and mers-cov infections in vitro sakurai et al 2015 gunaratne et al 2018a b ebola virus entry into host cells occurs by macropinocytosis followed by relocation to the endosomal compartment thereafter the virus binds to the endosomal membrane protein npc1 to fuse with acidic late endosomeslysosomes and release the capside into the cytoplasm falzarano and feldmann 2015 a recent series of investigations demonstrated that inhibiting tpcs-mediated el ca2 release with nifedipine verapamil nicardipine and diltiazem prevented viral genome entry in the cytoplasm sakurai et al 2015 penny et al 2019 subsequently the same strategy was worked out to find clinically available tools to treat mers which was first described in saudi arabia in 2012 zaki et al 2012 and subsequently reported to affect more than 1500 subjects zumla et al 2015 as described above for sars-cov-2 the viral s protein mediates mers-cov entry upon binding to the host cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 followed by proteolytic priming via tmprss2 raj et al 2013 park et al 2016 following clathrin-mediated endocytosis mers-cov is redirected through the el system where the s protein is proteolytically cleaved by lysosomal proteases which results in vesicular fusion and capside release into the cytoplasm millet and whittaker 2014 burkard et al 2014 notably mers-cov pseudovirus translocation was also attenuated by blocking el tpcs with verapamil nicardipine and nimodipine gunaratne et al 2018b tpcs function as homodimers in which each subunit comprises two homologous six-transmembrane domain motifs therefore they represent the molecular ancestors of the  cav subunits of voltage-gated na and ca2 channels with which they share the structural motifs within the pore regions patel 2015 in the same line docking analysis and ca2 fluxes measurements confirmed that ca2 antagonists avidly bind to the tpc pore rahman et al 2014as a further support to the proposal to probe ca2 antagonists to treat covid-19 it is worth recalling that chloroquine inhibits sars-cov-2 virus entry by promoting the alkalinization of el vesicles wang et al 2020c liu et al 2020a which is a common strategy to perturb el membrane fusion notably elevating el ph would also result in a significant reduction in el ca2 concentration usually around 500 m as el ca2 refilling is mainly driven by the h gradient morgan et al 2011 faris et al 2018 for instance the lysomotropic weak base nh4cl abrogates el ca2 storage morgan et al 2011 as well as mers-cov gunaratne et al 2018b and sars-cov yang et al 2004 vincent et al 2005 entry in the cytoplasm furthermore lysosomotropic agents also affected ace2 localization in vitro the viral receptor remains trapped within perinuclear vacuoles upon pretreatment with chloroquine nh4cl or bafilomycin a1 wang et al 2008besides supporting viral entry into the host cells preliminary evidence suggested that tpcs contribute to deliver the el ca2 signal responsible for nlrp3 inflammasome activation tseng et al 2017 it thus appears that blocking tpcs-mediated el ca2 release with either chloroquine or ca2 antagonists might represent a potential perspective to treat covid-19 patients by interfering with both sars-cov-2 infection and the subsequent inflammatory response while this hypothesis remains to be probed by a devoted experimental pipeline a clinical trial has been launched in china to evaluate the therapeutic outcome of tetrandrine on sars-cov-2-infected subjects clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04308317 tetrandrine is an alkaloid isolated from the root of stephania tetrandra a vine that grows in china and taiwan and is widely employed in china to treat autoimmune diseases cv disorders hypertension and cancer tetrandrine targets multiple intracellular signaling pathways including l-type voltage-gated ca2 channels which could explain its beneficial effects on the cv system yao and jiang 2002 of note tetrandrine was recently shown to inhibit tpcs-mediated el ca2 release and to attenuate ebola sakurai et al 2015 and mers-cov-2 gunaratne et al 2018b entry into the host cells these findings however may suggest the hypothesis that repurposing of ca2 antagonists could prove effective in treating sars-cov-2 infection while at the same time attenuating cv and respiratory dysfunction co-occurring in older covid-19 patientsthe covid-19 pandemic has rapidly spread throughout the globe by preferentially affecting older individuals with underlying cv comorbidities besides ards and acute kidney injury cardiovascular complications also represent a common consequence of the disease and at the same time a cause for adverse outcome in covid-19 patients although we cannot ignore emerging events of drug-induced sudden cardiac death among treated covid-19 patients chorin et al 2020 clinical reports well support careful evaluation of the pathogenic mechanisms that promote the onset of severe covid-19 due to cvd following sars-cov-2 infection these include for example classical ras pathway and ace2 nlrp3inflammasome and hypoxemia fig 1 furthermore the prevalence and death toll of covid-19 increases with aging as well as frailty and seems correlated with prolonged exposure to air pollution both of which represent life-threatening cv risk factors in our opinion understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that exacerbate the impact of covid-19 in patients with existing cv pathologies and lead to major cardiac complications is mandatory to design a truly cardioprotective therapy while waiting for the vaccineduring the past two decades the outbreak and prevalence of severe acute respiratory infections have been seen as one of the most serious hazards to global health both two prominent coronaviruses 2002 sars-cov and 2012 mers-cov have markedly affected humans causing 8422 and 1600 infections as well as 916 and 574 deaths respectively 1 2in early december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases with unknown reason emerged in wuhan hubei china high-throughput sequencing from lower respiratory tract samples has revealed a novel coronavirus that was named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and also named sars-cov-2 3 as of february 17th 2020 70636 confirmed cases and 1772 death cases have been documented in china 2019-ncov also targets the respiratory tract and shares many similar clinical symptoms with sars-cov and mers-cov 3 common symptoms include fever fatigue and dry cough followed always by anorexia myalgia dyspnea and so on 48 lymphopenia and prolonged prothrombin time are also the most common characteristics 46in addition as cardiologists we are also concerned about whether patients with cardiovascular disease are at greater risk for 2019-ncov and whether new coronavirus infections have an impact on the cardiovascular system previous studies have shown a relationship between cardiovascular metabolic diseases and sars and mers 911 a systematic analysis of 637 mers-cov cases showed that diabetes and hypertension are prevalent in about 50 of the patients and cardiac diseases are present in 30 of the cases 11 diabetes was seen as an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in patients with sars 9 with the spread of 2019-ncov and increase of the cases more and more 2019-ncov infected individuals exhibit comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes and cardia-cerebrovascular disease in chens study of 99 cases 40 patients had cardia-cerebrovascular disease 6 and in huangs study of 41 cases 20 patients had diabetes 4 these cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities might render them more susceptible to poor prognosis given the rapid spread of 2019-ncov an updated meta-analysis with significantly larger sample sizes by integrating the published studies is urgently warranted accordingly the present analysis will not only identify the cardiovascular epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-ncov infection with greater precision but also unravel the impact of the infection on the cardiac injurypreferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual participant data the prisma-ipd statement was followed for the conduct and reporting of this meta-analysis 12to identify all the studies illustrating the prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in 2019 novel coronavirus infection in china embase and pubmed were carefully searched from december 2019 to february 2020 the following search terms or keywords were used alone or in combination novel coronavirus influenza pneumonia cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes and cardiac injuryinclusion criteria are as follows 1 comparative studies randomised controlled trials rcts or non-rcts published in english 2 study population more than ten participants were included in the study 3 study intervention patients in the studies should be confirmed to have been infected by 2019 novel coronavirus 4 parameters the comorbidities of cardiovascular metabolic diseases and the outcome of cardiac injury should be given case reports non-human studies studies without adequate information and studies written in chinese for the fear of data duplication were excluded in the present meta-analysisprevalence of comorbidities including hypertension cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes table 1 and fig 2 together with clinical outcome of cardiac injury confirmed by elevation of troponin it or the creatine kinase seen as the second choice if troponin it were not provided were extracted from the identified studies table 1 and fig 3 the primary outcome measure was to compare the prevalence of comorbidities and impact on cardiac injury in icu and non-icu cases severe and non-severe data as the second choice if icu data was not provided cochrane collaborations tool was followed to assess the risk of biasall analyses were performed using openmeta analyst version 1010 httpswwwcebmbrowneduopenmeta and revman software version 53 forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of the cardiovascular metabolic diseases in 2019-ncov infection severity from the selected studies as well as the impact of the 2019-ncov infection on the cardiac injury the results of the included studies were performed with fixed-effect models mantelhaenszel method 13 or random-effect models in cases of significant heterogeneity between estimates 14 we used the i2 statistics to assess the magnitude of heterogeneity 25 50 and 75 represented low moderate and high degrees of heterogeneity respectively the chosen of the proper effect model was based on the analysis results the fixed effect model was used if i2  50 and the random effect model was used if i2  50 15after initially identifying 399 articles 111 duplicate documents were identified of the leaving trials after review of the titles and abstracts 277 documents of non-human researches reviews and studies that were not clinical trials were excluded the leaving 11 studies were carefully and detailed evaluated at last six studies were excluded because the participants of the trials did not meet the criteria we have set then one study published in medrxiv was added finally a total of six studies with 1527 patients were included 46 8 16 17 fig 1 all of the selected studies were published in 2020 with different sample patient sizes that ranged from 11 to 1099 patients table 1 summarizes the study characteristicssystematic analysis of studies that described the epidemiological and clinical features of covid-19 cases and reported the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases as well as the impact on cardiac injury in the infectious disease has identified six reports with 1527 patients table 1 the majority of the cases were localized in wuhan or recent travel to wuhan or contact people from wuhan the median ages were respectively 56 49 47 555 34 and 57 years old according to the six studies the infection was diagnosed throughout the whole spectrum of age covering from new born to 92 years old in all of the studies men were more likely to be infected than women and the overall proportion of male is 578meta-analysis for the identified studies showed that the most prevalent cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities were hypertension 171 95 ci 99244 and cardia-cerebrovascular disease 164 95 ci 66261 followed by diabetes 97 95 ci 69125 fig 2 there was a significant heterogeneity cochrans q in the estimates of comorbidities among the identified studies with an i2 index varied from 47 to 95 fig 2we then compared the difference of the prevalence of the three diseases between severe patients and non-severe patients or icu patients vs non-icu patients according to the data in the studies for hypertension and cardia-cerebrovascular disease the heterogeneity test results were calculated as i2  47 and 26 thus the fixed-effect model was used for further analyses the results from the three included studies with a total amount of 1278 patients showed that hypertension accounted for 288 of icusevere cases but 141 of non-icusevere cases a similar pattern was found in cardia-cerebrovascular disease statistics it accounted for 167 of icusevere cases but 62 of non-icusevere cases the proportion hypertension and cardia-cerebrovascular disease were both statistically significant higher in icusevere patients compared to the non-icusevere patients hypertension rr  203 95 ci 154 268 z  504 p  000001 cardia-cerebrovascular disease rr  330 95 ci 203 536 z  481 p  000001 fig 2 for diabetes the heterogeneity test showed that i2  67 and so the random effect model was used diabetes accounted for 117 of icusevere cases but 40 of non-icusevere cases the result indicated a higher proportion of diabetes in icusevere patients but without statistical significance rr  221 95 ci 088 557 z  168 p  009 fig 2at last we focused on the impact of the covid-19 on the cardiac injury two studies that gave clear data were statistically analyzed and the data showed that 80 95 ci 41120 patients might be suffered from an acute cardiac injury another two studies only gave the data of creatine kinase if it can be seen as a biomarker of cardiac injury the proportion might be 115 95 ci 78152 when we attempted to compare the differences of cardiac injury incidences between icusevere patients and non-icusevere patients we just included the two studies which specifically identified myocardial injury the data again showed a significant higher incidence of acute cardiac injury in icusevere patients compared to the non-icusevere patients rr  1348 95 ci 360 5047 z  386 p  00001 fig 3 the funnel plots demonstrated symmetrical distributions of the effect size of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and cardiac injury on either side of the pooled estimate but a non-symmetrical distribution of the effect size of diabetes fig 4 coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses which include six species that can cause diseases in humans to our knowledge 18 four viruses among them 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 have been reported to cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals 18 however the two other strains are the infamous sars-cov and mers-cov which have been linked to fatal illness and caused plagues and large numbers of deaths 19 complete genome sequences of 2019-ncov showed that it is identified as a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the sarbecovirus subgenus of coronaviridae family the same subgenus with sars-cov 3according to previous research on sars-cov the presence of comorbidities increased the mortality risk with cardiac disease and diabetes being the most important components to predict adverse outcomes 20 cardiac disease and diabetes increase the risk of death by twice as much as other risk factors 20 thus it is necessary for us to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac and metabolic diseases in covid-19 the present systematic analysis summarized the data from all of the five studies of covid-19 the results demonstrated that the overall proportion of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes were respectively 171 164 and 97 according to summary of the 2018 report on cardiovascular diseases in china the morbidities of the hypertension and diabetes were respectively 232 and 109 and there were about 13 million of cerebrovascular disease patients and 11 million of cardiovascular patients 21 therefore comparing the data to the report we did not find that people with hypertension and diabetes were more susceptible to 2019-ncov infection the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in people infected with the virus is about the same as in the general population even slightly lower however comparing the general population the incidence of cardia-cerebrovascular disease in patients with covid-19 is obviously much higherdue to the sample size and limited time so far data collection is still incomplete and most of the studies have not analyzed comorbidities in death cases so the relationship between cardiovascular metabolic diseases and covid-19-induced death cannot be determined but what is assuredly is that patients with hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases or diabetes are more likely to develop severeicu cases after 2019-ncov infection the overall proportion of hypertension cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds threefolds and twofolds respectively higher in icusevere cases than in their non-icusevere counterparts although the difference of diseases in the meta-analysis is not statistical the rr value is about 221 and we consider this might because of the sample size of included studies and the algorithm adopts the random effect model which is a more conservative approach so we speculate the result might reach statistical significance when more researches publish their dataanother important finding is the damage the virus did to the heart according to the present summary at least 80 patients with covid-19 suffered acute cardiac injury in chens report the first death was a 61-year old man with no previous chronic underlying disease after he was admitted by icu he had developed severe respiratory failure heart failure and sepsis and then experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on the 11th day of admission and was declared dead 6 this case reminded us that patients with a novel coronavirus might develop acute cardiac injury and further analysis indicates us that the incidence of myocardial injury is much higher in icusevere patients about 13 folds more than non-icucardiac patients and furthermore the observation also reminded us that patients with covid-19 associated with unstable angina or stemi have poor cardiac reserve lower tolerance to severe pneumonia and are more likely to develop cardiac insufficiency leading to deterioration according to the information released by shanghai health commission the first covid-19 death in shanghai was a patient 88 years old with a serious history of hypertension cardiac dysfunction the analysis of death causes suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction and in the course of its onset the 2019 ncov infection is only the inducementthe pathogenesis of 2019 ncov infection-related acute myocardial injury is still unknown but according to the clinical presentation and lab data of the disease as well as the pathogenesis of sars-cov it can be speculated that 2019-ncov infection may affect the cardiovascular system through multiple mechanismsfirst viral infection directly causes damage to cardiomyocyte according to oudits study sars-cov viral rna was detected in 35 of autopsied human heart samples from sars-cov infected patients during the toronto sars outbreak 22 and they also confirmed that pulmonary infection with the human sars-cov in mice led to an ace2-dependent myocardial infection 22 ace2 is an important target for sars-cov 23 and molecular modelling has shown high structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and 2019-ncov 24 ace2 expression is highly tissue-specific mainly expressed in the cardiovascular renal and gastrointestinal systems with a small amount expressed in lung cells therefore in addition to coronaviruses causing pneumonia through ace2 receptors in lung epithelial cells we also need to pay attention to possible viral effects on myocardial tissue second hypoxaemia may be also an important reason of cardiac injury in huangs study 32 covid-19 patients had various degree of hypoxaemia and need required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support in chens study up to 76 of patients require oxygen therapy due to severe 2019-ncov infection the pneumonia may cause significant gas exchange obstruction leading to hypoxaemia which significantly reduces the energy supply by cell metabolism and increases anaerobic fermentation causing intracellular acidosis and oxygen free radicals to destroy the phospholipid layer of cell membrane meanwhile hypoxia-induced influx of calcium ions also leads to injury and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes third huangs study noted that high concentration of il-1 ifn- ip-10 and mcp-1 could be detected in patients infected with 2019-ncov which might lead to activated t-helper-1 th1 cell responses 4 furthermore they also found that icu patients had much higher concentrations of inflammatory factors than those non-icu patients suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity 4 in addition repeated floods of catecholamines due to anxiety and the side effects of medication can also lead to myocardial damagein conclusion patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of infection of 2019-ncov and it can also greatly affect the development and prognosis of pneumonia simultaneously we should pay close attention to viral infection-related heart damage in the course of disease treatmenthuman and rodent angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 is an endotheliumbound carboxymonopeptidase with single activesite catalytic region whose expression is limited mainly to endothelial cells of the arteries arterioles and venules in various organs including the heart lungs and kidneys 1 2 loss of ace2 leads to an agedependent cardiomyopathy 1 2 3 and kidney disease 4 while also enhancing pulmonary 5 cardiac 6 and renal injuries 7 in addition to its peptidase action ace2 also functions as the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov 8 9 10 and ace2 expression is necessary for the pulmonary infection by sarscov 10 11 12 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars spread rapidly through the world leading to significant morbidity and acute often lethal lung failure with a mortality of approximately 10 despite modernday therapies 11 12 in toronto the sars outbreak was associated with loss of lives considerable burden on the healthcare system and a huge economic impact 13 14 15fatal sars is associated with a viraemic response suggesting that sarscov may affect other organs 16 interestingly patients infected with the sarscov suffered from cardiac disease including systolic and diastolic dysfunction 17 arrhythmias and sudden death 18 we hypothesized that the interaction between sarscov and ace2 in the heart could contribute to sarsmediated myocardial inflammation and damage we showed that pulmonary infection with the sarscov in mice leads to myocardial sarscov in an ace2dependent manner coupled with downregulation of the myocardial ace2 mrna and loss of ace2 protein in patients who died from sars presence of sarscov in the heart was associated with greater macrophage infiltration and myocardial damage in association with decreased myocardial ace2 protein expression our results demonstrate that ace2 plays a key role in mediating sarscov infection in the heart which in combination with downregulation of the myocardial ace2 could be the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of sarsassociated heart diseasemutant mice have been previously described 1 and only male littermate ace2 mutant ace2y wildtype ace2y controls were used in this study all experiments were performed in accordance to

previously described 1 7 analysis of myocardial ace2 mrna expression was carried out using taqman realtime pcr using the forward primer 5ggatacctacccttcctacatcagc3 reverse primer 5ctaccccacatatcaccaagca3 and probe 5famccactggatgcctccctgccctamra3 as previously described 7 10all data are shown as mean  sem all statistical analyses were performed using spss software chicago il usa version 101 we used anova followed by the students neumankeuls test for multiple comparison testing while the students ttest was used for comparisons between any two groupsangiotensin converting enzyme 2 is the functional receptor for the sarscov and mediates sarscov pulmonary infection 8 10 we examined the myocardial response to pulmonary infection with the sarscov within 2 days following sarscov infection there was a marked presence of the sarscov in the heart of wildtype ace2y mice while sarscov levels were reduced in the hearts of ace2y mice providing the first evidence for dependence of myocardial sarscov infection on ace2 expression fig 1a interestingly this process lead to a partial downregulation of ace2 mrna expression in wildtype mice fig 1b in association with a complete loss of myocardial ace2 protein levels fig 1cd these results show that in a wellvalidated pulmonary murine model of sars 10 sarscov can clearly infect the heart and modulate ace2 expression to decipher whether the effects on ace2 expression is mediated directly by sarscov vs a secondary myocarditis process we studied the encephalomyocarditis emc virusinduced murine model of viral myocarditis consistent with the impact of sarscov on myocardial ace2 mrna expression emc viral myocarditis was associated with a significant decrease in ace2 mrna fig 1e in contrast myocardial ace2 protein levels showed a significant increase fig 1fg suggesting an increased transcriptional efficiency of ace2 mrna andor reduced proteolytic processing of ace2 these results demonstrate that pulmonary infection with sarscov in our murine model leads to myocardial sarscov in an ace2dependent manner in association with decreased myocardial ace2 mrna expression and a specific reduction in myocardial ace2 protein levelsinterestingly severe cardiac dysfunction has also been described in patients with sars 17 18 given the high expression of ace2 in the heart 1 24 coupled with the observation that sarscov is detectable in the plasma of sars patients 12 25 we examined whether pulmonary sarscov infection leads to myocardial sarscov infection in patients who died from sars we examined the archived postmortem autopsy heart tissues from patients who had succumbed to the sars crisis for the evidence of myocardial sarscov infection twenty patients all of whom had confirmed diagnoses of sars with sarscov being detected in their lungs were studied reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction analysis showed that 35 of the patients 7 of 20 had positive sarscov genome detected in the heart fig 2a with an average viral load of 407  106 copies of sarscov per gram of heart tissue age 70  12 years 3m4f importantly the duration of the illness was significantly shortened in patients with detectable sarscov in their hearts n  7 39  23 days vs patients without sarscov in the heart n  13 432  97 days p  005 fig 2a these results indicate that in patients with sars pulmonary sarscov infection can clearly lead to sarscov infection in the heart resulting in a more aggressive illness and earlier death trichromestaining showed increased myocardial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in patients who had sarscov detected in their hearts fig 2ae the presence of myocardial inflammation and reduced ace2 expression in response to myocardial sarscov infection was associated with pathological hypertrophy as shown by increased cardiomyocyte crosssectional area fig 2f assessment of apoptosis using tunel staining revealed no increased apoptosis in the autopsied heart samples fig 2ghthe presence of sarscov in the heart suggests that this could lead to myocardial inflammation we used a positive control group that consisted of 13 patients who died from sars without evidence of sarscov in the heart age 67  12 years 6m7f and negative control group consisting of patients who died from bacterial pneumonia and did not have sars n  7 age 68  9 years 3m4f immunohistochemical staining of postmortem myocardial tissue using a macrophagespecific cd68 cellsurface marker revealed a significant amount of macrophage infiltration fig 3ad which was clearly increased in patients who had sarscov in their hearts with only a minor elevation in patients without sarscov in the heart fig 3e in contrast immunohistochemical staining of tcell specific cd3 cellsurface marker showed that myocardial lymphocytic infiltration was minimal fig 3fh with no significant difference in lymphocyte count between groups fig 3ithe ability of sarscov to utilize ace2 as a receptor in vivo and the presence of sarscov in the heart suggests that sarscov can interact with the myocardial ace2 system we hypothesized that the presence of sarcov in the hearts could be associated with decreased ace2 protein expression consistent with our observations in our murine model immunohistochemistry for myocardial ace2 protein expression showed that the presence sarscov in the heart was associated with marked downregulation of ace2 protein expression fig 4ac which was quantified and shown in fig 4f the specificity of our antiace2 antibody was shown by preincubation with human recombinant ace2 1 mg ml1 kindly provided by apeiron biologics austria which blocked most of the immunostaining for the native ace2 protein fig 4epatients who were infected with the sars virus suffered from cardiac disease ranging from systolic and diastolic dysfunction 17 arrhythmias and sudden death 18 in this study we have provided evidence that ace2 functions as the myocardial sarscov receptor in vivo respiratory sarscov infection in our murine model leads to an ace2dependent sarscov infection in the heart and decreased myocardial ace2 mrna expression cytokinemediated transcriptional downregulation of ace2 mrna could have lead to decreased ace2 mrna level in sarscov and emcmediated viral myocarditis26 virusmediated receptor downmodulation has been described for multiple viruses including hiv measles and pulmonary sarscov 10 the complete loss of ace2 protein in hearts infected with sarscov could be secondary to the activation of adam17tace by the sars spike protein which is known to cleave and release ace2 27 andor due to sarscov binding to ace2 in the endothelial cells leading to endocytosis of the ligandreceptor complex 12 28 and subsequent intracellular degradation of ace2in patients who succumbed to sars sarscov was detected in the heart of 35 of the subjects suggesting that sarscov is capable of infecting the myocardium in susceptible individuals we showed that patients who had sarscov in their hearts died considerably earlier suggesting that myocardial sarscov infection was associated with a more aggressive course of illness sarscov interaction with ace2 led to sarsassociated cardiomyopathy and likely contributed significantly to the morbidity and mortality in patients with sars 17 18 consistent with the cardiac disease in patients who succumbed to sars we previously reported that bilateral pulmonary oedema in association with bilateral pleural effusions was frequently observed at the time of autopsy 22 increased myocardial interstitial fibrosis in patients with sarscov in the heart is consistent with recent findings showing that the sarscov nucleocapsid n protein potentiates transforming growth factorbetamediated fibrosis 29 consistent with observations in lung tissue from patients affected by sars 23 cd 68 positive macrophages were detected in sarspositive hearts with an absence of lymphocytic invasion in contrast to classic viral myocarditis as seen with the enteroviruses and herpesvirus type 6 which are associated with a prominent lymphocytic infiltration 30 sarscovinduced myocardial inflammation is mediated predominantly by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines 23 31the deleterious effects of myocardial sarscov infection could be perpetuated by the prompt and severe downregulation of ace2 resulting in increased ang ii action andor loss of the cardioprotective effects from ang 17 1 3 5 andor activation of adam17tace by the sars spike protein leading to an increased release of tnf 20 27 myocardial dysfunction could also be secondary to the strong interferonmediated immunopathological events associated with the immune response in patients with sars 31 32 the cardiovascular involvement could explain the marked age dependence of mortality seen in patients with sars 11 12 because of decreased cardiovascular reserve with ageing consistent with ace2 being a key sarscov receptor patients with diabetes mellitus in whom ace2 expression is increased 7 showed greater susceptibility to sars 13 14 our results imply that interactions between infectious agents with key receptorsignalling pathways in the cardiovascular system may confer unique sensitivity to sarscov and potentially other viral infections indeed interaction and subsequent activation of the pi3k signalling by influenza a virus are an important determinant of viral replication and may lead to adverse cardiovascular effects in the setting of an avian influenza epidemic

articles published in english from december 2019 to april 2020 using the medical subject heading or text words coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or cardiac injury or biomarkers or inflammation and cardiac involvement fig 1 we search for articles that reported on observational studies or clinical trials promoting any relation between cardiac involvement inflammation and covid-19 we considered articles eligible for initial inclusion if they focused on this subject citations of relevant articles were reviewed to capture additional studies we also manually searched the reference of previous reviews and all records that received a full-text review few additional articles before our search years were included if they were referenced in existing articles and included pertinent important data for this present article no randomized trials neither interventional studies were available at this time in this investigation hence observational studies long-term prospective cohort studies case-control or cross-sectional studies were also included in this article to be eligible for inclusion studies had to be written in english be published in a peer-reviewed journal provides outcome data on cardiac injury inflammation and covid-19 this study was in accordance with the ethical standards of our institutional research committee and with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards the included studies were first categorized by whether the study compared clinical outcomes between cardiac involvement and inflammation in covid-19 patients after the initial search the authors separately screened all abstracts based on the eligibility criteria any abstracts or articles for which there was disagreement or uncertainty were reviewed again and discussed until consensus was reachedalhogbani11 described the evidence from a coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis manifested as myocardial edema and acute myocardial injury of the apical and lateral walls of the left ventricle this regional myocardial injury may result from direct viral myocardial infection and inflammation however according to a recent pathological study performed by xu et al17 there was scarce interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the myocardial tissue without substantial cardiac muscle tissue damage in their patient with covid-19 suggesting that the coronavirus might not directly impair the heart nevertheless this is just their proposal based on the pathological findings of only 1 patient who acquired covid-19 in wuhan on the other hand in the study performed by guo et al5 plasma troponin t levels were positively linear correlated in a significant manner with plasma high-sensitivity c-reactive protein crp levels indicating that myocardial injury may be closely associated with inflammatory pathogenesis during the progress of disease considering that most of the patients were elderly people with a probable association of coronary heart disease whether the myocardial injury was directly associated with sars-cov-2 infection is still unclear direct evidence demonstrating that sars-cov-2 infects the myocardial tissue or pericardial effusion liquid in patients with covid-19 is currently lacking of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies no prospective investigation has been reported so far elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaksanother plausible mechanism involves the ace2 the latter is a human cell receptor with a strong binding affinity to the virus spike protein of sars-cov-2 since ace2 is also highly expressed in the heart it is reasonable to hypothesize that covid-19induced cardiac injury might be mediated by ace21216 ace2 is a key counter regulatory enzyme that degrades angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17 thereby attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction sodium retention and fibrosis although angiotensin ii is the primary substrate of ace2 that enzyme also cleaves angiotensin i to angiotensin-19 and also participates in the hydrolysis of other peptides ace2 is expressed broadly including in the heart and kidneys and the lung alveolar epithelial cells2022the complexity underlying the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas clearly shows the different responses to different modulators in the presence of sars-cov 2 infection fig 2 the enzyme active sites of ace and ace2 are distinct therefore ace inhibitors in clinical use do not directly affect ace2 activity23 experimental animal studies have shown mixed findings with respect to the effects of ace inhibitors and arb on ace2 levels or activity in tissue2430 some studies have shown that arb may increase messenger rna expression or protein levels of ace2 in tissue2430 while others showed no effect27 these ostensibly inconsistent results demonstrate the complex raas responses and emphasize the notion that findings from experimental animal studies may not extrapolate to similar physiological responses in humans this fact shows the importance and relevance of human studies performed on this matter to shed more light for comprehensionat least theoretically the drug-induced increased ace2 expression produced by acei or arb might aggravate lung injury of patients with covid-19 however henry et al31 in a previous clinical study showed a beneficial effect of acei in patients admitted with viral pneumonia they retrospectively investigated the impact of ace inhibitors and statins on the rates of intubation and death in 1055 adult patients with a positive respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction test they found lower rates of death and intubation in those patients with continued use of ace inhibitors odds ratio 025 95 confidence interval ci 009064 during the hospital stay moreover those patients on ace inhibitors before hospital admission and subsequently discontinued the medication had a higher mortality than those patients who were not on ace inhibitor before admission they observed a significantly reduction of the pulmonary inflammatory response and cytokine release caused by virus infection31 in addition mortensen et al32 found a significant decrease in mortality length of stay and mechanical ventilation in patients taking ace inhibitors or arb who were hospitalized with pneumonia and compared with a matched cohortthe study done by kuba et al33 provided the first genetic proof a molecular evidence for the severe lung failure and mortality associated with sars-cov they demonstrated that infections with sars-cov resulted in ace2 downregulation through binding of sars-cov spike protein to ace2 which contributed to the severity of lung pathologies they further showed that this severity could be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway33 as the authors mentioned the fact of providing a molecular link between sars-cov pathogenesis and the role of the raas in lung failure envisioned a novel target in the therapeutic management recombinant ace2 protein could not only be a treatment to block virus spreading but modulation of the renin-angiotensin system could also be utilized to protect patients with covid-19the beneficial effect of aceiarb may be related to a compensatory increase in ace218 however the evidence regarding the use of aceiarb in patients with covid-19 infection is still emerging and larger prospective randomized clinical studies are required at present for patients with covid-19 who previously used aceiarb the use of these drug agents may not need to be discontinued based on current dataanother possible mechanism involved in cardiac injury may be the increased cytokine secretion during covid-19 in a previous research 46 patients with established clinical diagnosis of sars-cov were prospectively studied by li et al18 they found significantly higher left ventricular index of myocardial performance 042  013 vs 033  009 p  0001 longer isovolumic relaxation time 1029  157 vs 816  147 milliseconds p  0001 lower flow propagation velocity 696  157 vs 838  197 cms p  0011 and doppler-derived cardiac output 469  101 vs 549  104 lmin p  0001 were observed during acute infection when compared with those at 30 days a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction correlated moderately with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level r  0605 p  0001 whereas a higher index of myocardial performance correlated weakly with an increase in creatine kinase level r  038 p  0016 in this 30-day echocardiographic follow-up study they found that reversible subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment appears to be a common finding in acute sars-cov infection even among those patients without underlying cardiac disease they suggested that left ventricular dysfunction in the acute phase of the disease might be attributable to the cytokine storm syndrome resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to sars-cov infection18huang et al1 found that severely ill patients with covid-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines including interleukin il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and igg-induced protein 10 they also had higher plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha and tumor necrosis factor  indeed this is a serious life-threatening disease with clinical features of systemic inflammation methemoglobinemia hemodynamic instability and multiple organ failure the trademark clinical endorsement of cytokine storm syndrome is a severe uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response involving the continuous activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages some other markers of inflammatory response such as crp procalcitonin and leukocytes were also found to be significantly increased among patients who suffered from cardiac injury1the infection-related increased cytokine release is identified by an elevated plasma level of several inflammatory biomarkers various inflammatory serum markers that are shown to be elevated in patients with covid-19related cardiac injury are crp procalcitonin ferritin d-dimer il-2 il-7 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor igg-induced protein 10 chemokine ligand 3 and tumor necrosis alpha therefore the storming activation and secretion of these inflammatory cytokines can lead to apoptosis or necrosis of myocardial cells in covid-1913 in this regard huang et al1 demonstrated an imbalance of t helper 1 and t helper 2 responses resulting in a cytokine storm which may have contributed to myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 the release of inflammatory cytokines after infection may cause reduction in coronary blood flow and decreased oxygen supplyanother interesting factor to consider is the presence of preexisting cvds might also render patients to be more susceptible to covid-19induced heart injury shi et al3 demonstrated that patients with cardiac injury had a history of coronary heart disease 30 and hypertension 60 which were significantly more prevalent than in those patients without cardiac injury wang et al2 found very similar percentages in their patients who were critically ill with covid-19 25 had underlying heart diseases and 58 had hypertension it is reasonable to assume that patients with predisposing cvds such as coronary artery disease or heart failure are susceptible to cardiac injury and once such patients are infected with covid-19 myocardial ischemia or infarction and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are more likely to occur ultimately leading to a sudden deterioration the intrinsic inflammatory process within the atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary walls is exacerbated during the systemic inflammatory response in covid-19 making them susceptible to fissure initiating an acute coronary syndrome19altered myocardial demandsupply ratio in association with increased cardiometabolic demand in the myocardial tissue can result in myocyte hypoxia this alteration in the context of systemic infection associated with acute respiratory illness-related hypoxia can further impair myocardial oxygen demandsupply relationship and lead to acute myocardial injury16 in addition the systemic inflammation also causes endothelial dysfunction and increases the procoagulant activity of the blood which can further contribute to the formation of occlusive thrombi over a ruptured coronary plaque in the context of inflammation and hypoxemic state in covid-19 atrial fibrillation may supervene worsening the prognosis and developing heart failure19viral diseases can harm myocardial cells through direct myocyte damage by the virus and by systemic inflammatory responses han et al34 studied and analyzed in detail the main laboratory markers associated to cardiac injury in covid-19 patients and investigated the correlation between heart injury and severity of the disease they specifically analyzed serum levels of creatine kinase isoenzyme-mb myohemoglobin myo cardiac tni ultra-tni and n-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide nt-probnp in 273 covid-19 patients their patients were divided into 3 groups according to strict diagnostic criteria of their clinical condition mild 198 cases severe 60 cases and critical 15 cases the positive rate of myo ultra-tni and nt-probnp was higher in severe cases and critical cases as compared with mild cases the differences among the groups were statistically significant p  005these findings showed that higher concentrations in venous blood of creatine kinase isoenzyme-mb myo ultra-tni and nt-probnp were associated with the severity and mortality of covid-19 of note the authors analyzed these 4 cardiac injury parameters between the death n  24 and alive patients n  249 all 4 parameters were significantly higher in the death than in the alive group p  0001 therefore the authors concluded that careful monitoring of the myocardial enzyme profiles is of great importance in reducing the complications and mortality in covid-19 patients34 in this context an interesting meta-analysis was performed by lippi et al39 in a total number of 341 patients they found that tni plasma values were significantly increased in patients with severe covid-19 compared with those patients with milder forms of the disease therefore it seems rational to assume that initial measurements of serum biomarkers of cardiac injury should be performed immediately after hospitalization for covid-19 patients and further in-hospital monitoring may help identifying a subset of severe cases with possible cardiac involvement and consequently predict progression towards a worse clinical scenarioguo et al5 performed a retrospective single-center case series study to analyzed 187 patients with confirmed covid-19 the mean age was 5850  1466 years they evaluated the association of underlying cvd and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with covid-19 of 187 patients 144 patients 77 were discharged from the hospital and 43 patients 23 died overall 66 353 patients had underlying cvd including hypertension coronary heart disease and cardiomyopathy and 52 278 exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated troponin t tnt levels the mortality during hospitalization was 76 for patients without underlying cvd and normal tnt levels 133 for those with underlying cvd and normal tnt levels 375 for those without underlying cvd but elevated tnt levels and 694 for those with underlying cvd and elevated tnts fig 3 patients with underlying cvd were more likely to exhibit elevation of tnt levels compared with the patients without cvd 545 vs 132 plasma tnt levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity crp levels   0530 p  0001 and nt-probnp levels   0613 p  0001 during hospitalization patients with elevated tnt levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias and the use of glucocorticoid therapy 712 vs 511 and mechanical ventilation 596 vs 104 were higher compared with patients with normal tnt levels the mortality rates of patients with and without use of aceiangiotensin receptor blockers was 368 and 256 therefore the authors concluded that myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19 while the prognosis of patients with underlying cvd but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury interestingly these authors demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin t and plasma high-sensitivity crp levels biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation respectively fig 4 guo et al5 observed 52 278 patients who exhibited myocardial injury as demonstrated by elevation of troponin t levels and the mortality was markedly higher in these patients with elevated tnt levels than in those with normal tnt levels 596 vs 89 there was nearly 70 mortality in those covid-19 patients who had underlying cvd and elevated troponin t levels in addition their data on nt-probnp showed that its serum elevation and the presence of malignant arrhythmias were significantly more common in patients with elevated tnt levels moreover the serum levels of nt-probnp were significantly correlated with tnt levels in this respect gao et al35 studying 54 patients with covid-19 reported that the best cutoff value of nt-probnp was 88 pgml for predicting in-hospital death they found it to have an excellent sensitivity and good specificity fig 5 patients with high nt-probnp values had a significantly increased risk of death comparing to those with low values after adjustment for potential risk factors nt-probnp was independently correlated with in-hospital death35 the results of these 2 latter studies argue in favor of the concept that the greater the cardiac injury the greater the ventricular dysfunction in covid-19 patients also patients with underlying cvd are more prone to experience myocardial injury during the course of their covid-19there is no known direct association between the sars-cov-2 itself and the qt interval prolongation in the electrocardiogram of covid-19 patients however there is known association to prolonged qt interval and cardiac arrhythmias among certain drug agents that may be utilized in the therapeutic management of covid-19 hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been utilized as potential pharmacological agents in the prophylaxis or therapeutic management in covid-19 both drug agents are known to provoke malignant ventricular arrhythmias in certain patients4042 hydroxychloroquine acts on the entry and postentry stages of sars-cov-2 via effects on endosomal ph and the resulting underglycosylation of ace 2 receptors that are required for viral entry since it may prolong the qt interval and develop ventricular arrhythmias it should be given with extreme cautious in association with other qt interval prolonging drugs fig 6 there are case reports of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus showing hydroxychloroquine-induced qt interval prolongation and developing torsade de pointes4344 azithromycin is increasingly recognized as antibiotic that may cause qt prolongation malignant ventricular arrhythmias nonpause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsade des points and increased risk for sudden cardiac death45 there are very limited data evaluating the safety and clinical outcome of combination therapy with these 2 pharmacological agents and the effect of their combination on qt interval or arrhythmia risk has not been studied therefore multiple randomized clinical trials are currently ongoing studies table 3 shows certain care and safety considerations to considerthe novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 appears to be more transmittable with greater infectivity and somehow similar or higher morbidity and mortality depending on the area considered as compared with sars and mers49 so far there is a greater incidence of patients with sars-cov-2 who have developed severe pneumonia pulmonary edema acute respiratory distress syndrome cardiovascular compromise or multiple organ failure and death oudit et al46 previously demonstrated that the sars-cov genome was positively detected in the myocardial tissue in 35 of the patients with sars-cov infection this raises the possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus itself sars-cov-2 may share the same mechanism with sars-cov because the 2 viruses are highly homologous in genome4748 animal experimental studies have shown that some strains of coronavirus infection may seriously affect the heart for example coronavirus infection may induce cardiomyopathy that results in cardiac chamber dilatation and impairment of systolic function simulating dilated cardiomyopathy in rabbits49 in this context of cardiomyopathy it is interesting to note that dong et al50 reported 4 end-stage heart failure patients who were infected with covid-19 2 of them with severe illness presentation all 4 patients were male had typical lymphopenia and had significantly increased crp level three patients had elevated tni in the later evolution period and tni increased significantly a few days before death moreover the levels of crp and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly higher an interesting finding was that the tni level of the 2 critically ill patients increased significantly by more than 20-fold indicating important myocardial injury patients with end-stage heart failure seemed to be older have more comorbidity poor general condition a greater myocardial injury and higher mortality rate after covid-19according to the novel knowledge acquired from recent studies on covid-19 those patients who manifested cardiac injury presented with more severe acute illness requiring noninvasive or invasive ventilation compared with patients without cardiac injury they also manifested clearly abnormal laboratory radiographic findings and mortality in half of the hospitalized patients it is worth comparing these cardiovascular findings in covid-19 with those of sars of about 15 years ago49 yu et al10 studied the cardiovascular complications of sars in 121 hospitalized patients they observed that hypertension occurred in 504 of these patients 719 developed persistent tachycardia including 40 with continued tachycardia during outpatient follow-up therefore tachycardia could not be explained by fever which had already subsided by then it was neither explained by coexisting hypotension which was only present in a comparatively small number of patients although tachycardia-related cardiovascular complications were common in patients with sars they were generally self-limiting and not associated with mortality other types of cardiac arrhythmias were uncommon in patients with sars transient atrial fibrillation occurred in only 1 patient who had no history of cardiac disease therefore the cardiac arrhythmiaassociated effect of the coronavirus that causes sars is low in total 47 39 patients developed arterial desaturation that needed oxygen therapy however only 18 15 patients were admitted into intensive care unit only 6 5 patients died and all of them due to pneumonia10 in contrast with that from sars findings more than half of the patients with cardiac injury experienced in-hospital death with covid-19 indicating that this novel coronavirusinduced cardiac injury is associated with major adverse clinical outcomes and worse prognosis3 indeed cardiac injury was found to be independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19myocardial injury and common pathways of inflammation are significantly associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality and overall fatal outcome of covid-19 we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage namely coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis ace2 receptor binding affinity to the virus spike protein increased cytokine secretion and hypoxia-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis myocardial injury was found to be related to cardiac dysfunction ventricular arrhythmias and it was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19 inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury there was a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin t and plasma high-sensitivity crp levels biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation respectively although there are several possible mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage the exact mechanism of cardiac injury needs to be further explored in well-designed clinical studies strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in covid-19 are steadily needed given the high infectivity and lethality of covid-19 and the enormous economic and social impact of the worldwide outbreak elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future treatment in case of renewed outbreakscvds are still the number one killer in the world and represent the leading noncommunicable epidemic since numerous patients with cvd are using aceiarb drug agents clinical studies may be necessary to explore the potential associations of these pharmacological drugs with the susceptibility and prognosis of covid-19 despite the theoretical concerns and physiological uncertainties concerning the effect of raas inhibitors on ace2 ace inhibitors and arb drug agents should be continued in patients with covid-19 in otherwise stable condition5153 this is a position supported by multiple medical and scientific societies that needs to be explored by randomized clinical trials to search for the potential associations of these pharmacological drugs with the susceptibility and prognosis of covid-19the high morbidity and mortality of covid-19 its monumental economic burden and social impact the despair of a new pandemic outbreak and the thread of potential utilization of novel sars-cov-2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease emerging as an acute infectious disease covid-19 may become a chronic epidemic because of genetic recombination therefore we should be ready for the reemergence of covid-19 or other coronaviruses in the near futurenothing to declarewe thank dr angelica helga neumann for her excellent technical assistance and constant support in the making of this article and miss felicita torales for her help with the literature searchthe outbreak of pneumonia in eastern and now in europe and usa by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a serious social issue for the high number of pulmonary complications needing intensive care units icu treatment and for the mortality risk which is particularly elevated in north italy even if severe respiratory disease is a key factor precipitating poor outcome other factors could also play a role previous study reported that community-acquired pneumonia cap was associated with cardiovascular disease such as heart failure myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation and that myocardial damage as depicted by elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin hs-ctn t was detectable in   50 of cap patients cap severity was among the factors favoring myocardial injury 1 as troponin elevation is associated with poor prognosis we reviewed the data so far reported regarding the behavior of troponins in sars-cov-2 patients in relation to the disease severitywe searched the pubmed database without language restriction for studies in human patients published between 2019 and present time with a combination of text words and medical subject headings including troponin troponins myocardial injury laboratory coronavirus covid-19 2019-ncov sars-cov-2 initially 111 documents were evaluated after excluding papers that did not report data on troponin levels reviews commentaries and letters seven papers were selected of which one was excluded because data about the prevalence of patients with troponin elevation were not expressly reportedof the six selected studies five were set in china and one in usa and included a total number of 337 patients table 1 myocardial injury was evaluated by cardiac troponin i ctni in all but two which measured hs-ctni 2 3 myocardial injury ie troponin levels exceeding the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit was observed with a prevalence ranging from a minimum 2 to a maximum 44 in two studies the prevalence of myocardial injury was compared between patients with severe conditions requiring icu and patients not-requiring icu finding a significantly higher prevalence of troponin elevation in icu patients in particular wang et al 4 in a population of 138 hospitalized patients for covid-19-associated pneumonia found that myocardial injury was present in 22 of icu vs 2 of non-icu patients p  0001 similarly huang c et al 5 in a cohort of 41 patients found a myocardial injury prevalence of 31 in icu vs 4 of non-icu patients p  0017 in three studies that reported data of icu patients only 6 7 prevalence of myocardial injury ranged between 14 and 44 while liu et al 2 in a cohort of 30 hospital infected workers most of them without a severe pneumonia showed a prevalence of myocardial injury of 167 such large difference in terms of troponin elevation may depend on the time of analysis as troponin levels tend to increase by time after at admission accordingly in patients needed icu treatment arentz et al 3 reported troponin elevation at admission in 14 of patients while the occurrence of cardiomyopathies was seen in a larger number 33 suggesting an even higher incidence of troponin elevation during the icu treatmentin icu patients myocardial injury may have an important impact on the prognosis of covid-19-associated pneumonia yang et al 6 found that mortality was 75 in patients with myocardial injury and 42 in patients without he xw et al 7 reported an in-hospital mortality significantly higher in patients with myocardial injury than in patients without 61 vs 26 respectively p  0013together these data indicate that myocardial injury is often detectable in sars-cov-2 patients with an impact much more evident according with disease severity thus the highest percentage of troponin elevation has been reported in patients needed icu treatment it is also of interest that patients with troponin elevation were at higher risk of mortality but this potentially relevant association is biased by small sample size and lack of confounders analysis finally the mechanisms accounting for myocardial injury in sars-cov-2 was not investigated and therefore it is still unclear angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that is localized in the heart vascular system and lung and is implicated in hypertension interestingly ace2 serves as functional receptor for sars-cov-2 that therefore triggers lung infection upon binding its spike protein to ace2 8 such interaction may lead to ace2 downregulation which is potentially deleterious for the heart as ace2 serves to degrade angiotensin ii to angiotensin 1-7 which counteract the angiotensins vasoconstrictive activity 8 thus ace2 down-regulation by sars-cov-2 may be a potential trigger for oxidative stress as impaired angiotensin ii degradation could lead to activation of nox2 which is among the most important enzymes generating reactive oxidant species ros 9fig 1 of note nox2 localizes in the heart and rises during the acute phase of cap 1 independently correlates with troponin elevation 1 and is associated with experimentally-induced heart failure furthermore nox2 independently correlates with heart failure that often complicates cap 1 10 so far nox2 has not been measured in sars-cov-2 patients its evaluation might be useful to investigate the mechanism of disease of myocardial injurythe study has limitation and implications the study focused only in the chinese population and included a small number of subjects however the myocardial injury is almost impressive and its impact with clinical outcomes should be studied prospectively due to the potentially already reported interplay between myocardial nox2 cell injury and heart failure fig 1 targeting nox2 may be an approach to limit myocardial injury in patients affected by sars-cov-2 so far however there are not drugs in the market which inhibits nox2 an alternative possibility is the interruption of the vicious circle nox2 activation -ros-nox2 activation which perpetuates oxidative stress fig 1 in this context a simple and cheap approach may be provided by intravenous infusion of vitamin c that behaves as an antioxidant in vivo only at millimolar concentrations intravenous infusion of 1 g ascorbic acid resulted in an antioxidant effect that ultimately down-regulate nox2 activation without eliciting any side effect 11 of note another drug commonly used for arthritis ie tocilizumab and now under investigation in sars-cov-2 patients behaves also as an antioxidant and may interrupt the vicious circle nox2-ros-nox2in conclusion the data so far reported indicate that patients with sars-cov-2 display signs of myocardial injury which is more evident in patients with severe disease prospective study is needed to assess the impact of myocardial injury on clinical outcomes nox2 down-regulation may be an option to limit myocardial injury by sars-cov-2after the first cases of respiratory illness were reported in december 2019 a novel coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified to cause the so-called coronavirus disease covid-19 which meanwhile has become a worldwide pandemic 1 2 in general three distinct phases characterize progression of covid-19 an initial infection phase followed by a respiratory distress phase and finally culminating in a severe hyperinflammation state with more than 80 of sars-cov-2 infections showing only mild or even absent symptoms 3 the characteristics from the covid-19 outbreak reported from china 3 provided important lessons with respect to cardiovascular involvements both as a primary target as well as a comorbidity the infection phase marks virus infiltration and proliferation of the epithelium and lung parenchyma accompanied by mild symptoms and monocyte  macrophage activation as the initial immune response the ensuing inflammatory processes like vasodilation endothelial leakiness and leukocyte extravasation lead to pulmonary distress with pulmonary damage fluid extravasation and hypoxemia which in turn augments cardiovascular stress finally further amplification of the host inflammatory response will essentially culminate in systemic inflammation up to eliciting a cytokine storm 4importantly the cardiovascular system emerges as both a primary target as well as the most important secondary co-morbidity factor during all three of the covid-19 progression phases fig 1 there is accumulating evidence that the heart itself might be a direct target for viral infection with sars-cov-2 5 previous studies examining the cardiovascular effects of viral respiratory infections during influenza epidemics revealed a profound up to sixfold increased incidence ratio for acute myocardial infarction within 7 days of infection in part due to the heightened prothrombotic activity leading to intracoronary thrombotic events 6 hypotension and tachycardia will further imbalance the metabolic demand of a diseased heart exaggerated systemic inflammation with profoundly increased circulating levels of prototypical inflammatory markers such as il-6 il-2 tnfalpha mcp-1 or crp are well established to contribute to cardiac injury irrespective of the presence of hypoxemia indeed some of these biomarkers were shown to be associated with high mortality in retrospective clinical series of covid-19 patients hospitalized in china 7 indicating potential serious bystander effects on other organs including the heart in support of such collateral damage to the heart increased inflammatory markers do correlate with electrocardiographic abnormalities and biomarkers of cardiac injury 8 finally elevation of cardiac biomarkers documenting cardiac involvement is not only a prominent feature in covid-19 but is also associated with a profoundly worse clinical outcome 9 10 myocardial damage and heart failure contributed to almost 40 of deaths in a critically ill cohort hospitalized in wuhan 11 cox regression analyses revealed that the mortality risk associated with acute cardiac damage was significantly higher than age chronic pulmonary disease or prior history of cardiovascular disease 8 9 thus both direct and indirect mechanisms of cardiovascular injury most likely play a pivotal role for the deleterious consequences of sars-cov-2 infection in addition to the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ardslast patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with sars-cov-2 are more likely to develop severe symptoms if infected with sars-cov-2 and may also be more vulnerable to adverse cardiotoxic effects of treatment with antiviral drugs a most recent analysis from the leoss registry 12 displaying the prevalence of co-morbidities in covid-19 patients in germany disclosed that in all classes of disease severity more than 50 of the patients suffered from cardiovascular co-morbidity which was by far the most prominent co-morbidity associated with covid-19 fig 2taken together cardiovascular involvement is both highly prevalent and of significant prognostic importance in covid-19 therefore it is not only important to fully involve cardiologists for managing cardiovascular complications in severe cases of covid-19 but also to pay particular attention to cardiovascular protection of patients at risk to develop covid-19 it will be essential to allocate sufficient resources for cardiovascular diagnostic and therapeutic procedures even at times when the health care systems are globally overwhelmed and hospitals are guided by measures to contain and treat this infectious disease we need to advice patients that cardiovascular emergencies like stemi decompensated heart failure or life-threatening arrhythmias need immediate attention and treatment and emergency calls should not be delayed out of fear for being admitted to a hospital with the potential to acquire covid-19 we do need to set-up emergency treatment strategies for non-covid-19 patients in-hospital and assure protection of these patients from sars-cov-2-infected patients additionally we need to make sure to that hospital staff and health care workers in general are adequately protected and diagnostic and interventional procedures in covid-19 patients are guided by clinical necessity fortunately all major cardiovascular professional societies are meanwhile in the process of publishing guidance for various aspects of cardiovascular care in covid-19 patients including how and in whom to perform diagnostic and therapeutic interventions some of these guidance publications will be referenced to in the following chapters of this article this will without any doubt lead to greater awareness of the immediate cardiovascular implications of this infectious diseasenevertheless we should not stop here hospitalization for pneumonia was previously shown to be associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease up to 10 years of follow-up 13 it is very likely that sars-cov-2 infections with respiratory impairment will also lead to similar long-term adverse events we need to monitor covid-19 patients with acutely elevated markers of cardiac damage with respect to long-term consequences on cardiac function including definite proof of sars-cov-2-induced myocarditis by myocardial biopsy likewise it will be important to assess potential long-term cardiotoxic effects of antiviral therapy thus cardiovascular care during the covid-19 pandemic should already implement strategies to capture longer-term implications by prolonged clinical follow-upcovid-19 has spread to almost all countries of the world unexplained is the different impact of the disease in different countries there has been a slow increase in infections in africa and south-east asia with a surprisingly low fatality rate 14th april 2020 south africa had 2272 infections with 27 deaths despite a detailed surveillance system wwwcoronavirusjhuedu accessed 14th april 2020 it is currently unknown why there has been so far a slower than expected rise in cases and case mortality in low-to-middle income countries the population demographics and underlying co-morbidities are vastly different in those countries the mean age of many low-to-middle income countries is more than 2 decades lower than in higher income countries for example in uganda the life expectancy at birth for males and females is 60 and 65 years wwwwhoorg 485 of the population is in the age range of 014 years old with just 2 of the population being older than 60 years this age pyramid influences the current uganda cardiovascular health challenges which does include hypertension and coronary artery disease mainly in urban areas but rheumatic heart disease rhd and heart failure due to cardiomyopathies remain enormous challenges most of the patients do not have access to balloon valvotomy or surgery 14 untreated symptomatic patients with rheumatic heart disease have a mortality rate of 20 per annum leaving very few patients being able to live beyond their 40 years of age 15 however there are other factors which might have an impact the country-by-country difference in covid-19 morbidity and mortality could possibly be explained by national policies on bacillus calmette guerin bcg vaccination bcg is a live attenuated strain derived from an isolate of myocobacterium bovis used widely across the world as a vaccine for tuberculosis with many low-to-middle income countries but also some high-income countries such as japan having a universal bcg vaccination policy in newborns bcg vaccinations have been shown to produce non-specific immune effects leading to an improved response against other non-myocardial pathogens another possible protective mechanism could be the high number of people living with hivaids on anti-retroviral therapy south africa has a population of 57 million with  12 being hiv-infected sa has the worlds largest antiretroviral therapy art program subsidized by the government and provided free-of-charge only time will tell if low-to middle income countries will catch up on the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 or remain relatively spared 16the world heart federation has published a briefing on prevention coronavirus disease 2019 in low-income countries 17 this includes six easy rules to reduce the risk of corona virus transmission from staying at home and avoiding large gathering to a total shut down of a country had so far the biggest impact in a lower number of infections and early case detectionthe reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas regulates blood pressure and is also involved in cardiovascular endorgan damage like myocardial hypertrophy interstitial myocardial fibrosis atherosclerosis and plaque rupture in acute coronary syndromes therefore blockers of the raas are recommended for the use in hypertension to prevent cardiovascular events and heart failure 18 19 the protease renin cleaves angiotensin to angiotensinogen i ang 110 which then is processed to angiotensin ii ang 18 by the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 20 angiotensin ii stimulates at1-receptors which results in adverse cardiovascular effects like vasoconstriction cell proliferation and hypertrophy 21 in contrast the at2-receptor mediates vasodilation anti-proliferative actions and apoptosis and has been suggested to be involved in anti-proliferative effects upon binding of angiotensin ii 22 angiotensin ii 18 is cleaved by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 into angiotensin 17 23 which exerts directly a stimulation of the so called mas-receptor mediating vasodilation anti-proliferative effects and anti-inflammatory responses 24 it is now well established that the corona virus family binds via its spike protein to ace2 25 26 with well characterized binding residues 27 after proteolytic modification of ace2 28 and the coronavirus spike protein 11 12 by a membrane-bound proteinase adam17 the virus is internalized by clathrin-coated pits and after trypsin cleavage viral rna is released into this cellular cytoplasm causing sars infection 28 29 ace2 is degraded and shedfrom the cell membrane into the circulation after cleavage by adam17 28 30 as a result there is a downregulation of ace2 by the corona virus itself 31 the role of ace2 in corona virus infection is scrutinized by the fact that several animals cannot be infected by the corona virus when there is a knockout of ace2 which renders them resistant to infection 32 the role of ace2 is not specific for the corona virus as ace2 is also used by the respiratory syncytial rs virus and some types of influenza viruses 33 34ace2 can also be regulated in several cardio-pulmonary disease conditions like copd pulmonary hypertension asthma and after viral infections with influenza h1n1 h5n1 h7n9 as well as in sepsis 35 ace2 potentially by degrading maladaptive angiotensin ii and stimulating anti-inflammatory responses through the mas receptor 24 has been shown to improve lung injury after viral infections of clinical injuries 36 furthermore ards is not prominent after rs virus infections when the ace2 is knocked out 33 in addition recombinant human ace2 has been tested in a pilot study in human ards and has been shown to reduce circulating interleukin-6 concentrations accompanied by increases of ang 17 and reductions of angiotensin ii 37 therefore ace2 might be crucial for the entry of corona viruses into the cells and hence infectivity 2530 however it might also mediate beneficial effects on pulmonary complications after infection 36 37 the fact that the major risk factor for adverse outcomes in covid-19 is age and ace2 is downregulated in the aging population argues in favor of its role in poor outcome of that risk group 35 furthermore drugs like chloroquine and indometazine 35 as well as ace inhibitors and arbs 3840 have been shown to upregulate ace2 in the human heart and in the systemic as well as pulmonary vasculature 40 with association to outcomes in heart failure 41 atrial fibrillation 42 and pulmonary hypertension 43 these findings highlight the complex interaction of covid-19 and ace2 inhibition we would thus raise the hypothesis that pathophysiological conditions or drugs enhancing ace2 expression might lead to greater infectivity but at the same time potentially reduce mortality due to lung complications fig 3arterial hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor in cardiovascular disease in particular in china 44 in several early trials of covid-19 populations hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factor and comorbidity is amounting to approximately 3040 in the overall population of diseased individuals in china 7 45 46 and italy 47 in those patients who have complications or even died hypertension is more prevalent as was diabetes coronary artery disease chronic obstructive lung disease or malignancies 9 as hypertension is the comorbidity with the highest prevalence in deceased patients it has been claimed to be a risk factor for covid-19 however this would only be the case if there is a deviation from the overall prevalence of hypertension in the chinese population in china the prevalence of hypertension is high by comparing chinese populations age-matched to those in reports on covid-19 approximately 5574 years it becomes clear that the overall prevalence in hypertension is 44 with a further increase in populations at higher age 48 therefore the prevalence of the comorbidity hypertension in covid-19 patients is lower and does not exceed the overall prevalence in the relevant populations in china therefore there is no evidence that hypertension increases the likelihood to suffer from covid-19 cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities are elevated in patients who have fatal outcomes after covid-19 9 therefore all cardiovascular comorbidities in concert add to myocardial injury which has been shown to be closely associated with death as measured from cardiac troponin levels 9the next question arises of whether cardiac treatments and treatments with the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors rasi in particular ace-inhibitors ace-i or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs are associated with a differential outcome in covid-19 the guidelines for the management of hypertension of the european society of cardiology 18 but also chinese guidelines 49 and guidelines of the american college of cardiology acc and american heart association aha 19 recommend ace and arbs for the treatment of hypertension as these drugs have been shown to be effective in secondary prevention heart failure and protection against adverse renal outcomes in germany as in other countries in europe the prescription rate of ace and arbs are higher than all prescribed daily doses of other anti-hypertensive drugs combined 50 however adequate blood pressure control in china in the age group where covid-19 is most prevalent was only 349356 51 according to the 2010 chinese guidelines 49 and 152160 according to the 2017 accaha guidelines 19 in particular the frequency of ace-inhibitor treatment is particularly low in an asian population in particular in females because the ace-induced coughing is more prevalent than in other populations 51 therefore the low density of treatment with rasi does not argue in favor of a significant role of these drugs in the likelihood of covid-19 the upregulation of ace2 by rasi does not allow to argue in favor or against the use of ras-inhibitors in hypertension as recently expressed in various short communications and letters causing a lot of discussion and media attention 5258 although a large body of evidence has been generated in cell models animal models and observational studies further data are necessary to scrutinize the definite role of ace2 in infection frequency and causation of pulmonary complications after corona infections at this moment there is thus no compelling evidentiary background to change rasi therapy for hypertension or other cardiovascular conditionsbased on findings from corona and influenza infections in the past it has been speculated that acute myocardial injury might be triggered or facilitated in covid-19 infection 59 66 a previous study on the incidence of myocardial infarction after the outbreak of influenza infections in ontario reported a sixfold higher incidence ratio of ami within 6 days after a positive influenza test as compared to a negative test during the same time frame 66 it was hypothesized that an exaggerated inflammatory response mediated by viral infection with influenza a or b respiratory syncytial virus rsv or other virus had the potential to trigger acute plaque rupture in addition anecdotal evidence from sporadic case reports raised the suspicion of acute myocarditis although a direct sars-cov-2 infiltration of the heart has not been confirmed in the absence of histological confirmation by endocardial biopsy or by detection of viral genome in myocardial tissue yet 67 previously a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction lv-ef and a highly prevalent reversible subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment that was reported in acute sars-cov-2 infection and was attributed to the cytokine storm syndrome that is characterized by an uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response 68 finally cardiotoxic effects of antiviral therapies have been reported 69acute myocardial injury may occur independently from covid-19 and may manifest as type 1 myocardial infarction stemi or nstemi type 2 mi in the absence of plaque rupture or intracoronary thrombus or as an acute myocardial injury independent of myocardial ischemia fig 4 cases of acute mi on autopsy during hospitalization for covid-19 have been reported 7 but a systematic evaluation is lacking given the paucity of data on the exact prevalence and reasons for an acute myocardial injury during covid-19 our interpretation of hs-ctn elevations has to be discussed on knowledge previously derived from other acute critical conditions foremost severe infections causing sepsis or septic shock 70 in an investigation on hs-ctnt in setting of severe infection median concentrations of hs-ctnt were found to increase from 144 ngl in sepsis to 526 ngl in severe sepsis and 641 ngl in septic shock 70 likewise the prevalence of hs-ctnt  uln increased from 516 in sepsis to 804  in septic shock 70 very similar to covid-19 mild elevations of hs-ctnt were associated with a high mortality rate at 30 days 71 however the risk associated with myocardial injury at baseline persisted over 5 years after the index event suggesting a major prognostic role of pre-existing structural heart disease on long-term outcomes similar to sars-cov-2 infection an impairment of right and left ventricular function on echocardiography was common during other severe infections and there was a clear association between myocardial injury cardiac overload or hemodynamic stress as indicated by natriuretic peptides and inflammatory response 72 significant elevations of hs-ctn have been demonstrated following rapid atrial pacing irrespective the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia 73 in an experimental human model that utilized the trans-cardiac production of lactate for objective evidence of myocardial ischemia hs-ctnt increased in the absence of cad and lactate suggesting that tachycardia itself is capable to induce an acute myocardial injury likewise administration of catecholamines was found to release hs-ctnt in healthy volunteers 74 other mechanisms that have been related to the release of ctn include respiratory failure due to severe hypoxemia sepsis acute kidney failure hypertension or hypotension bradycardia fever anemia and many other causes 61 63acute mi with or without covid-19 represents a life-threatening condition that requires adjunctive medical therapies such as potent antiplatelet drugs and monitoring to anticipate complications however the enhanced infectious potency in humans 75 mandates a fundamental risk assessment to carefully weigh the relative advantages against disadvantages of treating cardiovascular disease while preventing the risk of sars-cov-2 transmissionin patients with suspected acs without st-segment elevation or in the absence of hemodynamic or rhythm instability and when covid-19 cannot be ruled-out due to suspicious clinical presentation the personal recommendation of the author is to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay and if available to perform a ct lung scan while waiting for the pcr result covid-19-associated pneumonia provides a typical picture that is characterized by bilateral lung infiltrates glass ground opacities consolidation reticular pattern and the so-called crazy paving pattern 10 60 the sensitivity of ct is reported as high as 9799 and is superior that of rt-pcr 76 the ct scan could ideally be performed as a multi-detector ct angiography providing additional information on coronary anatomy and on the presence of pulmonary embolism since elevations of d-dimer are not uncommon 7 60 and values exceeding the twosixfold of the uln are associated with high mortality 45 60 76 77regarding the measurement of cardiac biomarkers the american college of cardiology acc has released statements against the liberal use of troponin in covid-19 78 given the frequency and non-specific nature of abnormal troponin results among patients with covid-19 clinicians are advised to measure cardiac troponin only if acute myocardial infarction is suspected on clinical grounds 78 the european society of cardiology esc expands these recommendations by restricting the measurement of cardiac troponin ti concentrations to patients with suspected type 1 mi because this infarct type is more likely to benefit from adjunctive antiplatelet therapies and early revascularization therapies personal communication paper under revisionmoreover in order to reduce the length of stay in an ed and to dedicate monitoring capacities for other critically diseased patients accelerated rapid rule-out andor rule-in of mi seem to be particularly helpful 79 real world evidence suggests that patient disposition may be completed within 23 h without an increase of adverse outcomes compared to standard protocols 80 81 use of echocardiography or coronary angiography should be restricted to those patients in whom these procedures would be expected to meaningfully affect outcomes 78 timing of invasive coronary angiography depends on individual estimation of anticipated risk of death heart failure or other infarct-related complications factors that are supposed to favor an immediate or early coronary angiography under full protection of medical staff include stemi high risk non-st segment elevation mi as suggested by either unstable hemodynamics dynamic st segment changes rhythm instability or a very high clinical score as recommended in 2015 esc guidelines 79 cardiac troponin values should be interpreted as continuous variables since risk of death and benefits from an early invasive strategy incline with increasing values 82 83 it is unclear whether the benefit of revascularization outweighs the potential disadvantages of contamination of medical staff in patients with small-to-intermediate elevations of hs-ctn or whether a yet unsettled more refined risk stratification is required to identify those patients who are likely to benefit most 83 hence patients with nstemi at lower risk should be managed according to local expertise and capability to deliver echocardiography and invasive procedures effectively to the patient without exposing the medical staff to an increased risk of contamination 8487it has long been known that patients with chronic heart failure chf are at increased risk for adverse consequences of seasonal influenza 88 and other causes of pneumonia 89 conversely infections and in particular pneumonia are frequent triggers of heart failure exacerbations 90 of note influenza vaccination decreases mortality in chf patients and the beneficial effects of repetitive influenza vaccinations may even exceed those of guideline-directed pharmacotherapy 91 severe coronavirus infections such as with sars-cov-2 have been shown to result in a more severe course of disease in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease including heart failure 92 thus it is not surprising that covid-19 is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities 7 93 yet likely due to the lower prevalence of known chf in china there is still limited specific information on patients with preexisting heart failure nevertheless some early reports 9 indicate that covid-19 associated myocardial injury s below is more frequent in patients with heart failure and other cardiovascular comorbiditiesan obvious reason for an elevated troponin level could be acute coronary syndrome that obviously may also occur in covid-19 patients and which is likely to be underdiagnosed due to reluctance for invasive management s above however the high proportion of typically rather moderately increased high sensitive troponin levels in hospitalized covid-19 patients renders other explanations more likely including acute myocarditis due to sars-cov-2 or myocardial damage due to proinflammatory cytokines cytokine storm ace2 as a potential receptor for coronavirus infection s above is highly expressed in cardiomyocytes and in vascular pericytes 94 thus it seems plausible that sars-cov-2 may directly cause viral myocarditis with associated cell death and subsequent myocardial injury as measured by increased troponin levels indeed the first still anecdotal autopsy and endomyocardial biopsy reports describe evidence for an acute lymphocytic myocarditis 95 96 however the sars-cov-2 genome could not be detected in the myocardium of several of these early cases indicating that other mechanisms of myocardial injury must be involved at least in a subset of patients with myocardial injuryanother attractive hypothesis how myocardial injury in the context of covid-19 may be explained is a hyperinflammatory state where dysregulated cytokines mediate cardiomyocyte stress and ultimately cell death such a cytokine storm is a well-known 97 while underappreciated syndrome complicating sepsis in up to 4 of cases 98 its clinical characteristics include multiorgan failure associated with persistent fever and lymphopenia as well as high levels of ferritin and several cytokines such as interleukin-6 for example elevated interleukin-6 il-6 levels closely correlate with mortality in sepsis and il-6 has been shown to directly impair contractile function of cardiomyocytes 99 similarly lymphopenia and excessively elevated ferritin and interleukin-6 levels have been demonstrated in severe cases of covid-19 which also revealed myocardial injury with increased high sensitive troponinmultiple clinical trials are underway which test antiviral agents potentially effective against sars-cov-2 such as remdesivir and several antivirals previously shown to be effective eg in hiv infections reviewed in 100 as myocardial injury is associated with a dramatically worsened outcome in covid-19 the question arises whether therapy should also be specifically aimed at the prevention of myocardial damage andor hyperinflammation indeed the limited experience with inhibition of the cytokine storm by immunosuppression points towards this possibility for example interleukin-1 blockade by anakinra has been shown to reduce mortality in sepsis with hyperinflammation 101 similarly tocilizumab an interleukin-6 receptor blocking antibody shows early promise in covid-19 in a non-randomized trial involving 20 patients crp levels and oxygen levels were almost normalized within a few days 102 other promising targets include jak inhibitors such as baricitinib 103 immunoglobulins or fingolimod finally it has even been proposed that angiotensin receptors blockers eg losartan may not only be not harmful s above in covid-19 but in fact beneficial as they upregulate ace2 which could ameriolate tissue damage due to sars-cov-2 104 data on removal of cytokines by adsorbent polymer beads cytosorb are sparsecoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a pandemic after an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus occurred in wuhan china meanwhile it has spread throughout the world and is associated with mortality rates between 1 to about 5 cardiovascular disease is an important risk indicator for adverse outcomes and covid-19 might affect the cardiovascular system directly angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 has been shown to be a coreceptor for viral entry downregulating ace2 with cardiovascular consequences cardiovascular disease with dyspnea as a prime symptom like in heart failure myocardial ischemia or hypertensive emergency is an important differential diagnosis should not be ignored in covid-19 and needs to be recognized as an important indicator of poor outcome while there is no evidence for changing cardiovascular therapy a complete cardiovascular workup is necessary in covid-19 patients and in particular in patients with cardio-respiratory symptoms and even in acute respiratory distress syndrome in turn cardiopulmonary symptoms should not distract physicians from an unbiased work-up of cardiovascular conditions as these patients could suffer from life-threatening cardiovascular conditions in the absence of covid-19 healthcare providers in high middle and low income countries need to be aware of the importance of cardiovascular disease in patients with sars and covid-19 infections by providing optimal cardiovascular care

coronavirus disease of 2019 covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 and was first reported in wuhan china in december of 2019 1 initial presentations from wuhan were consistent with viral pneumonia and subsequent deep sequencing confirmed a novel rna-based virus of the coronaviridae family as of june 1 2020 there are 62 million confirmed worldwide cases of covid-19 with over 375000 deaths 2 covid-19 has become a worldwide pandemic and has mobilized healthcare workers in all disciplinessince the initial presentation of covid-19 much has been learned about the pathophysiology and specific cardiovascular manifestations of the disease early in the pandemic there was evidence that those with preexisting cardiovascular conditions were over-represented in cases of severe infection 3 since that time it has become clear that certain racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by covid-19 4 additionally covid-19 appears to have several unique cardiovascular manifestations that cardiologists must understand including worsening of heart failure myocarditis a proclivity for thrombosis and arrythmia finally the speed at which clinical trials for covid-19 are being conducted using both repurposed and new therapies means that cardiologists must be aware of potential cardiovascular side effects for agents that are not commonly used in cardiovascular practice
this article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authorssars-cov-2 is a novel rna coronavirus that has emerged as the causative infection responsible for the current covid-19 pandemic other viruses from the coronavirus family include the mers-cov virus responsible for the middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreak and the sars-cov virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak 58 initial infection with sars-cov-2 is a process that is still being understood but is known to involve viral s proteins and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss sars-cov-2 expresses numerous spike s proteins on the surface of the viral envelope which facilitates viral entry into the host cell tmprss a serine protease expressed on the host cell primes the viral s proteins to enable interaction with the host ace2 receptor 9 the primed s protein then binds the s1 subunit of the host ace2 receptor allowing for viral entry into the cell 10 the role of the ace2 receptor in human physiology remains under investigation but it is believed to provide counter regulation to the reninangiotensin system 11 12 the ace2 receptor is commonly found in the lungs in type 2 alveolar cells but is also expressed in vascular endothelium gut epithelium and in the proximal tubule in the kidneys 1315 the location of the ace2 receptor is implicated in a multitude of disease presentations associated with sars-cov-2 infection after binding the ace2 receptor the virus is internalized and the viral rna is released immediately the rna-dependent rna polymerase is translated which allows for viral replication and spread of the infection the role of the ace2 receptor expression and blockade within both sars-cov-2 infection and disease severity remains controversial with both protective and deleterious effects hypothesizedthe united states has surpassed other countries worldwide in case numbers with over 18 million cases as of june 1 2020 16 the epicenter has spread from china to many european countries and now the usa with significant clusters around the country the number of covid-19-related deaths worldwide has now climbed past 375000 due to the heterogeneity of testing strategies and case ascertainment mortality rates remain controversial with estimates ranging from 07 to 108
covid-19 has a broad spectrum of severity and phenotypic presentation the most typical presentation involves consequences of direct respiratory infection ranging from cough and dyspnea to hypoxia to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards the initial cohort study of covid-19 patients included data from 552 hospitals in china with 1099 patients with covid-19 disease 17 the study reported that the most common symptoms at presentation were cough 678 fatigue 381 and temperature  375 c 438 in the largest published cases series of sequential covid-19 cases from the united states in new york city of the 5700 patients admitted to 12 different hospitals 30 of patients presented with an initial fever and 20 presented with hypoxia 18 tachypnea was present in 173 and tachycardia in 431 mechanical ventilation was required in 122 of patients and early mortality was seen in 245 with 32 of patients surviving to discharge and 722 remaining in the hospital thus sars-cov-2 infection most commonly causes respiratory illness with a wide range of severity and outcomes that is relatively consistent in presentation cough dyspnea fever and hypoxia across the globethe preexisting burden of comorbid chronic disease is well recognized to contribute to the severity of sars-cov-2 infection and there are concerns that underlying comorbid illnesses play a role in the diverse spectrum of phenotypic presentation the initial study of 41 patients in wuhan china demonstrated a predominance of male patients 73 with pre-existing comorbidities including diabetes 20 hypertension 15 and cardiovascular disease 15 1 the median age of patients in this group was 49 years old only 7 of these initial patients had a history of tobacco use however since these initial studies a number of prospective and retrospective studies out of china have demonstrated higher rates of underlying comorbid conditions common underlying comorbidities include hypertension 3032 diabetes 1028 and cardiovascular and coronary artery diseases 1115 1921 smoking history or obstructive lung disease diagnoses were low when documented 210 in these studies these comorbidities were associated with worse severity of illness and mortality a review of 44672 confirmed covid-19 cases from wuhan china demonstrated increased mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease 105 diabetes 73 and hypertension 6 which was significantly higher than the overall case-fatality rate of 23 22in the united states there are similarities and notable differences from the european and chinese experience among 1482 patients admitted with covid-19 544 were men and 745 were over the age of 50 years with the majority 172 being over 85 years old 23 comorbidities included hypertension 497 obesity 483 diabetes mellitus 283 chronic lung disease 346 cardiovascular disease including coronary disease and heart failure 278 and less frequently renal disease 131 and immunocompromised conditions 96 these initial cases series have shown a similar relationship between underlying cardiac comorbidities with a higher prevalence of hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease and obesity in patients requiring mechanical ventilation 24a concerning trend is the alarming rate at which black and hispaniclatino americans are being infected and dying from covid-19 25 there were early data from cities and states across the country indicating higher mortality from covid19 in black and hispaniclatino populations these included milwaukee wi experiencing a 73 mortality rate in black patients who make up 26 of the population chicago il 67 of the mortality with 32 of the population and the states of louisiana 70 of the mortality with 32 of the population and michigan 41 of the mortality with 14 of the population in the covid-net catchment population of the usa a higher percentage of black patients were infected 33 compared to the percentage of overall population being black 18 23 this trend has been repeated across the country and has brought into stark reality the devastating impact covid-19 has had on communities of color 26 while it is well known that black and hispaniclatino patients have a higher incidence of diabetes and hypertension this alone does not explain the increased infected and mortality rates studies during prior epidemics have continued to demonstrate similar healthcare disparities on smaller scales likely related to multiple factors including access to care racial and ethnical stigmas among medical professionals crowded living conditions income instability and continued rates of exposure and protection 2730 it is crucial to acknowledge the institutionalized barriers to health as a first step to incite change and narrow the outcome gap and improve healthcare for marginalized individualsde novo cardiac injury has also been described in patients presenting with covid-19 disease initial studies provide insight into the prevalence and incidence of acute cardiac injury patients presenting with covid-19 early studies reported a prevalence of acute cardiac injury of 12 in the entire cohort as defined by either high sensitivity troponin hs tn or the mb fraction of creatinine kinase ck-mb  99th percentile or new echocardiographic or electrocardiographic abnormalities with greater elevations in cardiac biomarkers among patients requiring icu care 1 20 a meta-analysis further clarified the prevalence of acute cardiac injury among chinese patients presenting with covid-19 disease reporting a similar prevalence of acute cardiac injury defined as ck-mb or hs tn exceeding the 99th percentile 31 case cohort studies included data in patients for whom the outcome and illness course helped further elucidate the role of cardiac injury in covid-19 disease zhou et al showed that the initial hs tn was not dramatically elevated at illness onset but that in non-survivors there was a rapid rise starting after day 10 that was not seen in survivors 3 ruan et al reported the cause of death in the non-survivors with the majority 53 due to respiratory failure but a clinically significant number related to combined respiratorycardiac failure 33 and cardiac failure 7 32 based on these studies the authors hypothesize that myocardial injury occurs frequently in patients with severe covid disease and that myocardial dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of severe disease as the pandemic progressed and patient outcomes were defined investigators sought to evaluate the association of myocardial injury with mortality in a multivariable cox regression acute cardiac injury at any point during hospital stay was associated with an increased risk of mortality hr 426 95 confidence interval 192949 guo et al examined the association of cardiac comorbidities and acute cardiac injury as defined by hs tn above the 99th percentile with mortality in a retrospective cohort of 187 patients 19 in this cohort 28 of patients had acute cardiac injury the proportion of non-survivors was increased in the groups with underlying cardiac comorbidities hypertension coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy or myocardial injury and highest in groups with both the authors did not assess measures of association beyond descriptive statistics thus myocardial injury occurs not infrequently with covid-19 disease and that the presence of myocardial injury portends both more severe disease and higher mortalitythe mechanism of this acute cardiac injury remains elusive data from zhou et al and guo et al have shown that the rise in troponin typically occurs late in the disease process typically occurring 1014 days after the onset of symptoms and coincides with progressive respiratory decline and multiorgan failure 3 19 this would suggest that myocardial injury may be a marker for more severe infection and not causally associated however there are few reports of systematic cardiac testing of patients with covid-19 disease and cardiac injury limited our ability to understand causal associations a number of mechanisms have been proposed including direct myocardial injury and myocarditis systemic hyperinflammatory response leading to cytokine storm and myocardial injury microvascular thromboses acute plaque rupture physiology stress cardiomyopathy and extreme oxygen supplydemand mismatch due to critical illness 33 34 the relative mystery surrounding the pathophysiology of acute cardiac injury has resulted in conflicting recommendations regarding the use of troponin to screen and evaluate cardiac dysfunction in patients with covid-19 disease a communication by the american college of cardiology acc recommended against routine cardiac biomarker testing in patients presenting with covid-19 disease 35 subsequent review papers have advocated for systematic use of high-sensitivity troponin as a biomarker of severe illness with proven prognostic value in covid-19 disease 34 36 however this risk prediction strategy has not yet been evaluated prospectivelysars-cov2 has been implicated in cases of myocarditis and acute decompensated heart failure initial reports of myocarditis from china described cases of cardiogenic shock and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction among covid-19 patients 37 38 these patients had extremely elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers namely troponin ck-mb and bnp and required inotropy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo to maintain adequate cardiac output based on the clinical presentation and on these elevations in biomarkers these cases were deemed fulminant myocarditis and were treated with a combination of steroids ivig antivirals antibiotics anti-inflammatory agents renal replacement and mechanical ventilationduring other outbreaks of similar coronaviruses in the last 20 years namely sars-cov and mers there was evidence to support direct myocardial involvement among patients who died from sars-cov in toronto canada viral rna was detected in 35 of samples and the presence of viral rna was associated with increased levels of interstitial fibrosis and macrophage activity within the myocardium thus potentially leading to a more rapid clinical course compared to patients without viral rna in the myocardium 39 however hemodynamically significant myocarditis appears to have been a relatively rare complication of sars with one case series noting only one instance of potential myocarditis requiring inotropy among 121 cases 40 myocarditis also appears to have been a potential complication during the mers outbreak with mri findings consistent with myocarditis reported 41there is now additional evidence that sars-cov2 has a similar effect on the myocardium as sars-cov and mers myocardial involvement has been confirmed in sars-cov-2-positive patients via mri and endomyocardial biopsy 4244 cardiac biopsy findings in covid-19 patients have shown inflammatory infiltration of the myocardium with t-lymphocyte and macrophages interstitial edema and in some cases evidence of cytoplasmic vacuoles indicating direct viral involvement of myocardial cells 43 44 in a post-mortem case series of 68 patients from china 7 of covid-19 patients died of circulatory failure with some degree of myocardial involvement as marked by elevations in troponin 32 however it is unclear if these cases can truly be classified as myocarditis given the lack of ejection fraction assessment via tte mri or biopsy from a different case series in seattle wa troponin elevation was seen in 15 of patients but none of the patients who underwent tte had evidence of a reduced ejection fraction 45 there is currently no standardized approach to treatment of covid-19 cardiomyopathy in cases of more severe fulminant myocarditis resulting in cardiogenic shock treatments with immunomodulating drugs namely steroids and ivig but also more specific agents like tocilizumab to inhibit il-6 are being used clinical trial data is as of yet lacking on the efficacy of such therapies in covid-19-related myocarditis and are being extrapolated from other causes of fulminant myocarditis namely giant cell subtypedecompensation of pre-existing heart failure appears to be a more common cardiovascular manifestation of sars-cov-2 infection than clinically significant myocarditis prior to the covid-19 pandemic influenza-like respiratory infections significantly increased the risk of hospitalization for decompensated heart failure and in high influenza activity months may contribute to 19 of heart failure hospitalizations across the united states 46 the relationship between respiratory infection and decompensated heart failure appears to also be true for covid-19-like seasonal influenza in two retrospective case series from china of 113 and 191 patients heart failure was observed in 49 and 52 of deaths respectively 3 47 there appears to be a broad spectrum of disease severity ranging from stable to fulminant heart failure requiring inotropes and potentially mechanical circulatory support for refractory shock and or hypoxia the use of ecmo in covid-19 cases is being studied in a prospective manner as part of the extracorporeal life support organization elso registry as of june 1 2020 ecmo has been used in 1135 covid-19-confirmed cases worldwide with 52 discharged alive and the vast majority of patients receiving veno-venous ecmo for respiratory support 48there is interest in the role of aceiarb in both the overall risk of covid-19 and the severity of lung disease with studies suggesting both the possibility of deleterious and beneficial effects 49 50 major guideline committees have continued to advocate for the use of acearb medications in hemodynamically stable heart failure patients hypertension and those with ischemic heart disease 51 52covid-19 has been hypothesized to increase the risk of acute coronary syndromes acs and systemic thrombosis this premise is based on prior experience with viral infections such as influenza which predisposes patients to developing acs and may increase the risk of myocardial infarction mi by at least sixfold in the week following infection 53 this increase in mi incidence is also seen following infection with other respiratory infections such as respiratory syncytial virus and for non-viral respiratory illnesses such as bacterial pneumonia many mis due to covid-19 disease are likely related to supplydemand mismatch from hypoxia resulting in myocardial injury and troponin release however mi from acute atherothrombotic events were first reported in wuhan china soon after the onset of the pandemic as such chinese hospitals soon developed treatment algorithms aimed at providing urgent reperfusion to covid-19-suspected patients while maintaining the safety of catheterization lab staff in the setting of st-elevation mi stemi and suspected sars-cov-2 infection thrombolytics were often the first choice for acute reperfusion therapy in china 54 following this early experience in china accscai released a joint recommendation outlining care for covid-19-suspected patients 55 this document highlights the need for adequate personal protective equipment for catheterization lab staff the need to differentiate true acs from supplydemand mismatch consideration of deferring invasive angiography in low-risk non-st elevation myocardial infarction nstemi patients until hospital resources improve and the potential use of thrombolytics for st segment elevation myocardial infarction stemi cases where the risks of exposing staff to sars-cov2 outweigh the benefits of a primary percutaneous coronary intervention pci-based approach however the authors still expect primary pci to remain the standard of care for patients with stemi and possible covid-19 and thrombolytics reserved for non-pci-capable hospitals 56further adding to the complexity of treating these patients st-segment elevations are seen in covid-19 patients who are then found to have non-obstructive coronary disease in a case series of 18 patients in new york ny who developed st-segment elevations nine patients underwent invasive angiography of these nine patients three had no obstructive coronary artery disease and 56 with obstructive disease underwent pci 1 after receiving thrombolytics 57 these cases of st-segment elevation with no obstructive coronary disease on angiography may be related to peri-myocarditis although the pathophysiology remains under investigation importantly the mortality among patients without no obstructive coronary lesion was higher 90 than among those with obstructive coronary lesions 50 although the absolute numbers were limited a similar incidence of obstructive to non-obstructive coronary lesions was reported in a population of italian patients with stemi 58 the high prevalence of stemi mimics in this population further emphasizes the need for angiography either invasive or non-invasive as opposed to empiric fibrinolytic therapy given the potential for harm when administering fibrinolytics for non-acs presentationswhile covid-19 may potentially increase the risk of acs activations for stemi in the united states have decreased significantly during the pandemic among nine high-volume centers in the us there was a 38 reduction in stemi activations compared to the 14-month period before the pandemic 59 this finding is similar to the 40 reduction in stemi activations seen in spain 60 it is unclear what is responsible for the significant reduction in stemi activations but it may be related to patients fear of exposure to sars-cov2 when presenting to the hospital in hong kong china patients who presented with stemi during the height of the outbreak presented to the hospital significantly longer after onset of symptoms compared to a year prior 318 vs 83 min 61 it is currently unknown how many people worldwide may not be seeking medical care for possible acs due to fear of covid-19 it is possible that due to delays in seeking appropriate medical care patients may eventually present to the hospital with heart failure cardiogenic shock or mechanical complications from acs studies must be performed to assess the impact covid-19 could have on cardiovascular mortality through such indirect mechanismssars-cov2 infection is theorized to predispose to a hypercoagulable state through inflammation immune dysregulation and activation of cytokines this process has been implicated in acs but also in cases of thrombosis outside the coronary arteries among 184 icu patients in the netherlands 31 were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism deep-vein thrombosis ischemic stroke myocardial infarction or systemic embolismall while receiving standard prophylactic doses of anticoagulation as recommended by the who 62 remarkably none of the patients in this study developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy dic a known risk factor for the development of arterial and venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients d-dimer levels above 1500 ngml had a sensitivity of 85 and specificity of 89 for detecting venous thromboembolism in a cohort from china 63 some centers have advocated for the use of treatment dose anticoagulation for select patients with covid-19 and elevated d-dimer levels however this practice has yet to be well validatedamong 187 patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 in wuhan china arrhythmia occurred in 59 of all patients admitted 19 elevated troponin t was a statistically significant prognostic marker with 82 having either ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation it is unclear whether elevated troponin preceded or succeeded the arrhythmic events furthermore among 138 patients admitted to a single hospital in wuhan china arrhythmia type not specified was reported in 17 with the majority 44 occurring in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit 20 among patients who suffered a cardiac arrest the predominant rhythm was asystolepulseless electrical activity 94 followed by shockable ventricular tachycardiafibrillation 6 64 similar rates in the new york city population were reported by goyal et al arrhythmia was seen in 74 of the entire cohort with higher rates in the patients receiving icu care 185 as compared to non-icu care 18 24 arrhythmias may be induced by the presence of acidosis and metabolic disturbances as seen in critical illness with multiorgan dysfunction or catecholaminergic pressor infusion for hypotension and shock finally qt-prolonging agents given to some covid-19 patients may increase the susceptibility to arrhythmia as discussed below 65 66 unfortunately with the limited data available no trends have been apparent as of yet 67 68there is suspicion that the aggressive nature of the coronavirus pneumonia is related to an exaggerated immune response mediated by interferon and interleukins as has been seen in prior coronavirus infections 69 70 targets for covid-19 therapies are therefore not only focused on the intrinsic viral make up including proteins such as ace-2 cell surface receptor 3-chymotrypsin-like protease spike rna-dependent rna polymerase and papain-like protease but also the human immune system 71 there are currently over 350 active clinical trials searching for treatment options for covid-19 both in novel therapies as well as repurposed existing therapies which has the benefit of having a known safety profile the following table summarizes a selection of these drugs their mechanisms known and proposed cardiotoxicities and ongoing clinical trials table 1the ongoing covid-19 pandemic poses an enormous threat globally given the high prevalence of existing cardiovascular disease worldwide it is not surprising that cardiovascular comorbidities significantly impact disease severity the unique properties of the sars-cov-2 infection and pathophysiology further raise concern for de novo cardiac injury with covid-19 the cardiovascular presentations of covid-19 are still being elucidated but appear to at least include decompensated heart failure myocarditis acs arrhythmia and thrombosis the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on cardiovascular systems of care and whether patients are delaying necessary treatment will be of great importance to understand as the pandemic progresses in the months and years to come lastly emerging therapeutic approaches have expected and unexpected cardiac effects that must be monitored as treatment algorithms expand cardiologists will play a vital role in the care of covid-19 patients worldwide and in the ongoing research into the pathophysiology and population-based effects of the sars-cov2 virusthe pandemic caused by novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has had an enormous impact on the health and economy of the entire world 1 the total number of cases and fatalities continue to rise with a mortality rate currently estimated to be 1-5 2 of the multiple symptoms and clinical findings that have been attributed to covid-19 infection fever and cough are the most common 3 and significance in terms of widespread screening has been defined as temperatures  1005 f38c 4 cardiac injury and cardiac mortality have also become part of the emerging clinical picture of covid-19 4 5 6 and this raises the prospect of how to use implantable devices such as implantable cardiac monitors icms to aid in the screening or triage of suspected patients with daily remote monitoring capabilities screening from such a device could occur without reliance on patient compliance or recognized symptoms even among a non-ambulatory mobility-limited or quarantinedself-isolated populationwe describe here the application of temperature measurement within an icm biotronik biomonitor iii to screen for systemic infection based on measurements of fever and concomitant cardiac resting rate changes the biomonitor iii icm contains an internal integrated solid-state temperature sensor that has been enabled for research and data collection purposes but has not until now been evaluated in vivo for approval in the product additionally statistics like percent activity per day resting heart rate and mean rate per day are currently available in the icm and there is a known relationship between fever and heart rate parameters 7 the on-board temperature sensor was evaluated here for possible use as a screening tool for patients with implants although this was a retrospective study and clinical confirmations of fever were not performed across the entire population we describe here the details of one patient for which clinical confirmation with device data was possiblean elderly female residing in the new york city metropolitan region was implanted with a biomonitor iii in november of 2019 following a cerebrovascular accident trend data of daily measurements of temperature activity mean heart rate daily and mean heart rate at rest during the night from the time of implant through the first 90 days is shown in figure 1
 note the stable temperature trend and other metrics during this time period post-implant the standard deviation of day-to- day measurements was 035c from implant through the first 90 days confirming a stable measurement by the device from within the subcutaneous pocketon february 23rd the patient was admitted to the emergency department for a workup that was negative for fever the sensor confirmed there were no observations related to temperature in this timeframe however in late march the patient reported fever again coincident with the onset of rapid disease spread in the city by that time her spouse with whom she resided had been diagnosed covid-19-positive and she was advised to remain at home by emergency medical services and considered covid-19 presumptive positive the trend data from the period is shown in figure 2
 note the sharp increase in temperature on march 23 which was coincident with the patient contacting emergency services temperature as measured by the device trended upwards from an average of 368c in the 5 days preceding the episode to 384c average following the onset of fever activity as measured by the device trended downwards from an average of 46 preceding the fever to an average of 2 afterwards the heart rate at rest was 70 bpm before and 856 bpm after the temperature increase while the daily mean heart entire day average during these times increased from 876 to 93 bpm the patient remained at home and the fever episode resolved within approximately seven daysutilizing a criterion of two consecutive days with a 1 c temperature elevation identified multiple additional patients with clinically realistic episode trend data an additional example is shown in figure 3
 a device implanted in mid-july 2019 is shown with a full trend of daily data transmitted in this case the temperature trend was relatively unremarkable except for a short episode in early november showing brief decrease in activity and increases in heart rate metrics in mid-march however a significant clinical episode was detected with pre- and post-detection 5 day averages of 374c to 385c 103 to 83 activity 852 bpm to 1138 bpm mean rate and 77 bpm to 1032 bpm mean rate at rest further information beyond the trend data is not available for this patientthis report demonstrates the utility of performing temperature monitoring with an implantable device specifically the biomonitor iii implantable cardiac monitor the home monitoring service of biotronik provides daily messages without patient interaction when the patient unit is within range of the device and allows tracking of heart rate arrhythmia data and ecg snapshots among other statistics while there are numerous existing temperature measurement methods with traditional contact non-contact and wearable varieties all mainstream solutions require the subject to play a role to remember to take their reading and to properly acquire it varying accuracy and coverage over time is achieved in reality this new temperature monitoring functionality was evaluated in the context of screening and triage related to covid-19 or other highly contagious infectious diseases the hands-free rf transmission capabilities of this device make it highly suitable as a means for remote monitoring in this scenario as quarantined populations can be monitored easily and clinics can remotely screen patients for further follow upthe temperature sensor data provided by the device confirmed a fever-negative episode which was validated in the emergency department and subsequently detected a fever positive episode during a strongly presumptive covid-positive episode a second example with anonymous data demonstrated a dramatic fever and heart rate response via the trend data that would also warrant further investigation in the context of either general care or specifically cardiac care of the patient given the impact of coivd-19 on cardiac healtha retrospective analysis of available temperature and heart rate data from 4688 patients was performed to provide further perspective on the sensor data at a population level the goal was to determine if these data could be used as a screening tool without undue false alerts this exploratory analysis was conducted utilizing real world evidence methodology which has been approved by an irb granting waiver of informed consent and a full waiver of hipaa authorization temperatures rises exceeding 1c compared to the 30-day mean temperature for two consecutive days were considered clinically significant for this analysis a total of 497615 daily measurements of temperature average of 1061 days of monitoring per patient were analyzed and 103 patients within this population were identified using these criteria the relatively small number of findings with a device-level prevalence of 22 over the observation period align well with an actionable alert paradigm that would not overwhelm holter triage units while identifying patients of possible clinical interest according to guidelinesthis case report was somewhat limited due to the extenuating circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic and the public health policy to keep the infected but non-critical victims away from hospitals which prevented the patient from obtaining covid-19 testing at the time of their symptoms while an anonymized non-clinically validated assessment was possible across a broad number of devices confirmation was performed in the presented case study onlyit is possible that sources of temperature elevation other than fever could also be detected by the sensor and present as false positives for fever or infection notably heat stroke and malignant hyperthermic reactions to anesthesia or certain drugs heat application over the implant site or even intense muscular activity could in theory generate temperature deviations in the subcutaneous implant however the time scale of these processes are typically quite short minutes to hours in comparison to the 24-hour average used here and thus should not represent a significant confounder for this sensorthe temperature monitoring capability of the icm is not specific to covid-19 and cannot confirm a fever is related to covid-19 but instead represents a tool for screening and triage of any device patient for significant fever temperature monitoring or the need for remote monitoring alone would not warrant the implantation of an icm however due to the severity of the covid-19 pandemic and the implications for cardiac complications related to the disease screening for fever in the existing cardiac monitor population makes intuitive sense for early detection and additional follow up with a low overall detection rate and multiple variables heart rate activity it is possible to remotely construct a broader picture of patient health based on this vital datavital data such as this can be easily incorporated into the current remote monitoring infrastructure trend data would be available on the internet biotronik home monitoring through the cardiac monitoring units traditional credentials and alerts could be programmed to directly push messages out to specified contacts upon meeting pre-selected criteria such as a one-degree celsius increase in the future expansion of those specified contacts could permit new distribution channels to general practitioners general triage teams or even patients themselves within an appropriate framework this is especially important in case of health data such as temperature with wider than traditional cardiac implications as identical remote monitoring capabilities are available in biotronik pacemakers and icds as well development of temperature sensors and extension of these capabilities into those devices would confer similar benefits although a wider patient population could be addressedbased on current capabilities of the biomonitor iii icm and the additional possibility of making temperature data available we believe the device offers a unique opportunity to facilitate screening and triage in the context of the current coronavirus pandemic the potential benefits are numerous 1 earlier detection - especially among at-risk patient groups to reduce mortality who may not be subjectively aware of relatively minor temperature elevation 2 early suspicion of possibly contagious patients could protect caregivers family and others 3 fever specifically could be monitored remotely and hands-free to manage at-home care and 4 additionally normal icm surveillance remains in place for screening and diagnosis of cardiac injury or complications during recovery temperature monitoring functionality as demonstrated here could be a very important addition to implantable monitors to move these devices towards vital sign monitors with high compliance and significant clinical impact
1temperature monitoring functionality could be a very important addition to implantable monitors to move these devices towards vital sign monitors with high compliance and significant clinical impact2a minor temperature elevation which may not be subjectively apparent to the patient could be detected by an internal temperature sensor and in turn the patient alerted to the temperature elevation this could potentially allow earlier detection of a developing systemic infection such as covid-193the correlation of an elevated temperature with other physiologic parameters such as heart rate and activity levels may be a further indication of a systemic illness
the spread of novel coronavirus 2019-ncov covid-19 shook the world with its highly virulent transmissibility manifesting largely as a severe acute respiratory syndrome with more than 43 million people confirmed to be infectedwith approximately 13 million cases in the usaand over 294000 deaths worldwide at the time of this writing 1 originating in china the covid-19 epidemic has surpassed its predecessors in the number of hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions required to handle an infectious process within a short period of time and of such grand scale 2 the early sars epidemic that emerged in 2002 similarly involved human-to-human transmission with animal vectors linked to outbreaks and confirmed in laboratory isolates 3 initially described as pneumonia of unknown origin covid-19 is believed to be linked to bats based on its genomic similarity to known bat coronavirus batcov ratg13 4 though most coronaviruses are mild two beta-coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov also took place within the last two decades 5 these two unique predecessors preceded the pandemic that began in china in 2019 the virus originating in wuhan hubei province china in late december resulted in nearly 96000 cases initially and is now considered a worldwide pandemic 6routes of transmission of the virus have been documented to include respiratory droplets contact fomites and fecal-oral transmission 7 8 the most common symptoms at onset of illness include fever cough myalgia and fatigue with rare complaints of sputum production headache hemoptysis loss of taste andor smell and diarrhea in addition to clinical characteristics patients showcased ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography scans however more than half of the patients in early studies notably developed dyspnea that correlated with patchy infiltrates on chest radiographs the mean duration of symptoms was roughly 8 days with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards occurring between days 8 and 14 9 patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the wuhan cohort typically required icu admission of up to 12 weeks following symptom development which foreshadowed the scale of the pandemic and mirrored data obtained from the mers epidemic in 2015 10 11epidemiological data from china confirmed the median age of the patients impacted by the disease to be 59 years with disease distribution disproportionately impacting males 12 the data further hypothesized that children might be less likely to become infected or if infected demonstrated far milder symptoms italy documented nearly 22512 cases by march of 2020 with the largest proportion of cases and fatalities impacting males greater than 60 years of age 13 in the lombardy study 68 of patients had at least one existing comorbidity with hypertension being most frequently cited other predisposing factors included cardiovascular disease and hypercholesterolemia a rare subset had pre-existing lung disease manifesting as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease roughly 11 of the lombardy patients were managed with non-invasive ventilatory support 14 the need for invasive ventilatory support varied across regions of the world and some of the wuhan cohort were directly transitioned to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo for resuscitation purposes 10underlying risk factors such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease and immunosuppression have been explored as prognosticators regarding clinical outcomes of covid-19 infections in hospitalized patients 15 however the impact of the pandemic in patients with a history of cancer and pre-existing andor cancer treatmentassociated cardiovascular diseasethe cardio-oncology patientis unknown theoretically this population is likely at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from covid-19 infection and has unique healthcare needs that put them at higher risk at exposure from community and healthcare-related transmission examples of these risks include needing ongoing cancer treatments in the outpatient and inpatient setting as well as imaging-related procedures and operations for cancer-related staging and treatments if these patients also have pre-existing cardiovascular disease andor acquired cardiotoxicity during and after treatments they also warrant additional evaluation finally there appears to be a strong correlation with worse outcomes in hospitalized covid-19 patients in cardiovascular andor cancer-related comorbidities which will be reviewed belowa meta-analysis of 6 chinese studies evaluating 1527 affected patients showed that the most prevalent cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities included hypertension 171 cardiac andor cerebrovascular disease 164 and diabetes 97 most importantly patients with hypertension and cardiac andor cerebrovascular disease significantly accounted for more icu cases compared with non-icu cases with prevalence of 288 rr 203 for hypertension and 167 rr 330 for cardiac andor cerebrovascular disease 18 data from the world health organization and chinese center for disease control and prevention confirm that patients with comorbidities have a higher case fatality rate cfr than those without comorbidities 19 20 of the 55924 laboratory-confirmed cases in china there was a 38 cfr and higher rates were seen with those with cvd 132 diabetes 92 and hypertension 84 19 a cohort study of 201 patients from wuhan jinyintan hospital showed that hypertension was significantly associated with patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 274 vs 137 p  002 and later death 364 vs 175 p  005 21as of march 17 2020 the cfr in italy is 72 from a total of 22512 cases of which a detailed chart review of a subsample of 355 deceased patients found high underlying disease prevalence of ischemic heart disease 30 diabetes 355 atrial fibrillation 245 and cancer 203 22 a case series of patients with covid-19 in the icus in the lombardy region demonstrated that hypertension was the most common comorbidity 49 and cardiovascular disease 21 was the second furthermore there was a statistically significant higher prevalence of hypertension among patients who died compared with those who were discharged from the icu 63 vs 40 p  0001 14while epidemiologic data in the usa remains dynamic with limited studies to date in major urban centers a report of 167 confirmed cases linked to a long-term facility in washington state also conferred similar findings showing high underlying disease prevalence with hypertension 443 cardiac disease 407 and diabetes 228 23 a large new york study examined a total of 5700 patients with median age being 63 years age the new york cohort found hypertension in 566 patients obesity in 417 patients and diabetes in 338 of patients of the patients who died those with diabetes were more likely to have been mechanically ventilated or be hospitalized in the icu 15 another case series of 393 patients admitted to new york hospitals found that 501 of patients had hypertension and 21 had cardiovascular disease 24 not all studies detailed specifics of what defined cardiac disease therefore it is difficult to delineate covid-19 direct associations with coronary artery disease cardiomyopathy or heart failure from a large sample size standpoint however a case series from seattle washington did state that 429 of the 21 critically ill patients with covid-19 had underlying congestive heart failure 25in addition to underlying cvd being a risk factor for contracting covid-19 patients that develop acute myocardial injury have worse outcomes even in those without baseline cardiovascular dysfunction 2528 acute myocardial injury can be categorized in three varieties elevated troponin levels above the 99th percentile upper reference limit development of new or worsening heart failure and myocarditis several studies from china found that elevated troponin levels were significantly associated with higher mortality 2628 a case series of 187 patients at the seventh hospital of wuhan city china found that patients with elevated troponin t tnt levels had a significantly higher mortality rate to those with normal tnt levels 596 vs 89 p  0001 patients with underlying cvd including those with underlying hypertension coronary heart disease and cardiomyopathy were more likely to have elevated tnt levels during their hospital course 26 lipid metabolism is also observed to be dysregulated in patients with sars-cov infection serum concentrations of free fatty acids lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol remained elevated and contributed to chronic cardiovascular damage post infection in patients with sars-cov 29 long-term cardiovascular and atherosclerotic changes in patients who suffer from covid-19 have not been documented yet given the recent nature of this pandemica case series of 21 critically ill covid-19 patients from seattle also found that one-third of their patients developed new cardiomyopathy with cardiogenic shock in the absence of prior systolic dysfunction during the progression of their illness 25 it is unclear if these patients that developed cardiomyopathy truly had myocarditis or had underlying cvd that predisposed them to this clinical course however covid-19 has been shown to directly cause myocarditis in otherwise healthy individuals in several case reports 30 31 thus covid-19 demonstrates various patterns of myocardial injury with higher mortality risk being associated with elevated troponin levelsin addition in the cardio-oncology population elevated cardiac biomarkers can pose an additional layer of complexity and challenge when dealing with management abnormal elevations of troponin and bnp biomarkers can be indicative of cardiotoxicity from cancer physiology or from the treatments themselves 32 some elevations may be non-specific and are reflective of subclinical cardiotoxicity in patients receiving anthracyclines andor anti-her2 agents in which stable patients can be medically managed 33 34 however some patients receiving other agents such as certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors with prothrombotic risk ie ponatinib or fluoropyridines ie 5-fluorouracil may suffer cardiotoxicity in the form of coronary ischemiavasospasm which may warrant more invasive diagnostictreatment strategies 3537 elevated cardiac biomarkers have also been associated with worse outcomes and or cardiac hemodynamic instability including cytokine release syndrome from chimeric antigen therapy car-t heart failure from proteasome inhibitor use ie carfilzomib or myocarditis from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy 3841 some of these disease processes may confound treatment of a cancer patient also afflicted with covid-19 and thus multidisciplinary assessment particularly by a cardio-oncologist may be essential to provide optimal care in this high-risk populationcancer patients have shown to be at higher risk for contracting the virus likely from their immune dysregulation in setting of their malignancy and various treatments and remain at high risk for sustaining severe outcomes 19 42 per the who joint mission report the cfr for cancer patients 76 was higher than the overall cfr for 55924 covid-19 patients in china 19 reports from italy and washington also support that cancer patients had similar findings 14 22 23 however the specific type of cancer was neither reported in these studies nor linked to specific outcome several studies have indicated that cancer patients trend toward having more severe disease a case series of patients admitted to new york hospitals identified that 59 patients had cancer and 43 of these patients required invasive ventilation for support 24 a prospective cohort study of following 1590 covid-19 patients in china demonstrated that of the 18 patients with cancer lung cancer was the most frequently incurred malignancy moreover in this cohort history of cancer was associated with a higher risk of severe events icu admission requiring ventilation or death and faster progression to severe events median time for cancer patients 13 days vs 43 days for non-cancer patients those with a history of chemotherapy or surgery in the past month had a higher risk for severe events even when adjusted for other risk factors including age or 534 95 ci 1801618 p  0005 of the 18 described in the wuhan group roughly 10 received chemotherapy and 71 targeted therapy however age alone was also an independent risk factor for severe events in the cancer group of patients those with history of lung cancer versus other cancer types did not predict a more severe outcome 42another study from china evaluating all cancer patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university determined that cancer patients had a 079 infection rate compared with the overall citys 037 infection rate a total of 12 patients were affected 583 had non-small cell lung carcinoma nsclc with approximately 417 were undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and resulting mortality rate as of march 10 2020 being 25 additionally nsclc patients that were greater than age 60 had a higher incidence of covid-19 compared with younger patients with nsclc 43 these findings are further corroborated by a study that examined all 28 cancer patients admitted to 3 hospitals in china lung cancer was the most common cancer type among these patients 25 diabetes 143 and chronic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease 143 were the most common comorbidities listed clinical factors that significantly predicted worse outcomes in this group of patients included age patchy consolidation on imaging and receipt of anti-tumor treatment in the last 14 days 44 these studies suggest that patients with cancer are at higher risk for covid-19 and those with older age and cancer are at an even higher risk for poor outcomes lung cancer has been reported to be more common in these studies but the total sample size of cancer patients remains too low to draw any meaningful conclusions on which malignancy may be most associated with severity of covid-19 infections lastly although having recent anti-cancer treatment increases the risk for severe outcomes it is unclear which anti-cancer agents are associated with higher risk for acquiring covid-19 infection severity of infection andor mortality table 1 demonstrates a literature review of studies published until april 26 2020 that identify the prevalence of cancer among covid-19 infected patientsalthough no formal studies have assessed the direct impact of covid-19 on cardio-oncology patients a study has shown that both cvd patients and cancer patients do have an increased risk for cardiac injury which in of itself is an independent predictor of mortality 28 additionally since the data suggests that cvd and cancer are potentially independent risk factors for virus acquisition and severe outcomes it is reasonable to assume that if patients have both risk factors then they may posit higher cumulative risk there is also concern that cancer treatments may induce disease states such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseaseboth frequently associated risk factors for worse outcomes in covid-19 patients 19 an example of such a clinical scenario could involve metastatic renal carcinoma patients who develop hypertension from anti-vegf tyrosine kinase therapy or cardiomyopathy from anti-her2 and anthracycline therapy of breast cancer 45 46 however the definition of cardiovascular disease that patients have been classified with in these studies is not always clearly delineated thus risk stratification of these patients in regard to covid-19 risk requires more refined investigation and long-term follow-up regarding outcomesthe elevated risk that cancer patients face during the covid-19 pandemic poses many challenges some of these include providing ongoing cancer treatments especially if patients are undergoing curative therapy enrolling patients into experimental drug trials continuing close cardiotoxicity surveillance and providing treatments to patients who have an optimal window of adequate functional status 47 48 given concerns for hospital-acquired covid-19 infections this additional risk factor can impact continuation of therapy or initiation of regimens for aggressive malignancy that require hospitalization for closer monitoring 43 47 48 moreover patients that may rely on drugs or stem cell donations for treatment may necessitate access to unique global sources and are rendered at a disadvantage due to travel restrictions and quarantine policies 49 in response to these climactic changes the national comprehensive cancer network and national cancer institute have provided guidance to providers on providing care to oncology patients resource allocation and managing drug trials 50as referenced above a unique source of transmission in the cardio-oncology population is healthcare exposure healthcare-related exposure is being given greater importance as an attributable vector past experience with sars-cov demonstrated that the virus can be transmitted via aerosolizing procedures such as endotracheal intubation placing anesthesiologists at great risk for acquiring the infection 51 52 during the outbreak of covid-19 implementation of infection control and establishment of safe personal protective equipment ppe remained and remains key intense aerosolizing procedures such as emergent intubations cardiopulmonary resuscitation or bronchoscopies should require stringent ppe to maintain adequate protection despite attempting to roll out these precautions review of the who-china joint mission on covid confirmed that nearly 3387 healthcare workers tested positive for covid-19 infection resulting in 22 deaths 53 while initial understanding of the pathogen remained poor long-time exposure to large-scale infected patients directly increased the risk of infection for healthcare workers and risk of being an asymptomatic carrier 54 fatigue lack of available healthcare workers limited resources and intensity of response led to several healthcare workers succumbing to infection though unsettling it is doubly important to place value on healthcare-related exposure as an established risk factor when dealing with cancer patients with pre-existing risk factorscoronaviruses are a large collection of single-stranded enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses that fall within the family of coronaviridae and the order nidovirales 55 six specific coronaviruses have been identified as human-susceptible among which alpha and beta subsets demonstrated lower pathogenicity and caused milder respiratory symptoms respectively genomic analysis of sars-cov-2 showcased 962 shared sequencing with bat cov ratg13 thus positing that the bat variant served as the natural host of the virus 4 however the severe acute syndromes belong to the b-genus with envelope-anchored spike protein mediating viral entry into host cells by first binding to a host receptor and subsequently fusing membranes 56 the covid-19 infection has a well-defined capsular structure with 14 binding residues with 8 conserved from prior sars-cov infections the viral genome contains several open reading frames with majority of the viral rna-encoding non-structural proteins nsps that play a role in the pathogenesis of disease recent research studies focusing on nsp2 and nsp3 demonstrated an in vivo role that these subunits may play in infectious capability and differentiation of covid-19 57mechanistically covid-19 is found to be linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 a membrane-bound aminopeptidase highly expressed in lung intestinal and heart tissue beyond being implicated in hypertension and diabetes ace-2 further functions as a receptor for coronaviruses 58 covid-19 translocates into lung parenchyma via damaging epithelial cells resulting in respiratory symptoms with symptom severity worsening in patients with cardiovascular disease ace2 secretion is noted to be elevated in cvd patients due to increased reliance on angiotensin-receptor blockers for management of hypertension at the receptor level the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov spike protein specifically recognizes ace2 which contributes to both cross-species and human-to-human transmission 59 60 documented variability is demonstrated between various strains of sars-cov in terms of binding affinity and viral attachment which is preserved across both humans and animal models of disease transmission 61 the preserved domains across merssars may contribute to the heightened inflammatory response and cytokine milieu that leads to severe pneumonia 62on a molecular level specific associations and descriptive characteristics of the patients identified cytokine abnormalities in icu-level patients versus non-iculevel admissions compared with non-icu patients icu patients had higher plasma levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf-a 63 though this cytokine thumbprint is being linked to covid-19 infection ards similarly showcases elevations in inflammatory markers questioning origin and role of virally mediated hyperinflammation 64multiple treatments are being assessed in various trials including antivirals anti-inflammatories immunotherapies and cardiovascular medications for the treatment of covid-19 although some these therapies have potential to provide benefit there are numerous potential cardiac toxicities and drug-drug interactions that may be harmful to cardio-oncology patients which is critically relevant since a high percentage of covid-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities 6568 an appraisal of these agents and their potential cardiotoxicitiesof which there is no current proven efficacy at this timeis beyond the scope of this review however some agents are actively used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease andor cancer-related conditions and the unique disease states of the cardio-oncology population may yield insights into the mechanisms of covid-19 pathophysiologyfor instance the idea of using medications that have already been well-studied and target host responses by boosting host immunity was in discussion during prior significant outbreaks and epidemics including ebola and influenza 69 70 ace inhibitors acei angiotensin-receptor blockers arb and statins are of particular importance during this current pandemicthere has been a theoretical uncertainty in regard to the safety of aceiarb use in patients with covid-19 based on the ace2 viral entry mechanism 71 72 the virus gains cellular entry by attaching to the ace2 receptor 72 ace2 expression and activity have shown to be increased in by aceiarb use 73 although there is theoretical risk that ace2 upregulation may increase the susceptibility of infection other conflicting evidence indicates that upregulation of ace2 in fact has a more protective effect studies in mouse models have shown that ace2 is protective against acute lung injury and blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathway decreases lung failure 74 75 based on the review of the literature to date the heart failure society of america recommends continuation of aceiarb use for patients that are prescribed them for heart failure hypertension and ischemic disease 76 abrupt discontinuation of medications is not recommended and can worsen clinical stability especially in patients with existing cardiovascular conditions 71additionally statins have long been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties through multiple studies for instance simvastatin has been shown to decrease pulmonary inflammation in human subjects 77 although the benefits for cardiovascular patients have been numerous from a lipid lower standpoint it is important to note that the ability of statins to decrease inflammation also improves mortality 78 a retrospective analysis of patients from the veterans administration showed that statin use acei use or arb use each independently improved 30 day mortality of patients  65 years old who were hospitalized for pneumonia 79 however in the era of the covid-19 pandemic studies are needed to evaluate its role in covid-19related illnessalthough cancer patients have been considered immunosuppressed as a result of their underlying malignancy and cytoreduction therapies patients that undergo immunotherapy including immune checkpoint inhibitors icis or car-t cell therapy may have different immuno-physiology that responds to covid-19 differently 80 anti-pd-1pd-l1 and anti-ctla-4 icis have been approved by the fda for use in a variety of cancers these drugs primarily work by enhancing a patients immune response to tumors through inhibiting negative regulators of t cell function 81 car-t cell therapy involves reprogramming a patients own t cells to directly target their specific tumor 82an adverse effect that can occur with either anti-pd-1 therapy or car-t cell therapy involves cytokine release syndrome crs which is similar to the cytokine storm phenomenon that occurs in patients with severe covid-19 80 82 83 crs occurs as a result of hyperimmune activation in response to tumor death whereas cytokine storm in covid-19 patients occurs as a result of t cell hyperactivation from immune dysregulation 80 84 similar markers are elevated in both phenomena including il-6 tnf-alpha and ifn- of which il-6 has also been shown to be a mortality predictor in covid-19 patients 27 64 80 84 covid-19 patients that develop cytokine storm syndrome are at risk of developing ards and multi-organ failure 84 85 immunosuppression with tocilizumab an il-6 inhibitor is used to treat crs associated with car-t cell therapy 80 86 additionally tocilizumab immunosuppression is used to treat immune-related adverse events iraes from pd-1 inhibitors that are refractory to steroids iraes also occur as a result of hyperimmune activation 80 87 moreover the cytokine storm observed with covid-19 has also been noted to be similar to that of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh which is also treated with immunosuppression 64current trials are underway with using tocilizumab and sarilumab another il-6 inhibitor to treat covid-19 patients 8890 although immunotherapy may be thought to reinstate a cancer patients immunocompetence there is potential for synergy from crs and the covid-19 cytokine storm pathogenesis which can further worsen a patients mortality risk further unfavorable synergy between ici immune-related adverse events iraes can also be seen potentially between the pneumonitis that icis can cause and the lung involvement with covid-19 80 pneumonitis occurs in  10 of patients being treated with anti-ctla-4 and anti-pd-1 icis and is potentially life-threatening 81 therefore if combined with lung injury from covid-19 there is a theoretical potential for poor outcomesthere are potential cancer treatments that may counteract the pathogenesis of covid-19 such as ccr5 treatments and tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis 9193 the ccr5 receptor is a g proteincoupled receptor selectively expressed on macrophages t cells eosinophils dendritic cells and microglia and is implicated in chemokine-mediated signaling 94 this receptor has historically been targeted for hiv antiviral therapy in the setting of disrupting viral entry specifically through small molecule inhibition with maraviroc and vicriviroc and monoclonal antibody treatment with leronlimab 95 moreover multiple cancers have been shown to overexpress ccr5 which has been linked to a cancers metastatic potential ccr5 therapies are currently being studied in metastatic colorectal and breast cancers 91 94 due to its immune system restorative properties leronlimab is being investigated for compassionate use in the treatment of covid-19 patients 96 97 studies examining receptor blockade in leronlimab preliminarily have shown decreases in il-6 restoration of cd4cd8 ratios and reduction in overall covid-19 viremia 98 these collective findings suggest possible therapeutic role in establishing immune reconstitution in patients that are critically ill and may provide dual benefit in patients with shared cancer diagnosestkis like sunitinib and erlotinib that specifically inhibit aak1 a protein regulator that allows passage of the virus into cells have theorized utility 92 sunitinib is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor vegf tki which is used in first-line for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma 99 erlotinib is an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor egfr tki which is used in first-line treatment for metastatic egfr-mutant non-small cell lung cancer 100 both these tkis have shown to reduce the infectivity of dengue and ebola through in vivo studies with murine models which showed decreased viremia and mortality with treatments moreover in vitro studies in cultured cells and hepatitis c in this same study showed that use of these tkis reduced intracellular trafficking and inhibited viral entry 101 however the high doses required to achieve this effect may potentially exhibit harm to patients 92 93 regardless there is potential for cancer patients receiving these therapies to achieve dual benefit as referenced before but warrant further investigation further studies are warranted in tracking the outcomes of cancer patients with covid-19 and the type of treatments they receivedpatients with underlying hypertension diabetes and cancer are at higher risk for developing thrombotic events coagulopathy in coronavirus infection is now associated with high mortality and manifests with high d-dimer elevations 102 lung inflammation and impaired pulmonary gas exchange contributes to cytokine storm which leads to spike in d-dimer and pro-inflammatory response with impaired endothelial function tissue factor tf expressed by tumor cells contributes to thrombosis metastasis tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis leading to release of pro-coagulant microparticles into the circulation and triggering thromboembolism in patients with cancer 103 tf on circulating tumor cells leads to coating of cells with fibrin that traps them within microvasculature thereby contributing to worsening endothelial dysfunction 104 in patients with pre-existing cancer diagnoses shared covid infection as well as hypoxia places them at even greater risk of developing and incurring thrombotic events 105 early heparin initiation is posited to delay the spike in inflammatory biomarkers and may reduce contributions to pro-coagulopathic state 106 a retrospective study from china examined 449 patients classified as having severe covid-19 infection of which 272 had one or more chronic underlying diseases such as hypertension and heart disease patients were assigned to receive various forms of heparin with those treated with heparin having a lower mortality rate 40 vs 642 p  0029 107 data regarding initiation and choice of anticoagulation remains limited and further randomized clinical trials are necessary to determine prophylactic and treatment strategies for cardio-oncology patients infected with covid-19 as they represent a population with elevated theoretical risk for suffering from thromboembolic eventsthe covid-19 pandemic has added a significant layer and complexity of how patient care is being delivered due to concerns of bidirectional transmission with no protective algorithm widely in place to dictate ongoing management of cancer patients 108 initiating cancer treatments such as targeted immunotherapies and chemotherapy require special consideration in the covid-19 era as previously described compromised immune systems render patients with cancer at higher risk for acquiring covid-19 infection and the sequelae that may ensue cancer treatment centers and cardio-oncologists must now consider not only the patient but also the integral healthcare workers who are regularly interfacing with high-risk exposures devising strategies to ensure robust testing services and clearance mechanisms to protect patient and healthcare personnel is one of many methods now employed to continue ongoing treatments 48 109 110 though there are no clear evidence-based modifications in systems of care to reduce transmission risk while balancing high-standard cardio-oncology care various strategies are proposed table 2 life-prolonging surgeries and procedures can slowly be pursued and continued although the risks of delaying any such advanced treatmentsincluding bone marrow transplantation and chimeric antigen receptor treatmentneed to be weighed carefully covid-19 screening and testing prior to these surgeriesprocedures while not infallible should be considered if available due to rising concern for asymptomatic carriers following completing anti-cancer treatments patients may additionally benefit from receiving immune system restorative treatments such as filgastrimadditionally the transition to telemedicine to conduct interval cardiovascular and oncologic appointments can potentially protect patients from unnecessarily harmful nosocomial exposures 111 112 certain chronic conditions ie hypertension stablecompensated congestive heart failure may not necessarily require a face-to-face visit whereas highly symptomatic patients should still be seen in the cardio-oncology clinic preferably on the same day as their cancer outpatient visits deferring primary prevention assessments for example cholesterol monitoring unless otherwise indicated can augment protective mechanisms in place cardiovascular-related blood draws if necessary should be coincided with cancer-related treatmentsin addition the specter of cardiotoxicity related to certain cancer treatments also requires a reexamination of risk and benefit with respect to frequent cardiac monitoring due to previously mentioned concerns peri-chemotherapeutic events and development of cardiomyopathy ischemia and life-threatening arrhythmias are further worsened by simultaneous covid infection reducing reliance on frequent cardiac imaging in otherwise asymptomatic patients and providing in-mail ambulatory rhythm monitors for patients symptomatic with possible arrhythmias will further assist in mitigating exposure risk limited cardiac-imaging protocols ie focused just on ventricular function andor pericardial disease if necessary for symptomatic patients or those necessitating cardiotoxicity surveillance can also be devised to reduce exposure time in the healthcare setting in addition for patients at low risk of cardiotoxicity andor with prior serial-documented normal cardiac function it can be considered to defer serial cardiac imaging in certain treatments ie anti-her2 without anthracyclines braf-mek treatments in multidisciplinary discussions with oncology if the patient is asymptomatic 113the covid-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented global impact on healthcare delivery and its trajectory continues to remain unclear vulnerable patient populations include those with cardiovascular disease and cancer and the cardio-oncology patient having possessed both these risk factors may unfortunately be at significantly increased risk of experiencing worse outcomes related to covid-19 infection as of this writing there are no known studies focusing on the cardio-oncology population and there remain many opportunities to not only study the epidemiology of this unique but also significant group of patients clinical trials are ongoing but rigorous randomized high-quality science is warranted to study the efficacy of previously mentioned treatments they also may potentially reveal critical mechanistic insights into covid-19s pathophysiology which overlap with cardiovascular and cancer disease states 114 in addition the abrupt and possibly permanent alteration of cardiovascular and cancer systems of carewith the dramatic rise of telemedicine and other changesto mitigate transmission risk in the covid-19 era also warrants close study to evaluate clinical outcomes much remains unknown about how the pandemic will affect the cardio-oncology population and how they will be cared for but what is certain is that ongoing close multidisciplinary care and communication between the cardiac and cancer care providers of these patients remains more critical than ever in order to guarantee the best care possiblein december 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 caused an outbreak of pneumonia that has now led to a pandemic1 by may 2020 the world health organization who had reported 5 million cases and 250 000 deaths to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-192 covid-19 is highly transmissible and spreads rapidly in the population many of those infected will develop a fever and persistent cough and some will progress to severe lung injury34 acute respiratory failure may lead to severe complications or death particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease14the covid-19 pandemic poses potential serious additional risks for participants and staff engaged in clinical trials their safety is of key importance from a patient perspective potential risks entail not only additional exposure to infection during research visits but also risks due to disruption of general clinical care or due to failure to monitor adequately the continuation or withdrawal of research interventions the safety of patients and those who care for them is paramount but we should also ensure as far as possible that clinical trials are still able to answer the questions they were designed to address56investigators participants and funders enter a social contract when they decide to participate in a trial participants make the largest investment their own health and well-being time and effort often made over a period of years should be valued immensely investigators and funders provide their intelligence expertise curiosity questions and trial designs investigators guide patient care and investigation during a trial considering both trial-specific and general medical issues that arise and funders provide opportunities resources and management expertise the different stakeholders in this social contract also have both expectations and motivations some common and some diverse patients would like a better treatment for themselves and others in a similar situation now or in the future investigators physicians and nurses want to help their patients expand their professional knowledge and skills and help answer important medical questions for their patients and the wider society commercial companies have specialist knowledge in several important areas that often exceeds that of all other parties they may offer substantial resources in terms of manpower organization equipment expertise and finances however a return of investment is needed in order to reward the stakeholders who have financed the research and to enable the company to invest in future researchas physicians and trial leaders we consequently have the moral and ethical duty to our patients and the many thousands of people currently participating in clinical trials to provide reliable results we are responsible for the safety of trial participants but must also ensure that the commitment of trial volunteers is worthwhilethe integrity of clinical trials and the reliability of their results are essential for current and future generations of patients this remains true for heart failure hf trials even during the covid-19 crisis when the covid-19 epidemic has subsided hf will still remain a major cause of morbidity and mortalityrecognizing the unprecedented challenges facing clinical trials during this pandemic many national or regional regulatory authorities have issued guidance on the conduct of clinical trials in the face of the covid-19 crisis supplementary material online appendix s1 these efforts are important but many clinical trials are international crossing jurisdictional borders a single document that provides general internationally relevant guidance that can be modified according to local circumstances and regulations being recognized could help enhance the safety of trial participants and maintain the validity of trials and their results overall such a consensus document may also impact regional guidance accordingly the heart failure association of the european society of cardiology on 21 and 22 march 2020 conducted web-based meetings with expert clinical trialists in europe north america south america australia and asia the main objectives of this expert position paper are to highlight the challenges that this pandemic poses for the conduct of clinical trials in hf and to offer advice on how they might be overcome with some practical examples this expert panel acknowledges that suitable solutions will depend on many factors including whether the trial has recently started or is nearing completion the trial design the type and timing of interventions the nature of the patient population enrolled the local and regional severity of the covid-19 outbreak and the local governing laws and healthcare resources as the pandemic evolves so will the recommendationspatients not requiring urgent care should avoid hospitals or clinics whilst local regulations advise social distancing hf patients are generally older and have a higher burden of comorbidities which make them an especially high-risk group if they get a coronavirus infection every attempt should be made to reduce the risk of exposure some clinical trials might still be able to enrol new patients during the pandemic without increasing patient exposure for example those recruiting patients with acute hf during the index hospital admission if no extra trial visits in hospitals or clinic will be required after discharge or if the rest of the trial-related data collection can be accomplished remotely however in most circumstances it will be difficult to recruit new participants into hf trials that are currently in progress for many reasons including the fact that research staff may be redirected to support clinical services or covid-related research and may therefore not be available to enrol patients in clinical trialssponsors should assess the feasibility and safety of initiating new clinical trials until the evolution of the covid-19 pandemic becomes clearer and the rate of infection is under control currently only trials in hf that directly address specific issues relevant to covid-19 eg preventing infection or the consequences of infection or that treat aspects of covid-19 disease progression in hf patients such the use of anti-inflammatory therapies should be encouraged the timing of when it will again be safe to initiate new clinical trials will be strongly influenced by local circumstances rules and regulations for instance the national institute of health research in the uk has suspended all new clinical trials to prioritize covid-19 research and to enable the redeployment of staff to clinical duties7recruiting new participants into clinical trials will be interrupted in most cases or at least very severely curtailed due to the additional risk of infection and the reduced availability of research staff so that in most cases screening will cease whether it is advisable to contact patients by telephone to ask trial-related questions will depend on what ethical permissions have been obtained and the anticipated reaction of patients patients may be reassured by contact from a healthcare professional they know however it is also possible that patients may think it is inappropriate to be asked about trial participation when they or their family members might be in a crisis whether that be medical or financial this might depend on the nature of the research trials on protection from infection with or the complications of covid-19 might be expected by patients and greeted with enthusiasmin some countries the load on the healthcare system is now gradually decreasing and authorities are considering reducing restrictions whilst still maintaining social distancing depending on the region and the resilience of the healthcare system it may be possible to restart patient recruitment even when social distancing measures are still recommended these strategies will heavily depend on the local regulations and burden of covid-19 on the healthcare system in a particular region and will require frequent re-assessment of the situation when follow-up visits for existing trials are again possible then enrolment of new patients should also be possible however patients may be wary about agreeing to participate in clinical trials until they are confident that the covid-19 pandemic is firmly under controlpatient recruitment into international clinical trials will reflect the confidence that the sponsors have that a particular country has controlled not only the current risk of covid-19 infection but also the risk of resurgence some predict that the covid-19 pandemic might recur in waves over the next few years funders and sponsors need to be confident that the necessary treatment can be delivered and follow-up measurements can be done physically or remotely and that clinical outcomes will not be determined by the risk of or infection with covid-19 this may influence the geographic distribution of patient recruitmentpermanent cessation of ongoing clinical trials is rarely the best course of action unless they are nearing planned completion or have not yet started most trials should continue to follow patients who have already been enrolled provided this does not increase risk even if enrolment of new participants is temporarily haltedglobally almost two-thirds of deaths are due to the effects of chronic diseases such as hf89 it is the ethical responsibility of the biomedical research community towards our patients to continue to seek better therapies for conditions that shorten life even in these difficult times termination of a clinical trial may require patient contact such as study close-out visits to the hospital for final investigations and safety-related assessments and occasionally to down-titrate and stop investigational drugs or to start conventional treatments safely hence ending a trial could in some cases also increase the patient contact and local hospital research workload for a short period of timeif there are circumstances where patient safety cannot be ensured or trial data simply cannot be collected the trial may need to be paused or stopped altogether eg if early in the course trials that require close and frequent follow-up or complex investigations require detailed discussions to determine the optimum strategy for follow-up trials of devices that have already been implanted and cannot be managed remotely may require follow-up to ensure safe and effective device performance eg for implantable pulse generators where regular battery changes may be needed and for neurostimulation devices that may require clinically supervised titrationlastly the decision to restart enrolment into a trial should be re-assessed at regular intervals and will depend on epidemiological data pertinent to a given region or site and after review of the institutional capacity policies and local regulationsthere are special considerations for trials with run-in phases and views are controversial on this for instance if the run-in phase requires optimization of guideline-recommended therapy it can be argued that the risks of additional visits should be balanced against the advantages of optimizing therapy during the pandemic however if the run-in period is time limited and must be immediately followed by randomization and the active treatment phase it is preferable not to commence the run-in at all as a run-in phase that cannot lead to randomization serves no purpose also when orderly and timely delivery of the investigational product and data collection cannot be ensured the run-in phase cannot continue for the time being hence consideration should be given to a moratorium on commencing patients in a run-in phase until local staff can see a realistic prospect of successful and safe trial participation that is the aim of the run-in phasea first do no harm commitment mandates that every effort is made to minimize the risk of infection for trial patients and trial staff by converting physical visits into virtual visits whenever possible to ensure safe and documented study drug administration investigational medicinal products imps may be mailed to the patients home address using dedicated couriers risk management plans for storage and back-up transportation modalities should be considered and documented on a case-by-case basis this is of major importance because it may be ill advised for patients to attend face-to-face visits furthermore healthcare facilities may be overwhelmed especially if research staff are reassigned to clinical duties or quarantined due to sars-cov-2 exposurephysical visits should be reduced andor deferred whenever feasible trial procedures and endpoints that can be adequately assessed using remote visits such as symptoms or questionnaires eg eq-5d that do not require an in-person visit table 1 can instead be documented by postal questionnaires or standardized scripted phone follow-up alternative solutions using validated tools such as apps are encouraged1012 heart rate heart rhythm and blood pressure may all be potentially recorded by patients or carers if appropriate equipment and training is available13 participants should be asked to comply with standard operating procedures developed by the trial management team to ensure uniform data collection face-to-face visits at home might be necessary if a blood test a device check that cannot be done remotely or intravenous therapy is required patients would appreciate this see patient statements in supplementary material online appendix 2 however in some regions in-person visits may not be possible due to local laws and regulations
data that are critical for addressing the primary hypothesis of the trial should be prioritized a riskbenefit analysis should be applied to both primary and secondary endpoints balancing the safety of participants and staff with the impact that missing data will have on the results and their interpretation for example specialized investigations including some blood tests the investigation of mechanisms of action of the treatment under study and recording of surrogate endpoints that are ancillary trial aims may need to be interrupted for a period of time or entirely sacrificed to improve patient safety when the primary endpoint is a clinical event such as hospitalization or death this can usually be documented although accurate ascertainment and reporting might be delayedwhen in-person visits are deemed essential patients should be contacted via telephone first to screen for symptoms suggestive of viral illness in addition visits should be arranged so that patient waiting times and overlap are avoided by spreading visits over the working day non-essential companions should be discouraged from accompanying patients for their visits other trial processes that are not absolutely essential such as resolving data queries should be relaxed or if of low value omitted altogether to reduce the burden on research staff moreover healthcare workers could unknowingly be a vector of coronavirus and if sars-cov-2 testing is available it should be performed on trial staff to improve patient safety however currently this is not possible in most places and local circumstances and rules will prevail importantly testing of patients and staff with known exposure to or symptoms of covid-19 should be prioritized visitor logs and contact informationregularly maintainedshould be collected to enable subsequent contact tracing if required if personal protective equipment is available it should be used by both patients and staff during any face-to-face encounter however personal protective equipment should be reserved for frontline healthcare staff where there are shortages in addition careful cleaning of all surfaces and equipment is required after each patient contactthe number of staff that trial participants interact with should be minimized delegation logs where named individuals are approved to undertake certain duties in specific trials should be created to ensure as many team members cross-cover each other so that in the case of staff absence there is an alternative authorized personcase report forms cfrs should be changed so that covid-19 is a drop-down box for missing visits tests and drug supply a check list of screening questions to expedite the central endpoint committee deliberation may be helpful as well local regional and national rules take precedence and must be adhered to it is understandable that different policies and laws will exist in different regions meaning that the final decision taken will be locally determined patients must be informed about changes to the trial and planned follow-up as speedily as possiblewe strongly believe adjudication of endpoints in the future should consider covid-19 infection and its consequences if a patient is known to be infected with covid-19 this will assist interpretation and future analysis of results eg sensitivity analyses based on covid-19 status many regions have limited resourcestest kits for covid-19 diagnosis and thus routine testing of trial participants may not be possible however testing may become less costly and much more widely available in most regions perhaps as a rapid point of care test14 when covid-19 status cannot be assessed immediately it might be possible to retain specimens for future testing providing this is permitted and suitable safeguards for healthcare staff are in place moreover covid-19 pneumonitis can cause signs and symptoms similar to hf and may also cause acute systolic hf or myocarditis careful documentation of any tests of cardiac function eg echocardiography or invasive haemodynamic measurements or treatments directed at hf eg intravenous diuretic inotropic or vasodilator agents in the crf might assist differentiation between acute respiratory distress syndrome and hfthe event adjudication committee blinded to assigned intervention may be later asked to assess whether covid-19 contributed to a presumed cardiovascular endpoint event based on emerging evidence and publications a graded classification of relatedness eg proven likely or unlikely may be useful for future trial analysis and could be added to the crf when a patient is hospitalized determination of covid-19 status is strongly advocated particularly when hospitalization is part of the primary endpoint of the trial sites should be encouraged to focus on collection of narratives whenever possible as these can be especially valuable in patients with complex disease and when information from the medical chart may be lacking for many structural personnel or expediting reasons for example phone interviews with a patient may uncover useful clinical information that should be documented in the patients hospital and trial notespatients may avoid hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic and hospitals may be too overwhelmed to admit hf patients in the way in which they would normally do the clinical decision threshold for admitting a patient with decompensated hf may have changed during the covid-19 pandemic which may impact event rates for an uncertain period of time similarly the proportions of deaths due to cardiovascular non-cardiovascular or uncertain cause may change due to covid-19 infection if true then during the period of time of the covid-19 crisis the assumption that in a hf trial the majority of undetermined cause deaths are probably cardiovascular in origin may need to be reconsideredindependent data monitoring committees dmcs play a crucial role in the conduct of cardiovascular trials adjustments to the work of the dmc should be implemented in trials in which 8090 of the recruitment has been completed the dmc may be asked to perform an interim analysis to assess if the study question has already been answered trials that have already answered the primary question for futility harm or benefit may be stopped and thus limit unnecessary exposure for patients and investigators similarly if 90 or more of the anticipated events have accrued the power of the trial may not be affected severely and thus a decision regarding stopping or continuing a trial which is about to end could be made this also addresses the concern that the results of an almost complete trial might be changed by the impact of the epidemic for example if this epidemic had struck in 2014 the paradigm-hf trial could have been stopped well before march 2014 without adversely affecting the result and reducing the risk to patients and staff without exposing the trial to the risk of including many deaths due to infectionterminating a trial as opposed to pausing recruitment with the possibility of future resumptionwhich is not what we generally recommendis not without risks for patients in some cases as discussed above and hence careful evaluation is required before making such a decision case by case if based on an interim analysis appropriate statistical methods can be used eg promising zone approach15 but this cannot be applied post-hoc generally the steering committee blinded to study results should provide relevant boundaries and related decision rules for the dmc to use in order to make recommendations about early stopping of the trial or not the consequences of likely scenarios should be considered before looking at unblinded data this process is important for maintaining the integrity of the clinical trial16lastly the dmc should be flexible regarding the ability of trial organizers to provide timely reports there may be unavoidable delays in reporting serious adverse events and endpoints due to covid-19-related measuresinstitutional review board irb policies should be adapted to support clinical trials in these extraordinary circumstances as trial protocol modifications are expected to occur frequently irb policies should be adjusted to avoid the need for repeated reporting of protocol deviations flexibility may be considered for the timing of scheduled visits as long as they do not invalidate results for example if a face-to-face visit may be safely deferred then this should be allowed provided there are no safety concerns eg the imp is out of date or cannot be supplied in acceptable condition or at all this consideration will vary depending on the trial design and study intervention waivers in eligibility criteria due to difficulty in performing evaluations should not be allowed in addition definitions of protocol deviations may need to be revisited if certain tests cannot be performed within an expected time frame for logistical reasons if a covid 19-related protocol modification is not considered to be eligible for a waiver then expedited review will often be neededsponsors should describe in appropriate sections of the clinical study report the measures that were taken to manage trial conduct during disruption of the study caused by covid-19-related factors moreover a listing of all patients affected by the covid-19-related study disruption should be mentioned by unique participant number identifier and by investigational site with an explanation of how it altered participation trial registration sites such as clinicaltrialsgov should consider reporting all covid-19-related changes to the clinical trialsstatistical analysis plans should be reviewed carefully and modified if necessary to reflect changes to the trial precipitated by the covid-19 pandemic statistical approaches may change power calculations may need to be revised but rigorous methods of analysis including the principles of the intention to treat approach should prevail covid-19 status may or may not be important for the outcomes seen in a trial it is unclear what to do with data acquired before and after a prolonged delay in the conduct of the trial if a trial is temporarily halted statistical analysis plans may need to be revised to determine how to calculate and manage events that occur during the waiting time delays in recruitment can also alter the temporal distribution of events and hence power calculations may need revisionit may also be useful to select a date to distinguish data collected before covid-19 bc and after covid-19 ac the date should be defined per centre before and after the first documented covid patient is admitted to the local hospital this will allow post-covid-19 sensitivity analyses to be done and ensure for which part investigators may have the greatest confidence in the integrity of the data the date threshold must be specified per site per country andor for the trial overall prior to looking at the trial datait may be useful to describe a prepost covid analysis for all trials that were running at the time of the start of the covid-19 crisis this is for several reasons i the intervention might alter susceptibility to or the consequences of infection ii there may be uncertainty about the cause of events iii any benefit from the intervention may be overwhelmed or exaggerated by the impact of the virus iv delivery of the intervention in the population studied may be affected and finally v the general care or care specifically for hf may be affected eg monitoring of laboratory values for trial participantselectronic monitoring ie records from the hospital may provide an attractive alternative form of monitoring at enrolment patients may be consented for blanket electronic approval and this can provide important information to improve future trials in light of the covid-19 pandemic in some countries patient consent requirements cros for certain data protection issues have been abandoned for all covid-19-related data for clinical purposes17a few examples of actual recommendations given in a convenience sample of ongoing hf trials for some of which the authors are primary investigators are provided in the supplementary material online appendix 3in summary the covid-19 pandemic has caused various issues related to the conduct of clinical trials figure 1 in these challenging times it is our moral and ethical responsibility to keep trial participants safe and to safeguard the investment they have already made in ongoing clinical trials so that we can provide the answers that we have promised to them clearly patients with hf are at serious risk if infected by covid-19 any additional risk from participation in clinical trials should be avoided or minimized this should be a balance against the risk of not receiving optimal therapy which is often only attained when patients participate in clinical trials when they receive expert specialist protocol-driven care provided by the research team it is important to remember the social contract between patients trialists and funders through which patients enter trials in good faith so that they can help improve future healthcare and scientific knowledge the recommendations we make may evolve over time as the epidemiology of covid-19 remains dynamic

 for the podcast associated with this article please visit httpsacademicoupcomeurheartjpagespodcastsin late december 2019 the chinese physician li wenliang warned of unusual cases of pulmonary infection suspecting that a new highly contagious coronavirus might be involved he was not heard within weeks the unthinkable became reality and a pandemic evolved and took its path around the globe what sounded initially like a harmless flu and then suddenly arose as a black swan to the many unprepared was an expected event to virologists and to philanthropists such as bill gates as such nassim taleb who popularized the term1 introduced by sir karl popper almost a century ago2 refused to call it a black swan many national healthcare systems were not well prepared for such an event disinfectant and masks were lacking there were not enough hospital beds or intensive care units icus and ventilators were scarce all things that costed many lives for sure the austerity politics did not pay off in healthcare as it killed many indeed too many in affected countriesfor cardiologists the pandemic was indeed a black swan as the vast majority had never dealt with viruses or epidemics with the exception of a few interested in myocarditis3 as it turned out cardiovascular diseases cvds became the major risk factors for an unfortunate course of the pulmonary infection and a major cause of death in affected patients within weeks cvds came to centre stage in the pandemic as outlined in a viewpoint coronaviruses and the cardiovascular system acute and long-term implications by bernard prendergast et al from the john radcliffe hospital in oxford uk4 the authors remind us that much has been learnt in the course of preceding epidemics including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and h1n1 influenza and it is now recognized that their overall health burden may be underestimated since extrapulmonary manifestations are frequent acute and chronic cardiovascular complications of pneumonia are common and result from various mechanisms including relative ischaemia systemic inflammation and pathogen-mediated damage including myocarditis57 of note influenza vaccination reduces major cardiovascular events in patients with coronary disease8 thus the covid-19 outbreak emphasizes the need for greater awareness of the acute and long-term cardiovascular implications of viral infections and the significant gaps in knowledge that future research will need to address for the benefit of such patientsin a second viewpoint entitled sars-cov-2 should inhibitors of the reninangiotensin system be withdrawn in patients with covid-19 gabriela kuster et al from the university hospital basel in switzerland discuss the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ace-is could foster cell entry of the covid-19 virus and in turn provide a risk factor for fatal outcomes due to up-regulation of ace2 that the virus uses to dock on the cell membrane figure 19 the authors discuss the knowns and unknowns regarding the reninangiotensin system ace-is and sars-cov-2 interaction and provide two interpretations ie 1 a possible negative impact as ace-is which in the meantime appears unlikelyin spite of the well established protective effects of the agents10or 2 reverse causality since patients on ace-is are commonly older and have more comorbidities1113a brief communication entitled cell type-specific expression of the putative sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 in human hearts stefanie dimmeler et al from the johan-wolfgang goethe universitt in frankfurt am main germany continue on the subject14 they determined the tissue levels of ace2 where sars-cov-2 binds via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins they found that ace2 is highly expressed in the lung and heart complementing previous observations that it is increased in myocardial infarction15 although sars-cov-2 mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells it can also cause myocardial injury as assessed by increased troponin t and nt-probnp levels in covid-19-infected patients as further outlined in this issue16the current pandemic coronavirus sars-cov-2 predominantly affects elderly individuals especially men and those with cvd who are often receiving ace-is in their manuscript circulating plasma concentrations of ace2 in men and women with heart failure and effects of reninangiotensinaldosterone-inhibitors potential implications for coronavirus sars-cov-2-infected patients adriaan voors and colleagues from the university medical center groningen in the netherlands expand on this issue with heart failure patients17 they measured ace2 in 1485 men and 537 women with heart failure as the index cohort and validated it in 1123 men and 575 women the strongest predictor of elevated plasma levels of ace2 in both the index and validation cohort was male sex in the index cohort use of ace-is angiotensin receptor blockers arbs or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists was not an independent predictor of plasma ace2 in the validation cohort ace-is were independent predictors of lower plasma ace2 and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists of higher plasma ace2 concentrations thus surprisingly in patients with heart failure plasma concentrations of ace2 were higher in men than in women but use of neither an ace-i nor an arb was associated with higher plasma ace2 concentrations these data might explain the higher incidence and fatality rate of covid-19 in men but do not support previous reports suggesting that ace-is or arbs increase the vulnerability for covid-19 through increased plasma ace2 concentrations these provocative findings are further discussed by in an editorial by gavin oudit from the university of alberta in edmonton in canada and marc pfeffer from the harvard medical school in boston massachuttets in the usa18the impact of cvd on covid-19 outcomes has been investigated in the article clinical characteristics and outcomes of caucasian patients with covid-19 and a history of cardiac disease in northern italy by marco metra and colleagues from the universit degli studi di brescia in italy one of the centres with the highest case load and mortality19 they analysed 53 consecutive patients with confirmed covid-19 and a history of cvd admitted between 4 and 25 march 2020 when the epidemic reached its peak their mean age was 68 years and 81 were males the main cause of admission was either covid-19 pneumonia with a history of cvd in 47 or an acute cardiac condition with concomitant covid-19 in 52 of note 16 presented with acute heart failure 6 with acute coronary syndrome acs and 4 with pulmonary embolism figure 2 during hospitalization 32 died 11 developed thrombo-embolic events 21 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or ards and 11 suffered septic shock non-survivors tended to be older with a higher burden of cardiac comorbidities impaired renal function lower blood cells count and higher d-dimer both high-sensitivity troponin and nt-probnp were elevated at admission in both groups with a trend towards higher levels among non-survivors patients who died were also more likely to have a lower po2fio2 ratio and need for high-flow oxygen support compared with those who lived thus caucasian patients with cvd and superimposed covid-19 have an extremely poor prognosis findings that are put into context in an editorial by pierpaolo pellicori from the hull and east yorkshire medical research and teaching centre in kingston upon hull uk20the impact of viral pneumonia on cvd through various mechanisms is then reviewed in the manuscript entitled deleterious effects of viral pneumonia on the cardiovascular system by ling yang and colleagues from the third affiliated hospital of soochow university in changzhou china21 even though viral pneumonia is regarded as a pulmonary disease characterized by dyspnoea and hypoxaemia cardiovascular events outweigh all other causes of death in many viral pandemics they pursued three aspects i to summarize the knowledge about epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of viral infections in recent pandemics ii to explore the cardiovascular response to these infections and iii to identify coping strategies as experienced in the wuhan epidemic and future viral infection pandemicspandemics such as covid-19 massively affect health services in general as all efforts are focused on the patients affected by it furthermore the outcome of interventions may be affected by covid-19 for both patients and physicians in charge the latter issue is addressed in the current opinon eapci position statement in invasive management of acute coronary syndromes during the covid-19 pandemic prepared by andreas baumbach from st bartholomews hospital in london uk and colleagues on behalf of eapci22 they note that the covid-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to healthcare worldwide as the number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care overwhelms many healthcare systems and negatively affects standard of care leading to collateral clinical damage this position statement aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acs in the context of the covid-19 pandemic modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge various clinical scenarios as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected covid-19 infection presenting with st-segment and non-st-segment elevation acs are described as well as scenarios for re-organization of acs networks with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals in addition to in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac unitsthe issue is also complemented by various discussion forum pieces in a first entitled decline of acute coronary syndrome admissions in austria since the outbreak of covid-19 the pandemic response causes cardiac collateral damage bernhard metzler and colleagues from the university hospital innsbruck in austria discuss the pandemic based on the numbers from their country in another contribution entitled is fulminant myocarditis caused by circulating human coronaviruses ryan dare and colleagues from the university of arkansas for medical sciences in little rock arkansas usa comment on the recent contribution coronavirus fulminant myocarditis treated with glucocorticoid and human immunoglobulin by yuan fang and colleagues from the sichuan university west china hospital in chengdu sichuan china2324 fang et al respond to the contribution in a separate piece25in switching to another antihypertensive effective drug when using aceisarbs to treat arterial hypertension during covid-19 michele mario ciulla from the university of milan in italy comment on the viewpoint article also published in this issue entitled sars-cov2 should inhibitors of the reninangiotensin system be withdrawn in patients with covid-19 by kuster et al 926 kuster et al respond in a separate contribution27the editors hope that this issue of the european heart journal will be of interest to its readersthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 leading to the current coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic is putting high pressure on healthcare systems in several countries in both hemispheres the start and progression of the pandemic varies between regions and countries with some countries outside china currently making phased and tightly-regulated attempts to ease previously imposed social restrictions however many experts argue that this disease may be part of public life for many months to come requiring a long-term plan to cope with a varying influx of patients and protection of healthcare workers while awaiting the development of effective pharmacological treatment 1 2 therefore radiology departments need to remain vigilant to cope with this pandemic for the near futureas known covid-19 is a highly infectious disease submitted through small droplets with a prodromal phase varying in intensity and length preceding the onset of potential severe symptoms in the majority of patients as such the resulting large cohort of non- or mildly symptomatic infected people accelerates spreading of the disease and complicates triage between infected and non-infected patients while covid-19 is predominately characterised by a wide range of respiratory symptoms neurological gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms have been described as well at various stages of the disease 35given the established and fundamental diagnostic role of cardiovascular imaging in modern healthcare and the specific value of cardiopulmonary radiology in covid-19 patients departmental organisation and imaging programs need to be restructured during the pandemic in order to provide access to modern cardiovascular services while ensuring safety for healthcare professionals and other patients the uninterrupted availability of cardiovascular radiology services remains crucial particularly during the current pandemic outbreak to establish a correct diagnosis and to avoid unnecessary complications in different patient populationswhile suspected or established covid-19 patients may have concomitant cardiovascular symptoms and require further imaging investigations non-infected patients with pre-existing or acute cardiac events still must be granted access to cardiac imaging in order not to underdiagnose or delay treatment of relevant cardiovascular disease therefore potential non-infected patients with cardiovascular symptoms should still be encouraged to present to the hospital during the pandemic despite the current social restrictions and a pathway for clinical evaluation and imaging examinations should be providedfinally current imaging protocols should be tailored to the specific situation and provide a fast and comprehensive approach to detect cardiothoracic involvement in covid-19this paper represents a knowledge and experienced-based expert opinion on how to ensure continuous availability of cardiac imaging during the current covid-19 pandemic it may have to be tailored to the local resources workflow and hygiene guidelines and the characteristics of national and regional healthcare systems during the outbreakif possible suspected or confirmed covid-19 patients should be imaged in dedicated covid-19 x-ray ct and mr equipment in the radiology department in order to prevent cross-contamination between infected and non-infected patient populations some hospitals have even resorted to the expedited new installation of such dedicated ct scanners for the exclusive purpose of investigating potential covid-19 patients 8 if this is not possible eg due to a limited number of available primary scanners other scanner types eg spect-ct scanners or the cone-beam function of angiography suites could be used as covid-19 patient scanners for general purpose use the objective would be to either divert potentially infected patients to a specific scanner as previously mentioned or to increase capacity on other ct-scanners who are better suited for cardiovascular applications depending on the local situation notably all scan protocols on non-routine ct-scanners eg spect-ct scanners must be adapted to provide sufficient diagnostic quality for which close cooperation and coordination with industrial partners might be helpfulfinally if a dedicated ct-scanner for infected patients is not available at least dedicated covid-19 time slots on the available equipment must be defined preferable at the end of the day these timeslots can also be made available for the investigation of potential covid-19 patients who require high-quality cardiovascular ct-imaging which may not be available on the dedicated covid-scanneraccess routes to these scanners must be highlighted to transport services and clinicians and also clearly indicated to non-radiology staff these routes as well as the corresponding waiting areas must be separated from normal patient pathwaysthe sars-cov-2 virus has been reported to survive a variable amount of time on several types of surfaces and environmental conditions 9 10 cleaning the imaging facility after every suspected positive patient before scanning a negative patient is mandatory and must be performed according to local guidelines conversely cleaning between scanning of two or even more established sars-cov-2 positive patients is not necessary unless bacterial superinfection is known and local guidelines may differ currently there are no universally accepted guidelines on how to clean radiology imaging equipment for sars-cov-2 although some centres have published their experience proposing different methods and solutions for disinfecting the several components of ct and mr examination rooms 8 lists of disinfectants effective against sars-cov-2 have been published httpswwwepagovpesticide-registrationlist-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2 while a solution of 6271 ethanol 05 hydrogen peroxide or 01 sodium hypochlorite within 1 min of possible contamination has also been suggested 11 additionally several manufacturers have published equipment-specific guidelines for disinfection of their imaging equipment table 1 down-time for disinfection between patients varies according to the local available resources and also on the targeted imaging equipment the immediate availability of cleaning teams for scanners with mixed populations of sars-cov-2 positive and negative patients is advised to achieve maximum safety and productivity

if possible the scanner facilities should be ventilated under low pressure as compared to surrounding rooms similar concept as for septic surgical areas to ensure that potential contaminated aerosols are cleared via the climate controls and do not contaminate scanner control rooms or the corridorpersonal protective equipment ppe for maintaining a safe patient service onsite is of the highest importance however the global market for these products is currently under pressure therefore local health care authorities and professional bodies should be encouraged to help and assist in the buying process of ppe ppe must include a high number of various types of masks ranging from simple surgical masks for general staff to highly protective ffp2 masks for technicians and doctors with direct contact with covid-19 patients protective gowns eyeglasses and eye shields also need to be provided in table 2 we provide an overview on which kind of ppe should be used during imaging procedures to avoid wastage of these precious products all levels of healthcare professionals involved in imaging procedures must be repeatedly taught in the correct use of them 12 finally many hospitals make the wearing of protective masks mandatory to all hospital personnel and incoming visitors

imaging staff must be trained in the correct use of ppe and other measures of infection control mistakes during dressing and especially undressing are the main source for contamination of the staff and the surrounding area furthermore instructions in basic hygiene like handwashing should be implemented local hygiene protocols must be strictly implemented into the clinical workflow with appropriate training 12during the pandemic outpatient throughput should be decreased with cancellation of many elective investigations in order to avoid cross-contamination between in- and outpatients and to refocus inhouse resources if possible work schedules of imaging professionals should be reorganized in teams that are working completely separated teams of radiographers and radiologists should be changed simultaneously if possible this measure is of high importance to decrease the potential impact of quarantine measures on the department if a cohort member of the staff might be infected non-essential meetings must be cancelled andor shifted to virtual online meetings if absolutely necessary meetings should be reduced to a minimum of participants and should be held ensuring adequate distance of more than 15 m in a sufficiently large meeting room when such reconfigurations of the radiology department have been applied in association with protection and education as well as training of personnel some reports indicate that radiology staff can be effectively protected against sars-cov-2 infections 13reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing of a nasopharyngeal mucosal swab is currently the reference standard for proving an active sars-cov-2 infection also used in mild or even asymptomatic patients while rt-pcr has a very high specificity making a positive test pragmatically diagnostic its reported sensitivity varies between 60 and 70 leading to a potential 3040 of false-negative results also due to other factors given their multiple patient contacts under sometimes difficult conditions healthcare imaging professionals are especially at risk for infection and might also transfer this infection to vulnerable patients or colleagues to avoid this pathway of spreading and its potential catastrophic impact on patients and hospital departments high vigilance for potential infections of staff members is necessaryrt-pcr testing policies vary between hospitals regions and countries depending on several factors in many hospitals the rt-pcr test is not indicated for asymptomatic staff members and consequently routine swab testing of asymptomatic hospital personnel for screening purposes is not performed given the indicated lower sensitivity of rt-pcr test a negative result does not necessarily equate to being free of infection possible strategies for follow-up of healthcare professionals who have been in contact with infected patients in- or outside the hospital include self-screening for fever twice a day and vigilance for respiratory symptoms once a healthcare worker shows any clinical sign of infection he must be removed from the staff pool for further investigationantibody testsalso known as serological teststhat detect the immune response to an existing infection are not yet reliable enough and widely available but are currently being developed and prepared for mass deployment they have the potential to play a role in this complex situation results from these tests can help identify who has been infected and has developed antibodies that may protect them from future infections as well as identify those still at risk nevertheless as many questions regarding the individual immune response to sars-cov-2 infection remain unresolved current knowledge is too weak to recommend specific guidelines regarding the timing use and interpretation of antibody testssocial distancing and home working solutions have proven to be efficient barriers against viral spread therefore teleradiology if possible should be implemented to ensure safety of the imaging staff remote reporting within the hospital is also beneficial for working in smaller cohorts with people at home as back-up to in-house staff care must be taken in terms of data protection and technical setup of the outsourced teamsseveral investigators have reported on the involvement of the cardiovascular system in covid-19 patients however at this particular moment in time there is a lack of large multicentre studies and fundamental research to establish the exact mechanism of disease and effect of covid-19 disease on the cardiovascular system nevertheless several reports point to an exacerbated inflammatory response with myocardial injury and heart failure and an increased risk in the presence of pre-existing diseasethe presence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in covid-19 patients significantly increases their reported death rate 105 compared to other pre-existing conditions like diabetes or cancer 14 this is important not only as covid-19 patients with pre-existing cardiac disease form a large proportion of the symptomatic patient population but also as exacerbation of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases and secondary cardiac involvement in case of systemic spreading of the infection may further compromise prognosis 1517in a recent single-centre analysis almost 20 of hospitalised covid-19 patients had cardiac injury ie elevation of troponin i levels associated with an increased complication rate and need for mechanical ventilation compared to covid-19 patients without cardiac involvement 18 myocardial injury has recently been significantly associated with fatal outcomes in covid-19 patients in several series 17 19 in patients with covid-19 pneumonia an age  65 years pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease but especially the presence of cd3  cd8  t cells  75 cell l1 and elevated cardiac troponin i  005 ng ml1 have been identified as important predictors of mortality 20this and other publications report increased troponin levels in association with ecg abnormalities indicating cardiac injury in covid-19 patients a meta-analysis based on 4 studies with a total of 341 patients demonstrated a significant difference in cardiac troponin levels between subjects with severe and non-severe covid-19 disease 21 a main cause of high troponin levels and myocardial injury could be represented by acute myocarditis of varying severity in a few cases the occurrence of myocarditis in covid-19 has been reported but rarely associated with cardiac dysfunction a recent autopsy study has revealed significant viral rna in the heart among other organs exceeding levels of viremia 22 this data suggests that sars-cov-2 spreads of the bloodstream and can infect other organs additionally myocarditis has been associated in the past with other coronavirus diseases as mers 23 24 in a case series of 150 patients 7 of deaths were reported as related to acute heart failure consequent to myocarditis 16 nevertheless the exact relation between the presence of the sars-cov-2 virus and the pathogenesis of myocardial damage is not fully understood and further investigation is necessary increased troponin levels could also be related to acute type ii myocardial infarction mismatch between oxygen supply and demand without unstable coronary artery disease or to plaque rupture caused by severe inflammation type i myocardial infarction such a relation between inflammation and cardiovascular events have been previously reported in influenza and in other coronavirus infections 25heart failure has been reported in 23 of covid-19 patients in one study 26 but case fatality rate among those with pre-existing comorbidity was related to cardiovascular disease in 105 in china15 to date it remains unclear if fatality is caused by acute myocardial injury or exacerbation of a pre-existing cardiac disease cardiogenic pulmonary oedema is relatively common in this situation but the differential diagnosis with ards is not always easy even using imaging and berlin criteria 27 nevertheless a cardiogenic component of the acute failure is important when establishing an ecmo procedureabnormal coagulation parameters have been reported particularly increased d-dimer is associated with a worse prognosis 26 disseminated intravascular coagulation vascular inflammation and prolonged immobilization may contribute to an overall increased thromboembolic risk particularly in patients with rapid clinical worsening and hypoxia pulmonary embolism has to be considered and ct pulmonary angiography may be performed for further investigation 28atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmic events may occur in the course of the disease due to fever hemodynamic stress or volume overload to prevent renal failure ruling out left atrial appendage thrombus by transesophageal echocardiography prior to cardioversion in this setting appears to be of high risk for the performing physician because of the need for intubation of the probe in the patient additionally the procedure is stressful for the patient who may also suffer from shortness of breath due to the underlying disease therefore ccta including a late phase may be considered as a non-invasive procedure in these patients 30 the same holds true for evaluation of valve endocarditis where ccta should also be considered as an alternative to transoesophageal echocardiography but should be carefully read in close correlation with clinical circumstances 31as previously explained patients with covid-19 can develop raised troponin levels especially in an advanced stage of disease with an yet unclear mechanism of myocardial damage or minor thromboembolic events associated to a hypercoagulable state 32 therefore in case of pre-existing or unknown but suspected cardiac disease exclusion of coronary artery disease cad with ccta is helpful to avoid cardiac catheterization the latter being a procedure which under the current conditions is more challenging than usual this crisis might be the moment to expand the utilization of ccta to detect cad in clinical reality as suggested by the current esc guidelines who consider ccta a class i level a indication in patients with chronic coronary syndromes irrespective of age 33additionally coronary cta should be considered in covid-19 patients presenting with acute chest pain and raised troponins without st-elevation at ecg to rule out cad addressing a possible myocarditispericarditis or tako-tsubo disease and as such avoid unnecessary invasive coronary angiography which can be at risk for the operatorfurthermore the ruling out of pulmonary embolism should be provided in covid-19 patients because their increased risk of venous thromboembolism and the common presentation of elevated d-dimers hypoxia and dyspnea 26 if clinical and cardiac symptoms remain unclear triple rule-out protocolseven if they often do not provide perfect diagnostic statements for all diagnostic relevant targetsfor the evaluation of the pulmonary circulation and the coronary arteries might also be considered 16in the assessment of aortic stenosis in the need for surgical or non-surgical aortic valve replacement tavr ccta might be used as an alternative to pre-interventional angiography in an emergency or urgent situation and should be used for device selection and assessment of valve composition 3436ccta in general also provides insights into lung structure and -pathologies in covid-19 patients which is especially relevant in patients with moderate to severe respiratory symptoms or to screen for complications but does not include all lung fields 19 therefore and depending on local equipment it may be considered to add an additional low-dose scan of the whole lung before or after ct imaging of the heart 37 non-gated low-dose ct preferably with iv contrast medium can also be helpful to detect cardiac abnormalities eg right ventricular- or left ventricular dilatation or intracardiac thrombi furthermore as with every heavily diseased patient covid-19 patients could be more affected by side-effects of medication usually administered for cardiac-ct eg beta-blockers we want to underline the possibility of an interdisciplinary discussion with the referring physician to prevent such adverse events due to side-effectsreports are increasing that cmr can detect covid-19 associated myocarditis as a hypercoagulable state is also reported associated with this disease a potential differential diagnosis to myocarditis could be myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries minoca furthermore literature has reported cases of stress-induced cardiomyopathy tako-tsubo syndrome in co-existence with covid-19 38 independent of the sars-cov-2 pandemic differentiating minoca from myocarditis and other causes of acute myocardial injury is possible using cmr and therefore impacts patient management for secondary prevention 20 additionally cmr has the potential to incidentally detect extracardiac findings eg lung involvement pleural effusion which may be clinically relevanthowever direct diagnostic and prognostic implications of cmr imaging in the specific sars cov2 pandemic are actually not known therefore the usefulness of cmr might be limited for the diagnosis and differentiation between myocarditis tako-tsubo syndrome and minoca additionally cmr is more time-consuming than ct and therefore poses a potential higher risk for patients and staff eg because of viral transmission to overcome this obstacle this statement would propose a fast and focused cmr protocol for a comprehensive assessment of cardiac involvement in covid-19 this protocol incorporates cine sequences for functional assessment oedema imaging for detection of acute myocardial injury and t1 mapping as well as late gadolinium enhancement lge imaging for differentiation between ischemic and non-ischemic causes of myocardial injury this protocol should be accompanied by fast one breath-hold sequences for assessment of thoracic complications all efforts to reduce acquisition time eg use of accelerated imaging as compressed sensing or reduction of time delay for lge imaging should be used a proposed imaging protocol is summarized in table 3

indications for cardiac imaging are summarized in table 4

covid-19 related impact on hospital and departmental organisation varies between regions countries and types of hospitals with some hospitals in heavily affected regions accommodating a large proportion of covid-19 patients making them potentially less able to handle outpatients nevertheless the aim should always be to continuously provide safe cardiovascular ct- and mr imaging services in close collaboration with the referring clinicianduring the pandemic all cardiac imaging procedures that are planned in an elective setting should be evaluated carefully their planning adjusted to in-house healthcare guidelines imaging capacity and clinical urgency this is valid for ccta as well as cmr indications for cardiac imaging during the pandemic must have an immediate impact on patient management as the imaging procedure interrupts social distancing and potentially put the sars-cov-2 negative patient at risk for infectionct and mr imaging procedures of confirmed covid-19 negative inpatients may be performed during the inhouse period in order not to delay diagnosis and prevent the patient from undertreatment of a medical condition however depending on the pandemic-imposed burden on the local hospital and its evolution over time proper interdisciplinary communication is necessary to ensure that these examinations are performed at the most adequate moment for patient and staff in order to ensure overall safety and availability of properly disinfected equipment some hospitals may have more ability to continue delivering ctmr imaging services than otherstherefore indications for ccta include all kind of preoperative ccta scans including tavr coronary artery bypass adult congenital heart disease cardiac transplant and rule-out of coronary heart disease as well as pulmonary embolism in the chest pain triage indications for cmr should be tailored to local capacities and the possibility for safe imaging of sars-cov-2 negative patients in case for both conditions are fulfilled patients should undergo normal standard of care and indications may include the workup of acute myocarditis minoca and decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction of unknown aetiology stress testing may be considered as an alternative to cardiac catheterizationrestoring the cardiac imaging program to pre-pandemic levels of activity is and will be challenging as long as there is no established vaccination for sars-cov-2 safety of healthcare professionals and patients must be warranted but at the same time a higher patient turnover will be mandatory as many of examinations were initially rescheduled in the first step patients with subacute indications for imaging in ccta and cmr that were rescheduled should be scanned this should be done in close accordance to the referring physicians eg pre-operative examinations pre-operative scans may be scheduled close to the operations where an up-to-date covid-19 testing will be available if the number of these patients seems to be manageable the program might be reopened to routine outpatients preferably these patients should be contacted in advance in order to have more recent information on their wellbeing patients with suspected covid-19 symptoms should either be tested prior to imaging or rescheduled againthe use of ppe in this phase may be strongly recommended both for patients and for radiographers nurses and radiologists but guidelines may vary depending on the local situation patients should be wearing a surgical mask whereas radiographers and nurses in contact with patients should maintain all necessary precautions in cmr ppe has to be free of ferromagnetic or conducting materials in terms of mr safety nevertheless questions remain regarding the availability and distribution of ppe material to both hospital staff and the general population in many regionscardiac imaging and especially cmr might have an important role after the pandemic as myocardial involvement and changes in myocardial structure by scar induction and consecutive left ventricular dilatation might have an impact on the patients prognosis after surviving a covid-19 episode additionally it is currently not clear which impact covid-19 will leave on lung structure as this might influence right ventricular function and size by the induction of pulmonary hypertension early evaluation of this patient cohort by cmr and ct might be not only of scientific interest it might also have an immediate impact on patient therapycardiac imaging during and after the initial phase of the covid-19 pandemic is challenging patient and healthcare professionals safety must have the highest priority and therefore ppe resources must be provided training and teaching the use of ppe and hygiene procedure on adherence to the actual cdc and who guidelines working in separated teams and if possible the use of telemedicine is of essential importance to avoid virus spreading in health care professionalscardiac imaging services should help to avoid or at least cut down the number of risky invasive or time consuming procedures like cardiac catheterization or transoesophageal echocardiography therefore ccta might be favoured in ruling out coronary heart disease and left atrial appendage thrombus and should be offered to covid-19 positive patients when needed cmr may deliver insights into myocardial involvement in sars-cov 2 patients and discriminate types of myocardial damage due to an associated hypercoagulable state ruling out pulmonary embolism by ct must also be offered to clinicians based on local capacities and possibilities to ensure safe imaging non sars-cov-2 infected patients should undergo cardiac imaging when indicated to prevent undertreatment of cardiac conditionssetting up cardiac imaging program after the first critical phase of the pandemic will have to be tailored to the need of allied disciplines and focused on the safety of patients and healthcare professionals
1 statement of the problem the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china in late 2019 and has quickly become a pandemic significantly impacting the health and economy of the united states and the rest of the world12 there are several hundred thousands of cases and thousands of deaths related to covid-19 the disease caused by sars-cov-2 worldwide with an estimated mortality rate ranging from 1-52 the united states has been impacted by this pandemic significantly with hundreds of deaths reported these numbers will continue to worsen1 this healthcare crisis has imposed an unprecedented strain on society and has challenged the ability of health care organizations to provide adequate careelectrophysiologists play an important role in cardiovascular health with more than 40 of cardiology encounters being arrhythmia-related in a recent report from wuhan china 167 of hospitalized and 444 of icu patients with covid-19 had arrhythmias3 in addition there have been anecdotal reports of patients experiencing late myocardial dysfunction as well as cardiopulmonary arrest with pulseless electrical activity or ventricular fibrillation during the recovery phase of their pulmonary illness the purpose of this joint statement from the heart rhythm society american college of cardiology electrophysiology council and american heart association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee is to address numerous issues facing electrophysiologists and other health care providers managing arrhythmias during the pandemic and to provide corresponding general guidance
2 potential risks of exposure to patients physicians allied healthcare staff industry representatives and hospital administrators sars-cov-2 is a highly infectious virus associated with significant morbidity and mortality individuals may maintain high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract with significant potential for viral shedding and transmission even if asymptomatic45 while primarily transmitted by droplets airborne transmission is possible through aerosolization in the setting of high flow oxygen bronchoscopy open tracheal suctioning intubation extubation non-invasive positive pressure ventilation endoscopy or transesophageal echocardiography6as the prevalence of covid-19 increases exponentially patients presenting with seemingly non-related medical problems may expose health care providers to increased risk of contracting the disease if not properly protected such exposure puts electrophysiology ep staff physicians and other clinical personnel at increased risk of contracting covid-19 reducing contact between health care personnel and covid-19 patients is an integral step in limiting its spread and resource utilization including use of personal protective equipment ppein the hospital the number of individuals rounding should be minimized and social distancing should be practiced for patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection time and personnel spent in the room should also be limited many ep consults may be completed without a face-to-face visit by reviewing the chart and monitoring data non-urgent or non-emergent procedures should be postponed to a later date clinic visits and in person cardiac implantable electronic device cied checks should be converted to tele-health and remote checks whenever feasible minimizing fellow trainee contact with patients may include rotation of days involved in direct patient service managing remote checks and conducting patient tele-health visits attempts should be similarly made to limit exposure of ep allied professionals including nurses device clinic personnel hospital administrators and medical device company representatives additional steps may need to be taken to minimize exposure for higher risk individuals eg age 60 years pregnant immunocompromised and other co-morbid conditions
3 impact of covid-19 on cardiac arrhythmias patients infected with covid-19 can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from an asymptomatic state to severe disease with hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards type lung injury78 in the setting of hypoxemic respiratory failure ground glass opacification on chest imaging is found in more than 507 because the majority of patients will experience only mild symptoms including fever cough headache anorexia diarrhea andor malaise it can be difficult to distinguish covid-19 from the common coldcovid-19 has the potential to cause myocardial injury with at least 17 found to have an elevated troponin and 23 noted to have heart failure in a study of 191 inpatients from wuhan china9 cases of fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock have also been reported with associated atrial and ventricular arrhythmias1011 given that hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities that are common in the acute phase of severe illness can potentiate cardiac arrhythmias the exact arrhythmic risk related to covid-19 in patients with less severe illness or those who recover from the acute phase of the severe illness is currently unknown improved understanding of this is critical primarily in guiding the need for additional arrhythmia monitoring eg mobile cardiac telemetry post discharge and whether an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd or wearable cardioverter defibrillator will be needed in those with impaired left ventricular function thought secondary to covid-19
4 triage of procedures based on screening and personal protective equipment the experiences in china italy south korea and taiwan have informed the need to quickly test and triage patients with suspected infection it is important that all electrophysiologists have a high degree of suspicion for covid-19 in any patient they interact with in the ep laboratory hospital or outpatient setting a thorough travel history and assessment of contact with individualsfamily members who were sick or received hospitalization is mandatory patients with fever cough and upper respiratory symptoms deserve special attention and should be immediately isolated testing for sars-cov-2 along with other respiratory viruses eg influenza respiratory syncytial virus should be pursued
personal protective equipment ppe in patients with suspected covid-19 infection it is recommended that ppe be donned by all clinicians and health care providers this includes a face mask protective eyewear gown and gloves initial ppe recommendations in these patients included the use of fitted n95 or powered air purifying respirator papr masks protective eyewear gloves and gowns however due to a shortage of n95 masks and increased understanding of droplet and airborne transmissibility during routine care of suspected and positive covid-19 patients substitution with a surgical mask with a face shield combination or other protective eyewear during routine non-procedural care has been recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention cdcrecommendations related to ppe may continue to change based on supply chain contingency andor crisis capacity status consultation with the hospital infection control team is strongly recommended appropriate donning and doffing procedures should be followed as outlined by the cdc see useful links below it is also important to be know how to report potential covid-19 cases or exposure to public health authorities local or hospital covid-19 hotlines can be useful in this regard
5 guidance for managing invasive and non-invasive ep procedures clinic visits and cied interrogation due to the increased numbers of covid-19 cases and the anticipated impact on health care resources eg hospital and intensive care unit icu beds ventilators ppe and the blood supply it is recommended and increasingly mandated to postpone or cancel non-urgent elective procedures the definition of what constitutes an electivenon-urgent case should be based on individualized risk assessment informed by the patients clinical status in general it is reasonable to consider deferring any test or procedure that is unlikely to directly impact clinical care or outcomes over the next several months importantly the rationale for delaying non-urgent or elective procedures should ideally be discussed with the patient and documented in the medical record figure 1
 in contrast semi-urgent urgent or emergent procedures include those in which there isthreat to the patients life if the procedure is not performed urgentlythreat of permanent dysfunction of an extremity or organ systemrisk of rapidly worsening to severe symptoms

urgent or emergent procedures 
figure 1
 procedures are considered urgent or emergent if they substantially decrease the risk of clinical decompensation hospitalization or death screening for covid-19 should be performed if suspected and a high level of suspicion for covid-19 infection should be maintainedaventricular tachycardia vt ablation for medically uncontrolled electrical storm in a hemodynamically compromised patientbcatheter ablation of incessant hemodynamically significant severely symptomatic tachycardia svtafatrial flutter not responding to antiarrhythmic drugs rate control andor cardioversionccatheter ablation for wolff-parkinson-white syndrome or preexcited af with syncope or cardiac arrestdlead revision for malfunction in a pacemaker dependent patient or icd patient receiving inappropriate therapyegenerator change in pacemaker-dependent patients who are at elective replacement indicator eri or at device end of life eolfpacemaker or icd generator change with minimal battery remaining depending on specific clinical situationsgsecondary prevention icdhpacemaker implant for complete heart block mobitz ii av block or high grade avb with symptoms or severe symptomatic sinus node dysfunction with long pausesileaddevice extraction for infection including patients not responding to antibiotics or for endocarditis bacteremia or pocket infectionjcardiac resynchronization therapy in the setting of severe refractory heart failure in guideline indicated patientskcardioversion for highly symptomatic atrial arrhythmias or rapid ventricular rates not controlled with medicationsltransesophageal echocardiogram for patients who need urgent cardioversion further guidance on this issue from the american society of echocardiography

semi-urgent procedure 
figure 1
 some ep procedures are not emergent yet clinically may need to be performed in a timely manner due to clinical circumstances often the decision of when to schedule a procedure will depend on the clinical judgement of the ep physician in partnership with the patient and the associated health care teams as noted above appropriate ppe and a high level of suspicion for covid-19 infection is requiredavt ablation for medically refractory recurrent ventricular tachycardiabsvt ablation in patients with medically refractory svt resulting in ed visitsccied generator replacement for eri battery status that is not urgent or emergentdprimary prevention icd in patients at particularly high risk of life-threating ventricular arrhythmia

for suspected covid-19 patients requiring ep procedures it is optimal to await confirmation of covid-19 test status to avoid unnecessary utilization of resources ppe including n95 or papr masks should be used by health care personnel treating suspected or confirmed covid-19 patients requiring conscious sedation which carries a risk for aerosolization with high flow oxygen or intubation close coordination between anesthesia and the ep lab teams is required for general anesthesia cases consideration should be given to elective intubation in the icu or a negative pressure room prior to entering the ep lab as the care team is restricted to the labprocedure room until the procedure has finished staff should pay particular attention to having all supplies and equipment in the room at the start of the case consideration can also be given to performing procedures on confirmed or suspected covid-19 patients in a negative pressure operating room12it is important for hospitals to review the ventilation system of their ep labs to determine if there is sharing of air return that might require disinfection of other rooms where possible procedure time should also be minimized as an example among patients undergoing vt ablation extensive vt induction and activation mapping may be minimized to reduce risk same day discharges after device implant should be considered to minimize the patients risk of nosocomial infection to minimize transport of infected patients direct-current or chemical cardioversions can be performed at the bedside in the icu with suitable anesthesia support lastly when feasible patients with confirmed or suspected covid-19 infection should be scheduled as the last-case of the day given the extensive cleaning required after the procedure the cdcs recommendations for environmental cleaning and disinfection should be followed see link below
limit clinic visits to those considered time-sensitive or urgent where possible in-person clinic visits should be avoided instead tele-healthvirtual visits either secure internet phone or video should be adopted to minimize unnecessary exposurethe majority of incision site inspections post cied implantation or catheter ablation can be managed via tele-health by inspecting the site utilizing a video conference or by asking the patient to send a picture via secure email similarly many of the clinic follow-ups and some new consults can be performed via tele-health leveraging electronic medical record data and obtaining vital signs and ecg tracings using digital wearables where available as the number of app-based technologies evolves they will continue to be an integral part of tele-health examples of low risk patients for whom in-person visits could be deferred include asymptomatic patients with satisfactory cied battery longevity non-dependent pacemaker patients and primary prevention icd patients without symptoms suggesting worsening of heart failure or arrhythmia burden patients on antiarrhythmic drugs such as dofetilide that require qtc and lab monitoring may need to defer testing if prior values and their clinical condition have remained stable and if no new drugs that may prolong the qtc have been added patients with borderline values may need continued access to ecgs and laboratory testing while there have been several studies evaluating the use of mobile ecg devices for qtc monitoring none of the currently available single and six lead mobile ecg devices have been fda cleared for such purposes however regulations are evolving quickly in this areaother urgent or semi-urgent clinical indications can be evaluated in-person on an individualized basis select patients with worsening heart failure or arrhythmia symptoms or for whom there is a need for device reprogramming may warrant office evaluation these include but are not limited to af patients with worsening heart failure icd patients with recent shocks or syncope cied patients with recent symptoms suggesting possible device malfunction eg syncope or heart failure exacerbation or suspected device infection a limited physical examination may well be appropriate based on their clinical presentation when possible in-person visits and procedures should be coordinated on the same day to minimize multiple exposures for the patient in patients coming for outpatient visits measures should be taken to screen patients for concerning symptoms eg fever cough before they present to clinic if suggestive symptoms or a fever are present patients should be re-directed to an appropriate screening clinic or facility with appropriate measures taken figure 2
limit in-person cied interrogation to those considered urgent or time-sensitivein order to minimize exposure of ep staff and device manufacturer representatives to patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection it is prudent to only perform in-person cied interrogations as follows importantly device interrogation programmers cables and wands should be disinfected between all patientsaclinically actionable abnormality of cied noted on remote monitoring telemetry or ambulatory monitoringbicd shocks presyncope or syncope concerning for an arrhythmic event to perform programming changescevaluation of symptoms suspicious for arrhythmia or abnormal device function in patients who are not enrolled in remote monitoringdidentified need for re-programming of the deviceefor cied patients needing urgent or emergent mri scanning consider performing a ct scan instead if possible to minimize the need for additional health care provider or device manufacturer representative contact if not urgent delay the mrifpatients in the emergency department where remote monitoring is not available remote monitoring should be used wherever possible
cardiac electrophysiologists have a responsibility to protect patients their families other caregivers and themselves this includes resource stewardship keeping themselves safe while delivering care and collaboration with other healthcare professionals on the front lines figure 3

6 remote device monitoring a substantial number of ep patients with a cied have remote monitoring which remains a powerful tool for off-site cardiac rhythm management current guidelines give remote monitoring a class i recommendation for routine use in patients with cieds13 despite its effectiveness remote monitoring is significantly underutilized due to a variety of patient- and system-based issues in the midst of the pandemic remote monitoring should be used in most circumstances to reduce the need for non-urgent clinic visits when feasible remote monitoring should be reconsidered in patients who are currently not enrolled
7 resource conservation and training for all personnel as the pandemic spreads and affects more individuals resource conservation becomes even more important accordingly it is critical to conserve valuable resources such as ppe medical and ancillary staff by minimizing routine patient health care that can be postponed in the short to intermediate term while hospitals in currently low incidence geographies may feel confident of their capacity to handle elective procedures current projections predict a spread of covid-19 that is likely to overwhelm resources social distancing limiting exposure of patients with covid-19 infection to other patients and health care personnel and access to testing regardless of the incidence of the infection are critically important steps patient education about these measures should be reinforced at every opportunity
8 tele-medicine and digital health paradigms while effective utilization of tele-medicine pre-dated the pandemic it was largely limited by technical and reimbursement barriers in the current covid-19 crisis adoption of virtual medical services is rapidly increasing the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms have expanded tele-health services to keep people safe and help health care providers focus on individuals who have the most dire health care needs at the present time tele-medicine can be provided by phone and using several secure messaging applications and platforms physicians should familiarize themselves with the federal state and local policiesregulations and follow procedures at their own institutions the office for civil rights ocr for the us department of health and human services recently released a notification of enforcement discretion for tele-health and are allowing the use of any non-public facing audio or video communication product to provide tele-health during the covid-19 crisis to this end the ocr has expressed willingness to forego penalties for hipaa noncompliance among providers enacting good faith measures for tele-medicine during the pandemic14 one unexpected outcome of the covid-19 cloud may be advancement of digital health methodology and practices that leverage smart phones video conferencing systems wearables and remote monitoring
9 cardiopulmonary resuscitation advanced cardiac life
support
 arrhythmia management of covid-19 patients while there are limited published data currently available on arrhythmia management in covid-19 patients such data will be forthcoming the number of personnel in the room of a cardiac arrest victim with confirmed or suspected covid-19 during resuscitation efforts should be minimized all participants should don ppe prior to entering the patient room because of the risk of viral aerosolization consideration should be given to early intubation along with the use of external mechanical compression devices and airborne precautions during intubationat the time of this writing it is unclear what medications may be beneficial for patients with covid-19 off-label use of some medications is currently being investigated while we are not recommending any specific treatment safety guidance for clinicians using hydroxychloroquine hcq may be requested of ep providers hcq is known to block kv111 herg and can cause drug-induced lqt15 the clinical arrhythmic toxicity syncope and torsade de pointes is largely limited to chronic use due to its long half-life of 40 days use of multiple concomitant qt prolonging medications eg azithromycin metabolic derangements renal failure or in the setting of an acute overdose1617 to date it has been widely tolerated in most populations as an anti-malarial and safely used in the rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus populations without ecg monitoring18 because the proposed hcq therapy for covid-19 is relatively short eg 5-10 days the risk of arrhythmic toxicity is likely quite low there are specific precautions to be considered for select patients howeverpatients with known congenital long qt syndromepatients with severe renal insufficiency should have the dose reduced 50 for crcl 10 mlminpatients on qt prolonging drugselectrolyte imbalances eg hypokalemia hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to use with regular monitoring
none of the above conditions is an absolute contraindication if use of hcq is warranted it is reasonable to temporarily stop class iii antiarrhythmic drugs with use of a reasonable alternative if there is evidence of qt prolongation importantly aggressive electrolyte correction can mitigate arrhythmic toxicity ecg monitoring should be considered for patients on multiple qt prolonging medications and avoidance or careful monitoring may be required for congenital lqt patients additional guidance for navigating and circumventing the qtc prolonging and torsadogenic potential of pharmacotherapies for covid-19 has been recently published19
10 concluding statements at this unprecedented time it is important that patients feel that physicians and health care systems are not abandoning them many patients with arrhythmias are among the sickest of those with cardiovascular disease to protect patients many of whom are high risk due to coexisting comorbidities and healthcare teams from covid-19 exposure preserve resources and maintain access to necessary cardiovascular care it is important that nonessential encounters tests and procedures be postponed while electrophysiology is uniquely suited to leverage virtual care and remote monitoring it is important to assure patients that they have our full support and we are ready and able to provide care as necessary11 useful links

 investigations on the outcome of these patients are scarce and data are very limited nevertheless hypertension is considered as one of the most important risk factors for covid19 the relationship between hypertension and adverse outcome is still questionablethe aim of this review paper was to summarize current knowledge about the relationship between hypertension and covid19 and the role of hypertension in outcome of these patients a comprehensive search was performed on pubmed scopus web of science and google scholar to find review papers on this topic published until may 1 2020sarscov2 infection is triggered when the sprotein of the virus binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 which is highly expressed in the heart lungs kidney and gastrointestinal tract and plays an important role in several cardiovascular and immune pathways
20
 sarscov2 binds to ace2 with much higher affinity compared to sarscov
21
 additionally sarscov2 shows its pathogenic activity by attacking type ii alveolar epithelial cells that are expressing ace2 previous studies of coronavirus that causes sars demonstrated that this virus binds to ace2 in pulmonary alveoli through their superficial spike proteins which causes lung damage and even lung function failure
21

the loss of ace2 caused by binding sarscov2 may shift the system to an overall higher angiotensin ii and lower angiotensin17 tone the role of angiotensin ii in covid19 hypertensive patients seems to be crucial due to its role in functioning of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas that promotes vasoconstriction sodium retention oxidative stress inflammation and fibrosis and increases the bioactive peptide angiotensin17

epidemiological data coming from china indicate that arterial hypertension cardiovascular diseases diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most prevalent concomitant diseases in patients with covid19

the prevalence of overweight and obesity was not reported in available studies about covid19 this circulus vitiosus between hypertension obesity and diabetes is difficult to break and therefore conclusion cannot be made without detailed data of all links of chain the impact of smoking should not be forgotten in the relation between copd hypertension and higher propensity to covid19

 the level of renal damage cannot be excluded as one of contribute factor for higher percentage of hypertension and advance stage of covid19 in hypertensive patients most of studies reported the large prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in covid19 patients but they also did not classified them and therefore it is difficult to estimate the individual effect of coronary artery disease heart failure and atrial fibrillation on occurrence and severity of covid19li et al summarized the findings from 6 studies and showed that the prevalence of hypertension cardio and cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with covid19 was 171 164 and 97 respectively
17
 the incidences of hypertension cardiocerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were two to threefolds higher in patients with severe type of covid19 than in their nonsevere counterparts yang et al included 46248 covid19 patients from 8 studies and reported that the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension diabetes cardiovascular diseases and respiratory system disease
18
 the most frequent comorbidities in severe patients were hypertension respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease the large metaanalysis that included 76993 patients with covid19 found that the pooled prevalence of hypertension cardiovascular disease smoking history and diabetes was 1637 1211 763 and 787 respectively 
19
 table 1 the authors of metaanalyses agreed about the large heterogeneity between studies which obviously limited the quality of their study this can be partly explained by different designs and large variation in sample size among studies

some essential data are still missing and it would be dangerous to ascribe the large portion of risk for sarscov2 infection or severity of covid19 to any risk factor including hypertension it would be reasonable to hypothesize that uncontrolled comorbidities as well as combination of concomitant diseases may increase the risk of infection and severity of covid19 but this has to be examinedthere are many controversies about the effect of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb in covid19 patients
24
 some authors expressed their concern that the use of reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitors and variation in ace2 expression may be partly responsible for sarscov2 virulence
25
 
26
 populationbased studies estimated that only small proportion of hypertensive patients in china 30 to 40 is treated with antihypertensive therapy and raas inhibitors are used in only 25 to 30 of treated patients
27
 
28
 therefore it can be anticipated that only small percentage of covid19 patients in china were actually treated with acei or arbon the other hand the prevalence of cardiac damage in covid19 patients is not negligible and it is associated with adverse outcome in these subjects
5
 
6
 data regarding the frequency of heart failure in covid19 patients are scarce and the same is valid for chronic kidney disease from therapeutic point of view acei and arb have important roles in treatment of these conditionscardiac injury heart failure and renal impairment particularly with albuminuria therefore withdrawing raas inhibitors or switching medications would have uncertain benefits but very certain disadvantagesit would be expected that problem with raas inhibitors would escalate in western countries europe and usa where patients are taking antihypertensive medications and particularly raas inhibitors in significantly higher percentage than in china however studies from italy and usa did not show any association between raas inhibitors and susceptibility to coronavirus complications or mortality from covid19
29
 
30
 
31
 even new investigation from china confirmed these findings
32
 the switching from the raas inhibitors to another antihypertensive therapy would lead to insufficient blood pressure control which could induce more complications in covid19 patients than infection of sarscov2 itself novel data showed that raas inhibitors could even improve the outcome of hypertensive patients with covid19
33
 the authors hypothesized that raas inhibitors have an indirect antiviral role by regulating immune function and inhibiting inflammatory responses
31
 based on the available data despite some theoretical possibilities multiple specialty societies recommended that covid19 patients should continue therapy with raas inhibitors
34
 
35
 
36

limited number of studies provided outcome data after a short followup therefore one should be careful in interpretation of these findings guan et al demonstrated that patients with severe covid19 and those with primary end point admission in intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death had significantly higher percentage of hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease copd chronic renal disease and cancer
3
 the authors did not investigate the relationship between different demographic and clinical parameters with severity of disease or the outcomeshi et al reported that hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease copd and cancer were more prevalent in the patients with myocardial injury diagnosed by elevation of highsensitivity troponin i and creatinine kinasemyocardial band ckmb
5
 cardiac injury was associated with significantly higher mortality 521 vs 45 the authors did not investigate which comorbidities were associated with cardiac injury and mortality it must be noted that patients with cardiac injury were significantly older guo et al demonstrated similar results when compared covid19 patients with and without elevation of troponin and found that 278 of patients with covid19 had cardiac injury
6
 in this study chronic renal dysfunction and usage of raas were also more prevalent in patients with cardiac injury however patients with cardiac injury were almost 20 years older and more frequently men than those without injury which also have to be taken into account it was also reported that underlying cardiovascular disease was worsening outcome only in patients with myocardial injury
6
 defining myocardial injury only by elevation of troponin i in these circumstances could be questionable because this biomarker may be increased in many conditions such as inflammation andor sepsissystemic inflammatory response syndrome and kidney injury the authors did not clearly stated which disorders were included under the term cardiovascular disease and it is not clear whether hypertension was included in this term furthermore it is difficult to understand which cardiomyopathies were included and whether patients with heart failure were includedchen et al reported that hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes were more prevalent among covid19 patients who died in comparison with survivors
7
 however there was a large difference in age and sex distribution between groups and authors did not investigate the effect of comorbidities on outcome in this population
7
 table 2 zhou et al reported that hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease chronic renal disease and copd were more frequent among nonsurvivors than in survivors
9
 the authors found that hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease were predictors of mortality in covid19 patients nevertheless none of these comorbidities remained significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for age sex and smoking status these findings confirmed the importance of comprehensive risk assessment by including all relevant risk factors and comorbiditiesin the large original study that included 1590 patients guan et al showed that after adjusting for age and smoking status patients with copd diabetes hypertension and malignancy were more likely to reach the composite end points admission to intensive care unit or invasive ventilation or death than those without
12
 malignancy copd hypertension and diabetes increased the risk of adverse outcome for 35 27 157 and 158fold respectively
12
 patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly higher risk of the composite end point than patients with a single comorbidity stratification of patients according to their age 65 years vs 65 years did not show significant difference in the strength of associations between the number of comorbidities and mortality of covid19
12
 however it cannot be excluded that other confounding factors besides aging and smoking might also be responsible for the association between comorbidities and outcome it would be also helpful to divide primary outcome into two separate outcomes a admission to intensive care unit andor invasive ventilation and b death this would provide separated information about independent predictors of severity and mortality of covid19 this was performed in the small study and authors found that hypertension and diabetes were predictors of acute respiratory distress syndrome but not mortality in covid19 patients
16
 unfortunately multivariable analysis with adjustment for relevant confounding factors was not performed in this investigationthere are a number of limitations in the mentioned investigations the selfreporting of comorbidities on hospital admission represents one of them underreporting of comorbidities due to the lack of awareness andor the lack of diagnostic testing could interfere the associations between comorbidities and clinical outcome more importantly the duration of followup was short and some patients remained in the hospital at the time of publishing these studies which means that real outcome was unknown obesity was not reported in available studies and its influence could not be investigated furthermore only one study reported basal values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure which would help to estimate the percentage of uncontrolled hypertension the same refers to prevalence of patients with uncontrolled diabetes the most of studies included small number of patients which is additional obstacle one should not forget the fact that majority of studies come from china and we should be cautious when extrapolating these findings to other countries with outbreak of covid19 studies should consider all potential sources of bias and confounding which is why additional investigations with improved design are warrantedrecent findings reported that arterial hypertension represented one of the most common comorbidities in patients with covid19 this prevalence ranged between 10 and 34 the impact of hypertension on outcome and particularly on mortality in covid19 patients is not clear due to lack of data studies did not provide evidence that raas inhibitors should be avoided or switched in these patients large studies that will consider all potential sources of bias and confounding factors as well as longer followup are necessary the public pressure to find all answers is very high but physicians duty is to stay rational and has scientific approach to available and upcoming datathe ongoing outburst of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has rattled the entire human population as it potentiates the life-threatening acute medical complications and death worldwide a distinctive coronavirus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-2 has been determined to be accountable for the ongoing covid-19 1 the sars-cov-2 responsible for the covid-19 in human is proposed to be originated in bats and pangolins 2 the first incidence of the transmission from animal to humans has been known to have occurred in wuhan hubei province china in late 2019 3 4 5 since then covid-19 continues to emerge all over the world through the person-to-person transmission of viral droplets the victims encountered by the sars-cov-2 have been reported to develop a wide range of clinical symptoms that include dry cough sore throat fever body pain headache abdominal pain diarrhoea and fatigue 45 in the severe stage the sars-cov-2 infection is known to cause pneumonia acute respiratory failure encephalopathy and multi-organ dysfunctions thereby leading to death 4 5 6 in general coronaviruses have been known to cross the blood-brain barrier bbb and affect the central nervous system cns 7 a growing body of evidence suggests that loss of smell and taste might be the distinct signs of covid-19 which provides a clue that the sars-cov-2 infection affects the sensory inputs and impairs the gustatory and olfactory regions of the brain 89 the sars-cov-2 mediated pathogenicity in the brain has been suggested to be responsible for the respiratory failure leading to death in subjects with covid-19 710 though a substantial portion of sars-cov-2 infected individuals has been recovering from the clinical symptoms the pathological impact of the covid-19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs heart brain and other organs even after the recovery may not be excluded while drug-based therapeutic interventions and establishment of vaccination against the covid-19 are in rapid progress the pathological impact of the sars-cov-2 infection on the brain that alters the neuroplasticity requires an intense scientific focus altogether the unforeseen growing pathological stigma of covid-19 has necessitated the need for the development of pharmacological immunological biochemical genetic based antiviral approaches as well as the cytoprotective treatment regime that could safeguard the organs that are highly vulnerable during covid-19 see fig 1 fig 2
botulinum toxins bonts are bacterial proteins that induces paralysis of muscle and sudden respiratory failure leading to death in human 1112 however very mild dose of the purified forms of bont have been known to yield therapeutic benefits against many diseases including strabismus blepharospasm chronic migraine overactive bladder and also used for anti-ageing cosmetics 1213 ample scientific evidence suggests that the therapeutic roles of bont have been extending as they provide relief from various respiratory failures cardiovascular defects and neurological deficits 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 notably the aforementioned clinical complications have been reported as the clinical feature of covid-19 considering the fact the benefit of therapeutic bont can be repurposed to ameliorate sars-cov-2 mediated various pathological effects including pulmonary failure cardiovascular defects and neurological deficits noticed in cases with covid-19 thus this review article provides 1 an overview on the sars-cov-2 mediated pathological impact on the lungs heart and brain 2 describes the therapeutic uses of bont against pulmonary failure cardiovascular defects and neurological deficits and 3 emphasize the rationality for the possible uses of bont to prevent sars-cov-2 infection and manage covid-19 at various aspectsthe sars-cov-2 belongs to a family of positive-strand rna viruses of the genus beta-coronavirus and it shares genetic similarity with two viral strains that appear to have originated in bats 218 the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 has been recognized as a receptor for the sars-cov-2 19 thus cells that express ace2 are vulnerable to the infection and are considered as the main target of the sars-cov-2 2021 the ace2 gene is highly expressed in the respiratory tract and thus the lungs are the major hotspot of sars-cov-2 infection and its pathogenic events 22 however sars-cov2 infection appears to takes place also in the gastrointestinal tract cardiovascular system brain and other organs that are known to express the ace2 192023 individuals with diabetes obesity hypertension and cardiovascular disorders have been recognised to be highly susceptible to sars-cov2 infection leading to the development of covid-19 1624 the abnormal expression and functions of the ace2 have been linked to diabetes obesity hypertension and cardiovascular disorders 42025 moreover recent findings suggest that the density of the ace2 on the cells increases upon ageing and its expression is found to be higher in men than women since sars-cov-2 appears to affect men than women in many countries 26 while sars-cov-2 infection develops various symptoms in the host acute respiratory distress syndrome ards represents a pathological hallmark of covid-19 27 in many cases pneumonia appears to be the major clinical consequence of sars-cov-2 infection due to prominent proinflammatory process in the alveoli of the lungs 22627 many reports from in vivo and in vitro studies and histopathological findings on the post-mortem human lungs suggest that sars-covs causes apoptosis in alveolar cells and degeneration of small blood vessels of the lungs 1626 27 28 in the intensive conditions respiratory arrest has been a major cause of covid-19 associated death 2526 in addition the available clinical data suggests that a significant portion of covid-19 patients have hypertension and cardiovascular disease 6212429 the medications that are used to manage the symptoms of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders in association with diabetes have been known to induce the expression of ace-2 202223 thus it has been correlated that individuals with hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disorders are at high risk of being infected with sars-cov-2 and developing covid-19 2429 recent reports on the blood parameters indicated the elevated levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in a significant proportion of individuals with covid-19 3031 the elevated levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in the circulation have been known to be the biomarkers of the muscle degeneration and tissue damage in various organs including the heart and liver moreover cardiac arrest has increasingly been noticed as one of the reasons for the mortality associated with covid-19 2931meanwhile sars-cov-2 has been reported to enter into the brain leading to acute neuropathological signatures while the expression of the ace2 in the brain is evident 1032 previous reports have clearly indicated that neural invasion of sars-covs can be facilitated by olfactory neurons through nasal neuroepithelial cells 3334 the presence of the sars-covs in cerebrospinal fluid csf of infected individuals was also evident 35 upon the neural infection the sars-covs can elicit unregulatable neuroinflammatory responses thereby leading to seizures convulsions loss of consciousness encephalomyelitis and encephalitis 7343637 netland j et al reported that sars-covs can invade the brain through the olfactory epithelium and can induce neuronal death in a transgenic mouse model that expresses the human ace2 gene 38 though human subjects with autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis have been reported to be highly susceptible to get sars-cov2 infection neurological abnormalities can increasingly be expected in the critical stage of any individuals with covid-19 39 the viral infections mediated neuropathogenicity in the brain regions that regulate the respiratory cardiac gustatory and olfactory functions might be highly relevant for the covid-19 cases in addition covid-19 may exhibit abnormal regulations of hpa in association with panic anxiety and depression-like disorders which may need an additional line of scientific focus considering the fact the sars-cov-2 infection might impair the brain function at the level of impaired synaptic plasticity neuroinflammation neurodegeneration and abnormal neurogenesis gliosis leading to cognitive impairment and dementia similar to that of other neuro-invasive viruses including herpes simplex virus poliovirus and hiv 40 moreover the ace2 gene expression and functions have been linked to cerebral blood flow cbf in physiological state while it can also be expected that sars-cov-2 infection can mediate abnormal regulation of the ace2 gene 41 a recent study revealed a significant portion of covd-19 victims has been overlapped with signs of cerebrovascular disease 5742 taken together neuropathogenic correlates of sars-cov-2 mediated clinical symptoms in patients with covid-19 requires an intensive assessment at various levels of neurological abnormalities meanwhile implementation of a multifaceted drug that could yield beneficial effects against the clinical symptoms of covid-19 needs to be designated for which treatment option like therapeutic botulinum neurotoxins bonts might serve the purpose to combat covid19bonts are the most harmful biological substance currently known to human 1213 bonts are mainly produced by strains of anaerobic spore-forming bacterium clostridium botulinum 1143 seven major serotypes of bonts have been characterized and designated as type a to g 44 among them bonts types a b e and f have directly been liked to induce lethal human diseases 1112 structurally bonts consist of a heavy and a light polypeptide chains of about 100 and 50 kda in size respectively coupled by a disulfide bridge 1112 the heavy chain of bonts binds to its receptors at the presynaptic terminals of the cholinergic neurons and enters into the cytoplasm of the neurons as receptor-mediated endocytosis where the disulphide bond between two polypeptide chains of the bonts disassociates and gains their activated form 1112 the light chain binds to inactivate the proteins like synaptosomal-associated protein snap 25 vesicle-associated membrane protein vamp and syntaxin that are responsible for the fusion of neurotransmitter containing vesicles with lipid bilayer in the synaptic cleft thereby preventing the release of acetylcholine ach in cholinergic parasympathetic and postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings bonts-mediated blockades of the ach release and subsequent arrest in the cholinergic signalling at the synaptic junctions have been regarded to induce dreadful muscle paralysis and death 1112 bonts are known to induce symptoms like dryness of the mouth and eyes urinary retention fluctuations of the blood pressure abnormal heart rate fatigue and dyspnoea 11 12 13 1445 the lungs are the primary target organ when bonts are inhaled as it induces acute pneumonitis and paralysis of breathing muscle leading to respiratory arrest 11 12 1345 however mild dose of the purified forms of bont has extensively been implemented to treat a wide range of clinical symptoms 11 12 13 notably therapeutic bont has been implemented to reduce the severity of disease and provide a cure clinical conditions that include hyperhidrosis chronic migraine strabismus hemifacial spasms blepharospasm abnormal heart rate dysphagia and urinary bladder dysfunctions 11 12 131745 moreover mild therapeutic dose of bont has clearly been shown to provide beneficial effect against the conditions with obstruction of the lung functions like chronic cough bronchitis asthma and dyspnoea 111214161746besides therapeutic bonts are implemented to attenuate a number of neurological disorders which exhibit characteristics of different forms of movement disorders and cerebral palsy 11 12 13 notably therapeutic bonts have clinically been practised to control the abnormal movement disorders noticed in dystonia huntingtons disease hd spinocerebellar ataxia sca amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als parkinsons disease pd spasticity from stroke and different forms of tic disorders 11 12 1347 though the causative factors and clinical symptoms of the aforementioned disorders are highly dissimilar therapeutic bonts appear to yield beneficial effect regardless of aetiological differences taken together insight into the potential molecular targets of therapeutic bonts would be of great help to extend its curative potential to combat the refractory ongoing diseases in humanthus far sars-cov-2 induced acute ards responsible for pneumonia and respiratory arrest has been implicated as a key determining factor for the extending casualties of the covid-19 crisis worldwide 4 5 6102731 meanwhile cardiac arrest resulting from the sars-cov-2 associated heart failure has also been linked to mortality in individuals with covid-19 24 besides sars-cov-2 appears to enter the brain and elicit the neuropathogenicity in various brain regions that controls body temperature reparation and heart beat 10 studies on the neuropathological studies derived from both patients and experimental animals have strongly indicated that sars-cov-2 can also induce neuropathological outcomes as like other neuro-invasive viruses 810344248 owing to the aforementioned fact li yc and co-workers have recently reported that patients with covid-19 exhibit many neurologic signs and further indicated that the brainstem is highly vulnerable in subjects with covid19 10 moreover the ct and mri based findings revealed that the thalamus medial temporal lobes and subinsular region are affected and development of encephalopathy is apparently evident in the brain of a subject with covid-19 49 considering the fact it can be expected that individuals who have recovered from covid-19 are at high risk of the onset of neurological motor cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms therefore in addition to aiming the druggable strategies at peripheral and systemic levels the brain represents one of the major therapeutic targets to manage the symptoms and to evade covid-19 related mortalities though inhibition of the expression and functions of the ace2 gene using inhibitors may be of help in prevention it would not yield an ultimate cure for positive cases with covid-19 50 apart from the vaccination based prevention of covid-19 in the unaffected population a number of medical measures may be considered in order to manage and provide effectual defence against covid-19 as follows 1 reduction of the viral load by pharmacological genetic interference-based interventions or therapies to boost immunity against sars-cov-2 in positive cases followed by 2 assigning anti-inflammatory regimes to reduce the sars-cov-2 mediated chronic proinflammatory responses 3 supplementation of cytoprotective agents and 4 implementation of neurotrophic support to sustain the neuroplasticity while many drugs can individually meet any one of the aforementioned strategies identification of a single drug or establishment of a strategy with multipurpose therapeutic potentials might be highly appropriate for the momentthe therapeutic forms of bont have been approved by the food and drug administration fda for the treatment of many clinical conditions including chronic headache and dystonia 11 12 13 besides bonts have been licensed for its use as anti-ageing cosmetics 121351 in particular mild therapeutic bont injection has been proven to be beneficial against headache body pain persistent fever chronic cough pneumonia and dyspnoea 11 12 13 14161746 while those are considered as the general clinical symptoms of covid-19 3 4 5 621262730424849 notably a significant portion of patients with covid-19 has been reported to exhibit lymphopenia a condition of having a low level of lymphocytes in the blood 52 therapeutic bont injections appear to elevate immune cell counts including platelets counts in the blood which might help fight the sars-cov-2 as it can enhance antigen presentation and the macrophages-mediated phagocytosis to eliminate the virulent factors 5354 moreover therapeutic bont has been known to avert the irregular heart rhythm even after open heart surgery 55 therapeutic bont injection has been reported to improve blood circulation and oxygen supply thereby improving the survival rate of subjects with ischemic conditions 1256 57 58 besides implementation of therapeutic bont is an eminent clinical practice to manage movement disorders in a wide range of neurological deficits 11 12 13 remarkably therapeutic bont appear to provide neuroprotection against cerebral ischaemic insults 59 eventually the existing list of diseases treated by therapeutic bont are associated with increased levels of ace2 in the respective organs or in the circulation for example abnormal levels and functions of ace2 have been recognized as a biomarker and therapeutic target for chronic headache dyspnoea bronchitis cardiovascular disorders hypertension neuroinflammation and neurological disorders 60 61 62 63 64 while the underlying mechanisms of therapeutic bont on the recovery of the aforementioned clinical complications remains unclear therapeutic bont can be proposed to suppress the expression of the ace2 3758 taken together therapeutic bonts may also be used as a preventive measure against sars-cov-2 infection in population at riskrecently rigorous implementation of many drugs and therapeutic strategies has been envisaged against covid-19 while the prediction of the clinical outcome of the proposed drugs and therapies are the major focus the underlying mode of action and possible adverse effects associated with such therapeutic approaches may not be excluded for example the hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a treatment regime for covid-19 along with azithromycin 65 however there exist some considerable remarks that the antiviral mechanism of action of these drugs against sars-cov-2 or their probable effects to reduce the pathological events of covid-19 remains unknown besides the use of both drugs has been reported to be associated with some fatal side effects 6667 while the transplantation of different types of stem cells has been proposed to improve the outcome of covid-19 68 the use of stem cells has been known to be associated with the risk of developing tumor growth and metastasis 69 however there has been some mounting optimism generated on the implementation of the aforementioned drugs and cell-based therapeutics against covid-19 with stringent regulation and safety guidelines that might be essential for the momentin 2008 the fda indicated the potential dangers of the bont as a therapeutic agent and it further claimed that bont could spread beyond the injection site 7071 notably high doses of bont have been known to elicit adverse effects on the cns 13 toxic effect if any found due to the treatment using bont could be neutralized using available antibodies against bont 72 besides the implementation of antioxidants along with the bont treatment has also been reported to minimize its side effects 73 moreover it has been clearly reported that the adverse effects of therapeutic bont are temporary and reversible 74 the use of bont at a very low dose has been reported to be comparatively safe 12134753 it has been repeatedly demonstrated that very mild doses of bont can attenuate many human diseases even at 10 to 20 units 12134575 eventually a mild dose of bont injection has been an accepted practice for the aesthetic procedure even in healthy individuals despite some rare reports on its adverse effects depending upon some criteria 11135153 a very recent retrospective study by chiu sy in 2020 indicates that the fda approved 400 units of bont as a maximum dose per treatment session to be implemented for the patients with neurological deficits with a 3-month interval 76 even such a high-end dose of bont has been reported to improve the functional outcome in patients without any obvious adverse effects 76 therefore a mild dose of bont can be translated for the benefit of individuals with covid-19 considering the spreading nature of bont from the injection site to distal areas 71 a mild dose of bont can be expected to yield omnipresent positive effects in many organs that are known to be affected by covid-19 taken together a mild dose of bont can be repurposed to combat the pathological stigma associated with multiple organ defects resulting from covid-19 however side effects that could arise from the use of bont may not be completely ignored given that stringent implementation of safety measures and the therapeutic regime of bont against the refractory disease like covid-19 need to be envisioned for the optimization of therapeutic dose and clinical procedure for the bont based therapy administration paradigms diagnostics measures and expected outcomes in different subjects with covid-19 need to be outlined and designated in accordance with established experimental data preclinical studies and human clinical trials under the regulation and guidelines of the global drug authorities scientific bodies and health care associations the human body and physiology have the tremendous ability for spontaneous recovery against many viral infections by a given time frame hence a significant proportion of individuals affected by sars-cov-2 have recovered from the dreadful covid-19 that would shed insight into the underlying mechanism of the disease and signify the possibilities for drug discovery however there is an urgent and unmet therapeutic need for the individuals with covid-19 who are at a critical stage to diminish the mortality rate for which identification and perspectives on the candidate drugs and approaches including the therapeutic bont have become highly important future experiments directed towards covid-19 are needed however to validate the proposed therapeutic effect of drugs like bontthe present exponential incessant in covid-19 requires ultimate eradication therapy while plans like nation-wide lockdown social distancing and self-quarantine have been imposed by many countries to avoid the spread of sars-cov-2 the establishment of vaccination identifying the pharmacological strategies and disease modifying therapies to halt the course of covid-19 has been accelerated among them implementations of ace2 inhibitors 50 hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin 65 enriched plasma from covid-19 survivors 77 mesenchymal stem cell therapy 68 and antiviral drugs of hiv treatment like ivermectin 78 have gained the front-line attention but their therapeutic efficacy needs to be tested against covid-19 adding to that therapeutic bont regarded as a magic bullet appears to have a proven curative effect against many explicated symptoms of covid-19 including the respiratory failure cardiac defects and neurological deficits importantly therapeutic bont has the capacity to migrate from intramuscular injection site to the brain and other organs 71 therapeutic bont is relatively safe and the beneficial effect of a single therapeutic dose of bont appears to be long lasting 79 the therapeutic forms of bont are available under the brand names like botox or onabotulinumtoxina dysport bocouture and jeuveau in all countries thus this article strongly proposes the conception that therapeutic forms of bont can also be considered as a potent treatment against covid-19 however with high precaution measuresdeclaration of competing interestthe author declares no competing interestas the number of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 cases grows more complications associated with the disease become apparent one of the more concerning complications affects the cardiovascular system thus far there is limited information available on the etiology clinical outcomes and management options for cardiovascular complications caused by covid-19 the more common cardiovascular sequalae are acute coronary syndrome cardiomyopathy arrythmia myocarditis cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest 1 interestingly the observed cardiovascular injury is similar to that caused by middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 sars-cov-1 and influenza 1 this review focuses on literature published in the year 2020 on covid-19 induced cardiovascular complications with intention to better understand pathophysiology of this process its impact on clinical outcomes and available therapies in order to understand management options clinical outcomes and mortality associated with covid-19 induced cardiovascular injury it is important to first better understand the pathophysiology babapoor-farrokhran et al highlighted resemblance in pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 with sars-cov-1 and mers-cov 2 they concluded that in all three coronavirus outbreaks angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 receptors played an important role disruption of these receptors causes cardiomyopathy and leads to heart failure not only has covid-19 been linked to the development of severe cardiovascular complications but it was also found to have affinity for patients with underlying cardiovascular disease who are at risk for developing severe complications the mechanism of myocardial injury caused by covid-19 has not been fully understood but the proposed mechanism is thought to be through direct damage to cardiomyocytes systemic inflammation fibrosis interferon and cytokine-mediated immune response coronary plaque destabilization and hypoxia 2rizzo et al also emphasized the relationship between covid-19 and development of cardiac disease in their work they further described the pathophysiology of cardiovascular injury in covid-19 patients through notch signaling that is implicated in both immune response to the viral infection and regulation of cardiovascular function this is an important target for therapies and is discussed later in this review etiology for cardiovascular complications in covid-19 patients suggested by rizzo et al is in line with what babapoor-farrokhran et al proposed earlier but they also commented that cardiac injury could be due to microvascular damage and stress-related cardiomyopathy rizzo et al further explained that sars-cov-2 has potential to directly replicate within cardiomyocytes and pericytes causing viral myocarditis 3hendren et al proposed that in patients with no underlying coronary artery disease cardiomyopathy ventricular arrythmias and hemodynamic instability are the more common presentations of cardiovascular complications 4a number of case series and case studies have been done to help assess risk factors outcomes and mortality related to covid-19 induced cardiovascular complications a case series of 21 patients from washington state with a mean age of 70 years and 52 male was presented by arentz et al they concluded that comorbidities were identified in 86 of cases most commonly chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy developing in 33 of cases 5 shi et al evaluated 416 patients with covid-19 of whom 197 had evidence of myocardial injury patients with myocardial injury had a significantly higher mortality rate at 512 when compared to patients without myocardial injury at 45 in patients with myocardial damage a greater degree of elevation in high-sensitivity troponin i levels was associated with higher mortality rates 6 guo et al researched the impact of pre-existing cardiovascular disease cvd and new myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in covid-19 patient population of the 187 patients in retrospective single-center case series they evaluated 278 developed a new myocardial injury causing cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias they concluded that while myocardial injury is associated with fatal outcomes in covid-19 patients clinical prognosis for patients with pre-existing cvd but without superimposed myocardial injury is favorable based on these results covid-19 patients with known underlying cvd and evidence of myocardial injury require more aggressive therapies 7 interestingly there have been a few cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as broken heart syndrome in covid-19 patients takotsubo cardiomyopathy oftentimes presents similar to an acute myocardial infarction with a marked elevation in troponins and motion wall abnormalities on echocardiogram but no coronary artery disease on catheterization chadha reported a case of takotsubo in an 85-year-old female with no underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease the reported case was brought on by severe anxiety over the current covid-19 pandemic 8 dabbagh et al presented another case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy from covid-19 that was further complicated by large hemorrhagic pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of tamponade this patient responded well to treatment with pericardiocentesis steroids hydroxychloroquine and colchicine 9 minhas et al and kir et al reported observed cases of takotsubo in covid-19 patients with the case presented in kir et al also manifesting in rarely seen high-grade atrioventricular block 1011given high mortality and poor outcomes associated with cardiovascular complications from covid-19 available treatment options need to be discussed it is important to have a management plan for st segment elevation myocardial infarction stemi and non-st segment elevation myocardial infarction nstemi during the pandemic mahmud et al emphasized the importance of keeping covid-19 induced cardiac complications in mind when evaluating patients with st elevations and choosing reperfusion therapy during the pandemic percutaneous coronary intervention pci should remain the standard of care for patients with stemi and if pci is not available fibrinolysis should be considered on the other hand in order to limit healthcare worker exposure patients with nstemi should be managed with stabilization strategies if hemodynamically stable given acuity of these interventions and oftentimes lack of known covid-19 status it is important that all healthcare professionals are adequately attired with personal protective equipment if the patient has stemi and pci is necessary 12 hendren et al also recommended a conservative approach with no extensive cardiac workup for covid-19 patients with elevated troponin but who are otherwise medically stable on the other hand they summarized that covid-19 patients with ventricular arrythmias and hemodynamic instability require a full cardiological evaluation and consideration for experimental therapies and clinical trials 4while cardiovascular sequelae bear poor outcomes and high mortality for covid-19 patients there are no guidelines on early screening or prevention of these complications atallah et al recommended screening covid-19 patients using high-sensitivity troponin to better triage patients into high- or low-risk groups if symptomatic patients should be monitored with troponin daily and if troponin is normal levels can be monitored longitudinally to predict potentially worsening disease because surviving patients had minimal elevation in troponin levels using a high-sensitivity troponin to screen for possible severe complications and poor prognosis early may be beneficial 13naksuk et al expressed concern that in addition to virus-induced cardiovascular damage therapy that is currently being used for treatment of covid-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can cause irreversible cardiomyopathy or worsen underlying cardiac dysfunction both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine along with other therapies used such as favipiravir lopinavirritonavir macrolide agents and piperacillin-tazobactam can cause atrioventricular block bundle branch block and qtc prolongation due to multiple investigational and off-label drug use with uncertain cardiac safety profiles and limited resources for cardiac monitoring and drug-drug interaction there should be clear protocols of how these therapies should be used and cardiac monitoring should be provided to patients on multiple agents that could affect the heart function 14an important therapy target was previously discussed by rizzo et al notch signaling pathway is implicated in both immune response to virus infection and regulation of cardiovascular function sars-cov-2 entry into the cell is facilitated by binding of the viral spike glycoprotein to the ace-2 receptor followed by the proteolytic cut of the s glycoprotein by the host protease furin the number of ace-2 receptors on cell membrane is regulated by adam17 the notch signaling is a positive regulator of furin and negative regulator of adam17 prevention of notch signaling pathway activation can interfere with viral entry into the cells by reducing furin and increasing adam17 notch signaling pathway can be used as a possible target therapy to prevent sars-cov-2 infection from progressing to cardiac disease 3 hendren et al proposed that prior experience with sars-cov-1 may guide current management of cardiovascular complications with anti-viral agents interleukin-6 inhibitors and convalescent serum 4cardiovascular complications from covid-19 are quickly becoming one of the more concerning sequelae of this disease just like the previous outbreaks of coronavirus sars-cov-2 acts through ace-2 receptors and causes cardiac injury though direct damage to the cardiomyocytes systemic inflammation fibrosis interferon and cytokine-mediated immune response coronary plaque destabilization and hypoxia comorbidities especially underling heart disease make patients more predisposed to severe cardiovascular complications covid-19 patients who develop myocardial injury have a higher mortality rate compared to those who do not interestingly a number of takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases related to covid-19 have been reported more research needs to be done to further assess that association it is important to consider covid-19 induced cardiac injury when evaluating stemi and nstemi for stemi pci should remain the standard of care while nstemi given hemodynamic stability should be managed with stabilization strategies in order to limit healthcare worker exposure monitoring hospitalized covid-19 patients with high sensitivity troponin can help screen for possible severe complications early multiple investigational and off-label drugs with uncertain cardiac safety profiles are currently being used in the treatment of covid-19 therefore telemetry should be provided to patients on multiple agents notch signaling pathway is an important target for therapy to prevent cardiovascular complications other therapies that can be used to control the cardiovascular injury from covid-19 are anti-viral agents interleukin-6 inhibitors and convalescent serum more research needs to be done to assess effectiveness of these therapiesthe pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 mediated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 viral infection is a serious geometrically expanding worldwide public health emergency with newly recognized manifestations being appreciated and reported daily the very high contagiousness of covid-19 is largely attributed to its rapid community transmission high virulence and sustained surface viability the presentation of covid-19 varies considerably from rare asymptomatic cases to mild flu-like symptoms including high fever to severe respiratory illness the sars-cov-2 pathogen is a single-stranded rna virus with the gravest clinical pathophysiology being a severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the newly evolved virus has an estimated 10- to 15-fold greater mortality rate than the usual seasonal haemophilus influenzae-mediated respiratory illness 2a critical cases are characterized by rapid respiratory deterioration septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure 3 29 contemporary infection rates and rolling updates are continuously displayed on the world health organization who covid-19 websitein this perspective report we focus on the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a key receptor for sars-cov-2 in different organs of the body including the lung heart and kidney we shall also discuss the physiological role of ace2 in the testis and the theoretical adverse effects of sars-cov-2 on the male reproductive system as the virus may have the potential to use ace2 as a route to infect this part of the body since there is only anecdotal evidence and concern in the literature as to the adverse effect of the coronavirus family specifically sars-cov-2 on male fertility we call for urgent targeted research on this topic to clarify this aspect from the current wave of the pandemicsars-cov-2 which belongs to the betacoronavirus genus has been recently sequenced 14 and has been shown to have many similarities with the original sars-cov first reported in 2002 spike proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have almost identical three-dimensional structures in the receptor-binding domain that maintains van der waals forces they have been shown to share 765 identity in amino acid sequences and to possess a high rate of homology 32 similar to most viruses the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 enter the host cell type 2 alveolar epithelial cells by receptor binding followed by endocytosis genome replication exocytosis and budding 7 while both viruses have been shown to recognize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor as their host receptor sars-cov-2 binds to ace2 receptor more efficiently than sars-cov increasing its damaging pathogenicity and its ability of sars-cov-2 to transmit from person to person 8 25 26 ace2 receptor recognition is the first step of viral infection as it is the key determinant of host cell and tissue tropism pathogenicity and subsequent viral replication however ace2 the entry receptor of the virus also plays a crucial role against lung injury 33ace2 is a transmembranal zinc metallopeptidase with high homology to the classic ace but contains a single catalytic domain both ace isoforms are part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas a cardinal endocrine system that plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance whereas ace catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin i ang i into angiotensin ii ang ii ace2 is responsible for the generation of angiotensin 17 ang 17 from ang ii while ang ii exerts deleterious effects on the heart lungs kidneys and the brain via angiotensin ii type 1 at1 receptors 10 the ang 17-mas receptor axis provokes beneficial balancing and salutary actions on these vital organs as evident by vasodilatory anti-inflammatory antifibrotic and diureticnatriuretic actions 21 22 interestingly ace2 is widely expressed in many organs including the heart kidney lung intestine liver and testis 4 28among several extra-respiratory organs ace2 is highly expressed in the human testis 5 23 this raises the question of whether covid-19 in males via the ace2 may have adverse reproductive implications especially in young men planning to have childrentypical components of the raas have been found in the testis and epididymis in the human and mammalian animal models 2 11 18 20 for instance the receptor mas has been identified in rat testis 16a and mouse 1 testis it starts to increase around puberty and reaches its maximal expression during reproductive life ace2 expression in the testis is restricted to the leydig and sertoli cells in humans 6 similarly mas mrna in the testis is localized to leydig and sertoli cells being much more pronounced in leydig cells 1 knockout mammalian models specifically to various components of the raas such as mas-knockout mice showed aberrant expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function and testicular steroidogenesis 11 30 however unlike the case for alveolar cells it is not yet known whether cells involved in spermatogenesis depend on intact ang 17 for functional integrity and this can be studied as a basic question in relevant model systemsrecently the expression pattern of ace2 in adult human testis at the level of single-cell transcriptomes was shown to be predominantly enriched in spermatogonia leydig and sertoli cells 27 in the clinical setting ang 17 and mas were detected in the seminiferous tubules as well as in the interstitial compartment mainly leydig cells in men with normal spermatogenesis however neither components of the raas were found in the seminiferous tubules of infertile men with nonobstructive azoospermia 20taken together the raas specifically ace2 seems to play an important role in male reproduction accumulating evidence suggests that the raas components are involved in human male regulation of steroidogenesis testosterone production and spermatogenesis in the testisan additional concern of the covid-19 pandemic that might impact male fertility is fever particularly high and sustained elevation in body temperature is a major manifestation of the covid-19 pandemic which complicates more than 80 of patients 12 the concept that fever and elevation of testicular temperature result in impairment of spermatogenesis is widely accepted 9more importantly emerging evidence indicates that a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 might have a secondary cytokine storm syndrome hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 16 this is an underrecognized hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by sustained fever with fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multiorgan failure these patients have a particular serum blood cytokine profile with cytopenia and hyperferritinemia these findings also suggest that immunomodulatory therapy il-6 antagonist may improve mortality rate considerably in these patients 16 24as cytokines contribute to testicular function and maintenance of male reproductive health and to the pathologies associated with their abnormal activity in this organ covid-19-induced changes in cytokines profile may have further implications to male fertility 13 in addition immunomodulatory therapies may provoke potential long-term effects on male fertility and are a matter of concern furthermore cytokine microenvironment deviations within the testis may have tumorigenic adverse effects on the cellular level leading eventually to testicular cancer a second long-term matter of concern 13to the best of our knowledge no clinical studies on male fertility investigated survivors from the previous coronavirus epidemics sars-cov commenced in 2002 and mers-cov commenced in 2012 this may be due to the fact that these viruses are much less contagious in comparison to the sars-cov-2 and the epidemics were short-lived and of limited scope to date only 8098 and 2538 people were infected worldwide by the sars-cov and mers-cov respectively who website it is also possible that the effect of these previous epidemics on male fertility were not explored in targeted studies one study analyzed the pathological changes of testes from six patients who died of sars suggesting sars-cov orchitis 31 all biopsies displayed widespread germ cell destruction with few or no spermatozoon in the seminiferous tubules sars viral genomic sequences by in situ hybridization were not detected in all specimens although immunohistochemistry demonstrated abundant igg precipitation indicating possible immune response as the cause of the damagein contrast as of april 28 2020 the number of confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 is 3073356 and the pandemic continues to evolve the highly contagious nature of the sars-cov-2 virus using ace2 as the receptor of entry to both the lungs and testis it is imperative to seize the opportunity to investigate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on male fertility one non-peer-reviewed retrospective study examined the impact of sars-cov-2 on male sex hormones in 81 hospitalized patients in their third to sixth decade of age 15 serum luteinizing hormone levels were higher in the sars-cov-2 group compared with controls while there were no differences in serum follicular stimulating hormone or testosterone levels another recent non-peer-reviewed study examined 34 recovering adult chinese male patients 2055 yr of age following confirmed covid-19 diagnosis while six men had mild scrotal discomfort at the time of disease suggesting viral orchitis in none of these men was sars-cov-2 detected in their semen 2936 days following recovery 17 one major limitation of both studies is the fact that the authors did not report sperm counts and viability of covid-19 patientsace2 is abundant in the adult human testis as it is in the lungs kidney and heart and the sars-cov-2 virus uses ace2 as its receptor of entry clinical and translational studies are needed without delay to determine the effects of sars-cov-2 on human spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis in the testis to inform medical consultation with infected men especially those in the reproductive years this may be of greater importance for men already known to have a sperm production problem the issue of sperm banking following sars-cov-2 infection and its safety should also be evaluated since all infertility and in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer treatments are presently deferred this may be the best time to conduct these targeted studies before returning to our routine endeavorsno conflicts of interest financial or otherwise are declared by the authorjsy za and ks created and developed the concept jsy drafted manuscript jsy za and ks edited and revised manuscript jsy za and ks approved final version of manuscriptin the united states viral respiratory infections are a leading cause of illness and hospitalization in infants 1 2 infectious complications range from upper respiratory tract diseases such as the common cold croup and otitis media to lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia children and especially infants with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk of morbidity from respiratory illness following cardiac surgery when compared to matched controls 36despite limited data cardiac surgeries in infants are often delayed 46 weeks for suspected acute respiratory infection prior to surgery due to symptoms or positive laboratory testing recommendation for surgical delay is based on concerns for prolonged hospital length of stay los and respiratory complications following surgery however there is no standard for clinical or laboratory screening tests to be used pre-operatively to evaluate for occult respiratory infections in infants undergoing cardiac surgeries peri-operative questioning of families for risk factors prior to surgery has been used but is not standardized the introduction of multiplex molecular tests using polymerase chain reaction pcr provides a rapid screen for respiratory viruses in asymptomatic children with results available within a couple of hours 7 8 theoretically detection of viruses pre-operatively could be used as a tool to decrease the incidence of post-operative complications in infants who are positive and avoid unnecessary postponements in surgery for those with negative testing however there are no data showing the effectiveness of either viral diagnostics or peri-operative questionnaires in the absence of significant symptoms the clinical impact of viral respiratory pathogen detection or positive screening for risk factors on post-operative outcomes following cardiac surgery in infants is unknownthe primary objective of this study was to prospectively estimate the prevalence of respiratory viruses using molecular testing in asymptomatic infants presenting for low complexity heart surgery during the winter season and to evaluate the impact of positive viral detection on hospital length of stay hlos cardiac intensive care unit length of stay cicu los intubation time and respiratory complications following cardiac surgery in infants deemed suitable for cardiac surgery by clinical evaluation the secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the value of a screening questionnaire as a predictive tool for the presence of viral pathogens as well as the impact of a positive questionnaire on outcomes listed abovewe hypothesized that post-operative outcomes would be worse in infants testing positive for respiratory pathogens by molecular testing or by our study questionnairethe eligible cohort consisted of infants 1 month to 1 year undergoing cardiac surgery consecutively admitted to our tertiary cicu during typical respiratory illness seasons over 2 yearsinfants were included if they were deemed free of respiratory infection and cleared to undergo cardiac surgery following pre-operative clinical evaluation by existing standard practice infants never discharged from the hospital following birth those with known genetic syndromes excluding trisomy 21 and those with symptomatic or clinically diagnosed respiratory infections at the time of surgery were excluded trisomy 21 was included as it encompasses a frequent patient population that requires surgery in infancy with the majority of cases requiring low complexity cardiac surgery such as tetralogy of fallot tof atrioventricular canal avc and ventricular septal defect vsd repairscardiothoracic and cardiology surgery lists were used to identify patients meeting inclusion criteria subjects meeting study criteria were recruited during their

anesthesia pre-operative screening see appendix the study survey queries for detailed information related to signs and symptoms of respiratory illness within 2 weeks of surgery presence of sick contacts exposure to second hand smoking immunization status palivizumab and influenza vaccination status history of prematurity asthma or reactive airway disease and pre-operative use of bronchodilators the questionnaire was distributed to parents after the standard pre-procedure history and physical exam were done and patients were felt to be suitable surgical candidates for the purposes of this study a positive questionnaire was defined as the presence of one or more general or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks of surgery or a history of exposure to sick contacts during this time perioddemographic and clinical information was obtained for each enrolled infant general demographics included gender age and weight at surgery history of prematurity defined as  37 weeks gestational age history of trisomy 21 or other underlying conditions such as heterotaxy laryngomalacia pulmonary hypertension tracheoesophageal fistula diaphragmatic hernia or gastroesophageal reflux

defined as p  005 and all tests were two-tailed data were analyzed using r v34 11sixty-nine infants were enrolled and had demographic data collected during the study period eleven of the enrolled patients were excluded either because of inadequate respiratory samples n  4 assay failure n  1 or incomplete questionnaires n  6 thus fifty-eight 58 subjects had complete data collection and were included in the analysis overall subject mean age was 167 days with thirty-six 62 between 1 and 6 months of age twenty-three 40 patients had at least one additional underlying condition including prematurity n  6 trisomy 21 n  5 heterotaxy n  2 laryngomalacia n  2 pulmonary hypertension n  3 tracheoesophageal fistula n  1 diaphragmatic hernia n  1 or gastroesophageal reflux disease n  3 of the three patients with pulmonary hypertension one had trisomy 21 with unbalanced avc palliated with pulmonary artery band while another had a vsd closed using amplatzer device the final patient with pulmonary hypertension had a non-trisomy 21 avc and a history of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia thirty-nine 67 patients had a biventricular surgical repair via median sternotomy with 33 57 of the procedures falling within rachs categories 12 the most common defect was a vsd and thus the most common surgical procedure was closure of a vsd table 1 compares demographic and clinical features of subjects with positive and negative pre-operative molecular testing there were no significant differences in baseline demographics between infants with positive vs negative pre-operative viral respiratory testing with the exception that there was a greater proportion of patients who were on pre-operative oxygen supplementation in the pcr group this difference was most likely due to a higher percentage of patients with trisomy 21 single ventricle physiology and underlying co-morbid conditions in the pcr group

seventeen 30 infants tested positive for a respiratory virus on the day of surgery by molecular methods viral detections are shown in table 2 14 82 of positive patients had a single pathogen detected while 3 infants 18 had two viral pathogens detected among the twenty viruses detected pre-operatively human rhinovirus was the most common hrv n  12 60 followed by respiratory syncytial virus rsv n  3 15 coronavirus cov n  3 15 and parainfluenza piv n  2 10 none of the patients tested were positive for non-viral pathogens

outcomes of study cohorts are shown in table 3 outcomes for infants who tested positive for a respiratory virus on the day of surgery were similar when compared to those with negative pre-operative testing furthermore there were no statistical differences in clinical outcomes when comparing infants who were pre-operatively tested positive for hrv to infants who were tested positive for other viruses additionally when comparing patients with single virus detection to dual virus detection post-operative outcomes including post-operative cicu and hlos were similar however the length of post-operative intubation time was longer the incidence of pulmonary complications higher and the use of oxygen at discharge more frequent in patients with dual detection table 3

seven 12 infants developed respiratory symptoms at an average of 4 days after heart surgery and were clinically tested for infection four of these seven patients had positive assays three tested positive for hrv 75 and one tested positive for rsv 25 with two of the four having the same viral pathogen detected pre-and post-operatively 1 rsv and 1 hrv patients with post-operative respiratory symptoms who subsequently tested positive n  4 or negative n  3 for a viral pathogen had significantly longer hlos cicu los and intubation time when compared to those not tested for infection n  51 oxygen therapy at home discharge was common among patients pcr post-operatively 50 or not tested 39 however none of the three patients tested negative post-operatively required home oxygen at discharge as one patient died before discharge and the other two had biventricular repairs with a prolonged length of stay during which the oxygen was weaned off prior to discharge table 4

thirty-eight subjects 66 were considered to have a positive screen for risk of acute respiratory infection using the study questionnaire of the 17 infants who tested positive for viruses at the time of surgery 13 76 had a positive questionnaire while 25 of the 41 infants 61 who tested negative had a positive questionnaire patients who developed symptoms and tested positive for virus n  4 had a 75 positive screen those who tested negative n  3 had a 67 positive questionnaire post-surgical outcomes were not different between infants who had a positive questionnaire versus those with a negative questionnaire table 5

the study questionnaire had low reliability for identifying molecular testing positive subjects p  0001 the accuracy sensitivity specificity positive predictive value ppv and negative predictive value npv were 50 95 ci 3763 76 95 ci 5093 39 95 ci 2455 ppv 34 95 ci 2642 and npv 80 95 ci 6191 respectivelythe key finding of our study was that almost a third of otherwise healthy infants deemed fit to undergo low complexity cardiac surgery by standard pre-operative history and physical findings had a respiratory virus detected by molecular testing additionally nearly two-thirds of our study subjects were positive by the screening study questionnaire for risk of respiratory infection however neither the detection of respiratory viruses by molecular testing nor a positive questionnaire identified asymptomatic infants at risk for poor post-operative outcomesthe introduction of polymerase chain reaction pcr based diagnostic platforms that can detect multiple pathogens in a single sample has increased the positivity rate and decreased the turn-around time for detection of common respiratory pathogens in contrast to viral detection methods that evaluate cell-killing or viral antigen presentation molecular assays do not require live organisms for detection therefore while rates of detection are generally higher in symptomatic individuals these tests are sometimes positive in asymptomatic children 12 for instance in one study nuclear acid testing nat increased pathogen detection from 4 to 42 of hospitalized children without symptomatic respiratory viral infection when compared to conventional testing such as enzyme immunoassay eia and direct fluorescent antibody dfa 7 thus while pcr testing is a very sensitive test for the detection of pathogens 13 positive testing may not identify or predict symptomatic illnessin the present study we were unable to demonstrate a difference in post-surgical outcomes in infants with positive pre-operative pcr testing when compared to those who tested negative this result is most likely due to the highly sensitive nature of multiplex nucleic acid testing and thus positive testing may not be indicative of clinical infection this is in contrast to altman et al 14 who examined the utility of pre-operative testing utilizing nasopharyngeal eia for respiratory viruses in children 16 days to 4 years of age undergoing heart surgery twenty-two patients were rsv positive and their surgery was delayed for approximately 24 weeks retesting prior to delayed surgery was not reported 14 the authors concluded that peri-operative screening for rsv was useful as it may prevent important post-operative morbidity mortality and cost related to hospitalization secondary to community acquired rsv infection 14 an important difference between altmans study and the present study is the difference in diagnostic testing the eia assay detects antigens from actively replicating viruses whereas pcr testing only requires the presence of viral dna in the sample this may explain the difference in outcomes between altmans study and our ownpre-operative testing has also been employed in children before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation this practice has been advocated for testing on symptomatic patients in order to detect viral infection before transplant and positive testing has resulted in delay of transplantation when feasible however the practice of testing in asymptomatic patients may not be necessary and warrants further study 15 16 similarly in our study pre-operative identification of respiratory viruses by rapid molecular testing in the absence of clinical symptoms did not predict increased morbidity or mortality correspondingly patients in the present study who became symptomatic post-operatively whether they tested positive or negative did have a significantly prolonged los intubation time and more freqeuent respiratory complications this is consistent with previously published studies in the literature suggesting that screening should not be routinely employed unless respiratory symptoms are present 36 14similar to previous studies hrv was the most common virus detected in our study when multiplex molecular testing is utilized in 2016 self et al investigated the prevalence of respiratory viruses in 832 children with community acquired pneumonia and used 521 asymptomatic children as controls they identified a virus in 69 of children with pneumonia and 25 of asymptomatic controls hrv was the most common virus identified in the asymptomatic control group accounting for over 70 of the viral isolates 17 interestingly this same study also showed that asymptomatic hrv detection declines with increasing age as hrv was detected in 24 of asymptomatic children less than 2 years of age while in only 08 of adults older than 18 years of age 16 the presence of hrv pcr test result in otherwise asymptomatic children does not necessarily represent at an at risk group of patients this is especially true in light of the fact that hrv has shown to persist in 50 of children for up to 2 weeks beyond the acute infection 12 however unlike hrv rsv hmpv and piv viruses are considerably more short-lived and rapidly cleared from the respiratory tract after an infection 18 in a 2014 swedish study influenza rsv and hmpv were identified in less than 1 of 209 asymptomatic controls 19 thus unlike hrv they are rarely detected in asymptomatic children however if identified they almost always progress to clinically evident respiratory disease 17 18 with the advent of molecular testing postponing surgery in pcr hrv infants could result in the inappropriate delay of timely cardiac surgery future studies will need to address at what age pcr testing for hrv may in fact predict adverse outcomes while our study did not show a difference in outcomes for infants with rsv hmpv or piv identified pre-operatively our numbers were quite small further study is needed to determine if detection of these viruses prior to surgery should be considered in the decision-making to proceed with surgeryit has been theorized that molecular testing may facilitate early detection of respiratory viruses even prior to the onset of symptoms when virus loads are low in theory this may have the benefit of viral detection in asymptomatic patients and aid in the prevention of transmission within the hospital unfortunately there are no studies that address the impact of isolation of asymptomatic patients and thus it is not clear that this is an appropriate use of pcr testing 7 additionally isolation has a significant impact on resource utilization by limiting nursing ratios and bed availability and can negatively affect patient care 20our study used a questionnaire that was felt to be a more comprehensive and uniform tool in identifying infants at risk for respiratory infection than the standard pre-anesthetic screening used at our institution we found that two-thirds of all patients 66 in the study had a positive questionnaire however a positive questionnaire did not predict adverse hospital outcomes nor did it correlate with the presence of a virus by pcr testing in similar fashion to our study malviya et al used a questionnaire to identify children with active uri symptoms presenting for cardiac surgery not surprisingly they found children with uris had a higher incidence of respiratory complications longer duration of mechanical ventilation and icu length of stay compared to those without symptoms 21 it is possible that our questionnaire was too broad and a more targeted questionnaire would more accurately predict post-operative risk this may merit further study in addition in our study the use of supplemental oxygen was a frequent practice both pre- and post-operatively due to the location of the hospital at high altitude in general many patients go home on oxygen therapy regardless of cardiac anatomy at least until their first post-operative visitthe strengths of our study included its prospective design and enrollment during several respiratory seasons the study is limited by the relatively small number of patients tested in a single center in addition infants tested were otherwise healthy coming from home and undergoing low complexity cardiac surgery which clearly creates selection bias the questionnaire was not externally validated the majority of infants positive for respiratory viruses had hrv limiting our ability to evaluate the effect of pre-operative detection of viruses such as rsv parainfluenza or hmpv on post-operative outcomesdespite a positive molecular testing in a third of infants cleared for cardiac surgery during respiratory season and a positive study questionnaire in more than half the post-operative outcomes of this cohort were not worse compared to test negative subjects screening for respiratory infection using molecular testing or a risk survey in asymptomatic otherwise healthy infants undergoing lower complexity cardiac surgery appears not to be an effective strategy to identify infants at risk of post- operative complications postponement of cardiac surgery based on its detection by pcr testing is not supported by the literature nor the findings of the present study but needs further investigationcardiovascular patients show increased risk of severe forms of coronavirus 2019 covid-19 infection 1 2 clinical manifestations are principally respiratory but some patients may also show cardiovascular complications 1 the present article reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the relation between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas particularly ace2 and covid-19 and between raas blockers and covid-19in human physiology peptides are degraded by a limited number of non-specific extracellular enzymes known as peptidases or proteases these are membrane proteins the active sites of which face the extracellular space endopeptidases cut within the peptide chain while exopeptidases release c- or n-terminal amino acids angiotensin-converting enzymes are exopeptidases carboxypeptidases relatively specific to the amino acids surrounding the cut site although these may be common to several peptides it is therefore important to be aware that a given peptidase is not as such specific to a given peptide angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is an enzyme carboxypeptidase mainly located in the membrane circulating forms being created by enzyme splicing of the membrane anchor it is homologous to the angiotensin-converting enzyme formerly simply known as ace but now better denoted ace1 first described in 2000 3 4 ace2 down-regulates the renin-angiotensin system and acts as a deactivator of angiotensin ii also known as angiotensin-1-8 an active peptide causing vasoconstriction pro-fibrosis pro-inflammation action stimulating aldosterone secretion by binding to the at1 receptor converting it into angiotensin-1-7 an active peptide with opposite properties to angiotensin ii 5 several animal studies showed that angiotensin-1-7 by binding to the mas receptor induced vasodilatation and showed anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammatory properties 6 fig 1
 angiotensin ii is also deactivated by an aminopeptidase which converts angiotensin ii into angiotensin iii which induces vasodilatation and increases natriuresis and bradykinin by preferential binding to at2 receptors with 30-fold greater affinity than for at1 receptors 7 8 ace2 also converts angiotensin 1 also known as angiotensin-1-10 into angiotensin-1-9 of unknown action which is further converted into angiotensin-1-7 by ace1 the raas can thus be divided into an activator system comprising the classical and historical angiotensin iiace1at1raldosterone pathway and an inhibitor system comprising the angiotensin-1-7ace2masr pathway the latter able both to deactivate angiotensin ii and counter its effects the pharmacology of the angiotensin-1-7ace2masr pathway in contrast to the angiotensin iiace1at1raldosterone pathway has been little explored but some in-vitro studies showed beneficial cardiovascular impact when activated possibly involving gmpc-8 9 10 11 12 elevation ace2 has also been reported to interact with the angiotensin-1 receptor at1r targeted by angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb arbs counter at1r-mediated effects of angiotensin ii thus stimulating angiotensin ii liberation in response to this increase in angiotensin ii they thus increase ace2 expression 13 ace2 seems to be expressed by the cells of various organs including heart kidney vessels

shows the latter to be identical to that of sars cov 21 despite the two viruses being distinct and showing no more than 80 homology moreover the affinity of sars-cov2 for ace2 is greater than that of sars-cov 22 23 this spike protein activation by tmprss2 proteases followed by sars-cov2 binding to the extracellular domain of membrane ace2 explains how the virus binds to and penetrates the cell see fig 1 in reference 5 conversely circulating soluble ace2 while it can bind to sars-cov2 is unable to induce cell infection experimentally antibodies targeting sars-cov seem also to block sars-cov2 binding to ace2 suggesting possible therapeutic strategies notably by repositioning certain protease inhibitors 24certain in-vitro studies reported a positive correlation between membrane expression andor tissue activity of ace2 and risk of covid-19 infection 25 moreover by binding to ace2 the virus induces a decrease in the ace2 tissue activity thus aggravating covid-19-induced inflammation in organs such as notably the lung 26 one study reported decreased membrane expression of ace2 in mouse lung following sars-cov administration concomitant with respiratory impairment 14 in this context the administration of arb losartan improved respiratory function perhaps by restoring ace2 membrane expression and tissue activity thus the level of ace2 membrane expression andor tissue activity may influence onset of covid-19 infection and thus the risk of developing more severe inflammatory tissue injuries likewise in a recent retrospective study of 175 chinese covd-19 patients requiring hospital admission 62 showed hypokalemia which the authors explained by altered angiotensin ii deactivation by a shift in ace1ace2 balance reduced ace2 tissue activity under covid-19 in favour of ace1 thus inducing aldosterone synthesis and hypokalemia occurrence 27 fig 1 if this hypothesis is confirmed mineralocorticoid receptor blockers may be able to contribute to correcting this hypokalemiatherefore it is clear that ace2 and particularly its membrane expression and tissue activity play a key role in covid-19 infection the exact roles however are complex and may be deleterious in the contamination phase as ace2 acts as a receptor to covid-19 and severity may correlate with membrane expression and tissue activity 28 29 while being beneficial in the inflammatory lesion phase 5 30 many questions thus remain at present unanswered to our knowledge there are no pharmacologic ace2 activators or inhibitors available to date in humans some groups suggested using circulating soluble ace2 to capture as many viruses as possible in plasma restricting their fixation on cell-membrane ace2 and thus limiting cell infection in-vitro studies showed that genetically engineered recombinant soluble ace2 could be a useful therapeutic option 20 31 moreover soluble ace2 might favour the angiotensin-1-7ace2masr pathway over the angiotensin iiaceat1raldosterone pathway preventing or treating severe inflammatory tissue lesions 14 human recombinant soluble ace2 is an fda-approved treatment since 2013 with a 2017 phase-ii trial in acute respiratory distress syndrome 32 which would allow rapid transfer to covid-19 a dedicated clinical trial is to be launched soon nct04287686angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei principally inhibit ace1 thus blocking angiotensin ii release fig 1 action on ace2 has never been reported and they are thought to have no such effect 33 34 acei like arb are widely prescribed as maintenance therapy in several chronic cardiovascular diseases including arterial hypertension heart failure and diabetic nephropathy in-vitro models free of covid-19 reported that acei and arb treatment increased membrane expression of ace2 especially in the heart 9 16 35 in-vitro findings in the few human studies of healthy covid-19-free subjects were discordant 36 37 38 39 it should also be borne in mind that circulating ace2 levels may not match membrane expression and tissue activity the latter possibly varying depending on the tissue certain in-vitro studies reported very low levels of circulating ace2 despite high membrane and thus tissue expression 40 there is also no evidence on the impact of aceiarb on pulmonary expression of ace2 notably in the context of covid-19some groups suggested that increased angiotensin ii expression may underlie a compensatory response by increasing ace2 expression in humans only arbs could thus induce ace2 elevation as aceis inhibit angiotensin ii release 13 likewise arbs by blocking at1 receptors may favour conversion of angiotensin ii into angiotensin iii enhancing the benefit of at2 receptor activation fig 1 it should also be keep in mind that cardiovascular diseases themselves and notably ischemic cardiopathy heart failure arterial hypertension and diabetes were associated with increased ace2 membrane expression and tissue activity in non-covid-19 animal models independently of aceiarb administration 2 41 42 43 the clinical situation infection contracted not yet contracted patient with or without cardiovascular history and covid-19 infection probably plays a major role some studies reported high levels of aceiarb in covid-19 infection and especially in severe forms requiring hospital or icu admission although it should be noticed that arterial hypertension is very common especially in the elderly for which aceiarb is prescribed in 2530 of cases 5 thus the positive or negative impact of aceiarb in covid-19 in humans remains unknown and is complex 44 possibly even depending on clinical stage negative in the contamination phase but beneficial in the tissue inflammation phase 45 46 studies of this question are forthcoming nct04330300 early data extracted from a retrospective study performed in china with potential confounders factors exhibited reassuring results with a possible beneficial effect on mortality of aceisarbs 47 some authors suggest that arbs but not aceis may provide benefit in covid-19 infection by preventing onset of severe tissue lesions 28 48 two clinical trials of losartan arb in covid-19 with or without hospital admission are due to be launched nct04312009 and nct04311177thus many scientific societies including the french society of arterial hypertension sfhta and european society of cardiology see httpwwwsfhtaeup6670 and many publications 5 49 50 advise against stopping maintenance treatments in an attempt to prevent covid-19 infection especially as imbalance in blood pressure and heart failure may be deleterious there remains the difficult and unanswered question of long-course aceiarb therapy in case of covid-19 infection especially when severe an individual and personalised attitude seems essential considering clinical presentation and severity hemodynamic respiratory and renal failure blood pressure etc and the indications for acei or arb non-complicated hypertension heart failure with impaired lvef etc it should also be noticed that the effects of acei and of arb in covid-19 infection are unknown and that the two may not be the same guidelines may be rapidly revised in the light of incoming data from ongoing clinical trials especially concerning arbother antihypertensive and cardiovascular drugs such as dihydropyridines 51 52 53 the combination sacubitril-valsartan 54 thiazide diuretics 55 and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists 56 57 58 affected in-vitro ace2 tissue expression regarding beta-blockers we retrieved a single in-vitro study reporting no impact of atenolol on aortic tissue expression of ace2 59 we found no studies of the impact of loop diuretics on tissue expression of ace2 although impact is physiologically conceivablethe present theoretical concerns around ace2 aceiarb and covid-19 require more detailed and dedicated human studies it now seems clear that ace2 is the key point for sars-cov2 cell-entry and it therefore represents a reasonable pharmacological target reducing ace2 membrane activity and tissue expression especially in the lung to prevent infection or reduce severity in patients not or not yet experiencing inflammatory lesions may represent a valuable option to prevent onset of severe inflammatory tissue lesions especially in the lung on the other hand the angiotensin-1-7ace2masr pathway should be favoured to the angiotensin iiaceat1raldosterone pathway in order to increase ace2 membrane expression andor tissue activity as pharmacological and therapeutic target eg by arbs circulating soluble ace2 is also a therapeutic option that is actually evaluated all these questions are currently unresolved and are being scrupulously investigated in ongoing trialsthe study was supported by the socit franaise de pharmacologie et de thrapeutique collge national des pharmacologues mdicaux and association pdagogique nationale des enseignants en thrapeutiquethe authors declare that they have no competing interestthe world is facing the challenge of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus sarscov2 which results in a disease syndrome known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 this disease started as an outbreak in wuhan china in december 2019 and at may 23 2020 the virus had spread to 216 countries areas and territories across the world with 5 103 006 confirmed cases and 333 401 deaths
1
 on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared the disease a global pandemicthe clinical spectrum of covid19 appears to be wide encompassing asymptomatic infection mild upper respiratory tract illness and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure systemic inflammatory syndrome and even death
2
 the respiratory tract is the primary target for sarscov2 virus however cardiovascular involvement has been documented in different studies and the heart is involved in 40 of patients dying from covid19 disease
3

cardiovascular complications of influenza and coronavirus infection including myocarditis acute myocardial infarction and exacerbation of heart failure have been documented during previous epidemics with significant impact on both morbidity and mortality
4
 underlying myocarditis has been described with electrocardiographic changes troponin elevation and echocardiographic evidence of diastolic and systolic dysfunction in previous coronavirus epidemics adverse outcomes including hypotension arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death have been reported in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease
5

patients with preexisting comorbidities are thought to be at an increased risk of infection with sarscov2 and also tend to have worse clinical outcomes specifically patients with cardiovascular disease diabetes and hypertension are thought to have a high complication rate with mortality rate of 105 reported in cardiac patients and mortality rates of 73 and 60 for diabetes and hypertension patients respectively
6

men are at higher risk in the covid19 epidemic they are admitted to hospital at higher rates and suffer higher degrees of morbidity and mortality united states data from the covid19 net dataset may 9 2020 found that men represented 529 of the hospitalized population as compared to 471 being women a report of 5700 patients from a new york hospital system found that men represented 603 of the admitted patients covid19 mortality in this study was higher in men than in women at every age
7
 the pathophysiology and significance of male predominance of covid19 disease is uncertain further study is ongoing in this areaas age increases so does the risk of developing severe covid19 disease data from the cdc in the united states reveal that patients with covid19 disease less than 19 years of age have a risk of hospitalization that is 2 to 3 compared to a risk of hospitalization that is greater than 31 in patients above the age of 85
8
 furthermore no patients in this cohort less than 19 years of age required icu care in the age group 20 to 45 years the hospitalization rate was 2 to 4 and in the 75 to 84 year cohort the rate of hospitalization increased to 11 to 31
9
 a trend was noted for increasing mortality with age in the united states with case fatality rates of 01 to 02 in patients less than 44 years of age and 104 to 273 in patient 85 years or older
9
 recently there have been reports of a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with covid19 disease resembling kawasaki disease in children
10
 much remains unclear about how commonly this occurs and what the risk factors may bepatients with preexisting comorbidities are thought to be at an increased risk of infection with sarscov2 and tend to have worse clinical outcomes specifically patients with cardiovascular disease diabetes and hypertension are thought to have a high complication rate with mortality rate of 105 reported in cardiac patients and mortality rates of 73 and 60 for diabetes and hypertension patients respectively
6
 in a review of 1590 chinese patients hypertension cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease diabetes hepatis b infection copd and chronic kidney disease were found to increase the risk of severe infections with covid19 disease in this study when looking at a composite endpoint of icu admission mechanical ventilation and death this end point was reached in 45 of patients with no comorbidities 193 of patients with one comorbidity and 285 of patients with 2 or more comorbidities
2
 this suggests increasing severity of disease as the number of comorbidities increase studies in the united states have suggested that obesity may also be a risk factor for severe covid19 disease
7

experience from the united states and uk have suggested that raceethnicity may play a role in the severity of covid19 infection data from the cdc found that in patients hospitalized for covid19 disease black patients represented 33 of the covid19 inpatient population while representing only 18 of the community in general respectively
11
 this suggests a disproportionate impact on the african american population indigenous peoples have also been noted to be at increased risk from covid19 disease in the united states the rates of covid19 cases have been documented to be four times as high on reservations when compared to the country as a whole
12

aside from race and ethnicity other socioeconomic factors have been shown to worsen outcome with covid19 disease nursing homes and assisted living facilities have proved to be areas of easy spread with high subsequent morbidity and mortality both inmates and correctional staff in us prisons have been documented to be at risk homeless shelters have also been identified as being at risk for covid19 disease
8

there are only few postmortem studies however histopathologic changes are consistent with diffuse alveolar damage reactive type ii pneumocyte hyperplasia hyaline membrane formation intraalveolar fibrin exudates epithelial damage along with loose interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrates
17
 intravascular coagulopathy was noted in an autopsy study with fibrin thrombosis of small arterial vessels in 87 of specimens microvascular thrombosis and hemorrhage linked to extensive alveolar and interstitial inflammation that shares features with the macrophage activation syndrome this may explain the severe hypoxemia which characterizes the clinical feature of ards in covid19 patients
18
 limited cardiac autopsies have shown some interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates but no virus has been identified in cardiac tissues
17

laboratory results for patients with covid 19 exhibit elevated cardiac biomarkers mild elevation of cardiac troponin levels less than 2 to 3 times of upper limits of normal have been observed and thought likely to be due to possible preexisting cardiac condition andor acute injury related to covid19 in patients with severe and fatal covid19 higher levels of cardiac troponin more than five times upper limits of normal suggests severe respiratory failure tachycardia systemic hypoxemia myocardial injury either from potential direct or indirect viral myocarditis endothelial dysfunction or plaque rupture triggered by covid19 infection with subsequent acute coronary syndrome takotsubo syndrome or progression to multiple organ failure
19

severe inflammatory andor respiratory illnesses is usually accompanied by elevated bnpntprobnp high bnpntprobnp levels correlates with the extent of right ventricular stress elevations of ddimers have been associated with poor outcome ddimer on admission greater than 20 gml fourfolds correlates with covid19 patients inhospital mortality
20

the actual incidence of myocarditis with covid19 infection is undetermined however it is assumed that up to 7 of the covid19related deaths are linked to myocarditis the spectrum of symptoms may vary from mild symptoms such as mild chest pain dyspnea and fatigue to more severe symptoms with left and right ventricular failure cardiogenic shock arrythmia and sudden cardiac death with fulminant myocarditis
21
 although there is no strong evidence supporting direct covid19 viral myocarditis so far the viral rnas of merscov and sarscov which are close relatives of sarscov2 have been found in the heart tissues of infected animals covid19 myocarditis is likely due to a combination of direct cell injury and tlymphocytesmediated cytotoxicity which can be augmented by the cytokine storm syndrome
21
 covid19 induced myocarditis may mimic an acute coronary syndrome with st segment elevation and elevated enzymes due to acute cardiac injury and hence providers should be aware of this presentation
22
 figure 2the most commonly reported arrhythmia in covid19 disease is symptomaticasymptomatic tachycardia bradycardia has been also reported arrythmia may occur in the setting of myocarditis myocardial ischemia and in critically ill patients with hypoxia and shock
23
 other forms of arrythmias have been reported several mechanisms may trigger or aggravate arrhythmias in subjects with covid 19 potential causes include electrolyte disturbance mainly hypokalemia adverse effects of therapies eg chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and azithromycin that prolong qt interval with potential development of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia vt
24
 and fever which may unmask cases of cardiac channelopathies such as brugada syndrome and long qt syndrome
6

there are no clear statistics on the incidence of st segment elevation myocardial infarction stemi from intracoronary plaque rupture or obstruction in the setting of covid 19 disease and it is likely low acute coronary events may be triggered by plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis due to inflammationincreased shear stress in high risk patients tam et al reported a significant decline in the number of patients with stemi seeking medical care at their institute
25
 they attributed this to the reluctance of patients to go to a hospital during the covid19 outbreak delays in evaluating patients with stemi after hospital arrival due to precautions such as detailed travel and contact history symptomatology and chest xray taken together this may delay patient transfer to catheterization laboratory additional precautions taken in catheterization laboratory such as time needed to wear protective gear may further delay intervention
25

there is a lack of data on the incidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction acute left ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock one study demonstrated heart failure in 52 of deceased patients and 12 of discharged patients
2
 many critically ill patients may develop reversible sepsisrelated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular dilatation impaired systolic function and recovery within 7 to 10 days
21
 covid19 infection can cause decompensation of underlying heart failure and may lead to mixed shock syndrome combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock invasive hemodynamic monitoring if feasible may be helpful to manage the cardiac component of shock in such cases
26

it is too early to predict long term cardiovascular outcome for patients who have recovered from covid 19 infection however the potential outcome may be similar to that seen in the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by the sarscov virus the outcome studies of patients who recovered from sars and were followed for 12 years showed that 40 had cardiovascular abnormalities 60 with altered glucose metabolism and 68 with abnormal lipid metabolism
25

covid19 infection is associated with a prothrombotic state causing venous and arterial thrombosis and elevated ddimer the reported incidence of cerebrovascular disease among severe covid19 patients varied from 23 to 22
27
increased production of antiphospholipid antibodies has been suggested as a possible cause of ischemic stroke
28
 stroke has been found to be associated with a 25fold increased disease severity in patients with covid19
27

laboratory and autopsy results have found evidence of a hypercoagulable state with severe covid19 infection coagulation factors and platelets are involved in modulation of the host immune response displaying proinflammatory functions that are independent from their hemostatic effects elevated ddimer has been linked to worse outcome
20

there are various medications new and established that are currently being tested in randomized clinical trials rct for the treatment of covid19 disease chloroquine an old antimalarial medication and hydroxychloroquine used in treating some rheumatologic conditions showed good invitro activity against the virus and there was great excitement about the potential of these medications in the early stages of the pandemic
29
 however the rcts so far have not shown any benefit for chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine rather a study had to be stopped midtrial due to side effects of therapy as 11 patients died in the group taking chloroquine in an analysis of a multinational registry of 96 032 patients from 671 hospitals in six continents mehra and colleagues
30
 found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used alone or with a macrolide on inhospital outcome for covid19 each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased inhospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of covid19 complications of the drug include severe cardiac electrical abnormalities electrical irregularities in the heart such as polymorphic vt torsade de pointes long qt syndrome and increased risk of sudden death
19
 remdesivir a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral rna polymerases and which was initially developed to treat the ebola virus has also shown good invitro activity against the sarscov2 virus
29
 clinical trials on remdesivir are currently ongoing and two trials have reported a reduction in time to clinical improvement in patients who took the drug compared to placebo
31
 convalescent plasma and tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody against interleukin6 are other therapies that have shown some promise in reducing severity of illness in case series but the results of rcts on these are still awaited
32

the renin angiotensin aldosterone system raas is a complex hormonal system that is comprised of the interactions of renin angiotensinogen angiotensin converting enzyme ace angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 angiotensin ii and aldosterone in summary raas is a system that responds to a physiologic state of hypovolemia hyponatremia adrenergic activation and hypotension and activates a system that increases vasoconstriction and fluid retention
33
 ace2 plays a role as a negative regulator in this system the spike s protein of sarscov2 enables the virus to enter into the host cells by binding to ace2 protein on the cell membrane this is similar to the mode of entry of the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscov which caused an epidemic in 20022003 the ace2 receptor is found in the cells of the upper respiratory tract and the alveoli of the lung and is the primary site of entry of the virus in the body
34
 it is also found in other tissues in varying amounts including the gastrointestinal tract which is probably the reason for a common presenting symptom of diarrhea and heart muscle which might explain the cardiac manifestations of covid19 diseasethe involvement of the raas system in viral entry makes it pertinent to consider the effects of medications that modulate the system angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs are common medications that are used to treat hypertension in a large study of a cohort of covid19 patients it was shown that there is an excess prevalence of hypertension in severe cases with poor outcomes suggesting that these medications might play a role in the pathology of the infection
3
 in that cohort of 1099 patients 165 15 of those patients had hypertension but 24 358 of the 67 with poor outcomes defined as admission to an intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death were hypertensiveacei and arb cause upregulation of ace2 and this is thought to increase viral entry 
35
 on the other hand markedly elevated angiotensin ii levels were noted in plasma samples from sarscov2 infected patients and were linearly associated with viral load and lung injury indeed enhanced ace activity and decreased ace2 activity have been shown to contribute to lung injury in mouse models
33
 this suggests that medications like acei and arbs which decrease ace activity and increase upregulation of ace2 might have beneficial effectstherefore from a theoretical standpoint acei and arbs might facilitate viral entry into respiratory cells leading to viral mediated cell damage but on the other hand these same medications might upregulate ace2 and ameliorate the acute lung injury caused by the virus it is not clear which of these activities are predominant in individuals with covid19 and further research is needed in the meantime most current cardiology guidelines recommend that patients on acei and arbs should continue taking their medications as usual an should not discontinue them with covid19 disease
36

statins are effective cholesterol lowering drugs that act primarily by blocking the 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoa hmgcoa reductase enzyme it was found that statins particularly pitavastatin bind strongly to and inhibit the sarscov2 main protease mpro a key coronavirus enzyme which is a potential drug target
37
 this will need to be explored in further studiesnonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids are medications that work by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme that produces prostaglandins and are commonly used for the relief of pain and fever initial public concern for these medications in the context of covid19 was raised by the french minister of health in midmarch and the basis of his concern appeared to be an anecdotal report of four patients who had appeared to worsen in the context of nsaid use these medications have been shown to increase the expression of ace2 on the cellular membranes and could theoretically increase viral entry into respiratory cells
38
 however aside from case reports there is no other evidence that nsaids lead to poor outcomes in covid19 patients and in contrast one nsaid indomethacin has shown in vitro evidence of inhibition of rna synthesis of the sarscov1 virus independent of its cyclooxygenase activity
39
 more studies will be needed on this but given this concern many european countries have suggested that in patients with respiratory tract infections acetaminophen should be used in preference to nsaids for control of pain and fever
40

this review has examined the cardiac complications of covid19 and also sheds a light on peculiar characteristics of the virus and its relationship with cardiac therapies particularly acei and arbs more research is ongoing on various aspects of this novel coronavirus and clinicians are watching keenly to learn as much as they can in the processthe authors declare no potential conflict of interestsviral respiratory infections vri are one of the leading causes of hospitalization during the first year of life 1 the most prevalent viruses are respiratory syncytial virus rsv rhinovirus bocavirus and others 23 some strategies are used in selected children including those with congenital heart disease chd to prevent vri-related hospitalizations like palivizumab 45children with chd have altered lung mechanics decreased lung compliance and increased pulmonary vascular resistance therefore they are more susceptible to complications of vri especially when they undergo open-heart surgery 56clinical detection of a vri in children after open-heart surgery is a challenging task and potentially lead to unnecessary use of antibiotics depending on the magnitude of the problem more aggressive intervention towards vri prevention may be neededthe frequency of vri and the most prevalent agents in children with chd undergoing heart surgery at our hospital are not known our hypothesis is that vri are highly prevalent in our patients and that they are associated with poorer outcomes we aimed to determine the frequency of vri in children submitted to heart surgery for chd and to estimate their impact on major outcomes duration of mechanical ventilation length of hospital and icu stay and mortalitywe used ibm spss 200 chicago il results were expressed as mean standard deviation median range or counts proportions according to data type and distribution the frequency of vri was calculated by dividing the number of cases of vri by the number of patients for comparison between groups with and without vri we used fishers exact test students t-test or mann-whitneys u test as appropriate multivariate logistic or linear regression models were used for binary or continuous outcomes respectively to identify the influence of a vri on the major outcomes independent variables were presence of vri age and stat category effect sizes were estimated by parameter estimates and significance of these associations were assessed by 95 confidence intervals a significance level of 005 was adoptedin univariate analyses the two groups did not differ in any of the studied outcomes duration of mechanical ventilation p  009 arteriovenous oxygen difference p  071 vasoactive-inotropic score p  085 extubation failure p  047 picu and hospital length-of-stay p  010 and 016 respectively surprisingly mortality was lower in patients with vri 20 vs 35 p  033 although not statistically significant due to the small number of patientsto better understand these apparently similar outcomes in patients with and without vri multivariate regression models were used to adjust for age and stat categories 13 versus 45 in multivariate logistic regression models the odds-ratio or for death was strongly influenced by age at surgery but not by stat 4 or the presence of a vri the or for extubation failure was not influenced by any of the predictors in multivariate general linear models arterial-venous oxygen difference d a-v o2 and the vasoactive-inotropic score vis were not influenced by any of the predictors length of mechanical ventilation was only influenced by stat 4 and not by age at surgery or the presence of a vri length of ventilatory support invasive and non-invasive and hospital stay were influenced by age at surgery and stat 4 but not by the presence of a vri finally picu length-of-stay was influenced only by age at surgery but not by stat 4 or the presence of a vri overall the presence of a vri did not affect the major outcomes these results are depicted in table 4 table 5
in this cohort 27 patients 56 were given antibiotics because of suspected postoperative bacterial infection of these five patients were positive for vri but had negative cultures for bacteriawe found a high frequency of children with a vri undergoing open-heart surgery in our hospital 416 with a frequency of hospital-acquired vri of 83 the most prevalent respiratory viruses found in our study were rhinovirus bocavirus enterovirus b influenza a h1n1 influenza c adenovirus rsv a and coronavirus in our study since these results were available only long after the surgery none was cancelled or postponed because of itbicer et al studied incidence and etiology of viral infections among hospitalized children with vri symptoms they found a prevalence of 665 and the most prevalent viruses were rsv adenovirus parainfluenza and rhinovirus 8 in our study the frequency was lower probably because we studied asymptomatic children and the types of viruses were also differentin our study we used a polymerase chain reaction pcr-based commercially-available automated method that can detect 18 different viruses at once kanashito et al compared three different methods of detecting vri in humans direct immunofluorescence single- and multiplex-pcr in 39 nasopharyngeal samples from children with congenital heart disease they found a vri prevalence of 641 multiplex pcr performed better than the other methods 9 krause et al highlighted the usefulness of multiplex pcr tests to distinguish vri from bacterial infections in children 10 vri can lead to unnecessary use of antibiotics in our study this may have occurred in five patientsin our study the presence of vri was not associated with major outcomes after open-heart surgery in children these findings did not confirm those reported by other investigators delgado-corcoran et al investigated the prevalence of rhinovirus in children submitted to heart surgery and showed that patients with vri had longer duration of mechanical ventilation more extubation failures frequent use of bronchodilators and longer hospital stay 11 in another study children submitted to open-heart surgery that had vri experienced longer hospital and picu length-of-stay compared with matched controls 12 altman et al studied the impact of rsv infection in children with chd and they found that these patients had more significant morbidity and higher mortality with higher healthcare-associated costs 6 we speculate that our results were negative because of a limited power given the small sample size and b detection of viruses in asymptomatic children since the ones with symptoms of vri were rescheduled in the study by delgado-corcoran et al 11 children were considered infected when they had symptoms of vri while in the study by spaeder et al 12 infection was defined as the presence of viruses in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal specimens although there is evidence that a symptomatic vri will negatively impact outcomes 12 it is not clear whether asymptomatic presence of a virus in the respiratory system will affect the outcomes therefore the usefulness and the cost-effectiveness of screening all children scheduled for congenital heart surgery regarding the presence of respiratory viruses need clarificationin brazil rsv is the most common cause of vri requiring hospitalization in children 13 in a systematic review of 20 published studies homaira et al showed that patients who most benefit from passive immunization against rsv were preterm infants 33 weeks children with chronic lung disease and children with congenital heart disease 14 however the most frequent virus in our patients was rhinovirus and rsv was detected in a single patient this finding cannot be attributed to the use of passive immunization against rsv since only a few of our patients were given itsome authors recommend screening for rhinovirus among patients scheduled for congenital heart surgery especially infants and toddlers with respiratory symptoms and that surgery should be postponed if positive they however acknowledge that cost-effectiveness is unknown 11 simsic et al adopted preoperative testing for respiratory virus by pcr before cardiac surgery for all patients with single-ventricle and if the test is positive surgery is rescheduled for 6 weeks pending a negative follow-up viral pcr 15 there are some rapid tests for vri in the market like the abbott testpack rsv abbott diagnostics santa clara ca the quickvue rsv test quidel corp san diego ca or the ramp rsv test response biomedical corp vancouver canada which are rapid enzyme immunoassay for the direct detection of rsv antigen in nasopharyngeal swab specimens 16 the clinical value of these rapid tests in children with chd is unknown in children admitted to an emergency department bedside testing for rsv if immediately available could have changed medical management in 64 of cases reduced the number of tests ordered antibiotics prescribed and saved an average of usd 669 per patient 17 another issue that may be considered is the lack of preventive strategies for most of the viruses that cause vri in these patients besides rsv new vaccines for these viruses could bring benefit to many patients in similar situationsin our hospital screening for vri is not routine patients scheduled for congenital heart surgery undergo only clinical evaluation and surgery is postponed for a few weeks if the patient has symptoms of a vri our findings are important because they bring awareness to the high frequency of asymptomatic vri in patients with chd scheduled for open heart surgery although here not associated with poorer outcomes although the screening test is non-invasive and technically simple on the other hand it is expensive besides identification of a respiratory virus does not necessarily mean an active infection since respiratory viruses can be detected weeks after a vri nevertheless despite the limitations of this study our results suggest that screening asymptomatic children for vri before open-heart surgery is not cost-effective since there was no difference in outcomeslimitations of this study include a heterogeneity of patients regarding anatomic diagnoses b the wide range of ages at surgery and c higher mortality than that of centers from developed countries therefore our results may not apply for resource-rich centers in developed countries they do at least in part for limited-resource centers from developing countriesin conclusion vri was frequent in children undergoing open-heart surgery but the presence of a vri did not impact on major outcomes in this cohortfunding this study was funded by programa de apoio  ps-graduao proap 1013039501100002322coordenao de aperfeioamento de pessoal de nvel superior

 therapeutics are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this pandemic disease while waiting for unregistered products to go through the testing process the best opportunity for identifying active therapeutics for immediate use is through repurposing existing drugs several candidates have been proposed as treatments and much attention has been directed toward remdesivir however even if remdesivir efficacy is established with randomized controlled trials limitations imposed by intravenous iv administration may prevent its widespread utility another candidate is the orally administered antimalarial drug chloroquine cq and it has been reported that cq was successfully used for the treatment of sarscov2 infection in china
2
 the initial report of cq efficacy in the clinic was followed by a publication describing a cq analog hydroxychloroquine hcq as active against sarscov2 in vitro as well

 this finding was quickly supported by an openlabel nonrandomized clinical trial of limited size in france that provided the first published clinical evidence hcq may be a viable treatment option against covid19
4
 based on these early hints of efficacy the us food and drug administration issued an emergency use authorization for emergency use of oral formulations of hydroxychloroquine sulfate for the treatment of covid19although cq and hcq are considered antimalarial agents they have alternative uses in rheumatology for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis
5
 between the two hcq is the preferred treatment option due to its improved safety profile cq and hcq are weakly basic 4aminoquinolines that enter the acidic compartments of host cells and the concentration of these drugs can accumulate in cells through a process known as lysosomal trapping
6
 
7
 for the treatment of sarscov2 infection a reduction in lysosomal ph is believed to adversely impact multiple stages of viral replication eg membrane fusion spike protein or angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor modifications
8
 
9

from a pharmacokinetics pk standpoint lysosomal trapping can result in the variable sequestration of drug within tissues and the total drug concentration in tissue may be much higher than plasma
7
 as drug levels reach a steady state the relationship between tissue and plasma drug concentrations is represented by a partitioning coefficient k
p for the treatment of viral pneumonia there is a specific interest in how drug levels will vary in the lung unfortunately predicting the impact of lysosomal trapping on drug levels in individual tissues over time is very difficult and it is not clear whether the hcq maximum concentration cmax andor area under the curve will be associated with efficacy a lack of confidence in tissue hcq concentrations impacts our ability to assess toxicity concerns as well longterm hcq use has been associated with qt prolongation
10
 
11
 and efforts to model hcq pk should consider both efficacy and known toxicities associated with treatmentdespite these challenges a recent publication described the development of a simcyp physiologically based pharmacokinetic pbpk model to support whether hcq lung levels will be sufficiently high enough to treat sarscov2 infection
3
 the authors briefly described the development of their model and the model was validated based on previous studies that characterized hcq plasma and blood pk after a single hcq intravenous andor oral dose although the provided information is limited the authors state that their final pbpk model used an hcq lung k
p value observed in rats and a perfusionlimited lung model for their hcq lung simulations the authors used their final simcyp pbpk model to simulate hcq lung concentrations with multiple dosing regimens and recommended a dosing regimen that they believed will provide sufficient hcq lung concentrations without reaching hcq levels perceived to be unsafe partially based on this report selected hospitalized patients with confirmed covid19 and moderate to severe disease or high risk for progression are being treated with hcq sulfate 400 mg bid for 1 day followed by 200 mg bid for 4 days university of washington medical center infectious disease physicians direct communicationmoving forward there are several concerns with the pk model that was used to support the recommended hcq dosing regimen for the treatment of covid19 over the course of treatment the average simulated plasma hcq plasma levels 100 ngml with the recommended dosing regimen are well below the in vitro hcq concentration required to reach 50 of the maximum observed sarscov2 elimination ec50 in a verocell model of viral infection
3
 furthermore the lowest concentration in vitro that cleared 100 of sarscov2 was 6700 ngml however the relatively low blood levels are not necessarily a problem as previous studies in dogs have observed that hcq blood exposure does not necessarily correlate with tissue exposure or pk outcomes
12
 for treatment of viral pneumonia the in vivo efficacy is predicted to be driven primarily by high lung hcq concentrations however the relatively high hcq lung k
p in the pbpk model used to simulate hcq human lung concentrations was based on hcq lung k
p values observed in rat pk studies accurate determination of a k
p value requires the drug reaching a distribution equilibrium with the target tissue 3 months for hcq in rats and there has been a large amount of observed variability in the reported values
13
 
14
 furthermore the relatively high hcq lung concentrations were based on a perfusionlimited lung model although the rat pk data suggest that a perfusionlimited lung model may be suitable for hcq it is not clear what data were used to inform the perfusion limited lung model in the authors simcyp model an additional concern is that the initial study focused on how the average unbound lung trough hcq levels compared with an in vitro ec50 for hcq treatment of covid19 we should be using conservative estimates of hcq lung levels that rely on the lower end of predicted confidence intervals furthermore instead of relating the lung hcq levels to current hcq ec50 values we believe the hcq lung concentrations should be compared with the hcq concentration required to clear 100 of sarscov2 in vitro 6700 ngml the current hcq ec50 values vary over time and the timedependent kinetics of hcq efficacy have not been characterized in detail
3
 however the hcq concentration required to clear 100 of sarscov2 in vitro 6700 ngml was the same at both timepoints 24 and 48 hoursfor this study the published hcq simcyp pbpk model was used to initially address our concerns first we used the hcq pbpk model to investigate how differences in hcq lung k
p will impact simulated hcq concentrations next the simcyp population simulator was used to determine how conservative estimates of hcq lung concentrations 5th percentile compare with the hcq in vitro efficacy data finally due to known qt prolongation issues hcq heart concentrations were simulated to understand how the unbound hcq heart cmax values may vary with different dosing regimens overall our modeling approach was designed to illustrate the current lack of data to support hcq pk modeling efforts to predict hcq dosing for treatment of sarscov2 infection pbpk modeling was developed and performed with simcyp simulator see 
supplementary
when a range of hcq lung k
p values were investigated with the simcyp hcq model changes in hcq lung k
p did not impact simulated plasma or blood hcq concentrations however the panel of k
p values generated large differences in simulated lung hcq levels relative to hcq in vitro efficacy when hcq sulfate is dosed at 400 mg bid for 1 day followed by 200 mg bid for 4 days the unbound hcq lung troughs simulated with a lung k
p of 44 barely reach levels fivefold higher than the reported hcq ec50 and levels never reach the value required to clear sarscov2 in vitro table 

1
 if we assume the hcq lung k
p value is the same in rats and humans k
p  220 unbound hcq lung troughs were predicted to be well above the in vitro ec50 but hcq troughs did not reach the minimum value required in vitro for virus elimination in contrast the hcq dosing regimen used in the clinical trial in france 200 mg tid for 10 days was predicted to generate unbound lung hcq troughs at levels that clear the virus in vitro for hcq lung k
p values 220 table 

2
 however it should be noted that 5 days of hcq dosing was required to reach sufficient hcq lung concentrations with both dosing regimens a summary of these results is illustrated in figure 

1
 finally unbound hcq heart cmax values were predicted with each dosing regimen table 

3
 although hcq dosing of 400 mg bid for 1 day followed by 200 mg bid for 4 days is predicted to generate a higher unbound hcq heart cmax on day 1 hcq dosing of 200 mg tid for 10 days will have higher hcq unbound cmax values for the remainder of the study the differences in hcq heart cmax values are relatively small over the first 5 days but the unbound hcq heart cmax on day 10 predicted with hcq 200 mg tid for 10 days is more than threefold greater than the value predicted with hcq 400 mg bid for 1 day followed by 200 mg bid for 4 dayswhen simulated tissue drug concentrations are used to support dosing recommendations the quality of the data used to inform the timedependent drug distribution to tissues should be carefully considered by the researchers for the hcq simcyp model described in this study changes in lung k
p values did not impact hcq blood or plasma concentrations but the adjustments generated dramatic differences in simulated hcq lung levels multiple preclinical in vivo studies support a relatively large hcq lung k
p but relying entirely on a rat pk study drastically limits the ability of current hcq pbpk models to translate in vitro efficacy data to the clinic given the complex tissue distribution kinetics of hcq any attempts to simulate human hcq lung levels as a basis for hcq treatment of covid19 should be met with caution at this timein the future additional robust mechanistic data should be acquired to improve our understanding of how hcq levels will vary throughout the body over time a previous study has provided strong evidence that lysosomal trapping is responsible for the high hcq in many tissues
7
 the authors used a pbpk modeling approach supported by mouse hcq tissue pk data to illustrate how hcq lysosome levels vary across multiple tissues furthermore their model predicted human gut and liver hcq lysosomal concentrations will exceed 10 mmoll after a single oral 200mg dose lysosomal trapping is a phenomenon that occurs across many cell types including leukocytes when leukocytes were compared hcq uptake was similar in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells but was greatest in purified monocytes
15
 macrophages are not accurately accounted for with our current simcyp model and the prediction accuracy may be improved by explicitly accounting for this phenomenon in the model furthermore sarscov2 is believed to effect cellular entry via attachment of its virion spike protein to the ace2 receptor and this receptor is commonly found on alveolar cells of the lung epithelium
16
 future studies that characterize hcq concentrations in human epithelial lining fluid elf plasma alveolar macrophages andor bronchial tissue will significantly improve the confidence in hcq pk modeling and will be crucial for the development of more advanced hcq multicompartment lung models additional hcq pk concerns include the known difference in r and shcq enantiomer rat tissue distribution the large amount of variability observed in human bp values and an incomplete understanding of the role hcq metabolites may play in efficacy against sarscov2
3
 
17
 furthermore the hcqsimulated pk data has been generated with healthy populations that do not necessarily reflect the patient populations in need of a treatment option for covid19 many of the patients in urgent need of treatment have comorbidities such as liver andor kidney disease and these diseases are likely to impact hcq disposition finally concern of hcq toxicity should also drive dose selection although there are only a few reports of hcqassociated qt prolongation it is possible that patients in greatest need of covid19 treatment may be more susceptible to hcq toxicity
10
 
11
 given these concerns the current protocol for hcq treatment of covid19 at the university of washington medical center includes monitoring for heart issues by placing the patients on telemetry to track electrocardiographic data over the course of treatment university of washington medical center infectious disease physicians direct communication currently there is no established hcq concentration plasma or heart that is associated with toxicity concerns so the simcyp hcq model can only account for relative differences in hcq levels without referring to a toxic thresholdas researchers acknowledge the current lack of hcq pk information they should also carefully consider how in vitro experiments are designed to characterize hcq efficacy against sarscov2 the initial studies characterizing hcq efficacy against sarscov2 have been conducted with vero cells which are kidney epithelial cells extracted from an african green monkey previous work with middle east respiratory syndrome cov suggests phagocytes may serve as viral reservoirs and future work should address the use of monocytederived macrophages as a host model to characterize therapeutic efficacy against sarscov2
18
 in addition if researchers are going to relate hcq levels to in vitro efficacy data we suggest using hcq concentrations required to eliminate sarscov2 in vitro and not the currently available ec50 values that vary over time
3

we are hopeful that hcq will provide a muchneeded treatment option for covid19 however we do not believe that current pk models can be used to inform a hcq dose selection with a high degree of certainty based on hcqs complex pk and the unclear mechanism of action against sarscov2 improved hcq pk models are needed to increase our confidence in predicting hcq efficacy assessing potential drugdrug interactions and identifying possible side effects such as qt prolongationno funding was received for this workall authors declared no competing interests for this workpulmonary hypertension ph is a chronic and progressive lung disease caused by multiple differing etiologies increasing pulmonary vascular resistance led to overloading of the right ventricle and eventually death1ph is characterized by a mean pulmonary artery pressure mpap  25 mmhg at rest in addition to the treatment of relieving symptoms targeted therapy aiming to improve heart function extended three-year survival of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah from 39 to 7523coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first reported in wuhan china in last december4 studies observed severe damage in the lung which raised the hypothesis that ph patients might be more vulnerable than others5 subsequently the whole country was placed in lockdown to prevent the spread of the disease which potentially could compromise ph patient care all these factors made ph patients a potentially vulnerable group hereby we designed a questionnaire for ph patients to understand their disease condition mental condition medication supplement and requirements in medical care during covid-19 outbreak the survey would provide general information for future medical care and support to ph patients in such conditionsthe study was conducted by experts from congenital heart disease center at wuhan asia heart hospital in wuhan in collaboration with other ph centers and unofficial patients groups patients diagnosed with ph and their families were considered for the survey ph was defined as mpap  25 mmhg at rest all diagnosis was made according to right heart catheter examinationa small-scale national online survey was performed ph patients and one of their family members were invited to participate in the survey via quick response qr code all answers were listed in non-medical descriptions and reviewed by unprofessional individuals for better understanding no personal information was included the study protocol and questionnaire were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of wuhan asia heart hospital 2020-s-002 participants were given informed consent during the surveythe questionnaire was designed by experts on ph in wuhan asia heart hospital wuhan china to understand the status of ph patients during covid-19 outbreak in china the questions were designed to cover the following issues 1 basic clinical information of the patients including age gender medical history of ph and current heart function 2 physical and mental conditions associated with covid-19 and 3 details of the medications they were using and requirements for medical care if any questions were designed in single choice and multiple choices yes or no were offered for most questions and answers other than choices were required to fill the questionnaire is still open for recruitment questionnaire in supplement here we present the preliminary data from the first respondentsbaseline characteristics are presented as number for categorical data and mean  standard deviation or median with interquartile range as appropriate for continuous data percentage is applied for illustrating constitution comparison was made between variables using students t-test or wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous variables regarding their distributions and with the 2 test for categorical variables a p-value of  005 was considered as statistically significant all statistical analyses were performed with spss 230 ibm corp armonk nyover 300 individuals were invited to participate in this survey a total of 120 ph patients and 23 family members from 16 provinces responded from 1 march 2020 to 11 march 2020 all questionnaires were included in final analysis a total of 648 n  87 participants were from hubei among which 299 n  26 were from wuhan 133 n  19 were from henan 70 n  10 from anhui and 189 n  27 came from other 13 provinces as shown in fig 1 both patients and their family members completed the survey in 13 families however we failed to identify them due to the design table 1 shows general information of the participants overall participants were aged 323  115 years a total of 61 patients suffered ph more than seven years three family participants did not know ph history of their relatives possibly due to the different etiology6 chd-pah contributed most in ph groups 79 658 in patients 13 565 in family participants p  0001

a total of 986 n  141 participants were in home quarantine during covid-19 outbreak table 1 shows the majority of participants 121 846 felt not much change on disease progress surprisingly most patients were with less severe symptoms as 469 n  67 participants proclaimed new york heart association heart functional class i and 44 308 were class ii a total of 833 n  100 patients and 913 n  21 family participants reported the disease progression was the same as before fatigue and less active was more reported in patients 20 vs 0 p  0026 however cough was common in both patients and family participants 58 vs 130 p  0203 as shown in fig 2 symptoms in others included not sleeping well chest pain aching pain in limbs and catching a cold but recovered there were three 25 patients hospitalized during covid-19 outbreak two of them were because of heart failure and one was due to pneumonia none of the family participants reported death of patients actually three patients passed away by 11 march 2020 one of the patients died due to an unexpected fall and unable to go to hospital during outbreak two died from worsening of pah all deaths were reported by family privately and not included in the survey
fever is an important symptom indicating covid-19 in our survey 50 n  6 patients had fever with highest temperature of 398 one patient was confirmed sars-cov-2 infection and two patients reported covid-19 related symptoms cough in their families all family participants denied covid-19 related symptoms in either themselves or patientsbosentan ambrisentan tadalafil and sildenafil were most commonly used medications for target therapy as shown in fig 3 specifically ambrisentan was preferred in 575 n  69 patients and 609 n  14 family participants a total of 216 n  26 patients and 261 n  6 family participants chose chinese generic ambrisentan because of the lower price in chinese generic medication there were 17 patients enrolling in clinical trial and using macitentan for free patients were more sensitive to the shortage of medications than family participants 62 517 vs 4 174 p  0003 there were 266 participants 29 in patients 9 in family participants who thought they had enough medications by the time of survey when it was at least 40 days after national lockdown as shown in fig 4a a total of 400 n  48 patients were able to buy more medications with great effort however 242 n  29 discontinued one or more medications there were 10 70 patients changing their medications without consulting their doctors as shown in fig 4a two of which previously took macitentan a total of 100 participants 699 thought they had medications shortage during covid-19 outbreak as shown in fig 4b
over 200 patients n  29 and family participants n  6 had panic but most of them 89 622 thought protection was important as shown in fig 5a though 483 n  58 patients and 391 n  9 family participants felt bad due to the disease more than 70 85 in patients 18 in family participants participants still kept optimistic at the same time as shown in fig 5b

both ph patients and their families requested further medical care despite of a lack of clear clinical worsening according to our survey a total of 117 n  14 patients and 261 n  6 family participants would like to contact their doctors during covid-19 outbreak 617 n  74 patients would go to the hospital for follow-up immediately after public transportation was available eight of whom preferred hospitalization and 609 n  14 family participants would ask their relatives with ph go to the hospital as soon as possible which was similar to patients additionally 739 n  17 family participants would also encourage patients to be more positivethe outbreak of covid-19 changed most peoples life in last winter specifically patients with chronic diseases might suffer from the high risk of covid-19 and uncontrolled existing diseases at the same time ph patients require sustained medical care similar to other chronic diseases any interruption in medications may result in clinical worsening and death however their living condition during covid-19 was unknown our small-scale national survey brought an insight to this group the results of the questionnaire indicated that the incidence of covid-19 was not higher in ph patients according to our survey regardless of incidental cough and fever in our patients only one patient was confirmed sars-cov-2 infection medication insufficiency was the most common problem in our patients as nearly 70 participants implied their medications shortage during covid-19 outbreak a total of 242 patients discontinued medications and 70 patients changed their medications without consulting their doctor a total of 986 participants stayed at home during outbreak and most of them were not depressed by either ph or covid-19 according to our survey however further requirements in medical care might significantly increase due to the high desire of follow-up even hospitalization from both patients and their families when covid-19 outbreak is overin early studies covid-19 patients often stayed in wuhan for a while or had a history of exposure to confirmed cases family cluster was also observed in several cases7 there were 182 n  26 participants from wuhan in our study which might be the result of hospital location and one of the patients groups were from hubei none of them reported covid-19 neither in patients nor in family participants person-to-person transmission is confirmed in covid-198 and lockdown in wuhan began in 24 january 2020 to prevent further spread of this infectious disease a total of 986 of our patients and their families were in home quarantine during covid-19 outbreak which might be a key factor that prevented our patients being infected previous studies showed 3251 patients with covid-19 had existing diseases such as diabetes hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases males were more vulnerable mean age of the patients were 4955 years from different study cohort911 our participants were 33 years old at mean age which was much younger than previous covid-19 patients our study cohort consisted of 80 females which was quite different from the proportion of covid-19 in addition most of our patients were chd-pah and maintained a fairly well heart function therefore the younger age more females different etiology and better cardiac function in our ph patients might result in a lower incidence of covid-19similar to any other chronic diseases ph patients have to take life-time medications and most of them had higher medication adherence12 bosentan was first used in pah in 200213 and it significantly improved six-minute walk distance and heart function since then targeted treatment has extended more than half of patients life to three or even five years14 combination therapy recommended in recent years has further reduced adverse events and slowed down the ph progression31517 in our study patients took ambrisentan more than bosentan partly due to the lower price in chinese generic medication a total of 17 patients were taking macitentan for free treprostinil was used in very few patients because of the high price and inconvenience of intravenous application18 luckily 400 of patients were able to continue their medications with great effort during the national lockdown different from other cardiovascular diseases ph target medications are expensive and unavailable in small cities which might result in the shortage of medications in our ph patients the lockdown in cities additionally prevented patients from getting supplement nearly 30 of patients either discontinued their medications or changed without consultation we have tried to help some of our patients to buy medications however shutdown of most public transportations made the process very difficult we could hardly predict the prognosis of those who changed their treatment for less than 40 days an interruption of treatment around three days might be tolerated19 but clinical worsening might happen due to the discontinuation of medications20 patients preferred clinic visiting to consult doctors for any modification our patients showed higher desire to contact their doctors even though we had provided online consultation before the surveymental condition of ph patients has aroused attentions in recent years their concerns about the invasive examination disease progression and social interactions may directly impact their tolerance to treatment21 the outbreak of covid-19 brought an unexpected crisis first in wuhan then spread to other cities surprisingly our ph patients and their families were mostly not panicking during the outbreak they were overall positive and optimistic even though there were shortages on their medications the reasons for such response might be as follows first most ph patients stayed at home which was familiar and comfort for them second there were not many clinical worsening in our patients their disease condition was mostly constant during the outbreak which maintained their optimism third we the doctors were active in patients groups including being available for consultation online and offering assistance for medication supplement all these might be helpful to reduce their anxietyour results provided preliminary view in living condition of ph patients during covid-19 in china however several limitations in our study need to be addressed first of all there were only 120 ph patients participating in the survey the small-scale survey might give us some general information which also might bring bias in some aspects the results might highlight chd-pah due to that chd-pah contributed most in the study population further study should try to include more patients to get more details the questionnaire was designed to generate the information from both patients and their family members however we failed to match patients with their family members from the beginning studies could avoid such mistakes and focus on patients more second the survey was started 35 days after wuhan lockdown and lasted 10 days most ph patients might be still stable in such a short time studies conducted later or longer might observe more clinical worsening and anxiety in patients and their families although no death was reported in our survey three patients passed away based on our knowledge neither patients nor their families would participate in the survey if they were in critical condition therefore our results might be more optimistic than real world follow-up to the real mortality has been initialed third there were many uncertainties in online survey we involved a question to estimate whether participants were seriously taking the survey the result showed 867 patients and 910 family participants went through the survey carefully which indicated there might be misunderstanding and incorrect answersour small-scale national survey first investigated the living condition of ph patients during covid-19 as the disease is spreading all over the world doctors should be aware that ph patients could be invulnerable to covid-19 if they are in good protection sustaining medical care including medication supplement is important for ph patients at this time covid-19 might impact ph patients psychologically other than physically higher hospitalization even death might been seen when the outbreak is oversars-cov-2 has caused a global covid-19 pandemic with serious infections major morbidity and mortality 1

6a comparison of covid-19 with other coronavirus infections shows similarity with sars-corona virus experimental data shows that the original sars-cov can also cause ace2- dependent myocardial injury5 moreover autopsy samples from the toronto sars epidemic demonstrated sars-cov rna in 35 of autopsied expired patients hearts demonstrating that the virus has cardiotropism and can infect myocardium19 in that study by oudit and colleagues the 7 of 20 patients who died from sars related corona virus had sars covid genome detected in the heart although the presence of sars covid rna does not automatically mean there was myocardial injury in this small case series by oudit et al all patients with detectable sars covid genome had increased myocardial inflammation including macrophage infiltration this suggests a direct causal effect from viral infiltration and the associated inflammation it was also noted in this study that patients with sars-cov infection in the heart suffered significantly more aggressive illness and succumbed to earlier death compared to those with sars-cov without myocardial infiltration19 a small long-term follow-up study of 25 patients mean age 48 years who recovered from sars-cov infection 2003 demonstrated lipid abnormalities and increased cardiovascular abnormalities 1cardiac involvement in patients with covid-19 table 1

20 in a case series of 187 patients with covid-19 elevated troponins with or without a history of cardiovascular disease were associated with malignant arrhythmias acute respiratory failure and higher mortality interestingly patients with known cvd but without elevated troponins had a more favorable outcome 12 acute cardiac injury portends a worse prognosis greater need for mechanical ventilation and higher mortality shi and colleagues 3 reported that cardiac injury was associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute kidney injury and coagulation disorders coagulation disorders and metabolic derangements with acute kidney injury can also contribute to cardiac injury other mechanisms of cardiac injury fig 1 include acute st segment myocardial infarction stemi type 2 myocardial infarction mi due to oxygen supplydemand mismatch vascular endothelial injury microthrombiemboli and systemic hyperinflammatory state leading to cytokine storm syndrome 15given the abundance of ace2 receptors on myocardial and vascular tissue direct viral myocardial infection with sars-cov-2 is one of the mechanisms of cardiac injury and myocarditis 6

21 tavazzi and colleagues describe a case of myocarditis in a covid-19 positive patient where direct viral infection was seen by endomyocardial biopsy showing low grade inflammation and sars-cov-2 particles in interstitial cells of the myocardium 22 the pathophysiology of acute myocarditis may be related to direct viral infection andor immune-mediated hyperinflammation fig1 21

22 the systemic hyperinflammatory response is thought to be the third stage of infection in a theoretical model proposed by atri et al 15up to 20-30 of patients hospitalized with covid-19 have evidence of myocardial involvement manifested by elevated troponin levels which is associated with worse short-term outcome table 1 1 2 3

20 the arrhythmia risk in patients with covid-19 is likely multifactorial related to the viral infection severity of the illness severity of cardiac injury inflammation and potentially drug treatment with qt prolonging drugs however the presence of ventricular arrhythmias is higher among patients with elevated troponin up to 17 in one series compared with 12 in patients without elevated troponin 12 lazzerini et al have demonstrated the direct effect that inflammatory cytokines including il-6 have on herg-k channels prolonging ventricular action potential duration leading to lethal ventricular arrhythmias23acute cardiac injury portends a worse prognosis greater need for mechanical ventilation and higher mortality shi and colleagues3 reported that cardiac injury was associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome acute kidney injury and coagulation disorders coagulation disorders and metabolic derangements with acute kidney injury can also contribute to cardiac injuryacute st-segment elevation myocardial infarction has been well recognized in viral respiratory illnesses 24 a study by kwong et al showed that the incidence of acute coronary syndrome is 5-10 times as high within the first seven days of influenza diagnosis25 recommendations from experts suggest that these patients should be preferentially treated with fibrinolytic therapy26 therefore patients with acute st-segment myocardial infarction and covid-19 may be expected to have larger infarcts if fibrinolytic therapy does not result in timely and complete reperfusiongiven the high prevalence of cardiac injury it is reasonable to expect that a spectrum of heart disease is present with some residual post-myocarditis abnormalities in fact media recent reports have already suggested some patients suffer new onset cardiomyopathy during the convalescent phase after covid-19 infection httpswwwnbcnewyorkcomnewscoronaviruscoronavirus-after-effects-ny-doctor-develops-heart-disease-after-recovery2397699as there are no current data on long-term covid-19 cardiovascular complications it would be instructive to review recovery from other types of myocardial injury for patients with acute coronary syndrome or type i mi standard follow-up and care are warranted chapman and colleagues studied consecutive hospital in-patients with elevated troponins27 patients with type ii mi supplydemand mismatch with evidence for ischemia and cardiac injury elevated troponin and no evidence for ischemia were compared with patients with type i mi during 5 years follow-up patients with type ii mi andor cardiac injury had significantly higher rates of major cardiovascular events after adjustment for clinical co-variates and higher rates of noncardiovascular death27 these data would be relevant for patients recovered from covid-19 associated cardiac injuryfor patients with stress induced myocardial injury the long-term follow-up of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be relevant in one recent small study the patients recovered from takotsubo cardiomyopathy demonstrated long-term symptomatic and functional impairment despite normalized ejection fraction28 however mri study did not reveal late gadolinium enhancement although atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are common during the acute phase there does not appear to be significant risk of ventricular arrhythmias in the convalescent phase after recovery from takotsubo cardiomyopathy29microemboli andor microvascular coronary dysfunction has been posited to be one of the mechanisms of acute coronary injury during covid-19 pre-clinical studies on microemboli demonstrated vasoconstriction and inflammation with increase in tumor necrosis factor  30 microemboli have been described during acute percuatenous coronary interventions and may lead to microvascular dysfunction and heart failure30long-term studies in patients with viral myocarditis which may be relevant for patients with covid-19 myocarditis andor fibrosis due to inflammation regional or local associated with their acute illness in one study of 502 patients with biopsy proven inflammatory carditis up to 66 of patients developed aborted or actual sudden cardiac death andor appropriate icd shocks31 in a recent study on inpatients with symptomatic active or prior myocarditis there was an increased prevalence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias 32 moreover the arrhythmic burden was not different among patients with active versus previous myocarditis although the type of arrhythmias differed in the 62 patients with previous myocarditis with mean ejection fraction 47  14 atrial fibrillation was present in 34 and ventricular tachycardia was present in 47 late gadolinium enhancement in a nonischemic pattern was observed on cardiac mri in all 62 patients with prior myocarditis ventricular arrhythmias occurred even among patients with left ventricular ejection fraction  50 32in a long-term follow-up study of 1142 patients who recovered from acute myocarditis mean age 402 years the authors noted heart failure hospitalizations between 6-8 33currently there are no studies that have specifically evaluated the burden of arrhythmias post-myocarditis in follow-up particularly in patients whose ventricular function has recovered in one study of long-term survival of 112 patients with biopsy proven myocarditis ejection fraction 40 was only a borderline predictor of mortality p0052 suggesting that a substantial number of patients with preserved left ventricular function died in follow-up 34 other series of patients with myocarditis also show diminished survival and sudden cardiac death35 a case report describes a patient with myocarditis who had a monitored ventricular fibrillation event 2 months later when left ventricular function was normal 36 autopsy series 37

38 of patients with sudden cardiac death have identified myocarditis as a potential explanation in a significant number of cases even with a grossly normal appearing heart the finding of myocarditis as a significant cause of sudden death in the young is notable and relevant to survivors of covid-1939
while myocarditis is typically considered for its manifestations on the ventricle the atrium is also involved40 endomyocardial biopsies in patients with idiopathic atrial fibrillation has shown a high incidence of myocarditis on both atrial septal and right ventricular biopsy specimens41 a taiwanese study found an adjusted odds ratio of 1182 p 003 for developing atrial fibrillation in individuals who had had influenza versus those who did not 42obesity has been observed to be a risk factor for worse outcomes during covid-19 infections ace2 is also expressed in adipose tissue recent publications point to a pathophysiologic link between covid-19 and obesity43 obesity modulates inflammatory response through secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines modulation of il-6 therefore covid-19 infection and its interaction with adipocytes may contribute to deleterious outcomes43 inflammation involving the epicardial adipose tissue eat may be impacted by myocarditis due to the contiguity of the myocardium and eat epicardial fat has been linked with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease 44

45 hence covid-19 interaction with epicardial fat may provide a plausible link to acute or long-term atrial fibrillation and coronary artery diseasethere is much unknown about covid-19 infection just like other entities with acute cardiac injury there is likely to be a diverse response depending on the mechanism of myocardial injury severity of the acute illness therapy delivered hemodynamic response host factors immune-mediated factors and post recovery care and follow-up based on other studies of patients with recovered myocarditis type ii mi or other cardiac injury it is expected that some patients will have subclinical and possibly overt cardiovascular abnormalities patients with ostensibly recovered cardiac function may still be at risk for coronary artery disease atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmiaswhile current paradigms for treatment appropriately focus on acute recovery it is unknown whether the treatment given during the acute illness may affect future cardiovascular pathology given the size of the pandemic it is important to determine whether acute delivery of antifibrotic therapy anti-inflammatory therapy cell-based therapy or antiviral therapy impacts long-term as well as short-term outcomesthe optimal screening for patients following recovery from covid-19 is unknown one paradigm fig 2
 would be to define the population at highest risk by identifying patients with covid-19 infection with elevated high-sensitivity troponin andor bnp as this has already been shown to provide important short-term prognostic information these patients should be followed to monitor and assess the long-term prognostic impact of covid-19 myocardial involvementscreening for residual cardiac involvement in the convalescent phase is needed to establish the population burden of long-term cardiac disease contributed to by covid-19 if a significant burden of disease is identified trials of prophylactic therapies to prevent long-term complications may be appropriate the type of testing and cost-effectiveness of screening tests for post covid-19 myocardial dysfunctionarrhythmias will need to be determined we recommend standard ecg and echocardiogram and possibly a cardiac monitor 2-6 months post recovery with the recognition that even these tests may not detect very subtle clinical abnormalities consideration should be given for advanced imaging ie mri with gadolinium enhancement or echocardiographic strain when initial testing reveals abnormalities or as clinically indicated future studies will clarify whether there will be a post-covid-19 cardiac syndrome and how best to manage patients recovering from covid-19 cardiac involvementwe are currently facing a pandemic unseen in our lifetime with potential long-term cardiovascular complications now is the time for action to plan appropriate registries such as the american heart association covid-19 registry and clinical studies to assess the incidence and significance of potential mid- and long-term cardiac abnormalities and dysrhythmias with the hope and promise to mitigate these long-term sequelaethe new coronavirus sars-cov-2 emerged in december 2019 and spread around the globe its disease covid-19 was declared a pandemic on the 11th of march 2020 the most burdened countries are china italy republic of korea and united states of america and almost 6 million of cases have been diagnosed around the world1
emerging reports suggest that case fatality rate ranges from 2 to 15 according to regions2

3 in addition sars-cov-2 infection has a higher incidence and case fatality rate among the elderly and those with chronic comorbidities4
immunosuppressed patients may have a different epidemiology in fact it is questioned whether immunosuppression may play a role in sars-cov-2 infection5 it has been speculated that sars-cov-2 damages the host through two overlapping mechanisms the first is the direct damage of the virus itself the second is an abnormal host response that may lead to a cytokine storm syndrome6 in consideration of this pathogenetic hypothesis anti-inflammatory therapy and immunosuppressive treatment have been proposed as potential rescue active treatment against the detrimental abnormal host response that may take place especially in the most severe forms of covid-19 on the other hand their efficacy in clinical practice have shown conflicting results7
the characterization of patients with acquired immunosuppression with sars-cov-2 infection is needed international societies of solid organ transplantation are working to provide guidance to help clinicians in the management of transplanted patients and facing the impact of covid-19 on transplant programs particularly it is still debated whether decreasing immunosuppressive therapy in covid-19-infected solid organ transplant recipients is worth and if maintaining transplantation programs is reasonable8 unfortunately to date data in the literature are lacking only few reports on solid organ transplanted patients and two case series on heart transplanted patients with covid-19 have been published so far9

13 ren et al reported a low rate of suspected cases of sars-cov-2 infection and no death in a series of 87 heart transplant patients however none had a laboratory confirmation of infection14 latif et al reported a case fatality rate of 25 in a series of 28 heart transplanted patients with a confirmed diagnosis of covid-1912
aim of this study is to report a series of heart transplanted patients with sars-cov-2 infection from two heart transplant centers in the north of italy describing clinical characteristics prognosis and the impact of covid-19 on heart transplant programssince the outbreak of covid-19 in italy specific protocols of infection restraint were applied and covid-19-free paths were identified inside our hospitals in particular history of contacts with confirmed or suspected cases of covid-19 was carefully investigated in both donors and recipients rt-pcr on bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in all donors and only negative donors were considered before transplant all recipients were tested with a nasopharyngeal swab and only negative patients were accepted for surgery during surgery before admission to a dedicated covid-free intensive care unit a second test on the bronchoalveolar lavage was performed to confirm the absence of virus induction and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy did not change after icu discharge patients were followed in a covid-19-free ward different paths for outpatients were also identified the outpatient follow-up was regularly performed without changes in the scheduled program for the most recent transplanted patients the follow-up of patients transplanted from more than one year was performed by phone and only urgent visits were carried out anyway before entering the transplant centre all patients were routinely tested if sars-cov-2 positive they were followed in dedicated rooms in dedicated catheterization and echo-doppler laboratoriescontinuous variables are presented as mean  sd or median and interquartile range and were compared with analysis of variance categorical variables are expressed as count and percentage differences between survivors and non-survivors were tested with t-test or with cross tabulations tables by the fishers exact test with fishers mid-p value arrangement as appropriate a roc analysis was performed to identify the most accurate variables to predict mortality cut-offs were identified according to youdens index a two-sided p-value 005 was considered statistically significant all analyses were performed with spss 200 ibm corp armonk ny usamedian age was 63 years range 22-77 20 77 patients were males mean time from transplant was 10  10 years median 6 mean ejection fraction was 60  8 other clinical characteristics are shown in table 1
 eighteen patients 69 had at least one comorbidity the most frequent ones were arterial hypertension and chronic kidney disease seven patients 27 received heart transplantation after the begin of covid-19 outbreak in china immunosuppressive treatment is shown in table 1 cyclosporin was the most frequent calcineurin inhibitor 85 and 8 patients 31 received three immunosuppressive drugs including oral steroidspatients who died were older than those who survived 71  6 vs 59  12 years respectively p001 had a higher incidence of chronic kidney disease and diabetes 57 vs 37 p 002 and 43 vs 5 p 004 respectively all patients who received heart transplantation after the begin of covid-19 outbreak survived 100 vs 63 in other patients p004 such did all patients receiving oral steroids 100 vs 42 in patients not on steroids p002 no association between calcineurin inhibitors trough levels and adverse events was foundclinical presentation is described in table 2
 the most frequent symptom was fever 81 followed by cough 62 dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent 31 e 23 respectively cough or fever were present in all but two patients 88 at presentation the first symptom was fever 80 or cough 52 gastrointestinal symptoms occurred only in patients taking mycophenolateat the first clinical evaluation 11 patients 42 had low oxygen saturation on room air while 3 had oxygen desaturation at walk test a respiratory rate higher than 14 breaths per minute was recorded in 10 patients 38 and 5 patients 19 had a partial pressure of oxygen lower than 65 mmhg patients who died had a higher respiratory rate and lower oxygen saturation at the first clinical evaluation p001 for bothin all patients a chest x-ray was performed 16 patients 62 presented signs of pneumonia a ct scan was performed in 6 patients showing interstitial involvement with diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities in all patientslaboratory tests are detailed in table 2 leukopenia was found in 13 patients 50 and lymphopenia in 16 62 elevated c-reactive protein was found in 15 patients 58 procalcitonin was high in 5 patients all of them with pneumonia among laboratory findings only high procalcitonin and c-reactive protein were associated with an adverse outcome while all the other tests were notseven patients died all from respiratory failure and in two of them pulmonary embolism was also present deaths occurred after a median of 8 days from hospitalization range 4-16 days seventeen patients 66 had a diagnosis of pneumonia eight of them 47 with a severe form among them only one survived p0001 on the other side all patients without pneumonia were alive at the last clinical follow-up p001 seventeen patients required hospitalization while nine were home quarantined and received a daily phone follow-up all hospitalized patients required oxygen administration for at least one day during hospitalization seven patients had a progression of respiratory failure and ultimately died regardless the ventilatory support to date no quarantined patient has been hospitalized and no death has occurred among outpatients four patients are still in hospital in stable conditions during follow-up all patients had a weekly nasopharyngeal swab and to date virus was no longer found in only one patientno patient had signs or symptoms consistent with acute graft rejection after detection of sars-cov-2 particularly no one had a reduction of systolic function at echo-doppler furthermore 7 patients underwent scheduled endomyocardial biopsies that were all negative both for acute rejection both for myocardial involvement of sars-cov-2among variables at first clinical contact the best predictors of mortality were age higher than 65 years procalcitonin higher than 05 ngml and oxygen saturation on room air lower than 95 with an area under the curve of 078 094 and 089 respectively table 4management of immunosuppressive treatment for covid-19 is detailed in table 3
 as a treatment strategy reduction of immunosuppression with discontinuation of one drug was performed in 9 patients while all other patients continued the same immunosuppressive regimen as before sars-cov-2 infection the discontinued drugs were everolimus or mycophenolate while cyclosporin and tacrolimus were always maintained four patients needed a reduction of mycophenolate because of leukopenia and 7 patients a reduction of daily dose of cyclosporin tacrolimus or everolimus because of interactions with antiviral treatment thirteen patients received steroids during covid-19 seven of them intravenously methylprednisolone 1 mgkgday while six continued oral prednisone all patients on steroids survived the association of steroids with better outcome was also confirmed when considering intravenous steroids only 100 vs 63 of pts p004 or excluding patients without pneumonia 100 vs 22 of pts p0001specific treatment for covid-19 is detailed in table 3 the treatment was regularly revised according to the emerging evidence in the literature all patients received symptomatic treatment eighteen patients 69 received oral hydroxychloroquine median dose 200 mg bid no side effects were observed with hydroxychloroquine though a mild increase of immunosuppressors was recorded hydroxychloroquine was usually stopped after resolution of symptoms the majority of patients 85 received also empirical antibiotic treatment first choice macrolide andor beta-lactam though a superimposed bacterial infection was documented in two patients only six patients with severe pneumonia were treated with lopinavirritonavir however after a few days the antiviral treatment was discontinued in both patients because of lack of clinical benefit18 and because of significant pharmacological interactions with immunosuppressive treatment ie increase of calcineurin inhibitors though levels higher than twice from baseline no patient received remdesivir tocilizumab or convalescent serum no one had qt interval greater than 480 ms mean qtc 455  15 msto date this is one of the largest series of solid organ transplant recipients with sars-cov-2 infection the main results are 1 covid-19 has a high mortality and hospitalization rate in heart transplanted patients 2 mortality is associated with age comorbidities worse presentation at the onset of symptoms and a longer time from transplant 3 patients who received heart transplantation during sars-cov-2 outbreak had a mild disease and no transplant-related complications 4 mortality rate was higher in those patients with a lower immunosuppressive therapy while the use of steroids seemed to be protectivethis is a cohort from two centers in the north of italy the two centers are located in the epicenter of the italian epidemic testing has been performed only in patients with symptoms or requiring outpatient clinic admission therefore the real incidence in our cohort is probably underestimated however our data show that the incidence of sars-cov-2 infection in transplanted patients was higher than in the overall italian population19 the higher incidence may be related to the characteristics of transplanted patients and to a higher risk of exposure due to frequent hospital admissions in fact transplanted patients with covid-19 were older than the overall italian covid-19 population the cohort was even older than covid-19 population described in china by guan and colleagues20 and the one reported in a meta-analysis by rodriguez-morales et al21 besides among covid-19 heart transplanted patients there were more males than in the general italian covid-19 positive population 77 vs 57 these data however are in line with the higher prevalence of males in the heart transplanted population according to the registry of the international society for heart and lung transplantation22
moreover the mortality rate of this cohort was higher than expected in fact in italy in the general population over 60 years the mortality rate for covid-19 the overall hospitalization rate and the icu hospitalization rate are 126 204 and 45 respectively our cohort showed alarming high rates of both mortality hospitalization and icu admission 27 65 and 19 respectively interestingly both the case fatality rate and baseline characteristics were similar to those recently reported by latif et al the high case fatality rate observed in heart transplanted patients may be due to the characteristics of the cohort evaluated in the analysis the majority of our cohort is represented by long-term heart transplanted survivors these patients are chronically exposed to a long immunosuppressive therapy and at high risk to develop side-effects although they show a good heart function this population must be considered very fragile due to the presence of different comorbidities ie chronic kidney disease related to a long exposure to immunosuppressive drugs in a transplanted cohort the association of advanced age with time-dependent comorbidities such as calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity and other common complications of immunosuppressive therapy may be detrimental also this conditions often require frequent in-hospital visits increasing the risk of exposure to sars-cov-2 these characteristics may therefore explain the higher incidence sars-cov-2 infection the more severe clinical presentation and the higher mortality rate in transplanted patients the incidence of infection appeared to be unrelated with time from transplant however all the recently transplanted patients survived and seemed less prone to develop severe covid-19 than those transplanted from a longer periodclinical presentation was similar to non-transplanted patients the incidence of fever and cough was in line with previous reports at least one of the two was present in almost all patients interestingly dyspnea at onset was less frequent and was not associated with adverse outcome gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly more frequent than in the overall covid-19 population 23 vs 4-6 it is difficult to explain this finding however all these patients were receiving mycophenolate that may have gastro-intestinal side-effects physical evaluation and radiological examination suggesting severe pneumonia at onset were the most accurate predictors of worse outcome the diagnostic and prognostic utility of laboratory findings may be challenged since immunosuppressive drugs may reduce the inflammatory response in transplanted patients however both c-reactive protein and procalcitonin were higher in patients who died while leukopenia and lymphopenia were notduring the covid-19 outbreak the management of immunosuppression is challenging in our experience reduction of immunosuppression could not provide a significant benefit and on the contrary this strategy was associated with a worse outcome it must be recognized that it is not possible to discriminate if deterioration was related with this strategy or it was the result of an independent progression of the disease and immunosuppression reduction only a marker of more severely ill patients in our series patients on oral steroids required for the age of transplant ie recent transplants or because of recurrent acute rejection did not have severe pneumonia nor died moreover all patients that received heart transplantation within three months had a higher grade of immunosuppression ie three immunosuppressive drugs and did not develop a severe disease these results are of interest because they support the theory of a protective role of immunosuppression in the control of cytokine storm syndrome related with virus infection23 however it must be recognized that these results should be interpreted with caution owing to potential bias and residual confounders in this observational study with a small sample size and a more robust evidence is required it should be also considered that patients who received heart transplantation in the last three months were younger had less comorbidities and followed a strict protocol of mitigation strategies such as quarantine or social distancing these characteristics may adequately explain the better observed outcome no differences were found between the incidence of covid-19 and the type of immunosuppressive agent nor their concentration was associated with severity of covid-19once some evidence on the beneficial effect of methylprednisolone has emerged in the literature24 some of our patients received steroids as infection treatment in our population the use of intravenous steroids as infection therapy was not associated with severe covid-19 or with progression of the viral disease suggesting a limited impact on viral load although generalization is not possible this may suggest that the treatment of acute rejection with intravenous steroid may not be contraindicated and in the evaluation between the risk of graft failure due to the presence of significant rejection and the potentially worsening of viral infection due to corticosteroid therapy the strategy may be in favor of rejection treatmentthis paper was intended to report the experience of two italian centers on heart transplanted recipients with sars-cov-2 infection and not to evaluate the efficacy of the suggested treatment for covid-1925 this will be hopefully provided by ongoing randomized clinical trials ie nct04252664 nct04257656 and chictr2000029765 patients requiring covid-19 specific treatments oxygen enoxaparin hydroxychloroquine had a worse outcome but it must be considered that the sickest patients were those more likely to receive those treatments however it should be emphasized that patients well tolerated hydroxychloroquine without significant pharmacological interactions with immunosuppression while lopinavirritonavir was often discontinued because of significant drug interactions unfortunately other rescue treatments such as tocilizumab remdesivir or convalescent serum were not used in our populations because some of them were not available and some of them were allowed exclusively in clinical trialsthe current analysis has some limitations the observational nature of the study the small sample size and the lack of a comparison group do not allow to draw definite conclusions on the association between outcome and clinical variables particularly the association between treatment both triple immunosuppression and use of steroids and outcome may depend on baseline differences among subgroups and not on the treatment itself the high level of variation in therapy and baseline immunosuppression may confound the findings and limit interpretation of the association between treatment and outcome moreover the individual impact of each single treatment can not be adequately assessed as multiple therapies were given some cases had missing data this limits the sample size further and the reliability of correlations the follow-up is short and still ongoing hence late adverse events were not recorded finally not all heart transplanted patients in the two centers have been tested for sars-cov-2 and this cohort deriving mostly from two covid-19 hotbeds could not be representative of the general population of heart transplanted patientsin conclusion sars-cov-2 infection showed a high mortality in heart transplanted patients although it burdened mainly old and frail patients in transplanted patients with covid-19 discontinuation of immunosuppression is not supported by any evidence on contrary in our cohort it was associated with poor outcome while the continuation or the initiation of steroids was associated with better outcome finally although it is difficult to draw definitive indications based on our initial experience recently transplanted patients with sars-cov-2 infection had not a poorer outcome this pleads to maintain active the transplant programs even during the epidemic phase of the infection at least for life-saving organs in our opinion the critical points to keep as safer as possible the transplant activity are 1 a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio between the urgent needs of the recipient and covid-19-related risk 2 the identification of covid-19-free paths for the transplant centers with periodically testing both patients and personnel 3 a meticulous screening of donor and recipient to demonstrate the absence of virus at the time of donation and transplant 4 an accurate donor-recipient matching reducing the post-operative risk allowing a rapid discharge from icu and hospital of the newly transplanted patientsno funding sources were received

 a large study from the chinese center for disease control and prevention revealed that among 72314 covid-19 patients 814 had mild symptoms while severe and critical presentations were only observed in 139 and 47 of cases respectively17 mild presentations generally consist of symptoms common to other viral infections the flu-like syndrome17 anosmia andor dysgeusia have also been reported particularly in mild presentations18 severe covid-19 may present as pneumonia ards with or without distributive and cardiogenic shock17ace2 represents a key counter regulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas that degrades angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17 attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction sodium retention and fibrosis3 after the initial engagement of ace2 by the sars-cov-2 spike protein there is subsequent down-regulation of ace2 leading to a reduction of angiotensin-173 which triggers acute lung damage importantly this injury can be attenuated in animal models by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei or angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb19patients with underlying heart disease are among the highest-risk individuals for developing severe forms of the disease including death5172021 a meta-analysis including 1527 chinese patients with covid-19 reported the following prevalence of hypertension diabetes cardiac and cerebrovascular disease 171 97 and 164 respectively21 comorbidity burden has been associated with the severity of covid-19 infection and the need for icu admission21 while overall case fatality rate among 44672 confirmed covid-19 cases from wuhan was 23 higher rates were observed in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease 105 diabetes 73 and hypertension 617 data from italy confirmed increased mortality rates in patients with comorbidities particularly the older adults with pre-existent cardiovascular conditions22patients with cardiovascular disease are generally older adults aging-related immunological quiescence may predispose to higher attack rates in the older adults23 furthermore diabetes and dyslipidemia highly prevalent in this subset of patients also represent markers of immunological dysregulation impacting on covid-19 infection susceptibility and outcomes424 as previously reported with other viral infections particularly influenza covid-19 might increase the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events and induce acute exacerbation of chronic conditions such as ischemic heart disease or chronic heart failure24it has been speculated that some drugs could increase susceptibility to developing severe forms of covid-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease receiving arb or acei have an upregulation of ace2 which would be therefore available in great amounts to offer a binding site for sars-cov-23424 however this concern derived from in-vitro and animal studies has not found confirmation in clinical practice24 indeed in a large multinational cohort of 8910 covid-19 patients mehra et al25 did not observe an increase in the risk of in-hospital death associated with the use of acei 21 vs 61 odds ratio 033 95 confidence interval 020-054 or arb 68 vs 57 odds ratio 123 95 confidence interval 087-174 similarly in a large population-based study from northern italy the use of acei and arb was more frequent among patients with covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease however there was no evidence that such drugs affected the risk of covid-19 26 furthermore reynolds et al27 found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for covid-19 or in the risk of severe covid-19 presentations in association with five common classes of antihypertensive drugs acei arb beta-blockers calcium-channel blockers and thiazide diuretics therefore given the balance of pros and cons of withholding such drugs professional societies have warned against discontinuation of aceis and arbs as it could paradoxically lead to increased mortality related to the exacerbation of cardiovascular and renal conditions424finally older adults may also receive non-cardiovascular medications such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and may require insulin or secretagogues for diabetes mellitus these drugs notoriously alter salt and water handling particularly in the presence of impaired renal function and may worsen respiratory complications including pulmonary edema and consequent hypoxia24

outlines the evaluation and management algorithms for the most common scenariosmyocardial injury is detected by an increased troponin level and can be due to myocardial ischemia or non-ischemic myocardial injury including myocarditis use of the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction mi is recommended for diagnosis4one possible mechanism of acute myocardial injury caused by sars-cov-2 infection could be its affinity to ace2 which is widely expressed in the heart and cause direct myocardial injury517 other proposed pathways include a cytokine storm triggered by an imbalanced response by type 1 and type 2 t-helper cells5 sympathetic hyperactivity anemia and hypoxemic myocardial cells damage due to respiratory dysfunction type 2 michinese reports estimated that myocardial injury occurs in 7-20 of hospitalized covid-19 patients4 myocardial injury associated with sars-cov-2 occurred in 5 of the first 41 covid-19 patients 122 in wuhan revealed by an increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i levels 28 pgml6 in this study 4 of 5 80 patients with myocardial injury were admitted to the icu which suggests the serious prognostic implications of myocardial injury in patients with covid-196in a small meta-analysis 4 studies 341 patients standardized mean differences of cardiac troponin i levels were significantly higher in those with severe covid-19-related symptoms compared to those with non-severe presentation28 myocardial injury present in 197 of covid-19 patients was associated with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers more severe pulmonary involvement higher need for non-invasive and invasive ventilation and increased rates of ards acute kidney injury and coagulation disorders29 patients with myocardial injury were at higher risk of death29it is hence reasonable to perform an initial measurement of serum troponin upon admission for sars-cov-2 infection as well as longitudinal monitoring during hospital stay30 this in turn could identify high-risk individuals who might be the target of advanced therapies including immune response modulation strategiesin a series reporting on 68 deaths in a cohort of 150 covid-19 patients 7 were attributed to myocarditis with hemodynamic collapse while in 33 of cases myocarditis could have played a contributing role to patient death31 although the clinical picture is still referred to as a myocarditis in many instances myocardial infection by sars-cov-2 was not proven in most cases with covid-19 myocardial involvement to date only isolated case reports provided data on the pathology of the myocardial tissue from covid-19 patients which preclude drawing definitive conclusions on this topic3233 sala et al32 reported on a 43-year-old woman with covid-19 who presented with a reverse tako-tsubo syndrome and mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction cardiac magnetic resonance cmr revealed diffuse myocardial edema on the basal and mid left ventricular segments with no detectable scar endomyocardial biopsy documented diffuse t-lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates and huge interstitial edema without any other substantial damage molecular analysis showed absence of the sars-cov-2 genome within the myocardium32 tavazzi et al33 described for the first time a biopsy-proven myocardial localization of viral particles in a covid-19 patient presenting with cardiogenic shock although the clinical presentation suggested severe and necrotizing acute myocarditis the pathology report demonstrated only low-grade myocardial inflammation and absence of myocyte necrosis33 importantly sars-cov-2 was only demonstrated in interstitial cytopathic macrophages and their surroundings while no viral particle was found in cardiac myocytes which showed non-specific damage mainly focal myofibrillar lysis33 either transient viremia or infected macrophage migration from the lung might occur in covid19 patients with nonacute myocardial involvement the available data seem to rule out a classic myocarditis presentation ie direct infection of myocardial cells by the virus while they suggest that myocardial involvement in covid-19 might rather be due to the cytokine release syndromecmr availability issues coupled with the potential for in-hospital spread of the virus related to the logistics of performing such test hampers the utilization of this valuable imaging modality in this context endomyocardial biopsy could provide key insights whereas bedside echocardiography could give information on left ventricular functionno consensus exists on the appropriate treatment of myocarditis associated with covid-19 in addition to mechanical circulatory support antiviral therapy lopinavir-ritonavir immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone were successfully used in the management of some case reports of fulminant myocarditis3435pericardial effusion remains an uncommon finding in the literature and few cases of tamponade in the setting of covid-19 have been reported3637kwong et al38 previously demonstrated that patients with acute respiratory infections were at increased risk for subsequently developing acute mi after both influenza and non-influenza viral illnesses including other coronavirus species covid-19 might trigger an intense inflammatory response which could also increase the risk of coronary plaque rupturethe actual prevalence of acute coronary syndromes acs in the setting of covid-19 infection is unknown given the gaps in testing witnessed in numerous countries in the early phases of the pandemic particularly in the absence of typical symptoms suggesting covid-19 infectionin 28 italian stemi patients with covid-19 stefanini et al39 reported that stemi represented the first clinical manifestation of covid-19 in the majority of cases 857 early mortality was 393 interestingly angiography demonstrated the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease in 393 of cases a finding also reported in the us by bangalore et al40 who found non-obstructive disease in one-third of the patients who underwent coronary angiography in this latter series the prognosis of stemi presentation was even worse than in the previous report with a 72 in-hospital mortality ratein addition to type 2 mi myocarditis and stress cardiomyopathy microvascular thrombosis has also been hypothesized as a mechanism underlying certain cases mimicking stemi presentation without obstructive coronary artery disease given the endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulable state associated with covid-19in 138 hospitalized covid-19 patients cardiac arrhythmias represented the leading complication 196 and were more common in patients requiring icu admission 444 vs 691 guo et al41 revealed that in 187 covid-19 positive patients stratified by the level of troponin malignant ventricular arrhythmias was twice more frequent in the presence of elevated troponin levels 115 vs 52 ventricular arrhythmias might also represent the first clinical manifestation of sars-cov-2 infectionin 136 covid-19 patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest shao et al42 revealed that the most common initial rhythm was asystole in 897 of cases pulseless electrical activity was found in 44 while a shockable rhythm was identified in only 59 of patientsin the context of lockdown and overwhelmed healthcare systems unable to provide timely emergency responses sudden cardiac death has been reported in patients with initially mild symptoms who were later found dead at home while in quarantine16 in 4 italian provinces baldi et al43 reported an increase of 58 in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the 40 days of the covid-19 outbreak in comparison with the same period in 2019 moreover the cumulative incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2020 was strongly associated with the cumulative incidence of covid-19 and the increase in the number of cases over the number in 2019 followed the time course of the covid-19 outbreak43in the setting of covid-19 arrhythmias might be due to the following mechanisms i direct viral damage to myocardial cells andor conduction system ii worsening of pre-existing myocardial conditions or conduction disturbances iii electrolytic derangements iv adrenergic stress leading to electrical instability and v acs with ongoing ischemiathe high-grade systemic inflammatory state characteristic of covid-19 represents another potential important pro-arrhythmic factor that should not be underestimated44 indeed strong evidence points to inflammation as a novel risk factor for long qt-syndrome and torsades de pointes primarily via direct electrophysiological effects of cytokines particularly il-1 il-6 and tnf- on the myocardium by modulating the expression andor function of several cardiomyocyte ion k and ca channels44finally some therapies proposed for treatment of covid-19 have been reported to cause arrhythmias45 see below and supplementary table s1concomitant heart failure was present in 23 to 49 of patients infected with covid-194647 notably it was associated with worse prognosis as it was almost 5 times more common in patients who did not survive the hospitalization 519 vs 11746 similar to troponin elevation of b-type natriuretic peptides bnpnt-probnp is associated with an unfavorable course among patients with ards31in the setting of covid-19 heart failure could be attributable to either the exacerbation of underlying cardiovascular disease or the new onset of cardiomyopathy particularly myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy isolated right heart failure can be observed in presence of pulmonary hypertension in the setting of severe ards andor pulmonary embolismmoreover older adults with cardiovascular disease often have left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction thus these patients may be prone to develop pulmonary edema when they are given copious amounts of intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure or as a vehicle for parenteral drug infusion24 however pulmonary edema as observed in the setting of covid-19 could also represent the manifestation of a pulmonary vascular injury which might be direct or mediated by the excess of local angiotensin-2 inducing severe vasoconstriction and microvascular dysfunction and activating inflammation process24in the context of covid-19 shock mechanisms could be either exclusively distributive septic or mixed distributive and cardiogenic cardiogenic shock might be prominent in case of fulminant myocardial involvement bnp and transthoracic echocardiogram are valuable to guide treatment24 right heart catheterization can also be useful in case of discrepancy of other tests but at the expense of a higher risk of in-hospital spread of the virus4in patients not responding to conventional management it is important to determine whether a concomitant cardiogenic component is present particularly when considering mechanical respiratory and circulatory support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo as this may impact device selection venovenous vs venoarterial48 figure 3 initial data in the setting of ards due to covid-19 showed that the prognosis remain poor even with ecmo use mortality rate 82349 in 12 critically ill covid-19 patients requiring ecmo zeng et al50 found that nearly half of them died from septic shock and multiorgan failure ecmo support duration ranged from 3 to 28 days50 a pooled analysis of early reports including 234 ards patients revealed that only 17 72 received ecmo51 the mortality rate was 941 in ecmo patients and 709 in conventional therapy patients51 the pooled effect of ecmo versus conventional therapy on mortality was neutral or 200 95ci 04981651 the extracorporeal life support organization elso recommends ecmo use only in expert centers in patients with severe ards pao2fio2100 after collegial discussion on a case-by-case basis52 ecmo can be considered futile and the patient can be returned to conventional management if no lung or cardiac recovery are observed after 21 days52covid-19 patients may be at increased risk of venous thromboembolism vte in addition to prolonged immobilization endothelial damage and vascular inflammation contribute to the development of a hypercoagulable state in a multicenter chinese study53 elevated d-dimer levels 1 gl were an independent predictor of in-hospital death d-dimer and fibrin degradation products levels were significantly higher in non-survivors furthermore disseminated intravascular coagulation was reported in 714 of patients who subsequently diedin a study of 184 patients with severe covid-19 from three centers in the netherlands 31 of patients developed vte despite pharmacological prophylaxis54 poissy et al55 reported a cumulative incidence of pulmonary embolism pe of 204 95 confidence interval 131-287 in a cohort of covid-19 patients in critical conditions in 901 of cases pe occurred in patients already receiving prophylactic antithrombotic treatment the incidence of pe in this cohort was significantly higher than that observed before the pandemic in patients with different conditions of similar severity or influenza infection therefore in case of hemodynamic or respiratory deterioration in a patient with stable parenchymal pulmonary involvement pulmonary embolism should be suspectedthe optimal thromboprophylactic regimen for patients hospitalized with covid-19 remains unknown low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin with or without mechanical compression stocking can be considered according to patient risk profile56several risk stratification tools can be used for vte risk assessment in this setting eg the caprini improve and padua models56 therapeutic anticoagulation even in absence of obvious vte complication could be considered in severely ill patients with high d-dimer although at present this recommendation is not substantiated by solid data56 systemic thrombolysis or catheter-based interventions might be considered in patients with massive pe and hemodynamic compromise percutaneous right ventricular assist devices or venovenous ecmo might be contemplated in young patients with right ventricular failure5758 figure 3ischemic stroke has been recognized as a complication of severe forms of covid-1959 which is thought to be associated with the highly prothrombotic state and major endothelial dysfunction caused by the infection beyrouti et al60 reported a case series of six covid-19 patients with stroke large-vessel occlusion with markedly elevated d-dimer levels 1000 gl were observed in all patients three patients had multiterritory infarcts two had concurrent vte and in two ischemic strokes occurred despite therapeutic anticoagulation60 similarly oxley et al61 reported on five young covid-19 patients age from 33 to 49 years who presented with large-vessel ischemic stroke such an association between large-vessel stroke and covid-19 in young patients requires further investigation therapeutic anticoagulation and thrombolysis could be beneficial to mitigate the consequences of stroke in this setting but must be balanced against the risk of hemorrhagic transformation particularly considering the critical conditions of these patients and the delays in diagnosis due to sedation and other concomitant acute issuesthe recent emergence of covid-19 and the psychosocial aspects related to the pandemic have put healthcare systems under pressure with an increasing number of infected individuals as well as shortage of personal protective equipment ppe among healthcare providers ventilators and certain drugsthe following recommendations are proposals to inform clinical decision-making among healthcare providers dealing with cardiovascular patients in the setting of the covid-19 pandemic these considerations are dynamic and might change in the coming weeksthe escalation of this health crisis has led to cancellation of elective cardiovascular procedures and outpatient visits due to the concern of disease transmission among healthcare providers and other patients as well as to optimize resource allocation telemedicine is recommended for triage management of non-emergent conditions and renewal of prescriptions for chronic stable patients4 any non-essential diagnostic investigation should be deferred at the same time it is important to continue guaranteeing care to cardiovascular emergencies and perform such non-deferrable procedures after collegial discussion on a case-by-case basis46263the optimal management strategy for patients with acs has generated controversy during this pandemic period46263 figure 3 in st-elevation myocardial infarction stemi patients chinese providers have developed algorithms that emphasize rapid testing for covid-19 infection and immediate fibrinolysis since in their healthcare system the logistics of primary pci have been severely disrupted by the critical need to protect healthcare providers from contagion6264 the canadian association of interventional cardiology instead recommends primary pci in low covid-19 probability in the absence of major logistic restrictions while fibrinolysis could be considered in moderatehigh probability or covid-19 positive stemi patients particularly in the presence of staffresource limitations65 pci in catheterization laboratories with aerosol-level ppe should also be considered in case of fibrinolysis contraindication or failure or in cases with cardiogenic shock due to acs65 even in case of successful initial fibrinolysis planned pci should be performed within 24 hours65for non-st-elevation acs nste-acs patients medical therapy should be initially pursued revascularization should be considered in case of refractory chest pain malignant arrhythmia and hemodynamic instability with rapid discharge following revascularization626365efforts should be made to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 mi and other causes of troponin rise626365 diagnostic and interventional procedures should be deferred in patients with type 2 mi myocardial injury and patients with suspected myocarditis without cardiogenic shock coronary computed tomography angiography performed at the time of lung evaluation in cases with severe respiratory involvement might be useful to rule out coronary artery diseaseroutine elective cardiac surgery procedures should be rescheduled while patients at high risk for short-term adverse cardiac events should still be offered surgical treatment466 given icu bed shortages and the risk for in-hospital contagion medical management as a bridge to intervention after the pandemic should also be considered in selected individuals the canadian society of cardiac surgeons have issued detailed recommendations regarding elective and emergency procedures66as the initial peak of the covid-19 pandemic starts to slowly abate in may 2020 professional cardiovascular societies indicated an ethical and logistic framework for the gradual reintroduction of invasive cardiovascular procedures and diagnostics tests67 patients with untreated cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of adverse outcomes and efforts should be made to reestablish prior pathways of care while simultaneously minimizing the risk of covid-19 resurgencelittle is known about the indirect impact of covid-19 on cardiovascular outcomes of non-infected individuals us investigators reported a 38 decrease in cardiac catheterization laboratory stemi activations68 which is similar to reductions in pci rates for acs observed in italy 32 and spain 406970 emergency medical services from hong kong reported a mean increase of 4 hours in time from symptom onset to first medical contact for stemi patients7 presumably because of patient hesitancy in seeking care due to concerns about possible in-hospital covid-19 contagion such delays might have a detrimental impact on prognosis71 previously uncommon mechanical complications of myocardial infarction are now being frequently observed which could be again due to delays in seeking care71 even more worrisome is the 58 increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest observed by italian investigators during the pandemic which could reflect the extreme consequences of such medical care avoidance behavior43 finally further in-hospital delays can be expected among patients admitted to the hospital which are related to covid-19 infection testing and implementation of precautions for healthcare providers7controlling exposures to occupational infections is fundamental to protect healthcare providers workers who enter the room of a patient with known or suspected covid-19 should adhere to standard precautions and use a mask face shield gown gloves and eye protection when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedure agp the provider should wear an n95 mask and a face shield or a powered air-purifying respirator papr additional control measures include limiting the number of healthcare providers to only those essential for patient care during the procedure and performing agps in an airborne infection isolation rooms with negative air pressure considerations to prevent infection among cardiovascular providers are summarized in table 2

the covid-19 pandemic represents the most important public health crisis of the century the health economic and societal impacts will be felt for many years to come patients with cardiovascular disease are particularly vulnerable to covid-19 and often develop severe forms of the infection several cardiovascular manifestations have been observed in covid-19 patients including myocardial injury myocarditis acute coronary syndromes pulmonary embolism stroke arrhythmias heart failure and cardiogenic shock covid-19 has profoundly reshaped usual pathways of care of both elective and acute cardiac patients further research is needed to precisely define the pathophysiology of covid-19 and to identify and properly evaluate drugs targeting the most relevant mechanisms that characterize severe manifestations of the disease collaborative initiatives should harness both conventional and novel tools to provide an effective and timely response to the covid-19 pandemic on the global stagethe recent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars due to coronavirus 2 cov-2 infection pandemic and subsequent spread of the disease called covid-19 brought back to discussion a topic already highlighted during the sars-cov-1 and coronavirus-related sars known as the middle east respiratory distress syndrome mers of 2002 and 2013 during those outbreaks it was observed a particularly elevated incidence of cardiovascular disease among patients who were also characterized by being elderly and in particular during the mers prevalently male 1 2another main topic of the discussion is the role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace 2 indeed this carboxypeptidase has been identified as a functional receptor for the spike protein of the coronaviruses outer membrane including sars-cov-2 3 ace2 is strongly expressed in the epithelium of different organs such as the kidney heart and lungsace2 shares a large affinity to the amino peptidase ace that is target to the ace inhibitors a class of antihypertensive drugs ace inhibitors represent the most used class of cardiovascular agents in the world for the treatment of epidemic cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension and heart failure although not directly inhibited by ace inhibitors ace2 is affected by chronic treatment with this class of drugs which leads to an increase in ace2 expression in several tissues 4 interestingly this feature is also shared by another class of drugs the angiotensin receptor-1 blockers arbs whose chronic administration is as well able to increase the level of expression of ace2 and also its activity as assessed by the circulating levels of the ace2 product angiotensin 17 5 these findings support the concern that the treatment with renin-angiotensin system ras inhibitors could make covid-19 symptoms more severe due to increased expression of ace2remarkably both issues have been re-proposed in the occurrence of the present epidemic of covid-19 in particular the issue of the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases among covid-19 patients is proposed by observational data obtained in chinese 6 and italian patients 7in this context we still lack the analysis of the confounding effects of age on the apparent association between cardiovascular disease covid-19 infection and clinical severity indeed the observed prevalence of male and elderly patients observed especially in the italian covid-19 population is a confounding factor that needs to be corrected for before any conclusive association is drawn this concern has been expressed by many 810similarly the ace2 upregulation argument has never been demonstrated in humans indeed while there is conflicting evidence from animal studies that arbs probably not ace inhibitors may upregulate membrane-bound ace2 in tissue-specific manners eg heart but not kidney these data cannot be extrapolated to humans and are not sufficient to support facilitation of sars-cov-2 entry 9 in particular it has never been demonstrated that the ace2 upregulation in the human lung occurs upon ras inhibition and even less that this causes a worsening of the covid-19 disease furthermore it can also be speculated that ace2 upregulation is protective indeed it has been shown that the binding of coronavirus to ace2 leads to the downregulation of ace2 11 which in turn causes an aceace2 imbalance and to the excessive production of angiotensin ii by the related ace enzyme this excess of angiotensin ii stimulates angiotensin ii receptor type 1 at1r and might cause an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability and lung damage 12 therefore according to this hypothesis the upregulation of ace2 caused by the chronic intake of at1r and ace inhibitors could be protective through two mechanisms first by blocking the increased production of angiotensin 17 which has been advocated as a possible mechanism of protection for the lung second by reducing the production of angiotensin ii it removes a cause of lung damage 13in this context of uncertainty there are advocates within the scientific community raising their voices for the cessation of ace inhibitors and arbs among patients taking these drugs that is claimed for both the prevention of the infection and the attenuation of the symptoms in case of infection these speculative claims are then taken over by the laical press starting a word of mouth that sustains panic behaviors among the general populationthe italian society of hypertension siia therefore takes a clear and firm position in line with statements by other international societies see table 1 siia states the following itemsthere is no evidence to associate hypertension or other cvds with covid-19 disease if hypertension was a predisposing factor for coronavirus infection there should be more hypertensives among covid-19 patients than observed in the general population to date there is no evidence that people with hypertension are overrepresented among those infected with covid-19there is no clinical evidence in humans that associates the intake of ace inhibitors or arbs with covid-19 disease at present we can neither say that they improve nor say they worsen the susceptibility to coronavirus infectionthere are no clinical data in patients that can confirm the harmful effect not even the protective one of ace inhibitors and arb in the context of the covid-19 epidemicfurthermore siia reiterates that subsequent points
aacute suspension without medical control of cardiovascular therapy and specifically of antihypertensive treatment increases the occurrence of acute events including hypertensive emergencies heart failure decompensation heart attacks and strokebthe favorable effects of ace inhibitors and arbs on the control of the progression of cvds in general and in particular of hypertensive patients have been confirmed for many years and for this reason ras inhibitors represent central agents for the management of cardiovascular conditions that cannot be easily substituted 10cin hypertensive patients with covid-19 or at risk of covid-19 infection ace inhibitors and arbs treatment should be maintained according to the recommendations contained in the 2018 escesh guidelines 10dsimilarly in all patients currently on therapy with ace inhibitors arbs and in the case of patients with heart failure also the arnis these drugs must not be suspendedein patients with covid-19 with severe symptoms or sepsis ace inhibitors and arbs like all other antihypertensive drugs should be used or discontinued on a case by case basis taking into account current guidelines
siia hopes and promotes further research that analyzes the constantly increasing data on the impact of hypertension and antihypertensive drugs in particular ace inhibitors and arbs on the clinical course of covid-19 infections in order to update these positions as new evidence becomes availablein particular to clarify which mechanism is prevalent and has a role in the clinical manifestation of covid-19 siia has launched a fact-finding investigation to verify the impact of therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system on the onset and clinical manifestation of the disease covid-19 this observational research is based on an online questionnaire made of 18 questions to collect information on medical history and the evolution of the disease in covid19 patients id nct04331574 clinicaltrialsgovthe current outbreak of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has quickly progressed to a global health emergency as of april 2020 very few countries remain unfamiliar with the devastation of the virions consequences according to the johns hopkins covid-19 resource center 2 million people worldwide have been infected with the virus as of 16 april 2020 since its origin in december 2019 12 at this point the organ involvement of covid-19 appears to be primarily respiratory with a range of disease severity the range includes asymptomatic subclinical infection or mild upper respiratory tract illness to nonlife-threatening pneumonia to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards requiring intensive care mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 3 however much is unknown about the extrapulmonary manifestations of the disease currently evidence has suggested gastrointestinal and hepatic involvement as well as cardiac complications such as myocarditis from sars-cov-2 4 5 6 7since the 1960s multiple human coronaviruses have been identified which usually cause mild self-limiting disease however there are also more lethal forms including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and of course the current sars-cov-2 8 corona meaning crown or garland in latin was used to describe this virus when it was first seen due to its spike-like capsid 9 importantly these spikes have demonstrated binding capability to the metallo-peptidase angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 in a study by li et al done over a decade ago in an attempt to better understand the behavior of the sars-cov subfamily 10 inspired by this finding other groups such as hamming et al explored the expression pattern of ace-2 and noted that its presence in lung alveolar epithelial cells small intestine epithelial cells arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells 11 the variety of ace-2 tissue expression furthers suggests the correlation between sars-cov-2 and extrapulmonary manifestationscardiovascular manifestations are not unique to this coronavirus pandemic in 2016 a case report documented a patient infected with mers-cov who was found to have acute heart failure secondary to myocarditis confirmed by cardiac mri 12 before then in 2009 oudit et al suggested that the interaction between the sars-cov subfamily and ace-2 mediated myocardial damage leading to systolic dysfunction and arrhythmias 13 14 15 16 while much remains unclear about this new coronavirus strain sars-cov-2 case reports similar to those of past outbreaks suggesting cardiac involvement have begun to emerge 123940 in addition these more recent reports have suggested that patients experiencing myocardial injury from sars-cov-2 have a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality 17 given the prevalence and apparent impact on patient outcomes with covid-19 this paper aims to review the effects of the novel virus on the cardiovascular system including its relationship with myocardial damageit is not known how underlying cardiovascular disease cvd contributes to the severity of covid-19 disease does comorbid cvd increase the likelihood of developing severe disease andor increase the risk of myocardial injury lessons from sars and mers are unclear with regard to the impact of cvd on disease severity a meta-analysis of 637 cases of mers identified the prevalence of cvd hypertension and diabetes to be 30 50 and 50 respectively 18 authors suggest that metabolic syndrome-related conditions such as cvd may predispose patients to increased risk for mers infection through increased systemic inflammation and dysregulation of the immune system while it is intuitive that the underlying cardiovascular disease burden may decrease the bodys reserve to fight a severe infection the data is far from definitivemany recent studies have indicated cvd as a risk factor for severe covid-19 disease 19 20 21 a summary of 44672 covid-19 cases documented by the chinese center for disease control and prevention demonstrated a case fatality rate of 105 with comorbid cvd compared to a 24 overall case fatality rate 2 a meta-analysis by bo li et al of 1527 patients mostly in wuhan china indicated the prevalence of hypertension cardiac and cerebrovascular disease and diabetes to be 171 164 and 97 respectively amongst patients with covid-19 a sub-group analysis showed that cardiac and cerebrovascular disease was present in 167 of cases requiring icu admission while only 62 of non-icu cases 20 a recent retrospective study by guo et al in a single center in wuhan china examined mortality associated with cvd comorbidity and troponin t tnt elevation on admission 22 in this study cvd was defined as patients with hypertension coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy comorbid cvd and elevated tnt was associated with the highest mortality of 694 elevated tnt without underlying cvd was 375 comorbid cvd without tnt elevation was 133 compared to 76 for individuals without cvd or tnt elevations on admission importantly individuals with cvd were significantly more likely to experience elevated tnt on admission compared to patients without underlying disease indicating an increased susceptibility to cardiac tissue insult due to underlying chronic diseasevarious mechanisms have been suggested to explain the increased vulnerability of patients with underlying cvd for severe covid-19 disease one mechanism direct myocardial injury will be addressed subsequently in this review other proposed mechanisms include 1 ineffective adaptation of the cardiovascular system to the increased demand of severe viral illness coupled with decreased systemic oxygenation during pneumonia 23 24 25 2 immune dysregulation including t cell and immune signaling dysfunction recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis of vascular disease may also adversely affect the bodys response to sars-cov-2 infection 26 27 28 29 3 electrolyte imbalances and adverse medication effects may disproportionately challenge a diseased heart with special consideration for the regimen of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment due to the potential for qtc prolongation 530 future studies are needed to elucidate these mechanisms and continue to identify targeted interventions for patients with underlying cvdcardiac dysfunction is not a common sequela of covid-19 disease however myocardial injury has been noted in a significant number of infected patients and it would not be the first time a coronavirus was associated with cardiac complications with previous sars infections patients have developed systolic and diastolic dysfunction with subsequent heart failure arrhythmias and sudden death due to myocardial injury 1415 in a study by li et al patients experiencing acute phase infection of sars demonstrated impaired left ventricular performance observed via echocardiography 14 a study by yu et al showed that in a cohort of 121 sars infected patients there was documented tachycardia despite being afebrile and disease resolution hypotension bradycardia and cardiomegaly during their disease courses 15 while many of these complications were self-limiting it demonstrates the propensity for the sars coronavirus subfamily to infect and modulate cardiac tissue potentiating myocardial damagethe evidence implicating the sars-cov-2 as a cause of myocardial damage appears to be more concrete when compared to its sars ancestors in a cross-sectional study by chen et al factors including elevated nt-probnp elevated ctni elevated hs-crp which are markers of myocardial injury and inflammation respectively were significantly correlated with severe disease and critical illness they further noted that age male sex elevated serum creatinine hypertension and coronary heart disease are additional factors contributing to severity of disease 31 in one of the initial studies in wuhan huang et al reported increased high sensitive troponin i hs-ctni levels 28 pgml in 5 of 41 covid-19 patients in their study 4 out of 5 patients with elevated hs-ctni required icu admission 32 in a similar single-center case series of 138 patients 36 patients required icu admission and their levels of creatine kinase ck-mb and hs-ctni were significantly higher 33 similarly in a retrospective chinese case series study on 187 patients with confirmed cases of covid-19 nearly 27 demonstrated increased tnt levels consistent with myocardial injury as mentioned previously in comorbid cardiovascular disease and illness course this study demonstrated that in patients with underlying cvd increased tnt levels were associated with higher mortality compared with no cvd however even in patients without underlying cvd elevated troponin was associated with higher mortality furthermore they noted that frequency of arrhythmias was higher in patients with elevated tnt finally they reported that in patients who died from the virus levels of tnt and nt-probnp increased during the course of hospitalization 22 in a similar study in wuhan a total of 82 out of 416 hospitalized patients showed myocardial injury via the same surrogate markers and the mortality rate was higher in this group of patients even after adjustment for age and other comorbidities 34 in another case-series of 419 cases with covid-19 in shenzhen china patients were divided into 36 icu patients and 383 non-icu patients they reported that hs-ctni level was significantly higher in the icu group patients with elevated enzymes or cardiac symptoms underwent echocardiography demonstrating thickened interventricular septum in 11 31 patients with associated enlarged left ventricular diastolic diameter decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and increased pulmonary arterial pressure in 4 11 patients 35 additionally a chinese case series by ruan et al on the current sars-cov-2 analyzed mortality data of 150 patients 5 out of 68 patients that succumbed to the virus had myocardial damage leading to circulatory failure reported as the cause of death further 22 out of the 68 deceased patients showed respiratory failure accompanied by myocardial damage in accordance with the previously mentioned studies cardiac troponin and myoglobin levels in the death group were significantly higher than the discharge group 36 given the clinical data the group suspected that the course of death in some of these patients was due to fulminant myocarditismyocarditis is a specific clinical sequela of myocardial damage and it can be diagnosed histologically or clinically clinical diagnosis can be made for instance via the 2013 european society of cardiologys position statement which requires a clinical presentation such as chest pain for example as well as a diagnostic criterion like elevated tnt or tni 37 it should be noted though that some clinicians may use different criteria for diagnosis and this may affect incidence between studies regardless viral infection has been noted to be one of the most common causes of myocarditis 38 further fulminant myocarditis defines an acute myocarditis episode as opposed to chronic myocarditis where the patient experiences life threatening cardiogenic shock since the ruan et al study multiple clinicians have published case reports on patients diagnosed with myocarditis who are covid-19 positive in two cases the patients presented with only cardiac symptoms and were not initially suspected to have the covid-19 disease for example in the report by incardi et al a 53-year-old woman presented with fatigue and hypotension with diffuse st elevation and elevated troponins so coronary angiography was performed but negative given her symptoms and the current outbreak the team suspected myocarditis and their hypothesis was strengthened when she was found to be covid-19 positive myocarditis was confirmed with cardiac mri showing marked biventricular edema and gadolinium enhancement 39 similarly in a series of four case reports by fried et al one of the patients had no symptoms other than chest pressure but was eventually found to be covid-19 positive and again diagnosed with myocarditis 40more formal studies on the incidence of myocarditis have since been published as well in a multicentered study of 84 patients 13 1548 were noted to have abnormal ecgs and cardiac enzyme levels however only 4 48 were clinically diagnosed with myocarditis the incidence of myocarditis in this study is lower than most other reports most likely due to confirmation of the diagnosis based on the clinical criteria for myocarditis mentioned previously 41 finally in a case series by chen et al they reported increased levels of n-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide and ctni in 275 and 10 of patients respectively interestingly levels of il-6 and other inflammatory cytokines were noted to be elevated especially in patients who experienced a more severe disease course requiring icu admission the group hypothesized that the elevated cytokines were due to cytokine storm which they attributed as the cause of fulminant myocarditis in these patients 7 in our next section we will further discuss mechanisms that may result in myocardial injury secondary to infection with sars-cov-2the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying myocardial injury caused by covid-19 are not well known so far and more studies need to be done to further delineate the mechanisms as discussed previously human sars-cov infection of the myocardium is known to be dependent on ace-2 receptors disruption of ace-2 leads to an age-dependent cardiomyopathy cardiac dysfunction and heart failure 4243 oudit et al hypothesized that the interaction between sars-cov and ace-2 in the heart could contribute to sars-mediated myocardial inflammation and damage they reported that the sars-cov viral rna was detected in autopsied human heart samples suggesting direct myocyte invasion of the virus they further indicated marked down regulation of ace-2 and reductions in ace-2 protein in the heart samples moreover they reported significant myocardial macrophage infiltration of post-mortem heart samples 13 the detrimental effect of ace-2 downregulation would impede cardioprotective effects of angiotensin 17 leading to increased tnf production 4244 tnf is a common inflammatory cytokine and many researchers have shown that the inflammatory response may be at least partially responsible for the myocardial damage for example guo et al reported increased inflammatory marker c-reactive protein along with elevated tnt levels in patients with underlying cvd and poor outcomes supporting the idea of severe inflammatory response as a possible mediator of cardiomyocyte damage 22in addition to tnf zhao et al discovered how sars virus activates tgf- signaling through the smad pathway to induce lung fibrosis this is also a common pathway of interstitial fibrosis development in the myocardium and could potentially be a mode of cardiac damage 45 it has also been proposed that in patients with sars strong interferon-mediated responses could contribute to myocardial dysfunction specifically in regard to interferons making the switch from hyperactive innate immunity to protective adaptive immunity 4647 finally another proposed mechanism is exaggerated cytokine response by type 1 and 2 helper t cells 48collectively due to significant resemblance of sars-cov infection with covid-19 the possible mechanisms of myocardial injury in covid-19 could be direct damage to the cardiomyocytes systemic inflammation myocardial interstitial fibrosis interferon mediated immune response exaggerated cytokine response by type 1 and 2 helper t cells in addition to coronary plaque destabilization and hypoxiasars-cov-2 the cause of the covid-19 disease has emerged as a global health emergency affecting almost every country in the world given the level of global interconnectivity some epidemiologists have forecasted that 4070 of the worlds population will be infected with covid-19 in the coming year 49 if this is true it means 4070 of the population will experience anything from no symptoms at all to mild respiratory symptoms to severe and life-threatening respiratory symptoms for the infected population it appears underlying cardiovascular disease is related to worsening outcomes in patients who have covid-19 in one study the case mortality rate more than tripled for patients with underlying cardiovascular disease 19 this is not necessarily unique to coronavirus as many infections are made worse by underlying cardiac disease however it was also noted that patients with a history of cardiovascular disease were more likely to have elevated levels of cardiac enzymes such as tnt which suggests the possibility that these patients were more susceptible to cardiac injury via sars-2-cov 22 as we are now investigating it also appears that some of this cohort will experience extra-pulmonary manifestations of the virus including cardiovascular complications coronavirus affecting other organ systems is not new to this outbreak as it has been studied with sars-cov subfamily in general as well as mers-cov in the past however the reports of myocardial involvement related to covid-19 so far seem to be increased when compared to previous sars-cov outbreaks the most frequent manifestation cardiac involvement so far appears to be myocarditis of course since clinicians are currently focusing on the most common and most lethal manifestations of sars-cov-2 we may see even more reports of cardiac complications as the pandemic progresses and other manifestations may become more prevalent for now research regarding cardiac manifestations has focused mostly on myocardial damage including myocarditis and in some cases fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock several reports have already investigated the incidence of myocarditis in covid-19 patients and some have reported circulatory failure resulting from myocardial damage secondary to the viral disease as the cause of death 36 interestingly emerging case reports are also showing that patients are presenting without respiratory symptoms and instead with chest pain pressure fatigue etc and later being found to be covid-19 positive with myocarditis the mechanisms leading to cardiac damage are numerous and include direct insult to myocytes by the virus cytokine and interferon inflammatory responses myocardial interstitial fibrotic response t1 and t2 helper cell response 45 46 47 48 what is known about the sars-cov subfamily in general is that they enter cells through ace-2 receptors further research showed that ace-2 receptors are expressed on lung alveolar epithelial cells gastrointestinal epithelial cells and endothelial cells of the arteries and veins the latter expression suggests how the virus can cause direct insult to the heart 1120several key points have been gleaned through this review of myocardial injury as it relates to covid-19 first it appears that this strain of sars-cov has an increased propensity for developing extra-pulmonary complications namely myocardial involvement the reporting of myocardial involvement is likely still very low given the current focus on the more common respiratory symptoms second it shows that while cardiac involvement is often self-limiting some studies have reported myocardial injury as being the cause of death and thus it is important that clinicians have this complication on their radar 36 third some case reports have accounts of patients who presented without respiratory symptoms and were later found to be covid-positive after being diagnosed with myocarditis with the emphasis of respiratory involvement of the covid-19 syndrome it is important to keep a high index of suspicion for the disease in patients presenting atypically to ensure we minimize community and healthcare worker exposure finally our review found that there are many proposed mechanisms of myocardial damage secondary to covid-19 infection but more research is required to delineate whether the virus causes direct myocardial injury inflammatory mediated injury or injury through another mechanismcovid-19 infection has been associated with myocardial injury which has been implicated with more severe disease courses and even death remarkable efforts are being done to elaborate underlying mechanisms of myocardial injury due to the acuteness of this pandemic the scientific world currently lacks randomized controlled trials in order to fully elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic measures however there are a handful of clinical trials on the way to assess possible therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of this disease even while lacking substantial evidence certain conclusions can be drawn from this review namely it appears extrapulmonary manifestations are more likely with this sars outbreak and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for covid-19 infection even in patients without respiratory symptoms as delayed testing will result in increased community and healthcare worker spreadthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorssmoking represents one of the leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide causing a plethora of adverse medical conditions including coronary artery disease stroke chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer and its detrimental effects impact also on passive smokers 1 25 even in the current coronavirus-associated disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic smokers especially the elderly appear to have an increased risk of getting infected progressing toward severely symptomatic disease and dying due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 infection 69abstinence is easy to preach but harder to achieve and several strategies have been proposed to ensure smokers can discontinue and abstain from their habit ranging from telemedicine nicotine replacement therapy varenicline and bupropion 10 most recently novel forms of smoking have been developed which differ from traditional combustion cigarettes tcc as smoking is not due to combustion but vaporization of nicotine-containing liquids ie electronic vaping cigarettes evc or heating of tobacco products without combustion ie heat-not-burn cigarettes hnbc 1112 collectively these alternative ways to smoke are called modified risk products mrp or more optimistically reduced risk products rrp 13 14 1517substantial evidence continues to accrue on mrp including results of randomized controlled trials rct and several systematic reviews have already been published on this topic 18 however the interplay between mrp cardiovascular physiology and cardiovascular disease is still uncertain with conflicting results provided by different scholarly sources 19 we thus aimed at conducting an updated umbrella review of systematic reviews on the cardiovascular effects in terms of both pathophysiology and symptomatic disease of evc and hnbc 20in keeping with prior similar projects led by our group this work was designed as an umbrella review ie overview of systematic reviews following established recommendations for evidence synthesis 202122 specifically we searched pubmed in order to find pertinent systematic reviews on the cardiovascular safety of mpr using the following string vaping or vapes or e-cigarette or ecigarette or electronic and cigarette or iqos or juul and heart or cardiac or coronary or vascular or venous or cardiovascular or artery or arterial or myocardial or thrombosis or atherosclerosis or atherothrombosis and systematicsb restricting our search to studies published until may 5 2020 citations were first screened at the titleabstract level then full texts were sought if potentially pertinent we extracted salient features of included reviews as well as corresponding original studies when appropriate review quality was appraised using the oxman-guyatt index 20from 36 citations we appraised in detail 17 articles eventually including 7 systematic reviews totaling 183 studies and reports tables 1 2 and 3 18 19 2328 29 specifically tzortzi et al overviewed case reports on evc-related injury reported in several databases including the leading us center for disease control 29 from a total of 133 publications no specific cardiac event was reported but chest pain was relatively common in such compiled series of cases 22 hua and talbot screened several databases looking for case reports of adverse events associated with evc use retrieving two cases a case of acute myocardial infarction in a young man and a case of atrial fibrillation in an elderly woman 24 in both cases reported in this hypothesis-generating systematic review nicotine-containing evc had been usedfarsalinos and polosa conducted a systematic review on several different generations of evc focusing on their comparison versus tcc and nicotine gums the impact of nicotine and the risk of active as well as passive smoking 18 in particular they synthesized evidence from 97 different reports including several chemical studies toxicological studies and clinical trials they concluded that despite evident safety issues including the presence of many toxic agents with established multidimensional risk eg acetaldehyde acrolein aluminum amino-tandalafil copper diethylene glycol formaldehyde iron lead nickel particulate matter rimonambant and silica evc represent an appealing alternative to tcc in a rrp strategy in terms of hazards they highlighted the risk of tachycardia and hypertension as well as impaired left anterior descending flow reserve even if it remained unclear whether these effects depended mainly on nicotine interestingly this old review was promising but limited by incomplete reporting and lack of quantitative synthesisgarcia and colleagues performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of evc on blood pressure bp heart rate hr and heart rate variability hrv pooling data from 19 studies and using largely explicit and valid methods 23 they concluded that evc are associated with acute increases in systolic blood pressure sbp diastolic blood pressure dbp and hr and changes in hrv typical of sympathetic prevalence over vagal activity even if mostly explained by nicotine exposure notably chronic use of evc still had adverse effects on hrv but effects on bp and hr were much more diluted potentially suggesting time-dependent adaptationkennedy and colleagues reviewed several experimental and clinical studies on the cardiovascular safety of evc highlighting that they may cause oxidative stress cardiomyocyte dysfunction and mutagenesis vascular inflammation endothelial dysfunction vasospasm complement deposition platelet aggregation adhesion and activation with hypertension tachycardia arterial stiffening atherosclerosis and thrombotic risk albeit less intensely than tcc 25 most importantly they suggested that studies with conflicts of interest were less likely to report adverse eventsskotsimara and colleagues reviewed 26 studies ranging from preclinical to clinical ones and then performed a formal meta-analysis of 14 trials 28 overall they identified the following as main signs of detrimental effects of evc cytotoxicity oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction bp hr arterial stiffness and myocardial infarction notably most of these effects were heterogeneous and quantitatively less intense than those associated with tccfinally riley et al conducted a systematic review originally focused on the interplay between hormonal contraception evc and cardiovascular risk 19 no study explicitly focused on hormonal contraception was retrieved and thus they expanded their analysis to the pathophysiologic link between evc and cardiovascular outcomes after including a total of 13 studies they concluded that evc significantly impact of bp and hr and may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarctionour umbrella review poignantly synthesizing the evidence accrued so far from in vitro in animal in human volunteers healthy subjects and patients on the cardiovascular risk associated with evc use either acute or chronic shows that data are expanding progressively but several conclusions can already be made on the multidimensional hazards of evc fig 1 table 4 30 31 first acute evc use is associated with several toxic effects at molecular eg dna cellular tissue organ and system level 25 32 for instance oxidative stress cytotoxicity and cardiomyocyte dysfunction are established effects of evc 33 second evc impact adversely on bp management cause tachycardia and worsen arterial stiffness 19 34 third evc use has been associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events including atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction even if the causal link is still debated 24 35 yet most reviews highlighted that the detrimental impact of evc was of lesser magnitude of that of tcc in addition the differential impact of liquids and nicotine was not clearly disentangledoverall these findings confirm prior reports and support further research on the topic of cardiovascular safety of evc several avenues for research are worth exploring for instance translational studies on the precise cellular mechanisms involved in evc toxicity are needed exploring for instance microrna inflammatory cascade autophagy apoptosis and regeneration 3638 observational studies on large samples are needed to accurately gauge the short and long-term risks of evc in apparently healthy subjects and in patients with cardiovascular disease 39 in addition randomized trials from small-sample speculative ones to large pragmatic studies are direly needed to ensure that the place of evc in current clinical practice is correctly defined 40 indeed our premise is that evc should be considered as an over-the-counter medical intervention suitable to support chronic smokers in their journey to eventual cessation accordingly only a comprehensive evidence platform hopefully summarized in a formal network meta-analysis will be able to precisely define the place and role if any of evc in a comprehensive approach aiming at smoking cessation and harm minimization 41 pragmatically and based on our personal and professional experience we may suggest a stepwise use of evc and hnbc with the eventual aim of total and continued abstinence fig 2 yet practitioners should be aware of the potential interactions between mrp and pharmacologic therapy in patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease ranging from atherothrombosis to heart failure and valvular heart disease 4246 as indeed it is plausible that many of the adverse cardiovascular effects of  mrp depend on nicotine thus raising the evident risk of cumulative toxicity if nrt and mrp are inadvertently combinedthis umbrella review has several drawbacks on top of those typical of this research design 20 first studies and reviews discussed hereby are mostly of small size and limited follow-up and often focus on apparently healthy subjects second data on long-term pulmonary and cancer risk are absent but this cannot be considered proof of absence of oncologic risk as only longitudinal studies will be able to inform on this safety dimension another elephant in the room is the lack of comprehensive data on hnbc which are a mainstay in the mrp arena and can be considered for some aspects as safe or safer than evc and for others worse eg because of small but measurable combustion 47 accordingly we expect that additional research synthesis efforts will be needed in the future including updated umbrella reviewsthe information accrued in this umbrella review coherently showing multidimensional adverse effects of hnbc and evc highlights the evident risk of adverse cardiovascular events associated with mrp accordingly further restrictions to their usage could be considered including equating them to over-the-counter or even prescription drugs indeed the best perspective is considering hnbc and evc as another management strategy to promote smoking cessation and maintain abstinence fig 2moreover their usage should be monitored minimized in intensity and duration aiming for clear timelines to switch from hnbc to evc and then stop them altogether if a hnbc-first approach is chosen or instead having a goal of evc usage followed by cessation if an evc-first approach is adopted an apparently banal but potentially useful framework could indeed be considering mrp as a novel and more palatable nrt maintaining many of the rituals of tcc without the abundance of combustion byproductsnonetheless dedicated large-scale and pragmatic randomized trials are needed to test the above strategy before recommending it to individuals and patients at largethe present umbrella review suggests that evc despite clearly causing an increase in overall cardiovascular risk may represent a temporary lesser evil than tcc in a risk-reduction or risk-modification strategy aiming for eventual abstinence from all tobacco or nicotine productsthe emergence of novel coronavirus officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has presented an unprecedented challenge for the healthcare community across the world high infectivity ability to get transmitted even during asymptomatic phase and relatively low virulence have resulted in rapid transmission of this virus beyond geographic regions leading to a pandemic the first case of this disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-2019 occurred on december 8 2019 in the hubei province of china 1 since then within a short span of just over 3 months the infection has spread to 177 countriesareaterritories across the world with 266073 confirmed cases and 11184 deaths world health organization statistics as on march 21 2020 2 respiratory involvement presenting as mild flulike illness to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome or fulminant pneumonia is the dominant clinical manifestation of covid-19 however much like any other respiratory tract infection pre-existing cardiovascular disease cvd and cv risk factors enhance vulnerability to covid-19 further covid-19 can worsen underlying cvd and even precipitate de novo cardiac complicationsthis review is aimed at providing overview of various cv manifestations in patients presenting with covid-19 the impact of pre-existing cvd and new onset cardiac complications on clinical outcomes in these patients is also discussed since our understanding on this subject is only evolving at this stage the information contained in the subsequent text is based mainly on the limited early experience with covid-19 and learnings from the previous coronavirus illnesses namely sars and middle-east respiratory syndrome mersthe patients with pre-existing cvd appear to have heightened vulnerability to develop covid-19 and tend to have more severe disease with worse clinical outcomes 1468 various cv risk factors also adversely affect porgnosis of these patients although they do not seem to increase likleihood of developing the infection a meta-analysis of six published studies from china including 1527 patients with covid-19 reported 97 164 and 171 prevalence of diabetes cardio-cerebrovascular disease and hypertension respectively 4 although the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in this cohort was same as in the chinese general population the prevalence of cardio-cerebrovascular disease was considerably higher more importantly the presence of diabetes cardio-cerebrovascular disease and hypertension was associated with a 2-fold 3-fold and 2-fold greater risk of severe disease or requiring intensive care unit icu admission suggesting prognostic impact of these comorbidities a much larger report from the chinese center for disease control and prevention described clinical outcomes in 44672 confirmed cases of covid-19 1 the overall case fatality rate cfr was 23 in the entire cohort but significantly higher 6 73 and 105 respectively in patients with hypertension diabetes and cvdalthough data is lacking the prevalence of various cv comorbidities and their impact on clinical outcomes seem to vary considerably across different geographic locations the cfrs have been lower in china outside hubei province and many other countries but much higher in some european nations 2 a small report including 21 patients from washington united states of america presented a particularly grim scenario 9 comorbidities were common in this cohort with diabetes present in 333 and congestive heart failure in 429 acute cardiac dysfunction occurred in 333 patients and 524 patients died however the overall cfr in the united states seems to be much lower 201 deaths out of 15219 confirmed cases 2 although it is likely to rise as many of the patients are currently hospitalized and have not yet had the definite outcomeacute myocardial injury is the most commonly described cv complication in covid-19 table 1 different reports have used different definitions for acute myocardial injury including rise in cardiac enzymes different biomarkers and cut-offs andor electrocardiographic abnormalities however an elevation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i ctni above 99th percentile upper reference limit is the most commonly used definitiontable 1
the overall incidence of acute cardiac injury has been variable but roughly 812 of the positive cases are known to develop significant elevation of ctni 10 the aforementioned meta-analysis of the chinese studies 4 reported 8 incidence of acute cardiac injury whereas another study including only those patients who had had a definite outcome death or discharge from hospital reported 17 incidence of ctni elevation 5 regardless of the actual incidence acute cardiac injury has been consistently shown to be a strong negative prognostic marker in patients with covid-19 568 the patients admitted to icu or having severefatal illness have several-fold higher likelihood of troponin elevation in contrast the incidence of elevated troponin has been very low only 12 in patients having mild illness not requiring icu admissionany of the mechanisms described above can lead to acute cardiac injury and rise in cardiac troponins in patients with covid-19 the relative role of these different mechanisms has not been described but direct ie non-coronary myocardial injury due to viral myocarditis or the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms these observations are supported by a previous autopsy study in patients who had died due to sars during the toronto sars outbreak 11 in this study the viral ribonucleic acid was detected in 35 of the autopsied human heart samples providing evidence for direct myocardial injury by the virusno study has described the incidence of st-segment elevation myocardial infarction in covid-19 but it appears to be low similarly the incidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction acute left ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock have also not been described only one chinese study reported incidence of heart failure in covid-19 patients 5 heart failure had occurred in 52 of the patients who subsequently died and in 12 of the patients who were discharged from the hospitalboth tachy- and brady-arrhythmias are known to occur in covid-19 a study describing clinical profile and outcomes in 138 chinese patients with covid-19 reported 167 incidence of arrhythmia 8 the incidence was much higher 444 in those requiring icu admission as compared to those not requiring icu admission 89 the type of arrhythmia was not describedcovid-19 has emerged only a few months ago and it is too early to predict long-term outcome of the patients who recover from this illness however some important messages can be gleaned from previous experiences with sars caused by sars-cov which shares considerable similarity with sars-cov-2 it was reported that among patients who had recovered from sars 68 continued to have abnormalities of lipid metabolism at 12-years follow-up cv abnormalities were present in 40 and altered glucose metabolism in 60 12 similar findings have also been reported in patients recovering from other respiratory tract infections 13 considering this careful follow-up of those recovering from the current covid-19 would be important to understand the long-term impact of this illness and also to protect these patients from future cvdthe overall management principles for patients presenting with covid-19 who develop cv complications or who have pre-existing cvd are same as for any other patient without covid-19 however there are a few important points that need consideration-1as caregivers it is our utmost responsibility to protect ourselves from getting infected while managing these patients therefore all heathcare personnel engaged in the care of covid-19 patients must observe necessary precautions at all times all of them should be trained in donning usage and doffing of the personal protective equipment in accordance with the existing practice guidelines2the hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with large volume of covid-19 patients many of whom would need icu care andor acute cardiac care appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis triage isolation and management of covid-19 patients with cv complications should be developed and well-rehearsed rapid triaging and management of these patients is crucial not only to allow efficient utilization of healthcare resources but also to minimize exposure to caregivers there are already reports highlighting delays in delivering acute cardiac care due to extra precautions that need to be observed in view of covid-19 14 efforts should be made to minimize such delays3strong emphasis should be placed on avoiding unwarranted diagnostic tests eg cardiac troponin echocardiography etc in these patients this is required to minimize unwarranted downstream diagnostictherapeutic procedures which would further strain the already stretched healthcare resources and would also subject caregivers to added risk of exposure to the infection the american college of cardiology has released an advisory discouraging random measurement of cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides 15 it urges all the clinicians to reserve these assays for circumstances in which they would actually meaningfully add to the management of the patients with covid-19 the american society of echocardiography has also issued a similar advisory regarding the use of echocardiography in these patients 164the individual hospitals may also have to reconsider risk-benefit ratio of primary percutaneous intervention vs fibrinolysis in patients with covid-19 who present with st-segment elevation myocardial infarction5there has been a concern regarding the safety of ace inhibitors acei and angiotensin receptor blockers arb during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic these agents upregulate expression of ace2 in various tissues including on cardiomyocytes 17 since sars-cov-2 binds to ace2 to gain entry into human cells there is a potentially increased risk of developing covid-19 or developing more severe disease in patients who are already on background treatment with aceiarb however to date no experimental or clinical data have emerged to support these concerns at the same time the risks of discontinuing these therapies are well known therefore several leading professional societies have strongly urged to not discontinue clinically-indicated aceiarb therapy in the event the patient develops covid-19 18196clinicians caring for these patients also need to be fully aware of the potential cv side-effects of various therapies used for treating the viral infection additionally various anti-retroviral drugs have significant interactions with cardiac drugs which need to be considered and appropriate dose modification done more recently chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and azathioprine have been proposed as potential therapeutic options based on preliminary evidence 20 both these drugs are known to prolong qt interval and due caution must be exercised when prescribing these agents their combination is best avoided and even when using chloroquinehydroxychloroquine alone daily electrocardiogram for monitoring qt interval is warranted esp in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and in those receiving another drug with potential to prolong qt interval
although respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of covid-19 the shear burden of the illness implies that a large number of patients with covid-19 would present with pre-existing cvd or develop new-onset cardiac dysfunction during the course of the illness considering this the current understanding about the interplay between cvd and covid-19 is grossly inadequate it is therefore highly desirable that the future studies on covid-19 specifically describe the incidence mechanisms clinical presentation and outcomes of various cv manifestations in these patients the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by the concurrence of these two illnesses also need to be adequately studiedcorona virus disease 2019 covid19 an outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 in wuhan in december 2019 has spread rapidly throughout china and to other regions of the world including europe the united states japan and australia

 however cardiovascular manifestations after covid19 infection has not been reported systemically this study was aimed to explore how covid19 affects cardiovascular system including myocardium conduction systems cardiac function and blood pressure especially in severe and critical cases and to identify potential risk factors predicting the severity of covid19we collected medical records of 54 patients diagnosed as severe and critical cases admitted to hospital from january 27 to february 28 2020 all the patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to the sixth edition guideline issued by chinas national health commission severe cases were classified when meeting any one of the following 1 respiratory distress rr  30timesmin 2 fingertip oxygen saturation  93 under resting state 3 arterial partial pressure of oxygen pao2fraction of inspiration o2 fio2  300 mmhg 1 mmhg  0133 kpa critical cases were classified when meeting any one of the following 1 respiratory failure and an artificial airway required for invasive mechanical ventilation 2 shock 3 combining failure of other organs which requires icu monitoring and treatment clinical laboratory electrocardiogram ecg and echocardiographic data were obtained from electronic medical record system and reviewed by a trained team of cardiologists this study was approved by the institutional ethicsblood pressure and pulse rate were measured at least every 4 hours during hospitalization using automatic blood pressure recording machines hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure 90 mmhg andor diastolic blood pressure 60 mmhg tachycardia was defined as a heart rate 100 beatsminute in at least two consecutive readings bradycardia was defined as a daytime heart rate 50 beatsminutes while awake in at least two consecutive readings the temperature was charted every 4 hours by eardrum thermometers patients were checked for new onset or change of symptoms blood tests were performed regularly cardiac injury was defined if the serum level of specific cardiac biomarkers eg troponin i was above 99 upper reference limit serious cardiac injury was defined if the serum level of troponin i tni was above 3 times upper reference limit

 echocardiography was performed when it was deemed necessary by the physician in charge such as significant hypotension that necessitated inotropic support or when there were suspicious changes of myocardial ischemia on electrocardiogram ecg was performed when clinically indicated such as the occurrence of unexplained or severe tachycardia bradycardia or hypotension or when cardiac arrhythmia was suspectedcontinuous variables were expressed as the means and sds categorical variables were summarized as the counts and percentages in each category for comparison of nonparametric variables pearson 
2 test was used multifactor logistic regression model was used to analyze the related factors of covid19 critical type a p value 05 was considered significantamong 54 patients enrolled in our study 39 722 were diagnosed as severe and 15 278 as critical cases thirtysix 667 patients were males gender differences were similar in severe and critical groups the median age was 576 449703 between 25 and 78 years old patients over 65 years old occupied almost one third while the average age was similar in severe and critical groups nine patients had a history of cardiocerebrovascular diseases including six patients with coronary artery disease four severe and two critical cases one patient with aortic and mitral valve replacement severe case one patient with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation critical case and one patient with persistent atrial fibrillation and acute cerebral infarction critical case none of the cases studied had a previous history of chronic heart failure or chronic lung disease the presenting symptoms of fever occurred in 47 870 patients including 34 630 lowgrade fever 9 166 moderate fever and 4 74 high fever respectively no difference in fever type was observed between severe and critical group the occurrence of diabetes and the level of ddimer white blood cell wbc procalcitonin interleukin6 il6 erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and creactive protein crp in critical cases were significantly higher than severe cases p  01 indicating that patients with diabetes and a higher level of ddimer and inflammation are more susceptible to develop critical conditions cardiac biomarkers were remarkedly higher in critical group p  001 suggesting more serious myocardial injury renal function biomarkers were similar in severe and critical cases while acute kidney injury occurred in about one third of patients in both groups clinical features and laboratory findings were summarized in table 1four patients two severe and two critical complained of chest pain but none of them were found to have tni elevation or ecg change presence of chest pain may be due to pleuritis caused by pneumonia elevation of tni was observed in 23 426 patients notably three patients with highly elevated tni 3 times the upper reference limit indicative of severe myocardial injury were all critical cases the serum levels of tni ckmb and myoglobin were significantly higher in critical group compared to severe group p  01 in addition elevation of tni was consistent with the elevation of inflammatory markers especially procalcitonin and il6 supporting information figure s1 indicating the role of inflammation and cytokine storm in cardiac injury stt changes in ecg were identified in four patients one severe and three critical and three of them were accompanied by increase of tni ntprobnp elevation occurred in 30 556 patients eight patients presented with significantly elevated ntprobnp 3 times the upper reference limit including five critical cases the concentration of ntprobnp were remarkedly higher in critical group compared to severe group p  01 table 2sixteen 296 patients had a history of hypertension in this study no significant difference was found in the percentage of hypertension between severe and critical patients among 16 patients with hypertension 8 were taking calcium channel blockers ccbs 3 were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceis angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs 3 were taking blockers and 5 were taking antihypertensive drugs irregularly none of them were taking diuretics nine patients with a history of hypertension and seven patients without a history of hypertension suffered from high blood pressure at admission all these patients were managed after admission according to 2018 escesh guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension three patients experienced hypotension at admission and all of them were diagnosed as critical cases consequently during treatment hypotension was found in 1 26 severe case and 7 467 critical cases p  01 including 3 ended up with death only one patient suffered from transient hypotension and recovered later these data suggested that critical patients are prone to present with persistent refractory shock in the course of covid19 infection a sign of poor prognosis table 3sinus tachycardia is the most common type of arrythmia and was observed in 23 590 severe patients and all the critical patients p  01 it is noteworthy that the rising of heart rate was not consistent with body temperature and oxygen saturation the heart rate remained on a high level even during the rehabilitative phase no significant difference of premature beat was found between severe and critical group only one severe patient experienced transient ventricular tachycardia during hospitalization while another two critical patients suffered from persistent refractory ventricular tachycardia and unfortunately ended up with death atrioventricular block avb was seen in two critical patients one firstdegree avb and the other mobitz type i seconddegree avb three patients experienced sinus bradycardia including two severe cases with a previous history of bradycardia and one critical case at end stage atrial fibrillation was rare and only one critical patient presented with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation table 3we performed echocardiography in 31 patients including 13 severe and 18 critical patients occurrence of mild pericardial effusion was observed in one severe case and five critical cases p  01 suggesting critical patients are more likely to develop pericardial effusion three critical cases suffered from new onset of heart failure two cases presented with right heart failure accompanied by right heart enlargement and pulmonary hypertension and unfortunately ended up with death one case presented with reversible left heart failure and elevation of tni indicative of possibility of myocarditis but it is a pity that we failed to obtain the histopathology during hospitalization cardiomegaly was not found in any patient without heart failure table 3multifactor logistic regression analysis showed that severe cardiac injury or  24 95ci 18201 p  04 hypotension during treatment or  34 95ci 21171 p  04 and pericardial effusion or  35 95ci 18151 p  05 were independent risk factors predicting the critical status of covid19 infection table 4it is the first time to systemically report cardiovascular manifestations after covid19 infection providing some reference for clinical practice our results suggested that more attention should be paid to old adult male patients and diabetic patients who are more susceptible to develop critical conditions the occurrence of cardiac injury in our study is significantly higher than data in previous studies probably due to different severity of enrolled patients urging us to attach importance to heart protection when choosing optimal treatment strategies especially in managing those severe and critical cases hypotension was an independent risk factor for critical status and poor prognosis therefore blood pressure should be closely monitored during the hospitalization period sinus tachycardia was the most common type of arrythmia in patients with covid19 especially in severe and critical cases ventricular tachycardia and atrioventricular block were less common but they may act as warning signs for disease deterioration close observation of vital signs is advised mild pericardial effusion occurred in about onethird of critical patients without manifestation of heart failure and was another independent risk factor for critical disease status more detailed studies are needed to get a deeper understanding of cardiovascular manifestations of sarscov2 infectionmain limitation of this study was small sample size only 54 confirmed severe and critical covid19 patients from single center were enrolled making it difficult to get a full understanding of the relation between covid19 and cardiovascular system besides the followup data should be collected to get a knowledge of the longterm impact of covid19 on cardiovascular systemthis study has systemically reported the impact of covid19 on cardiovascular system including myocardial injury blood pressure arrythmia and cardiac function in severe and critical cases hypotension during treatment severe myocardial injury and pericardial effusion were the independent risk factors of critical disease status in patients with covid19 monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function of covid19 patients and applying potential interventions especially for those with hypotension during treatment severe myocardial injury or pericardial effusion is of vital importancecoronavirus disease

a growing body of evidence suggests the notable impact of comorbidities of chronic diseases on the clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 infection according to coronavirus reports from the centers for disease control and prevention of the us department of health  human services patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome may have up to 10 times greater risk of death when infected with covid-19 5 in 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients from 575 hospitals 399 251 reported having at least one comorbidity 6 the most prevalent comorbidity of covid-19 was hypertension 169 followed by diabetes 82 this report has drawn considerable attention to on covid-19 coexisting disorders patients the presence of coexisting illness was found to be more common among severe patients 7 covid-19 patients have underlying risk factors associated with mortality including male gender advanced age and the presence of comorbidities including hypertension diabetes mellitus cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular diseases 8 the major comorbidities in fatality cases include hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease cerebral infarction and chronic bronchitis 9 it is notable that diabetes has been demonstrated as a potential risk factor in close association with mortality 10covid-19 places a huge burden on healthcare facilities especially regarding patients with comorbidities the intensive care was required for approximately 20 of polymorbid covid-19-infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a case fatality rate cfr greater than 13 11 special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children healthcare providers and elderly people 12 given the higher mortality and higher proportion of critically ill adult covid-19 patients with diabetes good in-patient glycemic control is particularly important in the comprehensive treatment of covid-19 individualized blood glucose target goals and treatment strategies should be made according to the specific circumstances of covid-19 patients with diabetes 13 14in our recent meta-analysis which included 1936 covid-19 patients in nine studies covid-19 was significantly correlated with several metabolic diseases indicating that hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease may exert a profound effect on the progression of covid-19 15 the adverse effects of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders on the immune system make patients more vulnerable to various infections however more evidence for the worsening of covid-19 patients with diabetes compared with non-diabetes is required for these conclusions to be consolidatedto elucidate the risk and severity of comorbidity in diabetes patients infected with covid-19 a retrospective study was carried out to investigate the clinical features radiographic and laboratory tests complications treatments and clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients with or without diabeteswe included 208 hospitalized patients  45 years old with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 from the hubei provincial hospital of integrated traditional chinese and western medicine between 12 january 2020 and 25 march 2020 covid-19 was diagnosed on the basis of the world health organization whos interim guidance a confirmed case of covid-19 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens a total of 96 diabetic and 112 non-diabetic patients were randomly selectedinformation on recent exposure history clinical symptoms or signs and laboratory findings on admission was extracted from electronic medical records we determined the presence of radiologic abnormality on the basis of the documentation or description in medical charts a major disagreement between two reviewers was resolved by consultation with a third reviewer laboratory assessments consisted of the following a complete blood count blood glucose and lipids coagulation testing assessment of liver and renal function measures of electrolytes c-reactive protein procalcitonin pct lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase blood gas analysis and detection of inflammation markerswe divided the cases into two groups a group for patients with covid-19 and type 2 diabetes based on the guidelines for the prevention and control of type 2 diabetes in china 2017 edition
16 and a group for covid-19 patients without diabetes all medical data were processed by a team of experienced clinicians who reviewed and abstracted the data data were entered into a computerized database and checked if core data were missing requests for clarification were sent to the coordinators who subsequently contacted the attending clinicianslaboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 was performed at the hubei provincial hospital of integrated chinese and western medicine rt-pcr assays were performed in accordance with the protocol established by the whocategorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages and continuous variables were described using mean median and interquartile range iqr values the means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t-tests when the data were normally distributed otherwise the mann-whitney u test was used proportions for categorical variables were compared using the 
2 test although the fisher exact test was used when the data were limited all statistical analyses were performed using statistical package for the social sciences spss version 130 software spss inc for unadjusted comparisons a two-sided p value of less than 005 was considered to be statistically significant the analyses have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and given the potential for type i error the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptiveas shown in table 1 96 462 patients with type 2 diabetes and 112 538 patients without diabetes were enrolled the median age of the patients was 64 years iqr 5569 a total of 514 was female fever body temperature  375 c was present in 91 of the patients on admission but developed in 519 during hospitalization the most common symptoms were cough 591 fatigue 524 shortness of breath 346 sputum 284 myalgia or arthralgia 159 and diarrhea 72 among the overall population 663 had at least one coexisting glucose-lipid metabolism disorder such as diabetes hypertension coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular diseaseon admission and during hospitalization the body temperature of the diabetic patients was lower than that of the non-diabetic patients 367 c iqr 364370 vs 369 c iqr 365370 p  0038 370 c iqr 368380 vs 380 c iqr 374386 p  0001 17 this profile may be attributed to the impaired immune response in diabetic patients furthermore fatigue 448 vs 589 p  0042 and chills 146 vs 18 p  0001 were the symptoms that differed most among diabetic and non-diabetic patients since the diabetic patients had been prone to fatigue for a long time due to energy metabolism disorders after infection with sars-cov-2 they may have become less sensitive to the symptoms of fatigue diabetes promotes a detrimental pro-inflammatory state 18 and may cause chill symptoms to be more pronouncedthe present study showed significant differences in comorbidities for diabetic covid-19 patients versus non-diabetic patients including hypertension 583 vs 313 p  0001 coronary heart disease 177 vs 80 p  0035 and chronic renal disease 63 vs 0 p  0007 it has been well established that hypertension coronary heart disease and chronic renal disease coexist with diabetes leading to a higher risk of morbidity and mortality for covid-19 in diabetic patients and patients with related glucose and lipid dysfunctions the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor overexpresses in multiple organs such as the lung kidney and liver which facilitates the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 bound to the cell receptor ace2 19 several lines of evidence suggest that diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of covid-19 17 20 our study enhanced this hypothesis nonetheless the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease hepatitis b infection cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd history was comparable between the two groupsthe radiologic data on admission is shown in table 2
 in the 201 ct scans that were performed at the time of admission 904 showed abnormal results no ct abnormality was found in seven of the 111 patients 63 without diabetes and in six of the 90 patients 67 with diabetes the most common patterns in the chest cts were ground-glass opacity 856 vs 649 p  0001 and bilateral patchy shadowing 767 vs 378 p  0001 among diabetic patients in comparison with non-diabetic patients which is consistent with other recent reports 2 that suggest more severe lung injury in diabetic covid-19 patients

diabetic patients and 35 non-diabetic patients were given glucocorticoids accounting for 350 of all non-diabetic patients p  0121 according to a retrospective study the patients with ards from covid-19 showed lower mortality among those receiving glucocorticoids 22 covid-19 patients can benefit from glucocorticoids treatment to reduce autoimmunity and cytokine toxicity 23in this retrospective study blood glucose was not monitored in every covid-19 patient after treatment with glucocorticoids due to outbreak isolation management therefore we could not analyze the impact of glucocorticoids on the glucose level of covid-19 patients with and without diabetes due to insufficient clinical data this is a limitation of the study although glucocorticoids unavoidably affect the blood glucose level there is no evidence that the administration of glucocorticoids worsens covid-19 in the future the influence of glucocorticoids on covid-19 patients with diabetes will be further investigatedthis retrospective study provides the first direct evidence supporting the high frequency of the coexistence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension coronary heart disease and chronic renal disease in patients with covid-19 this new finding strongly supports our proposed novel concept of glucolipid metabolic disease glmd and an integrated strategy for the treatment of the whole spectrum of metabolic diseases underlying sars-cov-2 infection 24 it has been recognized that disorders in the metabolism of glucose and lipids act as the initial trigger and as a potent driving force in the development and progress of various metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus dyslipidemia nonalcoholic fatty liver disease hypertension atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications as the metabolism of lipids and glucose is a highly coordinated process under both physiological and diseased conditions impairment in the signals corresponding to the metabolism of either lipids or glucose is not only a common mechanism but also the key mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of glmd 25another novel finding in the present study is the potentiated severity in covid-19 patients with metabolic comorbidities although several previous studies have reported on diabetes as one of the most common comorbidities in patients with sars-cov-2 infection 7 26 27 the pathophysiological consequence of the close association between diabetes and covid-19 progression still remains elusive our analysis highlights the markedly promoted morbidity in diabetes patients with covid-19 infection the frequency and degree of abnormalities in radiologic examinations of diabetic covid-19 patients were notably higher than those in the control group without diabetes in addition disruption in the homeostatic control of glucose metabolism and blood pressure was more severe in diabetic covid-19 patients diabetes and its related metabolic disorders have consistently been documented as one of the key risk factors for severe outcomes in patients infected with other types of coronavirus such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 28 29 and sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov 30 thus our data in the present study demonstrate that diabetes and its associated metabolic complications are a crucial contributor to enhanced morbidity and mortality in covid-19 patientsthe conceptional construction of glmd has great relevance to the clinical management of covid-19 on the one hand our data suggest that maintenance of the homeostasis in glucose and lipid metabolism via optimal clinical management in covid-19 patients is mandatory furthermore evidence from infection with another member of the coronavirus familynamely sars-covhas demonstrated that the binding of sars-cov to its receptor ace2 in the pancreas results in islet damage and a notable decrease in the release of insulin thereby causing short-term hyperglycemia and even the onset of diabetes 31 furthermore sars-cov-evoked diabetes-like traits markedly potentiate the progression to multiple-organ failure via a positive feedback loop therefore tight control of the parameter set of glucose and lipid metabolism may be the key to optimal clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients without a history of diabetes andor other metabolic diseases on the other hand diabetes has attained epidemic proportions worldwide according to estimated data from the international diabetes federation 415 million people have diabetes mellitus with 90 of these individuals having type 2 diabetes mellitus 32 hence powerful and integrated approaches should be launched for the comprehensive prevention of glmd which is of significant importance for marked reduction in the morbidity and mortality caused by covid-19 and other emerging infectious diseasesthe present study may possess limitations first this retrospective study was conducted on historical cohorts with all recorded events having already occurred thus information on relevant risk factors with potentially profound influence on the progression of covid-19 may not be included in the database and subsequent analysis therefore the measurement of the impact of diabetes and its complications on the clinical outcomes would not have been as accurate as in a prospective study second the sample size is relatively small therefore the findings observed in the present study warrant further validation through future study with a large sampling sizein conclusion diabetes and other coexisting metabolic disorders within the spectrum of glmd significantly boost the morbidity in covid-19 patients therefore these findings deliver at least two important messages for the clinical management of covid-19 first optimal management of the metabolic hemostasis of glucose and lipids is key in ensuring better clinical outcomes second increased clinical vigilance is warranted for covid-19 patients with glmd in the form of fundamental and chronic conditionsthe first cases of covid-19 were reported in december 2019 originating in wuhan china1 and with its rapid spread covid-19 has now become a pandemic affecting 972303 people across more than 170 countries around the world2with the increasing number of confirmed cases and the accumulating clinical data in addition to the common clinical presentation of respiratory failure caused by covid-19 the cardiovascular manifestations induced by this viral infection has generated considerable concern huang et al reported that 12 of patients with covid-19 were diagnosed as having acute myocardial injury showed by elevated levels of high-sensitive troponin i 3 from other recent data among 138 hospitalized patients with covid-19 167 had arrhythmias and 72 had acute myocardial injury4 these reports provides evidences of cardiac involvement as a possible late phenomenon of the viral respiratory infection this process can be subclinical with few interstitial inflammatory cells as reported by an autopsy study5 or can present with overt manifestations even without respiratory symptoms 6
not only has its number increased cardiovascular manifestations were also associated with increased mortality among covid-19 patients tao guo et al conducted a study on 187 patients with covid-19 a total of 52 278 exhibited myocardial injury as demonstrated by elevation of tnt levels and mortality was markedly higher in patients with elevated troponin t tntlevels than in patients with normal tnt levels 596 vs 89 patients with underlying cardiovascular disease cvd and escalation of tnt levels had the highest mortality 6944 and the shortest survival term7 all of these data suggest that we must also put concern on cardiovascular manifestations in patients with covid-19 infections therefore here we review the cardiovascular system involvement in the course of covid-19 infectioncurrent data from china and italy as well in the us show that covid-19 can present in relatively mild symptoms in affected individuals however some patients can suffer from very severe or even deadly conditions which require intensive care patients with more severe illness also at greater risk of mortality particularly older individuals with underlying comorbidities including cardiovascular disease8 9
table 1
shows various risk factors from several studies that increases the likelihood of patients developing cardiovascular involvement of covid-19 both with or without prior cardiovascular disease historyalthough the exact pathophysiological mechanism underlying myocardial injury caused by covid-19 is not fully understood a previous report showed that in 35 of the patients infected the sars-cov genome was positively detected in the heart13 as shown in figure 1
 sars-cov binds to cells expressing appropriate viral receptors particularly ace2 which is abundant in the heart14 murine models and human autopsy samples demonstrate that sars-cov can down-regulate myocardial and pulmonary ace2 pathways thereby mediating myocardial inflammation lung edema and acute respiratory failure8 this raises the possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus sars-cov-2 may share the same mechanism with sars-cov because the 2 viruses are highly homologous in genome1 15 some recent studies from china address the unique marked affinity of sars-cov-2 for the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor raising the possibility of direct viral infection of vascular endothelium and myocardium12 16 furthermore two experimental studies proved that sars-cov-2 uses ace2 which is also expressed in the heart as their receptor for entry into the cell17 18 all of this data further suggested that sars-cov-2 can have a direct invasion mechanism to the heartanother possible mechanism by which sars-cov-2 can cause injury to myocardial cells is by inflammation in the study done by tao guo et al plasma tnt levels were significantly positively linear correlated with plasma high-sensitivity c-reactive protein levels indicating that myocardial injury may be closely associated with inflammatory pathogenesis7 huang et al also highlighted that in patients with covid-19 the imbalance of t helper 1 and t helper 2 responses resulted in a cytokine storm which leads to myocardial injury the release of inflammatory cytokines after infection may cause reduction in coronary blood flow decreases in oxygen supply destabilization of coronary plaque and micro thrombogenesis3 chronic cardiovascular disease also may become unstable as a consequence of imbalance between infection-induce increased metabolic demand and reduced cardiac reserve acute coronary events in patients with covid-19 may result from the significant increase in myocardial demand triggered by infections that precipitate myocardial injury or infarct similar to type 2 myocardial infarction11
patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure may be at particular risk as a result of coronary plaque rupture secondary to virally induced systemic inflammation therefore rigorous use of plaque stabilizing agents aspirin and statins has been suggested as a possible therapeutic strategy20 coagulation abnormalities and arrhythmias are also seen in patients but the mechanism has yet to be known table 2
shows the potential mechanism of each cardiovascular manifestation in covid-19 patientswith severe respiratory infection and hypoxia in the setting of severe respiratory infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards caused by covid-19 it is very likely that patients will develop myocardial injury22 myocardial injury associated with the sars-cov-2 occurred in 5 of the first 41 patients diagnosed with covid-19 in wuhan which mainly manifested as an increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i hs- ctni levels 28 pgml3 such finding is associated with more severe disease and worse prognosis24 in another report of 138 patients with covid-19 in wuhan 36 patients require intensive care the levels of biomarkers of myocardial injury were significantly higher in patients treated in the icu than in those not treated in the icu median creatine kinase ck-mb level 18 ul versus 14 ul p  0001 hs- ctni level 110 pgml versus 51 pgml p  0004 suggesting that patients with severe symptoms often have complications involving acute myocardial injury4 another study of critically-ill covid-19 patients demonstrated that 33 n7 of patients developed cardiomyopathy23
another common cardiovascular manifestation found in covid-19 patients are cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest one of the presenting symptoms in 73 of patients admitted for covid-19 is a non-specific heart palpitations according to a cohort of 137 patients24 these symptoms are more common in icu patients compared to the non icu patients 444 vs 69 although specific types of arrhythmia are not described4 prevalence of arrhythmia might be attributable to metabolic abnormalities hypoxia neurohormonal or inflammatory stress in the settings of viral infection whether the patient has preexisting cardiovascular disease or not underlying myocarditis should highly be suspected in patients with new onset malignant tachyarrhythmia in the setting of elevated troponin levels25
a report by zhou and colleagues shows that 23 of covid-19 patients have heart failures which are notably more common in patients who did not survive hospitalization compared to those who did survive 519 vs 117 21 when a patient contracts an ards right heart failure often coexists 26 ards usually manifests as ground-glass opacities on chest imaging 27 such feature is similar to the case of de novo or coexisting pulmonary edema it is therefore very important to watch out for cardiogenic or mixed cardiac and primary pulmonary causes of respiratory manifestations in covid-19 see table 3
although there are no published case series so far there are reports of abnormal coagulation studies in patients with covid-19 which likely increased risk of venous thromboembolism vte28 a multicenter retrospective cohort in china shows that elevated d-dimer levels 1gl in covid-19 patients were strongly associated with in-hospital death or 184 95 ci 26-1286 p000321 other study comparing survivors to non-survivors d-dimer and fibrin degradation products fdp levels also shows that 714 non-survivors met clinical criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation dic27 risk of vte and dic also increases with prolonged immobilization in critically ill patients thromboembolic disease should be considered in critically ill covid-19 patients with clinical deterioration as evidence of hypoxia or hemodynamic instability6
it is reasonable to triage patients with covid-19 according to the presence of underlying cvd and evidence of myocardial injury this measure is to provide prioritized treatment and more aggressive treatment strategies compared to those without such conditions other cardiac biomarkers such as nt-probnp and electrocardiograms should be closely monitored for early warning and interventionmany drugs used to treat covid-19 patients may cause and exacerbate cardiac insufficiency arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disorders29 hydroxychloroquine sulfate a less toxic derivative of chloroquine30 is currently one of the recommended drugs to treat covid-19 patients covid-19 regimens with hydroxychloroquine are usually combined with additional antiviral drugs such as ritonavir and lopinavir these drugs are potent cyp3a4 inhibiting drugs and their combination is associated with qt-prolongation thus resulting in disturbance of cardiac rhythm epinephrine and other similar drugs have been proved in unmasking ventricular arrhythmias31 patients with familial arrhythmias such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia cpvt when given such drugs may result exacerbation of symptoms given that in most cases covid-19 around 899 in a study by wang et al patients receive antivirals this the possibility of these side effect must be taken into consideration close monitoring using ecg is to be done in patients treated with these drugswith the likelihood of critically ill covid-19 patients to develop thromboembolic disease thrombo phylactic utilization is recommended it is still unknown which drug is optimal for this purpose while there is drug-drug interaction between some antiviral therapy and direct oral anticoagulant low molecular heparins or unfractionated heparin with or without mechanical prophylaxis are suggested and preferred in acutely ill patients32
in this pandemic settings the trend of reperfusion therapy intended for stemi patients has shifted fibrinolytic therapy is more preferred than percutaneous coronary intervention pci whenever the facilities and the infrastructure are compatible to deliver the procedure each institution should also develop protocols for appropriate triage isolation and treatment of covid-19 patients who may need such interventions33 harm associated with pursuing reperfusion therapy may exceed the anticipated gain in some covid-19 patients particularly if the primary competing illness portends a poor outcomeunderlying medical comorbidities appear to significantly impact covid-19 severity and mortality summary of a report of 72 314 cases from the chinese center for disease control and prevention found that overall case-fatality rate cfr was 23 1023 deaths among 44 672 confirmed cases patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and hypertension have been reported to have significantly high-case fatality rates cfr compared with patients without these underlying comorbidities 105 and 6 percent mortality respectively compared with 09 percent mortality without underlying comorbidities34 35
significant adverse impact towards cardiac involvement has been posed by this illness but data available currently regarding the interplay between cvd and covid-19 are grossly inadequateso far literatures studying the pathophysiological mechanisms of how sars-cov2 can affect the cardiac are still very limited researchers mostly used sars as a comparison model for it is very similar to sars-cov-2 it is essential to understand this topic for such knowledge will give us better insight of the virus another interesting field for further research is the treatment of this disease up until now most regiments currently used to combat covid-19 and other similar diseases such as sars mainly aim to provide supportive care however a new drug which may specifically inhibit viral growth is being developed the drug is recombinant angiotensin converting enzymes ace2 which works mostly as a decoy towards the virus s receptors while the research has so far been limited to cell cultures and organoids this new drug seems to be promising a drug as such if successfully developed will hypothetically decrease the mortality morbidity and even prevent the cardiovascular manifestations of covid-19acknowledging the lack of data we have it is therefore highly desirable that the mechanisms the clinical presentation the outcomes of various cv manifestations and the proper treatment in these patients be studied furtherfinally it is concluded that sars-cov-2 has a devastating impact on the cardiovascular system thus these patients require clinicians meticulous attention towards the cardiovascular system and comprehensive treatment
10our patient was a 13monthold male baby at the time of transplant he was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and underwent staged palliation with a norwood procedure with sano modification followed by a bidirectional glenn procedure at 5 months of age his norwood procedure was complicated by bilateral vocal cord paresis requiring tracheostomy he remained hospitalized until his glenn procedure and was discharged on a home ventilator from which he was subsequently weaned he developed clinical heart failure from moderatetosevere tricuspid insufficiency with associated ventricular dysfunction several months after his glenn procedure that resulted in the initiation of an aggressive medical regimen including spironolactone furosemide enalapril and carvedilol with doses being optimized for weight gain over the following months he required several hospitalizations for viral infections each leading to worsening of congestion but never requiring inotropic support he was fully immunized including having received 2 doses of the inactivated influenza vaccine at 10 and 12 months of age in accordance with current national guidelines he additionally received monthly injections of palivizumab one month prior to transplant he developed severe congestion with poor perfusion anuria and reduced responsiveness this resulted in admission to the critical care unit where a milrinone infusion was started along with reinstitution of positive pressure ventilation via his tracheostomy due to this episode of decompensation without an obvious precipitating event he was evaluated for transplant and listed status 1a his blood type was o with elevated antia and antib isohemagglutinin titers so he was listed for abo compatible transplant he remained hospitalized through transplant for resistant congestion despite his milrinone infusion and enteral heart failure regimen after one month on the waitlist a heart became available our patient developed fever on the day of the organ offer with the only additional symptom being nasal congestion a respiratory viral panel obtained with the fever was reported the next day to be positive for coronavirus and rhinoenterovirusthe organ match run initially included our patient at sequence 5 four prior institutions declined the organ for organ quality using code 830 the donor had presented after a respiratory arrest following a short illness with a cough as part of the evaluation for the respiratory arrest the donors nasopharyngeal secretions exhibited influenza a positivity by polymerase chain reaction testing chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse pulmonary interstitial markings consistent with pneumonitis or edema and a bronchoscopy demonstrated purulent secretions with mixed gramnegative and grampositive organisms but no pathologic organisms were found cardiac structure and function were normal by echo the donor progressed to brain death over the next 36 hours during which time 3 doses of oseltamivir were administered when our center accepted the organ a dose of oseltamivir was administered to our recipient and twicedaily dosing was continued for 10 days posttransplant graft function was excellent immediately after transplant and an endomyocardial biopsy on posttransplant day 14 revealed no rejection respiratory viral panels on our recipient were positive for coronavirus and rhinoenterovirus but negative for influenza on posttransplant days 5 and 10 and negative for all viruses on posttransplant day 15 he never developed symptoms of a respiratory infection and was discharged from the hospital on posttransplant day 15 his immunosuppression was not modified in response to his potential donor influenza exposure including 1 day of solumedrol 10 mgkg 5 days of 15 mgkgdose thymoglobulin and solumedrol 3 mgkgd 60 mgkgdose mycophenylate twice daily and tacrolimus twice daily starting on posttransplant day 5 with a target range of 1012 additional immunosuppression consisted of 2 gkg of intravenous immunoglobulin for a positive t and bcell crossmatch on postoperative day 1the perception remains that the nearly 20 pediatric heart transplant waitlist mortality is largely due to donor organ shortage despite the fact that nearly 50 of available organs are declined and not placed1 2 expansion of what is considered an acceptable organ is likely to be the most efficient way to address this problem3 a significant number of donor hearts declined by pediatric transplant centers due to donor quality issues are subsequently transplanted at other centers with outcomes comparable to organs not previously declined for donor quality suggesting our ability to identify quality donor organs should be refined4 furthermore over 15 of waitlisted patients that decline an organ offer that is subsequently placed do not receive another organ offer before expiring or being removed from the waitlist for deterioration4 this led davies et al to conclude that some in the pediatric heart transplant community may be waiting for the perfect organ rather than taking one that is good enough and that this negatively impacts waitlist outcomesdonor infectious disease impacts organ acceptance practices for donation due to concern for transmission to an immunocompromised host at the time of transplant this reluctance does not extend to either cytomegalovirus or epsteinbarr virus status as these are both common and at least for cytomegalovirus there is effective medical therapy organ donation from hepatitis cpositive donors to hepatitis cnegative recipients is increasingly utilized in adult transplantation due to the recent development of highly effective antiviral agents which can then be used to treat the recipient5 given the expanded repertoire of antiinfectious agents against viruses and other microorganisms infections previously thought to render a donor heart unacceptable for transplantation are being reconsideredinfluenza is one such disease influenza caused over 100 childhood deaths in the united states yearly in the period 20102015 all potential organ donors6 although severe infection in a kidney recipient from an influenzapositive donor has been reported such reports are rare7 a recent survey of the american society of transplantation infectious disease community of practice demonstrated that more than 90 of practitioners would recommend accepting nonlung organs from influenzapositive donors8 multiple adult centers have reported positive outcomes with transplants from influenzapositive donors but uncertainty remains regarding the duration of donor and recipient antiviral therapy necessary to prevent disease transmission9
we recently published the first case report of a pediatric patient receiving a heart transplant from a donor with symptomatic influenza b disease the donor had received a full course of oseltamivir and was documented to have tested negative for influenza b before organ harvest10 our recipient received a 10day course of oseltamivir therapy and disease transmission did not occur the present case documents that the use of oseltamivir in donor and recipient even without a complete course in the donor may be adequate to mitigate the risk of influenza a transmission there has been uncertainty in cases in which donors are positive for influenza as to need for and duration of therapy of both the donor and recipient9 in 2010 the american society for transplantation the transplantation society and canadian society of transplantation endorsed recommendations that influenzapositive donors be considered for nonlymphoid solid organ transplant and while acknowledging inadequate supporting data suggested a full course of antiviral therapy be used prior to organ procurement whenever possible11 it is also of note that the center for disease control maintains updated information in regard to specific antiviral resistances reported which may play a role in antiviral therapy choice12 however in 2009 one united kingdom group reported success with 13 solid organ transplants from h1n1positive donors of which three had not completed therapy and only seven of the recipients received any antiviral therapy they reported no cases of influenza a viral transmission and our experience also supports this approach in pediatric heart transplant13 this suggests that an inability to completely treat a donor with a full oseltamivir course may not be a contraindication to transplant and using organs of incompletely treated hosts may expand the pool of donor organsall authors have participated sufficiently in this work to be listed as such no unlisted persons were involved directly with the writing of this manuscript and the manuscript is not being submitted to or published by any other publicationseveral types of drugs are available to treat coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 patients but no specific clinical trial confirmed their safety and efficacy 1 therefore the patients spontaneous immune response is still essential for healing consequently elderly patients frequently affected by many comorbidities may incur in the worst outcome to 27 may 2020 there have been more than 559 million confirmed cases of covid-19 and 350531 deaths all around the world while recovered patients have been more than 228 million 2 in italy up to 25 may 2020 the median age of the 230414 confirmed cases of covid-19 is 62 years 3 the case fatality rate of older patients in the ranges of 60-69 70-79 and 80-89 years is 105 258 and 319 respectively 3 while the median age of death is 81 years 4even if there is no real evidence about the drugs used to prevent and cure the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 5 several pharmacological agents are employed off-label as supportive treatment for patients among these antivirals eg remdesivir immunomodulators eg tocilizumab antibiotics eg azithromycin together with respiratory assistance if needed 6 the generally accepted approach against covid-19 infections can be distinguish in two steps 1 contrast the spread using social distancing and community containment and 2 pharmacological treatment of patients discerning mild and severe infections all this while waiting to discover the vaccineever since the pandemic started pulmonary impairment has been held to account for the high morbidity and mortality 7 8 this is in accordance with the coronavirus dissemination through respiratory system including mouth and nose mucosae 9 these tissues are rich in angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is the main binding site for the entry of the virus into host cells 10 about this it should be underlined that ectoenzyme ace2 is expressed also in several other human organs such as small intestine jejunum and kidneys and in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems 11 among these tissues ace2 is highly expressed in human vascular and cardiac pericytes suggesting the vulnerability of cardiovascular system to sars-cov-2 infection 12 13 14 15 this observation may explain the multi-organ damage arising from covid-19 infections which has been reported by frontline doctors during the treatment of this disease 16 several cases of cardiac complications are reported in these patients 17 18 19 an exemplificative case report concerns an healthy 53-years-old patient who developed an acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction a week after the onset of fever and dry cough due to covid-19 infection 20several risk factors are associated with a worse outcome for covid-19 patients the most recognized are demographic characteristics such as older age and male gender and pre-existing cardiovascular conditions 16 21 22 23 24 about the latter hypertension and coronary heart disease are among the most common comorbidities recorded in infected patients together with type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm 17 18 24 data from istituto superiore di sanit iss italy show that more than 683 of patients had hypertension 282 ischemic heart disease 225 atrial fibrillation while 301 t2dm 4 furthermore authors demonstrated that cardiac injury is independently related to increased mortality in covid-19 patients 17 unfortunately the cardiac injury mechanisms in these patients are still not well understoodseveral authors suggested that cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus are linked to endothelial dysfunction 25 26 27 28 and all of them are strictly related to aging figure 1
 in general the vasoconstriction induced by vascular modulators is increased in elderly while agonist-mediated endothelial vasodilation is attenuated 29 30 31 furthermore a reduced chronic adaptive capacity of older heart and vessels has been reported in animal models and in humans 31 it can be speculated that the cause-effect relation between covid-19 and cardiovascular impairment is bidirectional on the one hand patients with cardiovascular diseases and persistent endothelial dysfunction can be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection having an higher ace2 exposure in vascular and heart pericytes as recently suggested 12 on the other hand the infection itself can cause endothelial damage through heavy inflammatory changes figure 1 besides authors showed that patients with pneumonia have various alterations of vascular responses to endothelin 1 adrenomedullin nitric oxide no etc 32 in addition they observed that the vascular changes are age-related evidencing a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance during acute phase of pneumonia in younger patients but an increased resistance in elderly patients 32overall for the multi-organ damage arising from the covid-19 infections a common basis could be the status of endothelial dysfunction in each patient in support of this idea several clinical evidences have been reported 15 the endothelial dysfunction highlighted by post-mortem examinations is also supported by data reporting an evident increase of thromboembolic complications in covid-19 patients and suggesting to treat them with low-molecular-weight heparin lwmh 33 34 it is well-known that endothelial cell injury can strongly activate the coagulation system via exposure of tissue factor and other pathways therefore covid-19 infection aggravating the endothelial dysfunction of patients generates a detrimental hypercoagulable state 35in general the main causes of endothelial dysfunction are 1 aging 2 sex hormones and their decline during aging 3 ros 4 increased circulating endothelial microparticles and progenitor cells empspcs ratio and 5 a pro-inflammatory status 36 37considering the impact of the gender on the covid-19 epidemic even if confirmed cases from each nation are changing every day epidemiological data clearly evidence that in men the infection causes worse outcomes compared to women 21 22 23 24 in italy up to 21 may in the age range of 60-89 years male deaths were 639 of total cases 4 the reason behind this difference between genders appears not clear however the diversity in sex-hormones and styles of life are believed to play a role in the patients susceptibility to severe sars-cov-2 outcomes it is known that the activation of endothelial estrogen receptors increases no and decreases ros protecting the vascular system from angiotensin ii-mediated vasoconstriction inflammation and ros production 38 39 interestingly hudson and co-workers have suggested that women with congestive heart failure respond more favourably to angiotensin receptor blockers arbs than men who had a more effective survival with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei 40 in the china status ii study women showed a greater antihypertensive response to treatment with the arb valsartan combined with amlodipine compared to men on the same treatment 41 recently it has been suggested that arbs could be preferred over ace inhibitors in covid-19 patients since the former preserve the function of ace2 enzyme which counterbalance renin angiotensin system activation 42 however this topic still remains controversial 43 overall estrogens improve endothelial function through several mechanisms 1 reduction of oxidative stress 2 modulation of the renin-angiotensin system and 3 attenuation of the cellular endothelin-1 system 44could not we use protective agents to preserve cardiac and vascular functions during covid-19 treatmentsduring the pandemic joining forces is vital thus as people help doctors by limiting their displacements out of their houses avoiding hence the spread of the infection doctors help patients to overcome severe sars-cov-2 infections by using multiple pharmacological approaches in this context the preservation of endothelial function and the mitigation of vascular inflammation are prominent targets essential to reduce severe outcomes also in male older patientsdiabetes and novel coronavirus infection implications for treatment video mp4 1633936 kbcoronaviruses have been implicated as a cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections since the isolation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 in guangdong china in 2002 1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in saudi arabia in 2012 2 coronaviruses are enveloped positive single-stranded rna viruses which originated in bats indeed both sars-cov-1 and mers-cov were transmitted initially to humans from market civets and dromedary camels respectively 3 in humans sars-cov-1 infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor and mers-cov utilises the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp-4 receptor to infect both unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes 3more recently a novel coronavirus subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was isolated in wuhan china in december 2019 which causes the disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 4 subsequently a worldwide pandemic has resulted with over 55 million people infected and almost 350000 deaths in 188 countries at the time of writing 5 notably sars-cov-2 also appears to infect ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes predominantly via the ace2 receptor and is structurally similar to the sars-cov-1 6 akin to previous coronavirus outbreaks sars-cov-2 likely originated from the bat and the outbreak was initiated from animal-to-human transmission in markets in which wild animals were sold 4 7whilst the prevalence of diabetes in people infected with sars-cov-2 is relatively low compared to the population prevalence of diabetes in chinese and italian cohorts 8 9 people with diabetes appear to develop more severe forms of the disease data from the uk suggest that a diagnosis of diabetes is a major risk factor for hospital admission in people with covid-19 as 19 of 16749 patients hospitalised with covid-19 between february and april 2020 had underlying diabetes 10 see table 1 indeed one-third of all people dying from covid-19 in the uk had an underlying diagnosis of diabetes regrettably the odds of in-hospital death in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes t2d was 286 and 181 compared to people without diabetes after adjusting for confounding variables 11 moreover at the time of writing an underlying diagnosis of diabetes is the commonest underlying health condition amongst those who have died of covid-19 in the uk 12people with diabetes infected with sars-cov-2 in china and italy have also required greater use of intensive care unit icu support andor mechanical ventilation and have had a higher mortality rate than people without diabetes 13 indeed studies from both the usa and china report that diabetes is an independent predictor of death in people with covid-19 and that mortality is up to 50 higher in this patient population than in people without diabetes 14 moreover a recently published analysis of people with diabetes hospitalised for covid-19 in france found that 290 of people attained a primary outcome measure of mechanical ventilation andor death within 7 days of hospitalisation with covid-19 interestingly the authors of this study reported that high body mass index was independently associated with the primary outcome 15 in fact around 40 of people hospitalised with covid-19 in the usa had underlying diabetes or hyperglycaemia with a more than fourfold greater mortality than those who did not 16 therefore it would appear that diabetes may act as a marker for poor metabolic health that in turn increases the risk of severe disease in those infected with sars-cov-2 as several other high-risk medical conditions are associated with diabetes including hypertension obesity ischaemic heart disease and chronic renal diseasethere is undoubtedly an increased mortality in people with diabetes and covid-19 possibly due to the association of conditions with poor outcomes in covid-19 such as hypertension ischaemic heart disease and obesity 17 which are commonly observed in people with diabetes see fig 1 therefore the mortality association may be confounded by this relationship however considerable biology links poor outcomes and higher mortality in people with diabetes and covid-19 in this review we discuss the likely biological interactions between diabetes and covid-19 and the potential impact of diabetes medications on covid-19 severity and health outcomesthis article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authorsdiabetes is associated with poorer health outcomes as a result of its multi-system involvement and association with multiple cardiovascular renal and other comorbidities making it a leading cause of death worldwide 18 diabetes results in an inflammatory condition in which hyperglycaemia triggers the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in oxidative stress and thereby tissue inflammation moreover diabetes is associated with a relative immunodeficiency as a result of impaired macrophage and neutrophil function reduced lymphocyte proliferation and complement activation dysfunction 19 as a result of this pro-inflammatory and immunodeficient state higher morbidity and mortality has previously been associated with several bacterial and viral infections in people with diabetes 18 20 predictably uncontrolled glycaemia was previously associated with worse outcomes in people with diabetes during both the sars-cov-1 21 and mers-cov 22 disease outbreaks however there remains debate on whether hyperglycaemia acts to exacerbate the infection or is simply a consequence of the stress response that results from coronavirus infectionowing to the high prevalence of people with diabetes and covid-19 requiring hospitalisation andor icu support there must be more specific mechanisms which affect people with diabetes infected with sars-cov-2 14 given our understanding of the mechanism of sars-cov-1 and mers-cov we review the potential role of ace2 and dpp-4 receptors in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 in people with diabetes
the ace2 receptor is widely expressed within the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract tubular epithelial cells of the renal tract mucosal cells of the gastrointestinal tract arterial and venous endothelial cells cardiac myocytes and the pancreatic -cells 17 23 within the respiratory system ace2 converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin i and therefore inhibition of ace2 leads to elevated concentrations of angiotensin ii thereby generating a pro-inflammatory response and stimulating aldosterone secretion collectively these actions enhance local vascular permeability and renal fluid retention thus engendering respiratory distress 24 sars-cov-2 enters the host cell utilising the envelope spike glycoprotein on its surface to bind the ace2 enzyme which in turn modulates the enzymes activity potentiating cell damage and respiratory failure 25 consequently hypokalaemia has been noted as a feature of people who are critically ill from covid-19 and is believed to be a result of renal potassium wasting from excess aldosterone secretion moreover early normalisation of serum potassium is a predictor of an improved prognosis in people who are critically unwell with covid-19 26 interestingly one recent study concluded that sars-cov-2 may cause acute kidney injury via the ace2 receptor as the virus was detected within human glomerular cells at autopsy 27in people with diabetes hyperglycaemia in the earlier stages of covid-19 may worsen disease outcomes as hyperglycaemia induces the glycosylation of the ace2 receptor promoting cellular linkage to the sars-cov-2 virus and therefore promoting infection of the host cell and causing a higher disease severity 28 moreover early correction of hyperglycaemia can reverse this process and may improve disease outcomes leading many authors to argue a case for tight glycaemic control as a priority in the care for people with diabetes who have covid-19 17 2931 in addition to enhanced ace2 receptor glycosylation upregulation of ace2 receptor expression may enhance the ability of sars-cov-2 to enter and infect the host cell as a result there are safety concerns surrounding the use of many medications which are commonly used in people with diabetes including ace inhibitors angiotensin-receptor blockers ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones all of which appear to increase the expression of ace2 17 nevertheless little evidence currently supports their discontinuation in routine practice and current guidance supports continuation of these medications 17 32 however further study into the possibly harmful effect of such frequently utilised medications in people with diabetes and cardiovascular disease is warranted 33
genetic analyses of the ace2 gene provide further explanation for the poorer health outcomes seen in people with covid-19 and diabetes the ace2 enzyme is expressed by the ace2 gene on the x chromosome 34 interestingly expression of ace2 has been linked with the development of t2d and the expression of the single nucleotide polymorphism g8790a on the ace2 gene also increases the risk of developing t2d 35 36 theoretically an increased expression of ace2 or specific ace2 polymorphisms may result in greater disease severity by increased binding potential with the sars-cov-2 virus one study observed that asian men had greater expression of ace2 than their white or african american counterparts 37 implying that this may explain some of the population differences observed in covid-19 severity additionally cao and colleagues observed that east asian populations had higher ace2 receptor tissue expression which again may explain differences in susceptibility or response to sars-cov-2 38 however further investigation into this potential risk factor is warranted 33 and may lead to further therapeutic targetsfurther interest in the role of ace2 in people with diabetes comes from studies identifying this receptor in pancreatic -cells 39 recent observations of greater incidence rates of diabetic ketoacidosis have been reported in people with or without an underlying diagnosis of diabetes and are associated with a high mortality rate 40 diabetic ketoacidosis in this setting likely results from the destruction of pancreatic -cells following sars-cov-2 entry into the cell via the ace2 receptor indeed people with insulin-treated diabetes and covid-19 appear to have greater insulin resistance and require significantly higher insulin doses 14 this may simply reflect the severity of infection inducing a considerable catecholamine response which generates greater insulin resistance or it is a direct mechanism in which sars-cov-2 further impairs -cell function the latter argument is supported by a previous study conducted during the sars-cov-1 outbreak which observed that approximately 50 of non-diabetic patients with sars-cov-1 infection developed diabetes as an inpatient although only 5 of participants had diabetes at follow-up 3 years later the authors reason that as sars-cov-1 binds to the ace2 receptor in the pancreatic -cells the resulting damage to the islet cells impairs insulin release 39 it is this relative hypoinsulinaemia that is thought to be the cause of the higher incidence of hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients 40 as a result many argue that tighter blood glucose control is essential and will improve health outcomes in people with diabetes 17 2931the interest in dpp-4 receptors started with the finding that the mers-cov virus targeted this receptor to enter and subsequently infect a host cell 14 and that antibodies directed against dpp-4 inhibit the infection of host cells by the mers-cov virus 41 of course the dpp-4 enzyme plays a critical role in glucose metabolism by degrading incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide resulting in reduced insulin secretion 42 however dpp-4 also known as cluster of differentiation-26 cd26 plays an additional immunomodulatory role by activating t cells and maintaining lymphocyte function 43 recent studies have observed that the dpp-4cd26 molecule also interacts with the s1 domain of the sars-cov-2 viral spike glycoprotein 44 in addition to the initially reported interaction with the ace2 receptor 6 moreover there are structural similarities between sars-cov-2 and the mers-cov and sars-cov-1 viruses 4 44 however results are mixed and other studies do not support an interaction between sars-cov-2 and cells expressing dpp-4 but only to cells expressing ace2 45 nevertheless there remains a potential role for dpp-4 inhibitors in the treatment of people with covid-19 leading some to call for further studies to explore this potential therapeutic avenue 46 47drugs within this class of medication inhibit the sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 sglt-2 protein in the proximal convoluted tubule thereby preventing the reuptake of both sodium and glucose to promote their urinary excretion 48 use of these medications is associated with significant improvements in glycaemic control body weight and reduced progression of renal disease 49 50 since their introduction in 2013 their prescribing usage has increased dramatically and they are amongst the most commonly used drugs for treating t2d 51there is strong rationale for the use of sglt-2 inhibitors as a potential treatment for people with covid-19 firstly the use of these medications promotes diuresis and natriuresis which improves heart failure outcomes 52 53 additionally their use appears to selectively reduce interstitial fluid volume without significantly affecting the intravascular fluid volume 54 collectively these actions may improve covid-19 health outcomes because as discussed above covid-19 locally increases vascular permeability within the lung thereby increasing interstitial fluid volume and consequently inducing respiratory distress 24 secondly the use of sglt-2 inhibitors is associated with a shift in myocardial and renal metabolism from carbohydrate andor lipids to ketones which are more energy-efficient and may improve both myocardial and renal function 55 thirdly sglt-2 inhibitors are also believed to exert an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing serum leptin tumour necrosis factor-alpha tnf- and interleukin 6 il-6 levels but increasing serum adiponectin level 56 given the pro-inflammatory state associated with diabetes 19 reducing such inflammatory markers may result in improved morbidity and mortality associated with covid-19 indeed the use of sglt-2 inhibitors appears to be associated with favourable cardiovascular and general health outcomes making them an attractive therapeutic option in people with diabetes and covid-19as a result studies to establish whether these drugs improve covid-19 outcomes in people with or without diabetes would be important the dare-19 trial is a phase iii randomised double-blind and placebo-controlled trial which aims to establish whether dapagliflozin 10 mg reduces disease progression complications andor all-cause mortality in people with covid-19 57 interestingly not all of the study participants will have a diagnosis of diabetes but there is a requirement of a diagnosis of either hypertension t2d atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease heart failure or chronic renal disease to participate 57 we are unaware of other clinical trials investigating the use of these medications at the time of writinghowever there are some major concerns surrounding the use of sglt-2 inhibitors in people with diabetes and covid-19 such concerns are due to the increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis associated with the use of sglt-2 inhibitors as a result of increased urinary glucose excretion with reversal of the insulinglucagon ratio which then precipitates ketosis 58 given the increased risk of ketoacidosis in people with covid-19 discussed above there is therefore potential for harm associated with the use of sglt-2 inhibitors and the current recommendation is to withhold these drugs during illness in keeping with sick day rules 14 59 moreover sglt-2 inhibitors promote renal ace2 activity and thus there is potential that the use of these medications may promote sars-cov-2 infectivity 60 however there are no trials to date which demonstrate this and further data are required we await the outcome of the dare-19 trial with anticipation to further investigate the benefits and potential risks associated with the use of dapagliflozinas discussed above there is considerable interest in the dpp-4 receptor as a therapeutic target in people with covid-19 as a result of its potential interaction with this receptor to infect a host cell 44 whilst there is no currently available clinical data to support this some studies are underway to examine the impact of dpp-4 inhibition on covid-19 outcomes in people with diabetes the aim of an observational retrospective casecontrol study in italy is to compare clinical and biochemical outcomes in people with diabetes treated with the dpp-4 inhibitor sitagliptin to people with diabetes not treated with sitagliptin 61 the objective of a randomised open-label trial is to compare measures of glycaemic control inflammation and chest x-ray findings between insulin-treated patients with t2d with or without the dpp-4 inhibitor linagliptin 62 at the time of writing no further clinical trials on dpp-4 inhibitors were foundglucagon-like peptide-1 is an endogenous peptide secreted by the distal small bowel in response to glucose ingestion to stimulate insulin release from the -cells of the pancreas and is subsequently degraded by the dpp-4 enzyme glp-1 analogues act directly to stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion and are associated with improved glycaemic control body weight and reduced progression of renal disease 49 50glp-1 analogues may interact with the covid-19 disease process through two key processes upregulation of ace2 receptors and anti-inflammatory effects in rats use of the glp-1 analogue liraglutide was associated with upregulation of ace2 receptors in the cardiopulmonary system 63 and the liver 64 secondly the use of glp-1 analogues is known to improve metabolic health generally at least partly through reducing endovascular inflammation 65 indeed one pre-clinical trial found that use of liraglutide in rats was associated with reduced inflammatory measures including macrophage infiltration and reduced tnf- and il-6 levels 66 however there is a paucity of evidence from human studies in this area 60 and we are not aware of any ongoing trials examining the potential impact of these medications of covid-19 outcomes at the time of writing this reviewcovid-19 is a worldwide pandemic which has resulted in an extraordinary number of infections and deaths worldwide people with diabetes are particularly vulnerable to develop more severe forms of the disease possibly due to a clustering of risk factors such as hypertension ischaemic heart disease and chronic renal disease common pathways appear to exist that may explain the susceptibility of this patient population to covid-19 and some medications commonly used for people with diabetes may interact with these pathways however little is known to date on whether these interactions lead to clinical harm or benefit or indeed whether they have any impact at all although a recent analysis of people with diabetes hospitalised in france with covid-19 demonstrated no association with the need for mechanical ventilation or death within 7 days with glucose-lowering therapies such as metformin and insulin 15 safe trials exploring such medications are welcomed and we hope these will shed light on this rapidly evolving area in a time of great uncertainty whilst we continue to rapidly learn more about this novel diseasean emergence of pneumonia cases in wuhan hubei province china was first reported to the world health organization who on december 31 2019 1 a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which had not been previously identified in humans was subsequently isolated from these patients and was identified as the source of the acute respiratory illnesses now named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on march 11 2020 covid-19 was subsequently declared a global pandemic by the world health organization who and has spread to over 212 countriesterritories worldwide so far 2 3 this has surpassed the spread of other viral respiratory tract diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 4 5 specifically as of april 30th 2020 there are 3090445 reported laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide 3 and this number is expected to continue increasing this has resulted in an unprecedented international public health crisis that has prompted numerous countries to implement nation-wide lockdowns to mitigate the spread of the virus and reduce the burden on healthcare systemsthe public health burden of covid-19 has reached beyond that of any other infectious respiratory illness as it may have associations with non-communicable diseases ncds including cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disorders cvds patients with covid-19 often have vascular risk factors and comorbidities 6 7 which may increase the need for hospitalization and need for intensive care unit admissions andor intubation it may also induce vascular injury that would promote the risk of stroke 8 9 10 11while prevention and management of covid-19 is a top global health priority this should not come at the cost of compromising the treatment and management of other potentially life-threatening diseases 12 the present multicenter international study has been designed to assess changes in stroke rates severity subtypes ischemichemorrhagic and outcomes before during and after the covid-19 pandemic the results of this initiative can be used as a monitoring model for public health authorities and policymakers regarding the systems capacity during a global crisis of this magnitude ultimately enhanced simultaneous surveillance of ncd and covid-19 comorbidity in populations would generate the empirical data needed to better understand the dual-disease burden and to target coordinated carecascade is a new initiative and we foresee continuous collaboration across multiple participating centers worldwide figure 1

with covid-19 who develop strokes in hospital or within two weeks after their discharge we will also identify stroke patients with a laboratory-confirmed covid-19 diagnosis 17 further given the limited availability of covid-19 laboratory testing in some centers we will gather data regarding those clinically suspected of having covid-19 following a stroke with this approach we can provide a broader understanding of the larger incidence of both the communicable and non-communicable related diseaselocal ethics committee approval will be obtained for each participating center data sharing will be according to the institutional ethics committees policies and official agreements we will use anonymized data secured in protected servers the confidential data will be saved in an encrypted

subject id coding will be designed to have a specific designation code for each participating center that is only shared with the data processing center and the corresponding sitecrude and standardized hospitalization rates of stroke per month will be calculated using a direct method we will use a poisson regression model with a log link to compare the number of stroke hospitalizations during the covid-19 pandemic as compared to corresponding months in the previous and possibly upcoming years we will calculate risk ratios with 95 confidence intervals cis of the number of stroke hospitalizations within the pandemic period as compared to the periods before and after covid-19 we will use kaplan-meier survival method within the study period and cox-regression model to estimate

compare the proportion of different stroke care managements eg outpatient assistance craniectomy utilization discharge setting supported discharge between the covid-19 pandemic and previous periods these variables will be added as a time-varying confounder in the its regression model prevalence of stroke subtypes and important neuroimaging features eg cortical vs subcortical anterior vs posterior circulation stroke size and location etc will be estimated in proportion to total admitted strokes these variables will also be analyzed in the its model as a time-varying confounder using an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model according to the box-jenkins-tiao strategy serial autocorrelations of the hospitalization rates will be assessed the q-statistic will test analytically whether the autocorrelation function is different from a white noise process a lag plot will be created using the sample autocorrelation coefficients plotted against the corresponding lags we will calculate the durbin-watson dw statistic to test the autocorrelation of the errors in the segmented regression modelscascade is a new multicenter initiative to assess the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on stroke occurrence severity care and outcomes the results of this initiative will have multiple clinical and public health implications similar to other major global crises eg wwii critical periods of time surrounding covid-19 can be categorized as periods before during and after the pandemic since the 1918 flu pandemic 18 the world has not experienced a pandemic of this magnitude therefore the pooling of epidemiological clinical and laboratory data on the covid-19 pandemic is imperative to the success of national and global public health initiatives directed towards this novel virus and future national and international health crises in addition to the covid-19 viral epidemiology a successful model should also include other major diseases including ncds identifying the risk for vulnerable populations ie those with prior comorbidities and prioritizing preventive measures through strengthening public protections and improving access to health services combining these preventive measures for covid-19 with measures surrounding life-threatening ncd as well as focusing on screening and treatment programs during and after the pandemic is of major importance and one of the priorities of the cascade studycovid-19 can affect stroke rate and outcomes through various direct and indirect pathways among 20812 patients confirmed to have covid-19 in china as of february 11 2020 2683 patients 128 had hypertension and 873 42 had cardiovascular disease 6 similarly in italy in a subset of 355 patients who died of covid-19 352 were found to have comorbidities including diabetes in 355 ischemic heart disease in 30 atrial fibrillation in 245 and stroke in 96 of patients 7 the systemic inflammatory response from sars-cov-2 may trigger the rupture or erosion of atherosclerotic plaque 8 11 destabilize previous stroke or coronary artery disease 9 and may be associated with acute cardiac injury such as myocarditis 8 10sars-cov-2 may also have a peripheral vascular detrimental effect due to its ability to act on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors which play a major role in regulating cardiovascular function 11 19 furthermore it also has a potential negative neurotropic effect due to the expression of ace2 receptors on neurons and cerebral endothelial cells this facilitates the rupture of the blood-brain barrier and cerebral arteries 20 which suggests the development of more severe and devastating strokes 21 in the presence of covid-19 finally stroke-induced suppression of the innate and adaptive immune system is well described 22 and may impact susceptibility to and severity of sars-cov-2 infection in the acute phase of stroke ultimately impacting clinical outcomesgiven that covid-19 is closely related to sars 23 we anticipate similarities in cardiovascular presentations such as arrhythmias specifically in a cohort study n121 tachycardia 719 and bradycardia 149 were reported in patients with sars 24 in addition hypoxemia resulting from severe respiratory illness in covid-19 particularly in those with underlying cvds such as stroke and heart failure may also lead to atrial fibrillation 7 and increased mortality rate 25 finally covid-19 has been associated with abnormalities in the coagulation cascade 26similar to many other global health crises covid-19 may also indirectly affect the rate and severity of cvds prioritization of medical resources towards covid-19 precautions and assistance as seen in many countries may result in a reduction of resources for other potentially fatal diseases 27 this is important as a healthcare system collapse under significant burden from covid-19 may directly and indirectly affect all other major health conditions eg stroke resulting in higher mortality and morbidity among both infected and non-infected patients it is necessary to note that most countries heavily impacted by covid-19 are those that are typically more impacted by the presence of concurrent ncds rather than communicable diseases in general paper in preparation as such it is possible that the lack of prior exposure to a pandemic of this magnitude could have resulted in a lack of preparedness in terms of preventive and emergency management planscovid-19 may also indirectly affect cvds through heightened emotional responses such as stress 28 specifically within the 3 weeks following the 2011 great east japan earthquake and tsunami disaster there was a significant increase in the number of cardiovascular events including acute coronary syndrome or congestive heart failure without any change in the rate of stroke 29 a study observed a french population over 4 football world cup events a time period that is considered stressful for the audience viewing the matches 30 interestingly the study found a decrease in the rate of stroke potentially due to a state of the euphoria associated with viewing the football game 30 a similar study in germany during the 2006 world cup found that the incidence of cardiac emergencies increased significantly on days that the german team was playing 31 the difference in the incidence of cvds during these national disasters and events may be explained by the heterogeneous nature of cvd occurrences 29 further due to the implementation of mitigation strategies that have resulted in physical isolation of large subsets of the population covid-19 has indirectly and beneficially impacted air quality and pollution recent observational satellite images obtained from nasa depicted improvements in air quality over china during periods of quarantine in february 2020 a time which had seen nation-wide business closures and prohibited vehicular transportation specifically up to 30 reductions in no2 emissions and up to 40 reductions in co2 emissions have been observed 32 33 while similar reductions are normally seen during chinese lunar new year due to business closures the emissions typically increase once again in the following weeks 34 however due to the quarantine the number of festivities and outdoor events have been reduced similar trends have been observed in states that have implemented shelter-in-place orders within the united states 35 as of march 9 2020 italy which had also implemented a nation-wide lockdown has also seen improvements in air quality specifically from march 14 until march 25 2020 rome had seen up to a 35 decrease in no2 as compared to the same period in 2019 36 this is particularly important as air quality has been shown to have effects on stroke and other ncds 37 conversely it is possible that prolonged homestay due to the quarantine may lead to increased sedentary behaviors physical inactivity and unhealthy dietary intake habits leading to increasing or worsening chronic health conditions 38the cascade study is feasible and can provide scientific answers for many of the aforementioned hypotheses the data will be gathered in a challenging resource-limited situation during the covid-19 pandemic which is having an enormous impact on healthcare and the economy in many countries the proposed initiative can provide a wide range of information from individual-based health related issues to changes in health policy in high middle and low-income countries as well the cascade registry can also be combined with other international stroke registries to expand the knowledge in this field in addition our data will reflect the real-world and systemic healthcare challenges currently facing many centers around the world data will be gathered based on available stroke information at each center it is possible that those with transient ischemic attacks tias and minor strokes may not present to emergency rooms due to fear of contracting covid-19 from the hospital andor social distancing measures however we would ultimately not expect to see a significant decrease in the rate of severe and fatal stroke presentations therefore any changes in the rate severity and outcome of stroke within the study period will likely reflect the direct and indirect consequences of covid-19the worldwide convergence of ncd and communicable infectious diseases has the potential to overstretch global health systems the cascade initiative can potentially shed light on challenges related to stroke care as a major ncd within this context identifying and analyzing the current health-related data during the covid-19 period will help to optimize resource allocation conduct proper assessments to objectively identify the nature of the problem implement strategies to address the issue in the most effective and efficient way and better prepare for future viral outbreaksauthors and investigators have no conflict of interestthe covid-19 pandemic included ireland from march 1 2020 the states health services were re-tooled to address this with dramatic changes in resource allocation and utilisation cardiac surgery and heart and lung transplant services were particularly challenged there were three considerations intensive care availability patient covid-19 exposure and the impact of that on the risk of concurrent major surgery and patient willingness to attend hospital for surgery in the transplant domain there were also three challenges the confirmation of a safe donor the vulnerability of the immunocompromised recipient and intensive care unit icu resource utilisation the objective of this paper was to analyse activity patterns at the national centre for cardiothoracic surgery and transplantation and to discuss the impact of this change on the provision of cardiac and transplant surgical care going forwarddata regarding cardiothoracic operative activity in the mater misericordiae university hospital is collected prospectively on a standardised cardiothoracic digital database patient advocate tracking system pats a retrospective review of that prospectively collected data was performed for the first 4 months of the years 2019 and 2020 the number and nature of all cases as well as patient demographic and profile data were reviewed all cases were referred through the public sector however some of the surgery took place in private institutions as per the agreement between the state and the private hospitals as part of the pandemic emergency response the relative reduction in 2020 was expressed as a percentage of the caseload in 2019 this study was approved by the institutional review board ref code 13782149 tmra surgery for left-sided valvular heart disease including aortic valve replacements and mitral valve replacement or repair with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting cabg was not as dramatically affected as other procedures a 6 reduction 44 vs 41 cases was seen in the 4-month period focusing on march and april 2020 surgery continued at 90 rate of expected cases 17 vs 19looking at coronary artery bypass surgery alone we noted a 9 reduction in the number of cabg cases performed between 2019 and 2020 70 vs 64 however again the drop-off is focused on the 2 months of march and april in this time window of 2020 activity continued at 61 expected activity 36 vs 22 fig 2a and 2bmajor aortic surgery such as aortic root ascending aortic or arch replacement was seen to have an overall decrease in numbers by 44 16 vs 9 focusing on the period of march and april 2020 activity continued at 22 of the expected rate 9 vs 2the case numbers of adult congenital operations had initially increased in january and february between 2019 and 2020 1 vs 3 however three cases were performed in march and april of 2019 whereas no congenital procedures took place in the same months of 2020 fig 2a and 2bthe study included cases of heart transplant lung transplant and primary ventricular assist device vad and observed a 28 reduction overall and a 50 reduction since the onset of the pandemic fig 2bother procedures included epicardial permanent pacemaker placement central cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo myxoma excision emergency sternotomy for cardiac trauma and myomectomy the incidence of such cases had reduced by 92 since the pandemic restrictions were put in place with 13 cases performed in march and april 2019 while only one of these cases was performed in 2020of the 47 cases completed in the march and april 2020 period 32 cases were performed on-site at the mater misericordiae university hospital while 15 were performed at outsourced locations one of these cases would prove to be covid-19 swab positive this was associated with a prolonged icu stay and their care continues at the time of writingthe covid-19 pandemic has challenged the nations health service it has proven adaptable and flexible and has radically altered its profile and resource allocation in the context of the needs of the time major cardiac surgery dropped in priority this was driven by the three factors the need to re-distribute heath service resources in the emergency the need to balance risk of delayed surgery with perioperative covid-19 infection and the altered pattern of emergency department presentation and outpatient investigationsthe findings of this review demonstrate a significant drop in major cardiac surgery procedures there was a 50 reduction in cardiac and transplant surgery for march and april 2020 this occurred despite the utilisation of the private capacity contracted by the state in the emergency these findings are consistent internationally with those observed by salenger et al 1 who saw a 54 decrease in cardiac surgical volumes once restrictions were implemented the study used mathematical modelling to estimate a future delay of up to 8 months due to backlog of cases although this study discusses a different healthcare system there will inevitably be a backlog for irish patients and there are a number of patients on the elective waiting list for surgery within this speciality for whom this delay may be criticalwe know from previously published data that the mortality on the irish heart transplant waiting list is 24 for every 6 months on the list 2 equally patients listed for lung transplant often have an estimated survival of 2 years without transplant 3 the mortality risk for more general cases on a waiting list is also real there is a pattern in the profile of the delayed patients the service was able to protect cabg surgery and valve surgery to some extent there was a significant reduction in the numbers of major aortic cases performed which was mainly due to the drop-off in elective aortic cases for patients with aortic aneurysms as opposed to emergency procedures for dissection the potential for backlog of cases in the current climate presents a serious threat to patients with aortic diameters  6 cm who have an estimated rate of death risk or rupture of approximately 15 per year 4 however other groups such as adult congenital cases and transplant recipients would seem to have had their opportunity delayedone review from the netherlands 5 on the impact of covid-19 on transplant services considered that a reduction in potential donation offers was likely due to a reduction in road traffic accidents as more people worked from home at the time of writing the irish police force garda had reported an increase in both total collisions and case fatalities in 2020 when compared with those in 2019 including 25 fatalities in march and april 2020 as opposed to 20 in the same months of 2019 6 however an icu focusing on addressing this new pandemic may not be in a position to focus on the donation process the moratorium on visitors may also compromise the quality of the interaction between family and the icu team strict criteria were also developed to protect the recipient that mandated tight and secure clearance of covid-19 possibilities regarding a donor this may have excluded a number of potential donors although initial case report data suggested acceptable outcomes of covid-19 for solid organ transplant recipients 7 8 larger scale observational data suggests seriously raised morbidity and mortality in patients with heart transplants and covid-19 9 one consideration for patients awaiting heart transplant may be a temporising ventricular assist device vad which avoids immunosuppression while taking into account the support and care these patients require in the community and the capacity to provide this amidst the pandemic the small numbers of reported outcomes of lung transplant recipients post-covid-19 infected is mixed 7 10 11there were no adult congenital operations performed in march or april of 2020 these patients may be younger and without chronic hypertension and diabetes and may be among the lowest risk cardiac surgery group but there are currently no available studies with a focus on their covid-19 outcomes 12at the time of writing this review ireland had the thirteenth highest number of cases in the european union eu despite only ranking 19 in the eu in terms of population 13 despite this the number of cases in ireland has not surpassed the available icu resources 14 and consequently the irish government has proposed phased reopening of the country from may 18 2020 15 this presents a quandary for cardiothoracic services such as those provided in the mater hospital where there is no dedicated separate cardiac icu what patients should be selected for cardiac surgery while the icu continues to care for patients with the viruscardiac surgery patients are of particular relevance when discussing the covid-19 pandemic they have high rates of hypertension and diabetes two adverse risk factors for mortality with coronavirus infection 16 they require mechanical ventilation in the hours to days after surgery necessitating icu level care this means potentially more covid-19 risk then cocooning at home the risks therefore must be balanced between surgery delay and covid-19 exposure at a time of imperfect knowledge of the diseasefor the service reconstruction phase the potential to screen patients for planned surgery needs to be optimised methods such as clinical history nasopharyngeal swab testing and computed tomography of the thorax have been proposed ideally the hospital would be either a covid-19-free hospital with no emergency department another model is a single campus with two hospital divisions a covid-19 and non-covid-19 division with minimal cross-over between the two this presents challenges for icu organisation as it implies the need to two icus where the irish model was previously one single unit patients have become very afraid and also have declined dates of surgery offered to them it is too early for us all to be very definitive regarding that but patient confidence will have to be restored and patients will need demonstrable reassurance that their covid-19 exposure is being minimisedthe results of this study highlight the opportunity cost of the covid-19 pandemic response and highlight where some of the future challenges liethe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has abruptly reached pandemic proportions sars-cov-2 is a member of the betacoronavirus family as well as sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus since the beginning of 2020 the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has dramatically increased worldwide leaping to more than a million by march 2020 1 although the majority of covid-19 patients develop mild to moderate clinical features 2 severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure leading to high death rate may develop notably marked sex differences have emerged in covid-19 prevalence and prognosis in particular the age-specific risk of disease is reported to be significantly higher in males than in females except under the age of 50 years moreover the age-specific risks of death and hospitalization is at least two fold higher in males than in females among all age ranges 3 furthermore patients with advanced age and underlying pathologies mainly hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease cvd are more prone to experience severe form of the disease 4 even though the overall mortality considerably varies among countries the fatality-rate by age groups displays very similar patterns rising consistently in the 6069-year age group 5 importantly the presence of comorbidities further increases mortality in a sample of 355 patients who died of covid-19 in italy the prevalence of diabetes was 355 5 not so differently from covid-19 the spread of diabetes has known no boundaries and the number of affected people has reached nearly half a billion worldwide 6 the number of deaths attributed to diabetes and its complications was around 42 million in 2019 6 notably more than 65 of diabetic patients are over 65 years old 7 thus although with extremely different connotations covid-19 and diabetes are two pandemics that share the burden of a wide diffusion in the elderly population and a dramatic impact on global mortality and economic health resourcesthis short review is focused on some open questions emerging from the effort to fully understand the link between covid-19 and diabetes mainly in the context of possible harmful or beneficial effects of commonly used drugs in patients with diabetes on the course of covid-19 infectiondiabetes is reportedly a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide a conceivable link between diabetes and infectious diseases has been postulated in particular lower respiratory tract infections are known to be rather common and severe in the elderly with type 2 diabetes t2d 8 although evidence suggests that diabetes is unlikely to significantly increase the susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection a higher risk of worse covid-19 progression and outcomes has been observed 9 the mechanisms underlying this association are not completely clear yet but the exacerbated pro-inflammatory cascade and the impaired immune response in diabetic patients with covid-19 are suspected to be crucially involved in particular increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as leukocyte and neutrophil count pro-calcitonin c-reactive protein ferritin and circulating cytokines that trigger the cytokine storm namely il-6 il-8 il-2 receptor tnf- have been detected in diabetic patients with severe covid-19 compared to patients without diabetes 10 furthermore an altered immune response in diabetic patients possibly due to impaired lymphocyte neutrophil and monocytemacrophage function has been long hypothesised especially in the presence of poorly controlled glycaemia 11 12 higher concentrations of d-dimer and fibrinogen hallmarks of severe forms of covid-19 have been also reported in patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes suggesting that these patients might be more prone to develop coagulation abnormalities in the course of the infection known to be significantly associated with worse prognosis 10 13in a recent retrospective study involving chinese patients n  904 with moderate severe or critical disease the major risk factors for mortality and poor outcomes were evaluated among the enrolled patients 15 n  136 had diabetes including t2d type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes overall diabetes increased the odds of in-hospital death and poor prognosis diabetic patients were older and had significant alterations of several laboratory parameters associated with poor prognosis compared to patients without diabetes in particular they had higher levels of d-dimer while female diabetic patients had increased ldh and neutrophil count compared to non-diabetic patients cvd was more common in men with diabetes than in non-diabetic men notably in multivariable regression analysis insulin therapy was independently associated with poor prognosis c-reactive protein was the only independent risk factor for either mortality or poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 and diabetes 14 besides this further research is also needed to clarify whether hypoglycaemia might also contribute to adverse outcomes and increased mortality in covid-19 patients with diabetes 15patients with diabetes have high prevalence of high blood pressure and are at increased risk of cvd 16 hence the treatment of hypertension largely includes drug classes that have demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events such as angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs 17 since ace converts angiotensin i into angiotensin ii a potent vasoconstrictor and sodium-retentive agent the blockage of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas leads to an effective reduction in blood pressure ace shows homology with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptor to which the transmembrane spike glycoprotein on the surface of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 binds allowing the internalization of the virus by the alveolar cells and other cell types 18 ace2 which is clearly not a direct target of ace inhibitors is a ubiquitous mono-carboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin ii into the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic angiotensin-17 contrasting its potent vasoconstrictor sodium-retentive pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects indeed angiotensin-17 binding to the mas receptor induces nitric oxide release protecting against tissue injury 19 another known substrate of ace2 is angiotensin i which is converted into angiotensin-19 20 21 the latter is in turn converted into angiotensin-17 by ace therefore competing with angiotensin ii for its binding 22limited animal and in vitro studies have reported an upregulation of ace2 induced by arbs and to a far lesser extent by ace inhibitors predominantly in the heart and in the kidney the effect is partly explained by an increase in local levels of angiotensin ii induced by arbs but not by ace inhibitors 20 indeed arbs block angiotensin ii type 1 at1 receptors and consequently increase the availability of the substrate angiotensin ii which upregulates ace2 21 based on this assumption it has been speculated that the treatment with arbs and ace inhibitors might favour the entry of sars-cov-2 into the lung cells therefore increasing the risk for adverse outcomes and severe forms of covid-19 infectionconversely a beneficial effect of a background therapy with arb on the course of the disease has been supposed two complex mechanisms might support this hypothesis firstly angiotensin ii by binding to its receptor at1 might enhance the shedding of trans-membrane ace2 promoted by adam17 a disintegrin and metalloprotease therefore releasing soluble ace2 locally the soluble form of ace2 is unable to mediate sars-cov-2 internalization as it is no longer annexed to the cell membrane 21 secondly the up-regulation of ace2 probably induced by arbs might not necessarily have negative effects as sars-cov-2 internalization in the lung cells inevitably induces the downregulation of ace2 the increase in its substrate angiotensin ii a potent vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory agent might contribute to an exacerbation of lung injury indeed in animal models of lung injury a clear association between the activation of the angiotensin ii-at1 signalling and the severity of lung damage has been observed while the detrimental effects of this cascade are counterbalanced by the activation of the ace2-angiotensin-17-mas receptor axis 23 specifically in models of sepsis or acid aspiration which frequently cause acute lung injury and ards ace2 knockout mice experienced a more severe tissue damage characterized by marked inflammatory cell infiltration increased vascular permeability lung oedema and bleeding compared to wild-type mice similarly angiotensin ii type 2 at2 receptors knockout mice had a more marked lung damage in the same models the injection of recombinant human ace2 protein into ace2 knockout mice considerably decreased the severity of lung injury 24 in line with these findings the pre-treatment with recombinant human ace2 was able to reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue injury in a mouse model of respiratory syncytial virus infection 25 evidence from clinical studies is still rather limited in patients with ards recombinant human ace2 increased angiotensin-17 and decreased angiotensin-ii concentrations even though the study was prematurely discontinued for the lack of clinical improvement 26 overall evidence from animal models suggests a conceivable pneumo-protective role of both ace2 and at2 receptor in the context of lung injury a loss of pulmonary ace2 might therefore have harmful effects exacerbating inflammation and promoting respiratory distress and fibrosis in the same way the activation of ace angiotensin ii and at1 receptor axis might exert detrimental effects worsening lung damage the rationale of raas inhibition is therefore counterbalancing these effects by reducing angiotensin ii and increasing ace2 notably arb and ace inhibitors attenuated lps-induced lung injury in several preclinical studies 2731 recently milne et al analysed gene expression of ace2 ace agtr1 encoding for at1 tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 requested cofactor for the internalization of sars-cov-2 and adam17 in a large number of healthy lung tissue samples collected from patients undergoing lung resection for cancer a significant association between use of ace inhibitors and reduced ace2 gene expression was observed differently the use of arbs was not linked to relevant changes in ace2 expression but was significantly correlated to increased ace and decreased agtr1 expression 32 although these findings are quite in contrast with data from animal studies it should be highlighted that gene expression rather than protein concentration was analysed and that the collected tissue samples did not exhibit lung injury or ards covid-19 results in severe lung damage and an imbalance of the raas system in this context cannot be excluded recently in a pilot study covid-19 patients were found to have higher levels of circulating angiotensin ii compared to healthy subjects and a correlation between angiotensin ii concentration and the severity of the disease was observed as well 33 thus the effects of ace inhibitors and arbs might be very different in extremely damaged context and should be therefore explored in animal models of covid-19mounting evidence from recent clinical studies suggests that raas inhibitor use is not related to an increased risk of covid-19 infection or poor outcomes in a retrospective cohort study of 18472 patients screened for covid-19 test positivity was not significantly associated with ace inhibitor or arb therapy 34 similarly in a us study no relationship emerged between prior ace inhibitor or arb use and the increased likelihood of a positive sars-cov-2 test result adjusting for relevant confounding factors 35 in an italian community-based casecontrol study no association was found between ace inhibitor or arb treatment and covid-19 infection although the use of these drugs was rather frequent due to high prevalence of cvd 36 overall these findings excluded an increased risk of covid-19 infection in patients already treated with raas inhibitorsother studies have evaluated the link between covid-19 progression and raas inhibitor therapy in a recent korean population-based cohort study involving 5179 covid-19 patients the use of ace inhibitors or arbs was not associated with a higher mortality risk after adjustment for confounders 37 in a recent systematic review including a total of n  23565 covid-19 patients from different countries ace inhibitor or arb use was not associated with increased severity of covid-19 illness 38 interestingly in a meta-analysis of more than 19000 covid-19 patients from seven cohort studies and five casecontrol studies the use of raas inhibitors was not linked to a higher risk of covid-19 infection severity or mortality whereas mortality risk was significantly lower in patients treated with ace inhibitors or arbs compared to those treated with other antihypertensive drugs 39taking together data from observational studies indicates that raas inhibitor therapy is unlikely to have a negative impact on the course of the infection however whether patients with covid-19 might take advantage of initiating these drugs or not in terms of disease progression and outcomes should be explored in clinical trials which are still ongoingcvd is a well-known major complications of diabetes the risk of developing cvd is 2- to fivefold higher in patients with t2d than in non-diabetic patients mainly due to diabetes-related coronary atherosclerosis 40 in addition diabetic cardiomyopathy may occur independently of coronary artery disease likely developing from t helper 1 driven responses within the cardiomyocyte 41 42 besides the common clinical features of covid-19 cardiovascular damage may occur in nearly 12 of patients 43 being a cause of major concern due to a high related mortality the mechanisms underlying this complication are largely unknown the direct viral damage and the destabilization of coronary plaques reportedly are suspected to play a consistent role notably in a sample of 187 patients with covid-19 guo et al observed that the presence of background coronary heart disease or cardiomyopathy was associated with frequent occurrence of myocardial damage highlighted by a marked increase in serum troponin t in the course of the disease 44 accordingly mortality was considerably higher among patients with myocardial injury and concomitant cvd 694 than in patients without cvd 375 remarkably a considerable percentage of patients displaying myocardial injury had diabetes 30 compared to patients without myocardial injury 89 myocardial injury may therefore contribute to the poorer outcomes observed in diabetic patients with covid-19 45 of note patients with myocardial injury were more prone to develop malignant arrhythmias ards coagulopathy and acute kidney injury which explained high mortality 44 importantly ace inhibitors and arbs were broadly used in patients with myocardial injury but mortality did not significantly differ between treated and non-treated patients although consistent evidence excluding harms or suggesting benefits of raas inhibitors on covid-19 patients with hearth injury is lacking most arbs were able to increase ace2 expression in the hearts of animal models of arterial hypertension 46 even in this pathological context the possible effects of these drugs should be further elucidated as the down-regulation of ace2 in cardiomyocytes and in blood vessels induced by sars-cov2 internalization might exacerbate myocardial injury and endothelial dysfunction compromising heart function in patients with diabetes and underlying cvd 20 47in addition patients with t2d have high rate of lipid alterations and statins are the first line therapy for dyslipidaemia remarkably evidence from preclinical studies suggests that statins might modulate ace2 expression in several tissues including the heart it has been observed that atorvastatin increased ace2 protein expression in the heart and in the kidney of rabbits with atherosclerosis 48 in another study diabetic rats displayed significantly lower expression of ace2 and impaired systolic and diastolic function compared to control rats and the combined treatment with insulin and fluvastatin was associated with higher levels of ace2 compared to non-treated diabetic rats 49ace2 is a multi-substrate enzyme and is a targeted by several molecules although extremely limited there is evidence in animal studies that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ppar- agonists which are insulin-sensitizer drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes t2d might increase the expression of ace2 in different tissues in an animal model of hypertension the insulin-sensitizer rosiglitazone modulated the ace2angiotensin-17angiotensin ii axis in aortic tissue and lowered blood pressure by increasing the expression of ace2 50 similarly in high fat diet fed rats an animal model of obesity pioglitazone increased the expression of ace2 in insulin-sensitive tissues liver adipose tissue and skeletal muscle likely through the modulation of renin-angiotensin system 51ace2 is widely distributed in human tissues and remarkably its expression was found to be even lower in the lung than in other sites 4 hence other mediators are thought to play a role in facilitating sars-cov-2 infection the priming by the serine protease tmprss2 is requested for the binding of ace2 and the internalization of sars-cov-2 tmprss2 cleaves the s protein in s1 and s2 subunits a necessary step for membrane fusion and viral internalization which contextually drags ace2 into the alveolar cells 18 in light of this both antibodies targeting s-protein and tmprss2 inhibitors might prevent sars-cov-2 entry in lung cell 18 individuating other possible candidate co-receptors is therefore of great importance for the development of new therapeutic strategies to contrast the infectiondpp4 is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface exopeptidase with important metabolic functions it mainly regulates the bioactivity of gut-derived hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide gip they stimulate insulin secretion in response to oral glucose administration known as the incretin effect 52 the dpp4 inhibitors dpp4i are commonly used drugs for the treatment of t2d they prevent the degradation of incretins by inhibiting the catalytic activity of dpp4 as a result -cell insulin secretion is potentiated and glycaemia is significantly reduced independently of its catalytic function dpp4 displays inflammatory and immune functions 53 indeed it is expressed mainly by t-lymphocytes and is involved in their activation and proliferation 54 interestingly pro-inflammatory factors significantly increase dpp4 expression in circulating immune cells 55 unlike sars-cov and sars-cov-2 which binds to ace2 to entry into lung cells dpp4 is the functional receptor for mers-cov 56 hence several mouse and human monoclonal antibodies preventing protein s binding to dpp4 have given promising results for the treatment of mers 57 of note it has been recently reported that dpp4 shares patterns of expression with ace2 in the lung precisely in alveolar type 2 cells the main target of sars-cov-2 58 vankadari et al have recently set up a docking model of dpp4 and the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein 59 they predicted several dpp4 residues that might be involved in the interaction with sars-cov-2 s1 domain of the spike protein also targeted by other coronaviruses that enter the host cells through the functional receptor dpp4 however further validation is needed to draw conclusions and to establish whether the possible adhesion between dpp4 and spike protein may play a role in sars-cov-2 infection consequently there are some important issues to be addressed before claiming possible beneficial effects of dpp4 modulation on covid-19 60 according to data from chen et al in patients with diabetes and moderate-severe covid-19 the use of dpp4i did not significantly impact on mortality and clinical outcomes 14the presence of diabetes considerably influences the course of covid-19 infection being a risk factor for poor outcomes in limited preclinical studies ace2 expression was found to be modulated by several players in different tissues most of them are largely employed in the treatment of diabetes such as antihypertensive and to a considerably lesser extent insulin-sensitizers and statins in light of this the potential harmful or protective effects of these treatments in covid-19 infection might be an interesting soil for further research to date data supporting that these drugs clearly interfere with sars-cov-2 access in lung cells or in other tissues are completely lacking it should be stressed that in the absence of evidence from consistent clinical studies the discontinuation or the adoption of these therapies in the attempt to influence the course of the infection is strongly discouragedin order to maintain the benefits of randomization the primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle continuous variables will be described as medians 25th 75th percentiles or mean  standard deviation according to the distribution medians will be compared using the kruskal-wallis test and means will be compared using the t-test categorical

funding and trial oversight
this is an investigator-initiated study with financial support from dor institute for research and education idor no extramural funding was used to support this work the study is being coordinated by idor and the brazilian clinical research institute bcri both institutions will coordinate data management idor will manage the electronic clinical report form database the bcri will manage the clinical events adjudication database the executive and steering committees together with the operational teams from idor and bcri will oversee the medical scientific and operational conduct of the study the executive and steering committee members are responsible for the reporting of the results and the drafting and editing of this and forthcoming manuscripts the authors are solely responsible for the design and conduct of this study all study analyses the drafting and editing of the paper and its final contentsan independent dsmb will monitor safety and efficacy data on an ongoing basis with access to unblinded data the dsmb will review the primary outcome of the study as well as the secondary outcomes through weekly evaluations and also through 2 formal interim analyses including the hf group the dsmb will use a p-value 0001 in the interim analyses to declare a statistically significant difference in outcomes between study groups to guide their recommendations2223 an overall p-value 005 will be used to declare statistical significance at the end of the studyan independent clinical events classification committee will adjudicate the causes of death and the clinical outcomes described as secondary outcomes such as death myocardial infarction stroke hypertensive crisis and new or worsening heart failurethe majority of patients affected by covid-19 will have favorable clinical outcomes during the acute phase of the infection24 nevertheless the risk of severe forms of the infection increases significantly according to age and the presence of chronic comorbidities2526 among these comorbidities cardiovascular diseases are particularly important because of the intrinsic risk of adverse outcomes and the prevalence of these conditions in the global population2526 hypertension diabetes heart failure and coronary heart disease are common comorbidities associated with worse prognosis among patients with covid-19 however the higher risk detected in this group could also be due to other related factors that may facilitate infection and increase propagation of the virus27
renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are routinely used for common cardiovascular conditions1921 the benefits in reducing cardiovascular events are well established mainly in long-term analyses of patients with chronic use of these therapies2829 however in some acute clinical conditions these drugs are temporarily discontinued due to an imminent risk higher than the potential short-term benefit of these therapies30 there is currently an intense debate about the suspension or maintenance of chronic aceiarb therapy in patients with covid-191213273132
the brace corona trial was designed to test the impact of discontinuation compared with maintenance of chronic aceiarb therapy in patients with covid-19 this is one of several questions facing physicians in the setting of covid-19 and data are needed from randomized clinical trials like brace corona because renin-angiotensin system inhibitors increase levels of ace2 a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of covid-1915 the presence of ace2 in alveolar epithelial cells makes the lungs a preferred site of entry for the virus which explains the respiratory manifestations in patients with covid-19 this hypothesis of worse outcomes associated with the use of acei or arb in patients with covid-19 was recently shown in observational studies2526 however a cause-effect relation between the use of acei or arb and adverse events in covid-19 cannot be established since many confounding factors could explain a worse or better prognosis for these patients in observational analyses in a recent retrospective study of hospitalized covid-19 patients all-cause mortality was lower among patients on aceiarb therapy when compared with those not using aceiarbs33 an observational analysis from a single-center study showed that aceiarb use was not associated with severity of covid-19 infection or worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with hypertension34 nonetheless the effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibition on ace2 is uncertain and the potential harm related to this mechanism is not well defined3132 in addition the use of acei or arbs could be beneficial not only due to the well-known cardiovascular protection32 but also because of the potential respiratory system protection in patients affected by severe respiratory disease1527 considering that these high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease and covid-19 are commonly hospitalized the decision regarding the best approach for the management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors is critical in a scenario of apparent equipoise without high quality scientific evidence the medical decisions in clinical practice have been heterogeneous thus a randomized clinical trial is necessary to guide practicea multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted during a pandemic should follow the same steps commonly adopted in pivotal phase iii trials however the critical and urgent nature of a pandemic encourages opportunities to create more efficient research processes which can be adopted for use in clinical research conducted during non-pandemic times in a new and threatening situation like the covid-19 pandemic there is no specific evidence to guide medical therapy yet there is an urgent need to quickly answer the clinical questions that arise in order to guide treatment of the hundreds of thousands of people infected with a potentially lethal disease collaborative pragmatic studies are one of the best solutions in this scenario5 brace corona took less than 3 weeks from protocol development to first patient randomized including national ethics board review and approval which is unprecedented in brazil figure 4
 the covid-19 registry is already collecting the key clinical variables and outcomes that will be used for the randomized trial adding randomization to this structure allows for an efficient process which can provide the scientific community with a streamlined approach to answer a relevant clinical question with less bureaucracy and at lower cost in addition clinicians on the frontline who are already very interested in answering this medical question will be highly engaged with the trialsource documents from potential events will be adjudicated by a clinical events classification committee since many different complications could occur due to the interaction between covid-19 baseline cardiovascular condition and therapies used by these patients the primary study outcome chosen for brace corona daoh at 30 days was also very pragmatic and encompasses the potential effect of any relevant medical complication therefore regardless of the type of in-hospital complication it will be captured in the study and daoh will ultimately represent a meaningful outcome of the net benefit from the patients perspective this efficient model of a registry-based randomized trial which is the first of its kind in brazil has already been applied successfully in other countries3536 and represents a unique opportunity during the global crisis of covid-19 that could serve as an important legacy to the medical communitybrace corona is a multicenter randomized trial in patients hospitalized with covid-19 on renin-angiotensin system blockers that aims to determine whether discontinuation compared with maintenance of these drugs increases days alive and out of the hospital the results of this study will help guide medical decision making regarding the best management of a high-risk population of patients infected with sars-cov-2 most of all brace corona reinforces the importance of pragmatic randomized clinical trials which are effective models to provide rapid answers to inform clinical practice especially in situations that require appropriate rapid and high-quality evidence to guide medical practicerdl research support from bristol-myers squibb glaxosmithkline medtronic pfizer consulting fees from bayer boehringer ingelheim bristol-myers squibb daiichi-sankyo glaxosmithkline medtronic merck pfizer portolaavsm consulting fees from pfizer bayer novartis daiichi-sankyo zodiac and roche pgmbs fees and research support from pfizerrjm-b no conflicts of interestsaf consulting fees pfizer bayer daiichi-sankyo boehringer serviergasa consulting fees from pfizer and servierass no conflict of interestdca research support from boehringer ingelheim consulting fees pfizer bayer daiichi-sankyo boehringer servierlm no conflict of interestmfs no conflict of interestnzs no conflict of interestcmg no conflict of interestcbg research grants astrazeneca fda nih gsk medtronic novartis apple boehringer ingelheim bms pfizer janssen consulting astrazeneca espero gsk medtronic novartis boehringer ingelheim boston scientific bms pfizer daiichi sankyo merck roche eli lilly janssenjha research support from boehringer ingelheim bristol-myers squibb cryolife csl behring glaxosmithkline us food and drug administration us national institutes of health xatek consulting fees or honoraria from abbvie bayer bristol-myers squibb cryolife csl behring novo nordisk pfizer portola quantum genomics us veterans administration xatek zafgen conflicts of interest disclosures available at httpwwwdcridukeeduresearchcoiofs research support from boehringer ingelheim consulting fees pfizer bayer daiichi-sankyo boehringer ingelheim

according to the center for systems science and engineering at the johns hopkins university as of april 12 2020 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 pandemic caused 108867 deaths worldwide with a total of 1777666 infected people httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml just to make a comparison the sars-cov virus in years 2002-2003 infested about 8500 people in 27 countries and caused 866 deaths 1
the tremendous impact of sars-cov-2 infection and the paucity or lack of established therapeutic measures is generating basic and clinical studies to explore the mechanisms of viral entry into the human body and the subsequent pathophysiological and therapeutic implicationsthe present review discusses the role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors which are not only the door through which the virus enters into cells 23 but also the conductor of several pathophysiological reactions associated with the clinical features of the disease with potential therapeutic implicationsthe entry of sars-cov-2 into cells is mediated by the efficient binding of the spike s viral protein a 1273 amino acid long protein which belongs to the viral envelope and protrudes outwards with a corona like appearance to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors 23
the ace2 receptor discovered by two independent groups in year 2000 45 is a trans-membrane type i glycoprotein mono-carboxypeptidase composed by 805 amino acids which uses a single extracellular catalytic domain to remove one single amino acid from the octapeptide angiotensin ii to generate angiotensin1-7 ace2 receptor also converts angiotensin i into angiotensin1-9 which in turn is converted to angiotensin1-7 by ace and neprilisin figure 1
 the catalytic efficiency of ace2 is 400 times higher on angiotensin ii than on angiotensin i 6 ace2 shows a 40 structural identity to ace 4 although ace-inhibitors do not block ace2 because of the different conformational structure of the catalytic site 4
ace2 mediates the cell entry of three strains of coronavirus sars-cov nl63 and sars-cov-2 7 notably sars-cov and sars-cov2 share a 76 identity in the amino acid sequence 8 thereby explaining the propensity of these viruses for binding with ace2 some structural variations of human ace2 have been identified that are characterized by a lower binding affinity with the spike viral protein with potential protective implications 9 the first step of viral entry process is the binding of the n-terminal portion of the viral protein unit s1 to a pocket of the ace2 receptor the second step which is believed to be of utmost importance for viral entry is the protein cleavage between the s1 and s2 units which is operated by the receptor transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 a member of the hepsintmprss subfamily 10 tmprss2 is stechiometrically contiguous to ace2 receptor 10 the cleavage of the viral protein by tmprss2 is a crucial step because after s1 detachment the remaining viral s2unit undergoes a conformational rearrangement which drives and completes the fusion between the viral and cellular membrane with subsequent entry of the virus into cell release of its content replication and infection of other cells the importance of tmpsrr2 is supported by the evidence that entry of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 into cells is partially blocked by camostat mesylate an inhibitor of tmpsrr2 2
ace2 genes map to the x chromosome 11 its expression seems to be higher in asian than in white and african-american people 12 and receptors are ubiquitous in particular ace2 receptors are expressed in the heart endothelium of coronary arteries myocites fibroblasts epicardial adipocites vessels vascular endothelial and smooth cells gut intestinal epithelial cells lung tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells type 2 pneumocytes macrophages kidney luminal surface of tubular epithelial cells testis brain 13 14 15 16 in the lung the wide surface of alveolar epithelial cells might explain the vulnerability of this organ to the consequences of virus invasion ace2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble formthe disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 adam17 upregulated by angiotensin ii through its type 1 receptors at1 receptors cleaves the membrane-anchored ace2 thereby releasing a circulating active form of ace2 with loss of the catalytically activity of the remaining part of the enzyme anchored to membrane 17 elevated circulating levels of soluble ace2 are markers of different disease states characterized by increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system and associated with a worse prognosis 1819
studies addressing the pulmonary effects of angiotensin1-7 appear particularly appealing mas receptors are expressed at the surface of bronchial smooth muscle cells and alveolar epithelium 2930 in experimental and clinical models of lung inflammation angiotensin1-7 exerted anti-inflammatory effects with less infiltrates of lymphocytes and neutrophils reduced perivascular and peri-bronchial inflammation and prevention of subsequent fibrosis 2931 32 33
ace2 is expressed on the luminal side of the bronchial ciliated epithelia where it removes a single amino acid residue also from the polypeptide des-arg 9 bradykinin dabk 6 thereby preventing the binding of dabk on the bradykinin receptor b1 receptor 34 in the presence of reduced ace2 function in the lung induced by endotoxins there is an increase of free dabk which in turn activates b1 receptors with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and intense lung inflammatory and injury 34
the ace2angiotensin1-7mas receptor axis exerts anti-thrombotic effects 35 36 37 38 mas receptors are expressed on platelets 39 stimulation of mas receptors by angiotensin1-7 increases prostacyclin and no release 3536 animals knockout for mas receptors have a shorter bleeding time and increased size of thrombi 36 in these animals administration of angiotensin1-7 induces a marked antithrombotic effect which is directly related to the plasma levels of angiotensin1-7
39 and is inhibited by a-779 an antagonist of mas receptors 35 thus angiotensin1-7 plays an important role in opposing the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory effects of angiotensin ii 4041
the ace2angiotensin1-7mas receptor axis is well expressed in the pancreas where it improves insulin secretion possibly by improving peri-insular blood flow and inhibiting fibrosis as a result of increased no release 2842 ace2 receptors are also expressed in the adipose tissue 4344 and a reduction of ace2 has been noted in the adipose tissue of obese animals 44 in animal experiments diets rich of fats decreased ace2 activity and angiotensin1-7 and increased angiotensin ii and blood pressure levels in male but not in female animals and these reactions were inhibited by at1 blockade with losartan 45 after ovariectomy female animals showed similar reactions as in males 45 these data suggest that ace2 deficiency may favor obesity-induced hypertension 45 ace2 is also expressed in the cardiac adipocytes 46 obese patients with heart failure have an increased amount of epicardial adipose tissue 46 and it has been suggested that ace2 deficiency can induce heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in animals 47 this phenomenon has been attributed to adipose tissue inflammation through local activation of macrophages which possess at1 receptors on their cellular membrane 26
since the pulmonary inflammation and the resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome ards are potentially deadly complications of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 studies addressing the lung complications of ace2 down-regulation are of outmost importance studies using different models of lung injury showed that the down-regulation of ace2 receptors triggers important inflammatory lesions in the respiratory tree alveolar wall thickening edema infiltrates of inflammatory cells bleeding which appear to be mediated by angiotensin ii 2248 49 50
tracheal instillation of cigarette smoke 49 or particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter of less than 25 m 50 induces acute lung injury with release of inflammatory cytokines il-6 tnf- and tgf-1 and increased expression of ace consistent with aceangiotensin iiat1 receptor axis over-activity 50 these reactions are increased in ace2 knockout mice 50 in a model of acid aspiration which induces acute lung injury lung inflammatory lesions were more severe and lethal in ace2 knock-out animals 48 in these animals injection of recombinant ace2 as well as at1 receptor blockers attenuate the degree of lung injury 48 these findings strongly suggest that ace2 protects from lung injury induced by acid aspiration 48
notably lung injury has been induced by the isolated spike viral protein of the sars-cov the ligand for ace2 binding in the absence of other viral components 22 this model has the merit to investigate the impact of ace2 down-regulation in the absence of confounding effects of viral invasion and replication the authors found that even the isolated spike viral protein induced down-regulation of ace2 receptors with concomitant increase of angiotensin ii in the lung tissue and precipitation of severe pulmonary inflammatory lesions 22 also in this model at1 receptor blockers attenuated the pulmonary lesions induced by the spike viral protein 22
a key point to remark is that ace2 are mainly expressed in pneumocytes type ii small cylindrical cells which represent 5 of all pneumocytes 51 pneumocytes type 2 are responsible for the production of alveolar surfactant and in the same time they function as stem cells progenitors of pneumocytes type i 95 of all pneumocytes which are responsible of gas exchanges 52 therefore the damage of pneumocytes type ii due to the binding of coronavirus to ace2 receptors is devastating for at least three reasons 1 local unopposed aceangiotensin iiat1 receptor axis over-activity 2 reduced production of alveolar surfactant by injured pneumocytes type ii leading to reduced lung elasticity 3 reduced repair of pneumocytes type i leading to impaired gas exchanges and fibrosis 53
studies from china and italy have shown that hypertension diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease are the most frequent comorbidities in patients infected with sars-cov-2 54 55 56 older age and male sex are two additional factors associated with sars-cov-2 infection 54 55 56 a similar picture emerged a few years ago with the sars-cov infection 5758
in a study conducted in 201 patients infected with sars-cov-2 most patients were men 637 of patients the mean age was 51 years and the most frequent comorbidities were hypertension 194 diabetes 109 and history of cardiovascular disease 40 55 notably the patients who developed ards were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension 274 vs 137 diabetes 190 vs 51 when compared with those who did not develop ards 55 in a multivariate analysis the factors associated with progression from ards syndrome to death included older age neutrophilia and hyper-coagulation mainly reflected by a higher d-dimer 55 abnormal coagulation parameters and enhanced thrombosis predict a poor prognosis in patients with sars-cov-2 59 a meta-analysis of 8 studies conducted in china on a total of 46248 patients infected with sars-cov2 confirmed that hypertension diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease were the most frequent comorbidities in these patients 56 again hypertension and history of cardiovascular disease were significantly more prevalent among the more severe patients 56
in a recent analysis of 1591 infected patients from italy the mean age of patients was 63 years men were 82 and the prevalence of patients with hypertension diabetes and previous cardiovascular disease was 49 17 and 21 respectively 54 patients with hypertension were older that those without hypertension 66 vs 62 years p0005 when comparing the patients who died in the intensive care unit with those who survived the former were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension 63 vs 40 p0001 54
it is interesting to note that several conditions associated with viral infection and severity of the disease share a variable degree of ace2 deficiency for example ace2 expression in the lungs markedly decreases with ageing 60 to a greater extent in men than women 60 diabetes mellitus has been associated with reduced ace2 expression possibly as effect of glycosylation 61 62 63 several experimental and clinical studies indicate that ace2 deficiency obtained through deletion or inhibition may be a causative factor for hypertension 1464 treatment with soluble recombinant ace2 reduces the blood pressure rise provoked by angiotensin ii increases angiotensin1-7 and reduces angiotensin ii 65 ace2 deficiency has been associated with exacerbation of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy induced by angiotensin ii 66 and maladaptive left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction 67 furthermore deficiency of ace2 enhances the susceptibility to heart failure 14 a heterozygote loss of ace2 is believed sufficient to increase the susceptibility to heart disease 68
given the above premises it is tempting to speculate figure 2
 that ace2 deficiency may play a central role in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection the down-regulation of ace2 induced by viral invasion could be especially detrimental in individuals with baseline ace2 deficiency due for example to older age diabetes hypertension and prior heart diseases including heart failurethe possibility that a mild or moderate ace2 deficiency may protect from viral invasion seems unlikely because of the intrinsically high affinity of sars-cov-2 to ace2 receptors 23 by contrast in a setting of ace2 deficiency the ace2 down-regulation induced by virus could amplify the imbalance between the aceangiotensin iiat1 receptor axis adverse and the ace2angiotensin1-7imas receptor axis protective at lung level such dysregulation would much facilitate the progression of inflammatory and hyper-coagulation processes which share dependency upon local angiotensin ii hyper-activity insufficiently opposed by angiotensin1-7 this chain of events would not deny the concomitant role of other mechanisms including an impaired immune response to initial viral invasion or a genetic susceptibility to hyper-inflammation and thrombosis 6970
in this context administration of soluble recombinant ace2 12 or angiotensin1-7
71 could be promising therapeutic approaches requiring urgent evaluation in clinical trials two trials of losartan as additional treatment for sars-cov-2 infection in hospitalized nct04312009 or not hospitalized nct04311177 patients have been announced supported by the background of the huge adverse impact of the aceangiotensin iiat1 receptor axis over-activity in these patientsthe possibility that ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs may be discontinued even temporarily because these drugs appear to increase the expression of ace2 receptors the site of viral entry into the human organism 72 73 74 75 is actively debated 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 several scientific societies and various experts in this area expressed the position that discontinuation of these drugs is not justified by evidence and could be dangerous 76778182 on the other hand several experimental data discussed above suggest the potential utility of arbs particularly to limit lung inflammation during viral invasion 8083 it is hoped that the results of the above mentioned nct04312009 and nct04311177 trials will answer this questionwe suggest that ace2 down-regulation induced by the cell entry of sars-cov nl63 and sars-cov-2 may be particularly detrimental in subjects with pre-existing ace2 deficiency some degree of ace2 deficiency has been associated with a variety of conditions including older age hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease which also characterize people more likely to be infected and to present more severe complications in a setting of enhanced ace2 deficiency produced by the viral invasion the marked dysregulation between the adverse aceangiotensin iiat1 axis and the protective ace2angiotensin1-7mas axis would contribute to enhance the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes these considerations provide a rationale for investigating the role of therapeutic approaches conceptually linked to ace2 receptor activity these include the use of soluble recombinant ace2 angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers which are currently being evaluatedstudy supported in part by the no-profit fondazione umbra cuore e ipertensione-onlus perugia italynonethe authors declare they have no conflict of interestaccurate tracking modeling and understanding of covid-19 status as well as collaboration with local regional state and federal authorities are critical to health care organizations when making informed decisions about the resumption and ramping up of services considerations include hospital and intensive care unit icu census ventilator and ppe availability and staffing capability areas that are more severely affected where entire hospitals were converted into covid-19 care units will likely require a longer time before they will have capacity to provide care for noncovid-19 nonurgent cases however this may be quite different for regions that are less affected and have a significantly lower prevalence and incidence of covid-19 cases in general a significant and sustained drop in local incidence should be observed before health care organizations in areas experiencing a high case level should increase elective medical interventions the timing and rollout of this process will be dictated by governmental and health system policies in areas fortunate enough to have avoided a high covid-19 burden assiduous attention to ongoing local covid-19 incidence will be essential to managing the reboot process and the need to respond rapidly if a second wave occurs accordingly resumption of nonurgent ep services should be approached in a measured and cautious manner contingency plans and specific criteria to limit or stop elective cases in the event of a second wave should be predefined in advance of reopening in compliance with local regulationstesting for covid-19 infection is a critical tool as we embark on safely restarting elective and semi-elective procedures figure 1
illustrates a model for the evolution of detectable virus and virus-specific immunoglobulin during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection our current understanding regarding the limitations of these tests and how the timing of results over the course of exposure or infection impacts the interpretation of test results are shown in figure 2
patient screening and diagnostic testing are important tools to limit patient and staff exposure however lack of widespread access to timely and accurate viral testing has been a major limitation from the onset of the pandemic6 and there will likely be persistent variations in regional availability of testing greatly affecting our ability to identify infected individuals schedule cases prevent disease transmission and clarify policies that will minimize the risk of restarting elective proceduresthe test platforms now available have different advantages and limitations including differences in turnaround time and throughput fortunately false positive rates are low for established viral polymerase chain reaction pcr tests8 however sensitivity of pcr-based viral testing varies among platforms significantly variable false negative rates from available test kits have been reported which may be compounded by sampling limitations and variation in presence of virus at different sites during the course of the disease9 these considerations may prompt repeat testing6

10 when there is evidence of exposure typical symptoms or clinical presentation although atypical symptom presentations are well described11 whether a positive pcr test late in the course of the disease in an asymptomatic person represents detection of noninfectious viral particles or transmissible virus remains uncertainserologic antibody testing may supplement viral detection by pcr when available12

13 but it remains controversial and susceptible to misinterpretation when used to make decisions related to individual patient management pcr viral testing may be more accurate than igm for assessment of early stages of infection igg may be more helpful in the identification of prior infection over time figure 1 unfortunately limitations in sensitivity and specificity associated with serologic testing when compared with covid-19 viral testing could result in improper clinical decisions false positive serology tests uncertainties about whether true seropositivity confers protection from reinfection and the potential for continued viral transmissibility could create a false sense of security while ongoing research may clarify these issues and serologic testing will likely continue to improve at this time seropositivity should not be used to determine decreased standards for ppe or other containment approaches given the above limitations of viral and antibody testing all patients regardless of the test results should be treated with universal precautionsa major concern inhibiting patients from coming to hospitals is the fear of contracting covid-19 as both patients and health care workers can be asymptomatic carriers with the potential to infect other patients and health care staff11 the availability and implementation of universal testing policies for patients prior to procedures and for health care workers as well as universal masking sanitization and hand hygiene can favorably impact confidenceinstitutions will need to define standardized and comprehensive protocols for testing including testing prior to planned procedures electrophysiologists laboratory managers and outpatient clinical team leaders should define workflow processes for preprocedure testing and operational plans concordant with hospital and local policies for many institutions testing policies will be extensive and include multiple locations such as clinics procedural areas eg cardiac catheterization laboratory endoscopy suite interventional radiology suite etc and off-site locations including drive-through testing accommodations to testing will need to be based on a patients clinical condition geographic location inpatient versus outpatient status type and urgency of intervention test capability and local conditionsideally viral pcr testing should be performed within 1272 hours prior to the procedure whenever feasible to allow sufficient time for test results to be obtained and reviewed in the event that positive test results may change procedure planning mandatory preoperative isolation for the period between testing and procedure performance is important to mitigate the possibility of infection if preoperative testing is unavailable locally in a hospital or health care system and yet patients are to undergo nonurgent procedures then alternative screening methods must be established in conjunction with the health care system and local public health officials regardless of the availability of testing all organizations should utilize mandatory symptom screening temperature analysis and mandatory maskingpostoperative or postprocedure covid-19 testing may need to be considered in patients who develop symptoms after the procedure is performed atelectasis fever and volume overload are not uncommon in the postoperative period establishing operational guidelines for covid-19 testing in these patients and management of testing results should be determinedtransmission of covid-19 to exposed hcws has been documented since a negative test does not preclude subsequent infection even soon after testing periodic viral testing for asymptomatic health care workers is not currently a standard approach but enhanced surveillance of health care workers for even mild symptoms fever or a history of exposure and universal masking has generally been adopted this may reduce patient fear of developing hospital-acquired covid-19 infection quarantine of hcws with confirmed or suspected covid-19 and return-to-work criteria should follow centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidelines or local policy14
active viral shedding remains a possibility for asymptomatic individuals with positive igm andor igg serology15 where available viral testing should be performed to help determine whether the hcw is in true convalescence without active viral shedding some institutions offer serology testing for hcws which may suggest exposure to coronavirus but whether antibodies confer immunity to recurrent infection is unproventhe ability to perform elective or semi-elective cases is highly dependent on the covid-19 burden in each region regional risk can be categorized based on the severity of disease burden the state of resource utilization and projections figure 3
 as follows 1 high prevalence and incidence 2 medium prevalence and incidence and 3 low prevalence and incidence these factors could impact whether the health care systems in a region have the capacity to start engaging in elective procedural or medical carethe availability of ppe and resources remains a major consideration in the timing of resumption of semi-elective and elective procedures adherence to ppe policies according to cdc and local policies remains critical for hcws in the hospital and operatingprocedure rooms supply chains for ppe needed for aerosol airborne droplet and contact precautions should ideally project and maintain adequate supplies for covid-19related care in addition to covering the extra ppe needs for elective procedures comprehensive hospital-wide multispecialty operational committees and leadership that can oversee this process are valuable and include supply chain data analytics strategic planning quality assessment infection prevention and clinical expertise patients and hcws will need to continue using ppe particularly masks until community spread of the virus has reduced below threat level and when local and federal regulations dictateimportant data needed to inform health care system planning include the following bed icu and ventilator capacity procedural and recovery room availability depth of diagnostic and laboratory services and cleaning capacity housekeeping in all clinical areas along the continuum of care should be addressed eg clinic preoperative ep laboratories recovery areas icus ventilators transesophageal echocardiography probes cardiac implantable electronic device cied programmers etc operating room and procedure schedules and staffing will need to be flexible to accommodate the influx of cases modifications may include limiting block time assignments to increase open scheduling time or extending hours of elective procedure scheduling repurposed rooms may need to be refitted with appropriate equipment to expand and return to prior capacity for specific procedures the need to prioritize scheduling of cases according to urgency and need for hospitalization will continue ideally preprocedure testing of patients will be performed outside of the preoperative assessment areas to facilitate appropriate preservation of ppe preferably registration pre- and postprocedural areas and ep laboratories should ideally be in near proximity to minimize exposure during transport appropriate staffing and reorientation of redeployed staff to new and old processes is important and case scheduling escalation increasing the caseload should be implemented gradually to allow time for assessment of impact on covid-19 positivity and transmission of note changes in use of ppe and other related precautions may increase procedure times adequate hcw staffing should be anticipated to accommodate a covid-19 surge should a second wave occurmany physician practices have shifted to telehealth platforms to communicate with their patients and provide medical care informing patients of the organizational processes instituted for minimizing exposure to covid-19 and the facilitys preparedness for restarting elective cases can help to allay patients fears on coming into hospital or clinic facilities honest and open communication about infection mitigation strategies available testing options and specific institutional plans can help the patient to decide whether to proceed with an elective procedureshared decision-making concerning the risks and benefits of moving forward with procedural options versus continuing noninvasive approaches is critical shared decision-making should ideally be documented in the electronic medical records scheduling decisions are more complex as they not only involve the provider and patient but also public health considerations if the procedure is being considered in a high or medium prevalence region figure 3 an elective procedure may be delayed longer even if the patient and provider usual shared decision participants would like to proceedonce a conversation is completed and the patient agrees to proceed written instruction on preprocedural care notes location of preanesthesiacovid-19 testing and details of periprocedural care can be helpful to send to the patient policies may continue to limit the number of family members who can accompany the patient accordingly appropriate arrangements will be required for drop off and pick up of the patient avoiding areas with known covid-19positive patients timely updates on patient condition and procedural status can be facilitated by a dedicated patient navigator or communicator who can be readily accessible for family members to call written instructions of routine procedural care and covid-19 prevention strategies are helpfulthe suspension of elective cases due to covid-19 has resulted in an accumulation of deferred ep procedures the ethical values used to prioritize procedures need to balance public health societal concerns with the commitment to the individual patient for example the risks of postponing a procedure in an individual should be fully weighed against the risk of further covid-19 spread transparency and communication regarding scheduling decisions are essential for patient and community trust for covid-19positive patients nonemergent cases should be delayed until recovery or a change in the patients condition warrants reconsiderationprocedure prioritization is essential and contingent upon facility capacity and the nature of deferred procedures as well as regional or local policy and restrictions all emergent or urgent procedures should take precedence followed by semi-urgent or time-sensitive procedures followed by elective procedures1 the triaging of these procedure categories will vary with geographic and temporal variations in covid-19 burden figure 4
 the ultimate decision regarding the time sensitivity of a procedure is based on clinical judgment and individual patient factors for many tertiary referral institutions communication to other hospitals and referring physicians about availability will be vital to ensure that all patients are prioritized according to medical need prioritizing inpatient procedures may minimize the need to reschedule later visits while reducing exposure and testing inpatient procedures will require similar preprocedural covid-19 testing according to local policies other considerations include the availability of the anesthesia team whose personnel may have been repurposed to covering icus to care for sick covid-19 patients case type and how further delay might impact patient outcomes how long patients have already been waiting and procedure risk given how this might impact bed or resource needs if complications result in prolonged hospitalization or icu stays one should ensure appropriate follow-up to assure there is no further deterioration of clinical status attention to local state and federal orders should also be considered as some geographies may have ongoing restrictions limiting the scheduling of elective procedures and surgeries in addition some hospitals may require physician attestation about medical necessity for a time-sensitive procedurecovid-19 has successfully moved many clinical practices to adopt digital telehealth platforms into care pathways to minimize patient exposure this model though initially cumbersome has proved to be a useful means of providing continued care for our patients similarly remote monitoring has continued to be a valuable resource for patients with cieds reestablishment of in-person visits will vary with geographic and temporal variation of viral incidence use of ppe for patient-facing outpatient clinic visits should continue per cdc and local authority guidelines clinic areas should be configured to comply with regional social distancing directivesin regions with high covid-19 burden in-person clinic visits may still need to be minimized using telehealth options the majority of incision-site inspections following cied implantation or catheter ablation can be managed via telehealth by inspecting the site utilizing a video conference or asking the patient to send a picture via secure email often in conjunction with a few simple questions similarly many of the clinic follow-ups and some new consults can be performed via telehealth leveraging electronic medical record data and obtaining vital signs and electrocardiography ecg tracings using digital wearables where available as the number of app-based technologies evolves they will continue to be an integral part of telehealth examples of low-risk patients for whom in-person visits could be deferred include asymptomatic patients with satisfactory cied battery longevity and primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd patients without symptoms suggesting worsening of heart failure or arrhythmia burden patients on antiarrhythmic drugs such as dofetilide that require qtc and laboratory monitoring may need to defer testing if prior values and their clinical condition have remained stable and if no new drugs that may prolong the qtc have been added in addition remote monitoring may offer a valuable supplement or perhaps short-term alternative to ecg in some situations where qtc and clinical condition have remained previously stable patients with borderline values may need continued access to ecg and laboratory testing some studies have evaluated the use of mobile ecg devices for qtc monitoring16

17 as the pandemic eases exceptions to use of less secure platforms may change practitioners are advised to remain up to date on current reimbursement and documentation requirementsother urgent or semi-urgent clinical indications can be evaluated in person on an individualized basis these might include patients with worsening heart failure associated with an uncontrolled arrhythmia significant arrhythmia symptoms a need for device reprogramming icd patients with recent shocks or syncope or cied patients with recent symptoms suggesting possible device malfunction eg syncope or heart failure exacerbation or suspected device infection select patient populations such as vulnerable infants and children with arrhythmias may also warrant in-person evaluation when possible in-person visits and procedures should be coordinated on the same day to minimize multiple exposures for the patient patients presenting for outpatient visits and hcws should be masked and measures should be taken to screen for concerning symptoms eg fever cough practitioners should be aware that covid-19 may present with atypical symptoms including diarrhea anorexia anosmia and multisystem inflammatory disease consisting of but not limited to a rash lymphadenopathy swelling of hands and feet and mucus membrane changes which have been seen in children and adolescents18 19 20 21 if suggestive symptoms or a fever are present patients should be redirected to an appropriate screening clinic or facility with appropriate measures taken including testing for covid-19 or clinics should follow local policies figure 2depending on the regional stage of the pandemic local hospital and departmental guidance may vary in regions with continuing concern for pandemic spread in order to minimize exposure of ep staff and device manufacturer representatives to patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection it is prudent to consider limiting in-person cied interrogations to the following indicationsclinically actionable suspected cied abnormalityneed for reprogrammingevaluation of potential arrhythmic symptoms or alerts in patients without access to remote monitoring
potential strategies to maintain social distancing include reconfiguring waiting areas andor notifying patients when it is time for them to be seen importantly device interrogation programmers cables and wands should be disinfected between all patients plastic sleeves to cover the cable and wand may also be considered it may be helpful to inform patients of the disinfecting procedures being systematically performed between visitsa current expert consensus statement gives remote monitoring a class i recommendation for routine use in patients with cieds22 based on multiple studies demonstrating reduction of unnecessary icd therapies and mortality22 23 24 25 despite its effectiveness prior to the pandemic remote monitoring was significantly underutilized due to a variety of patient- and system-based issues23 during the pandemic use of remote monitoring is even more important and should be used in most circumstances to reduce the need for nonurgent clinic visits when feasible remote monitoring should be reconsidered in patients who are currently not enrolledquality improvement programs and care pathways can help to standardize and support safe high-quality high-value patient care risk-adjusted data can be used to evaluate patient care outcomes based on principles discussed an example of a stepwise care pathway is summarized as follows figure 5

all appropriate covid-19 precautions should be followedunnecessary exposure of the patient to the clinic or hospital environment can be minimized by carefully prioritizing the problem and utilizing telehealth platforms wherever necessarythe patients comorbidity profile should be assessed in the event that there is a potential procedural complication and the remote possibility that the patient may acquire covid-19 infection during the periprocedural periodappropriate patient education should be provided potentially through web resources with thorough orientation to the health care environment and review of the patients clinical situation greater transparency will help the patient understand the risks benefits and alternatives to the planned interventionduring outpatient clinic visits universal masking and social distancing which may require blocking off or rearranging waiting or exam room seating andor limiting the number of family members accompanying the patient to a maximum of one or per local policy should continue engaging other family members via telehealth video options while the patient is seeing the clinician in consultation is a way to involve them in the process

after a decision to intervene has been made prior authorization should be completed as necessary in some hospitals or states attestation to the necessity of the procedure during the covid-19 pandemic may be necessaryformulation of guidance for when previously obtained laboratory testing diagnostic imaging history and physical and consent can be utilized is helpful to determine whether these need to be repeated for rescheduled procedures that were previously deferredavoidance of elective interventions on covid-19positive patients persons under investigation puis or patients with a high comorbidity profile should be considereduse of telehealth or consolidation of preoperative assessment to the same day of the procedure in the preoperative area can help minimize patient exposure if there is no significant change in patients clinical statuspreoperative covid-19 testing should be performed within 1272 hours before the procedure when feasible patients should be advised to maintain isolation between the time of testing and the planned procedure for emergent procedures when rapid testing is not feasible patients should be treated as pui with use of appropriate ppe all of the preoperative testing should be consolidated as much as feasible determining the pathway for follow-up and reporting of results to the patient and procedure team is important along with standardized recommendations for patients who test positive for covid-19limiting or minimizing companions in procedure facilities may still be required initial limitations to zero accompanying companions may be able to be relaxed to one or minimal family members or friends later in the evolution of the covid-19 pandemic telehealth digital platforms can be used to communicate with and update the patients family a patient navigator is an excellent resource providing a single point of contact active discharge planning ahead of time can facilitate arrangements for resources needed after the procedure

ppe use should follow cdc or hospital guidelines similar to rules earlier in the covid-19 pandemiceach procedure patient is a pui unless tested otherwisethe number of personnel that are in contact with the patient should be minimized if possible especially for covid-19positive patients or puisanesthesiology and ep care teams should take appropriate aerosolairbornedroplet precautions patients can be extubated in the laboratory and then transported to the recovery areasmoke evacuators may be considered for procedures using electrocautery in covid-19positive patients

if available recovery in a perioperative unit that is close to the ep laboratories can minimize patient transport and recovery within a relatively covid-19 safe environment minimizing their exposure to other patients or hospital personnel who are not involved in their carewhen possible same-day discharge should be considered if patients need to be monitored overnight they could potentially stay in the same room and be discharged the next day if possible to minimize contactperiodic viral pcr or serologic testing may become routine for health care workers in these periprocedure areas including the housekeeping and dietary staffprohibiting or minimizing family members or accompanying persons in the recovery area can reduce unnecessary exposure exceptions may be considered for minors or adults with special needs patients can be transported to a pick-up area where the discharging staff member or the patient coordinator can meet the caretaker to review the discharge instructionspatient needs and the potential for delayed complications should be anticipated and appropriate standard of care testing eg chest x-rays device checks echocardiograms if needed should be performed before discharge especially for same-day dischargesppe use should be per guidelines

maintaining social distancing and universal masking remain important for patientspatients should be educated and reminded about the importance of avoiding covid-19 exposure and infection during the recovery phasethere should be a single easy mechanism through which patients can get in touch with their ep care team to address any postprocedural concernsincision checks device checks and even post-ablation follow-up in most cases can be performed using telehealth platforms
when possible an ep covid-19 working group representing the stakeholders involved in the ep care continuum pathway can coordinate with institutional or hospital-level covid-19 leadership the group may include an electrophysiologist ep laboratory manager outpatient clinic manager ep nurse advanced practice providers device technician anesthesiologist and imaging team to provide insights into various aspects of the workflow this team can clarify interpret iterate and disseminate policies and also provide the necessary operational support to plan and successfully execute the reboot process as the efforts to contain covid-19 continue effective communication with the rest of the ep team the extended cardiology team and other relevant clinical and hospitalhealth care system teams is essential a logical and methodical approach to easing the restrictions and slowly revamping work without causing major disruptions to the work done by other care teams is extremely important coordination with other hospital covid-19 teams developing similar pathways would be synergistic regularly scheduled appraisals of the process and adjustments should be made to fit the needs of the facility and the care teams decisions should be data driven transparency and data sharing with other teams should be encouraged so that all teams and patients benefit from the collective experiences establishing institutional programs to assess successes and failures so that consistent progress occurs is advantageous institutional teams should take a lead in understanding and implementing regulatory body policies new information on testing changes in ppe guidance patient waitlists insurance and prior authorization issues and implementation of periodic and timely communications with the patients while keeping abreast of the ground situation of covid-19 in the regionthis pandemic is far from being over as the stay-at-home orders are lifted and more people emerge from social isolation or fail to practice masking or social distancing human-to-human spread may surge and there could be second or even recurring waves of the covid-19 pandemic health care teams and hospitals must continue to be prepared and preserve adequate resources for such contingencies appropriate planning for dealing with a second wave should be a mandatory component of the elective reboot plan we will have to learn to create relatively covid-19 safe zones within the hospitals to help isolate patients from second waves and yet be able to provide regular care for noncovid-19 patientscovid-19 has presented health care systems across the globe with novel challenges as ep professionals we need to determine how we can minimize the ravages of living with covid-19 while ensuring that we provide exemplary care to our arrhythmia patients across all age-groups in this document we have tried to provide ep clinicians and institutional administrators with a series of guiding suggestions and principles to move forward as we start the reboot to provide necessary heart rhythm care to our patients which has understandably and appropriately been delayed our main goal as health care professionals whether we serve in a clinical teaching research or administrative role is to do everything we can to create a safe environment for our patients so that they receive the excellent care they deserve
the harris county medical society hcms and the houston academy of medicine ham has named dr richard allen williams winner of the john p mcgovern compleat physician award at a ceremony on january 17 2020 dr williams is the first african american recipient of the award 1the john p mcgovern compleat physician award is an annual national award named after its first recipient john p mcgovern it recognizes the physician who embodies the ideals of sir william oslermedical excellence humane and ethical care commitment to medical humanities and writing research and harmony between the academic and medical practitioner dr williams commitment to excellence is demonstrated by his continued contributions to the field of cardiology excelling as a clinician in his 50 years of medical practice 2there has been a lot of discussion about african americans not being acknowledged for their achievements this is true not only in the black community but among foreigners international medical graduates women and other minority groupshistorically there has been a difference in cardiovascular disease cvd burden among racialethnic groups in the usa one in every four deaths in the usa is caused by cvd in other words one person dies every 37 s 3 in 2015 235 of african americans died from heart disease 239 are male and 231 are female in 2017 heart disease at 242 was the leading cause of death in men of all ages and in all races and origins 4 heart disease at 218 was also the leading cause of death in women of all races and origins 5 the best predictors of cvd are age gender dyslipidemia hypertension and diabetes these risk factors are strongly influenced by lifestyle dietary behaviors physical inactivity smoking and adiposity although genetic variation plays a role in susceptibility it cannot account solely for the difference in racialethnic health disparities 6in laymans terms hypertension is high blood pressure which increases the risk for heart disease and stroke by causing permanent damage to the heart even without having any symptoms 7 unfortunately hypertension is more prevalent and develops at a younger age in african americans than whites or hispanics 8 furthermore african americans are more likely to have diabetes than non-hispanic whites 7in 2018 179 of the american population was covered by medicaid 9 meanwhile 34 of african americans were supported by medicaid compared to 32 hispanics and 15 whites 10 the usa spent 219 billion from 2014 to 2015 on heart disease alone this includes the cost of healthcare services medicines and lost productivity due to death 3dr williams founded the association of black cardiologists abc in 1974 to address the inequities in cardiovascular care between blacks and whites he served as abc president for 10 years 11 he set out to form the organization because of the fact that blacks were being misunderstood by whites in medicine dr williams said in an essay he wrote for the 60th reunion of harvard class 1957 in the essay he revealed that there were articles in peer-reviewed medical journals stating that black patients did not experience chest pain as whites did because blacks lack the intellectual capacity to perceive pain 12dr williams started abc along with 17 other dedicated medical professionals since its inception abcs membership has grown to 1800 carrying forward the abc 18 mission to bring special attention to the adverse impact of cardiovascular disease on african americans and close the healthcare disparity gap through the years policy makers have looked to the abc as the leading authority on issues that impact the practice of and access to cardiovascular care in all populations 13abc members have published 100 studies and op-ed articlesbetween 2016 and the presenton the treatment of black patients 14 in one study achieving health equity by normalizing cardiac care pegus et al compared the rates of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca for acute myocardial infarction ami and for intermediate coronary syndrome ics and the rates of transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in white population versus black population covered by equivalent insurance while blacks have similar prevalence rates for ami and ics they experience lower rates of ptca by 46 compared with whites the same study found that black patients receive fewer evidenced-based cardiac procedural care than white patients the authors concluded that normalizing procedure rates in the african american community to match their disease prevalence will require education and participation from patients providers insurers and advocacy organizations the study not only stressed the importance of identifying factors that contribute to health disparities it recommended the application of science-based care one solution to help normalize procedure rates and decrease disparities is by providing cardiovascular registries that link to health insurance claims and electronic medical record emr data this can provide transparent information about treatment cost for various racialethnic groups enhance treatment communication and recommendation and improve the consistency of appropriate cardiovascular procedures among patient groups 15research suggests that minority patients are more likely to follow healthcare recommendations provided by healthcare workers of the same race with this in mind abc aims to improve diversity of the health workforce via support of federal legislative efforts such as the health equity and accountability act of 2016 13dr williams believes in the importance of diversity considerations in healthcare and the non-biased treatment of people or communities because of their dissimilar status a great deal of the poor and underserved communities is made up of african americans representing the disenfranchised population who do not receive good healthcare as a result of poor quality care in cardiology african americans have worsened in morbidity or disease and could face early mortality or death 16the abcs mission is to eliminate cardiovascular disparities through education research and advocacy its website httpwwwabc-patientcom offers free digital health guides such as 7 steps to a healthy heart acute coronary syndrome stroke and heart attack prevention and cooking for your heart and soul featuring recipes good for the heart available for purchase when in stock is a 40-min video before you eat the church food watch this video it details how unhealthy foods and sedentary lifestyles contribute to obesity and diabetes that fuel heart disease numbers 17let us discuss racial disparities in pain assessment and treatmentquestion is a black persons skin thicker than a white persons skin in a perfect world free of bias we would all reply no the perception or treatment of pain in blacks and whites is equal in the real world past or present this is a rarity a 2016 study conducted by hoffman et al demonstrates that there are beliefs held by laymen and those with some exposure to medical training medical students and residents about biological differences between blacks and whites that contribute to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment false beliefs dating back to the time of slavery such as the idea that blacks feel less pain than whites continue to be held by many folks today the consequence is inaccurate pain assessment and inadequate pain treatment of african americans this study is the first to provide evidence that racial bias in pain perception is associated with racial bias in pain treatment recommendations 18sadly racial disparities are apparent in the midst of covid-19 pandemic the novel coronavirus is infecting and killing people all over the world as of april 5 2020 there are a total of 7616 deaths and 304826 cases of covid-19 in the usa according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 19 the coronavirus does not discriminate but can the same be said for physicians and healthcare workers on the front linesan article published on april 2 2020 on the npr website reported that african americans with symptoms of cough and fever were less likely to be tested for coronavirus citing bio-tech data firm rubix life sciences reviews on recent billing information in several states this is especially detrimental to the african americans as they are a racial minority group with higher rates of certain diseases such as diabetes high blood pressure and kidney disease any delay in the possible diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 is harmful and puts them at greater risk of death because chronic illnesses can lead to more severe cases of covid-19 on top of hypertension coronary artery disease heart failure and myocardial injury are risk factors associated with worse outcomes 20 dr james hildreth president of meharry medical college and an infectious disease specialist shared his observations with npr he said he has not witnessed overt bias among healthcare workers but the distribution of testing sites shows a disparity in access to medical care that has long persisted 21the definition of healthcare disparity is not simply defined by the difference in health outcomes based on race or ethnicity rather it circumferences all attributable variables that lead to disproportionate access to care the social determinants of health relevant to the current pandemic include limited job and social mobility working frontline jobs lack of adequate protective equipment living in crowded housing eating only food desserts without healthy foods being uninsured and relying on public transportation 22 the widening health status gap is largely determined by race clyde w yancy md in his article covid-19 and african americans referenced the johns hopkins university and american community survey which showed that out of 131 predominant black counties in the usa the infection rate is 1375100000 and the death rate is 63100000 this indicated an infection rate threefold higher and a death rate sixfold higher than that in predominantly white counties 20 for example in new york black people comprise 28 of covid-19 deaths despite representing 22 of the population while white people accounted for 27 of deaths although they represent 32 of the population 22 we know the most effective strategy to reduce covid-19 infection is social distancing and self-quarantine being able to maintain socialphysical distancing has become an issue of privilege much of the african american community resides in poor areas where there is simply an inability to practice social distancing 20 patient choice and responsibility play an essential role as well patients of minority communities present themselves with late self-referral due to distrust health beliefs and disease fatalism 22
of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most inhumane martin luther king jr
the important and comprehensively researched book an american health dilemma a medical history of african americans and the problem of race beginnings to 1900 explores the origin and history of medicine in relation to intellectual and scientific racism suffered by african americans it starts from the time of the slave trade and traces the evolution of racial attitudes and healthcare practices through the civil war and jim crow laws to present day the authors w michael byrd md and linda a clayton md both physicians and senior research scientists at the harvard school of public health also present current statistics on racial disparities in american healthcare as a preface to an extensive and documented history of healthcare by and for blackshistorically african american physicians are not given the recognition they deserve not because they do not do quality work but because of racial disparity this was the theme of dr williams acceptance speech at the john p mcgovern award ceremony he understood the significance of being the first black physician to receive the award it indicates progress in areas of diversity inclusion and equity it is a sign of change for the better that would have made sir william osler the father of modern medicine prouddr williams is now one of the superstars of medicine in the same league as two trailblazing cardiovascular surgeons dr michael debakey and dr denton cooley 23 dr debakey was a pioneer in coronary bypass operations 24 dr cooley performed the first successful human heart transplant in the usa 18if you do not give rewards or honors to the people that are deserving based on race gender culture age education then the john p mcgovern physician award loses its value dr williams said in his speech at the award ceremony he also knew the value of building strong effective relationships throughout the healthcare communityrahn kennedy bailey md fapa assistant dean of clinical education at charles r drew university school of medicine and chief medical officer cmo of the kedren hospital system attended dr williams award ceremony in houston tx on january 17 2020dr bailey has been a mentee of dr williams for more than a decade now when we think of a mentor and mentee we automatically think of an older wiser person helping a younger person kick-start his or her career dr williams did more than this he valued the concept of mentorship and tried to help everyone no matter what age race and gender his focus was and always will be on justice and equity in healthcare delivery 24despite his many accomplishments dr williams refuses to rest on his laurels he wants to address the cultural divide on race and ethnicity in healthcare i want to do something to get rid of it and not focus on calling names i think we can get more accomplished in this way i am all about solidarity unity and working together as long as people have the same aims he stated in the august 23 2019 issue of cardiology magazine 25racism whether conscious or unconscious has been pervasive in our society since the days of slavery i feel that is responsible for the health care disparities that we now suffer he says it has been extremely difficult to erase those disparities to do that there has to be specific intent on the part of government and all of our citizens and it has not been the case 25the term comorbidity refers to the coexistence of multiple diseases or disorders in relation to a primary disease or disorder in an individual
1 a comorbidity relationship between two diseases exists whenever they appear simultaneously in a patient more than chance alone
2 it represents the cooccurrence of diseases or presence of different medical conditions one after another in the same patient
1 3 some diseases or infections can coexist in an individual by coincidence and there is no pathological association among them however in most of the cases multiple diseases acute or chronic events occur together in a patient because of the associations among them these comorbidity associations can be due to direct or indirect causal relationships and the shared risk factors among diseases
4 for an instance a type of genetic abnormality linked to cancer is more common in patient of type 2 diabetes than other people
5 examples of comorbidity studies are many often referring to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd
6 7 obesity
8 mental disorders
9 immune-related diseases
10 cancer
11 etccomorbidity can be attributed to the disease connections on the molecular level such as dysregulated genes ppis proteinprotein interactions and metabolic pathways as potential causes of comorbidity
1 3 12 13 from a genetic perspective a pair of diseases is connected because they have both been associated with the same dysregulated genes
14 15 whereas from a proteomics perspective phenotypically similar diseases are related via biological modules such as ppis or molecular pathways
16 17population-based disease association is important in conjunction with molecular and genetic data to uncover the molecular origins of diseases and disease comorbidities patient medical records contain important clarification regarding the co-occurrences of diseases affecting the same patient
2 during the last few years several researchers have been conducted the disease comorbidity analysis to understand the origins of many diseases
1 12 18 goh cusick valle childs vidal barabasi et al and feldman rzhetsky vitkup et al built networks of gene-disease associations by connecting diseases that have been associated with the same genes
14 15 whereas lee park kay christakis oltvai and barabsi et al constructed a network in which two diseases are linked if metabolic reactions are associated between them
13 disease association studies from proteomic point of view have been studied by rual venkatesan hao hirozane-kishikawa dricot li berriz gibbons dreze ayivi-guedehoussou et al and stelzl worm lalowski haenig brembeck goehler stroedicke zenkner schoenherr koeppen et al
19 20 rzhetsky wajngurt park and zheng et al inferred the comorbidity links between 161 disorders from the disease history of 15 million patients
12 however all of these efforts have focused on the role of a single molecular or phenotypic measure to capture diseasedisease relationships in our work we have used diseasegene associations ppis molecular pathways and clinical information to obtain statistically significant associations and comorbidity risks among diseasesinflammation is a hallmark of many serious human infectious diseases associated to a wide variety of infections such as hiv-1
21 uk doctor max pemberton says id rather have hiv than diabetes as life expectancy among diabetes patients is lower than that of hiv
22 however hiv has a comorbidity impact on the diabetes also the flu can cause complications including bacterial pneumonia or the worsening of chronic health problems asthma is the most common comorbidity in patients hospitalized for swine influenza h1n1 infection
23 dengue can cause myocardial impairment arrhythmias and occasionally fulminant myocarditis
24 chronic medical conditions such as heart disease lung disease diabetes renal disease rheumatologic disease dementia and stroke are risk factors for influenza complications
25 common chronic infections such as periodontitis or infection with helicobacter pylori may also increase stroke risk
26 moreover the severity of pneumonia in patients coinfected with influenza virus and bacteria is significantly higher than in those infected with bacteria alone the incidence of flu is higher in children and younger adults than in older individuals but influenza-associated morbidity and mortality increase with age especially for individuals with underlying medical conditions such as chronic cardiovascular diseases
27 during the ageing process the immune system becomes compromised and it causes an increasing inflammation
28 in particular chronic inflammation inflammageing and metabolic function are strongly affected by the ageing process
29 the ageing of populations is leading to an unprecedented increase different diseases like cancer and fatalities it is reported that 80 of the elderly population has three or more chronic conditions
30on the other hand respiratory viruses are an emerging threat to global health security and have led to worldwide epidemics with substantial morbidity and mortality
31 coronaviruses covs cause respiratory and enteric diseases in human and other animals that induce fatal respiratory gastrointestinal and neurological disease severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is an epidemic human disease is caused by a coronavirus cov called sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov
32 sars patients may present with a spectrum of disease severity ranging from flu-like symptoms and viral pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death
33 most of the deaths were attributed to complications related to sepsis ards and multiorgan failure which occurred commonly in the elderly for comorbidities
34 age and comorbidity eg diabetes mellitus heart disease were consistently found to be significant independent predictors of various adverse outcomes in sars
35 children with sars have better prognosis than adults
34 advanced age and comorbidities were significantly associated with increased risk of sars-cov related death due to acute respiratory distress syndrome
35 mild degree of anaemia is common in the sars infected patients and patients who have recovered from sars show symptoms of psychological trauma
34 another novel coronavirus mers-cov which is a new threat for public health has similar clinical characteristics to sars-cov but the comorbidity is the key aspect to underline their different impacts
36 37 mers-cov causes respiratory infections of varying severity and sometimes fatal infections in humans including kidney failure and severe acute pneumonia
38 despite sharing some clinical similarities with sars eg fever cough incubation period there are also some important differences such as the rapid progression to respiratory failure which we have studied on comorbidities point of viewinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 hiv and the resulting acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids affects cellular immune regulation
39 hiv infection severely impacts on the immune system causing phenotypic changes in peripheral cells and dysregulates the innate immune system
40 significant number of hiv-1 infected patients exhibits osteopenia and osteoporosis leading to higher incidence to develop weak and fragile bones during the course of disease
41 hiv has also been associated with an increased risk of developing both diabetes and cardiovascular disease
42 infection with hiv weakens the immune system and reduces the bodys ability to fight infections that may lead to cancer
43 44 people infected with human immunodeficiency virus hiv have a higher risk of some types of cancer kaposi sarcoma non-hodgkin lymphoma cervical cancer anal liver lung cancer and hodgkin lymphoma than uninfected people
45 many people infected with hiv are also infected with other viruses that cause certain cancers
46 47 hiv infection even when controlled by highly active antiretroviral therapy haart is being linked to chronic inflammation
48 people with hiv-1 infection appear to have a markedly higher rate of chronic kidney disease than the general public
49 it is because some of the risk factors associated with hiv-1 acquisition are the same as those that lead to kidney disease because of the virus itself and some therapies eg haart therapy antiretroviral therapy for hiv may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome abdominal obesity hyperglycaemia dyslipidaemia and hypertension and thus predispose to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease many of the biologic factors thought to be causally associated with inflammation in hiv disease are also thought to be causally associated with the inflammation of ageing
50infections acute and chronic conditions are often associated to comorbidity that increases the risk of medical conditions which can lead to further morbidity and mortality comorbidities related to flu have been recently investigated
51 comorbidities for tuberculosis have also been studied recently
52 53 to understand the overall mechanism we have studied the comorbidity associations of sars and hiv infections both hiv and sars are emerging infectious diseases in the modern world each of these diseases has caused global societal and economic impact related to unexpected illnesses and deaths
54 sras is a significant public health threat and hiv is a long term chronic infection since these two infections are associated with high mortality rates and there are no clinically approved antiviral treatments or vaccines available for either of these infections we have selected these two infections for our study centred on the sars and hiv-1 infections we have investigated highly heterogeneous disease comorbidity networks using the diseasegene associations ppi subnetwork molecular pathways and clinical informationwe have presented a systematic and quantitative approach to discover human disease comorbidities using different sources of available mrna expression protein-protein interactions signalling pathways diseasegene associations diseasedisease associations and diseasedrug associations data it has been shown that sars coronavirus infects and replicates in a wide variety of host cells in susceptible animals and human beings
55 56 to understand the host response to this pathogen we analysed the gene expression patterns of sars infected patients compared to normal subjects using oligo-nucleotide microarrays from the ncbi geo 
httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgeoqueryacccgiaccgse1739
55 we analysed the microarray gene expression data of over 8700 genes from the pbmcs of 10 sars patients and compared with healthy control samples we found that 274 genes p  001  15 fold change were differentially expressed as compared to healthy controls in which 120 genes were significantly up regulated and 154 genes were significantly down regulated see additional file
1 table s1on the other hand monocytes are the key immune responsive cells whose function is adversely impacted by hiv-1 hiv-1 infection radically alters the monocyte phenotype which is reflected in an hiv-1 induced gene expression analysis monocyte gene expression microarray data were collected for control and hiv patients from the ncbi geo 
httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgeoqueryacccgiaccgse18464
57 to find out the significant dysregulated genes during the hiv-1 infection we have performed global gene expression analysis we found that 186 genes p  001  15 fold change were differentially expressed as compared to healthy controls in which 71 genes were up regulated and 115 genes were down regulated see additional file
2 table s2considering the significantly dysregulated genes of sars 274 genes and hiv-1 186 genes infections and gene-disease associations information we have constructed two gene-disease associations networks gdn which are used to explore the shared genetic associations and disease comorbidity starting from the bipartite graph we generated biologically relevant network projections and constructed multi-relational gene-disease network in which nodes are diseases or genes and edges indicate association between gene and disease this bipartite graph consists of two disjoint sets of nodes where one set corresponds to all known genetic disorders and the other set corresponds to all of our identified significant genes for sars and hiv-1 infections the list of disorders disease genes and associations between them were obtained from the online mendelian inheritance in man omim
58 a compendium of human disease genes and phenotypes see details in the methods section we classified each disorder into one of 21 disorder categories based on the physiological system affected as introduced in goh cusick valle childs vidal barabasi et al
14in the gdn nodes represent diseases class or genes and two disorders are connected to each other if they share at least one gene in which mutations are associated with both diseases groups figures
1 and
2 the number of interlinked genes between sars infection and other diseases indicates that immunological hematological neurological metabolic and dermatological diseases categories are strongly associated with the sars infection see figure

3 table s3 few genes are also shared between more than 2 categories of diseases ie those disease groups are also associated through at least that genes for an instance the gene atm shared among sars infection cancer and immunological diseases therefore cancer and immunological diseases are also interrelated through the gene atm among all these disease classes immunological diseases class is tightly correlated with the sars infection due to the highest number of genes 12 genes shared between them on the other hand the number of associated genes between hiv infection and other diseases indicates that neurological metabolic cancer and hematological diseases categories are strongly correlated with the hiv infection see figure
2 and additional file
4 table s4 few hiv dysregulated genes are also shared between more than 2 categories of diseases such as the gene tgfb1 is shared among hiv infection cancer and skeletal diseases it is notable that 11 significant genes 4 upregulated and 7 downregulated are similarly dysregulated in the both sars and hiv infectionsto observe the association of sars and hiv infections with other 7 important diseases chronic heart failure kidney disorders breast cancer parkinson osteoporosis type 1 and type 2 diabetes we have collected mrna microarray raw data associated with each disease from the gene expression omnibus 
httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgeo accession numbers are gse9006 gse9128 gse15072 gse7158 gse8977 and gse7621
59 after several steps of statistical analysis we have selected the most significant over and under expressed genes for each infection and disease we also performed cross compare analysis to find the common significant genes between each disease and sars hiv-1 infection we observed that sars infection shares 21 12 16 5 11 11 11 and 13 genes corresponding to the chronic heart failure kidney disorders breast cancer parkinson osteoporosis hiv-1 infection type 1 and type 2 diabetes on the other hand hiv-1 infection shares 11 10 17 9 7 11 9 and 7 genes corresponding to the chronic heart failure kidney disorders breast cancer parkinson osteoporosis sars infection type 1 and type 2 diabetes then we built diseasedisease relationships network for sars and hiv-1 infection with other diseases see figures

5 table s5 and additional file
6 table s6 since genes do not function alone and they coordinate their activities in the form of complexes or molecular pathways therefore two diseases are potentially intercorrelated to each other if they share at least one commonly associated pathway for this reason we have used reactome pathway database
60 and selected the pathways related to these 7 diseases as well as sars and hiv-1 infections we have observed that diseases and infections shared pathways between them as shown in figures
3 a and b and additional file
5 table s5 and additional file
6 table s6dysregulation in a protein subnetwork may yield the dysfunction of multiple protein subnetworks therefore multiple diseases may be caused by the malfunction of a protein complex so two diseases are potentially related to each other if they share one or more commonly associated protein subnetwork to identify the association between diseases based on the ppi subnetwork we used significantly associated disease protein pairs data from the hprd data base
61 to find statistically significant associations among diseases we built disease networks centred on the sars and hiv infections in which two diseases are comorbid if there exists one or more protein subnetwork that are associated with both diseases the disease similarity network and the protein-protein interaction network are integrated systematically and comprehensively in a simple and compact manner to formulate the disease comorbidity for the sars and hiv-1 infections as shown in figures
4 and
5 we showed that sars and hiv infections shared ppi subnetworks with the other 7 diseases or infections similar to the gene-disease and pathway-disease associations as shown in figures
4 and
5based on the gene expression protein-protein interaction and molecular pathways data we have found that both sars and hiv-1 infections have a strong association with other 8 diseases or infections chronic heart failure kidney disorders breast cancer parkinson osteoporosis hivsars infection type 1 and type 2 diabetes these diseases and infections are also strongly correlated among them we present the correlation strength and distance between a pair of these diseases and infections in figure
6 we show that some diseases such as kidney disorders breast cancer osteoporosis and heart failure are more associated with the sars infection see figure
6 kidney disorder is also tightly connected with the hiv-1 infection the probability of occurring comorbidities between the more tightly connected diseases is more than that of othersit is notable that the patient medical records contain important evidence regarding the co-occurrences of diseases affecting the same patient so we constructed a phenotypic disease comorbidity network using 32 million medical records of 13039018 patients data from medpar and analysed its structural properties to better understand the connections among diseases and infections nodes are unique diseases and edges indicate co-morbidity of the diseases we included edges between disease pairs for which the co-occurrence is significantly greater than the random expectation based on population prevalence of the diseases as pointed out in
2 the relative risk rrij overestimates relations involving rare infections and diseases and underestimates relationships between very common disorders or infections on the other hand -correlation underestimates comorbidity between rare and frequent diseases and discriminates associations between disorders of similar appearances thus we built a network by selecting only the statistically significant network edges having rrij  20 and ij  006 figure
7 summarises the set of all comorbidity associations among all diseases expressed in the study population by constructing a phenotypic disease network pdn in the pdn nodes are disease phenotypes identified by unique icd-9-cm the international classification of diseases disease codes and links connect phenotypes that show significant comorbidity according to the relative risk rrij  20 and the correlation ij  006 our phenotypic disease network consists of 336 unique diseases nodes and 1018 co-morbidity relationshipssars-associated coronavirus icd-9-cm diagnosis code is 07982 which is under the group of viral and chlamydial infection in conditions classified elsewhere and of unspecified site and icd-9-cm diagnosis code 079 moreover the icd-9-cm code 4803 is for the pneumonia due to sars associated coronavirus so we have considered both icd-9-cm codes 07982 and 4803 for our phenotypic sars comorbidity study in our 3 digit code data we have considered 079 and for 5 digit code data we have considered 4803 considering the relative risk rrij  10 between the disease group 079 and other disorder categories we have constructed the pdn as shown in figure
8a and considering the relative risk rrij  20 between the disease group 4803 and other disorder categories we have constructed the pdn as shown in figure
8b we presented only the most significant relative risk associations see additional file
7 table s7 and additional file
8 table s8the icd-9-cm diagnosis code for the human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection is 042 to 044 which is under the group of infectious and parasitic diseases and icd-9-cm code 001139 so we have considered both 3 digit and 5 digit icd-9-cm codes for our phenotypic comorbidity studies related to hiv infection considering the relative risk rrij  20 between the disease group 042 and other disorder categories we have constructed the pdn as shown in figure
9a and considering the relative risk rrij  100 and -correlation ij  006 between the disease groups under the sub categories of 042 and other disorder categories we have constructed the pdn as shown in figure
9b only the most significant relative risk association is represented see additional file
9 table s9 and additional file
10 table s10to observe the trend of phenotypic relative risk corresponding to the number of shared genes between 2 diseases we have computed the number of shared genes between two diseases and their corresponding phenotypic relative risk of the occurrence of comorbidities as shown in figure
10 we observed that with increasing number of shared biomarker genes between 2 diseases the phenotypic relative risk is also increased we may predict existing diseases of a patient and the prospective disease comorbidities through the identification of highly up and down dysregulated genes so based on the available data we could predict the disease comorbidities and the level of the comorbidities using the regression model as figure
10it is notable that ageing is also a disease not a natural process for which age-related diseases increase exponentially with chronological time so to understand the impact of ageing on the disease comorbidities for sars and hiv infections we have considered the ageing data from the genage database 
httpgenomicssenescenceinfogeneshumanhtml
62 63 after cross comparing our 274 significant genes of sars infection condition and 186 significant genes of hiv-1 infection condition with the 76 ageing related genes it is observed that 4 genes anxa3 hist1h1c rasa3 gns are significantly over expressed in the both sars infection and human ageing process as shown figure
11 and 1 gene hba1 is significantly over expressed and 2 genes tfrc ghitm are significantly under expressed in the both hiv infection and human ageing process as shown figure
12 so from this observation it is recognised that sars and hiv-1 infections are also linked with the ageing process of human through the regulation of distinct genes and pathways on the other hand ageing is directly linked with some other diseases and inflammation including cancers thus sars and hiv infections also make comorbidities with other diseases through the genes related to ageing process so the infection of sars and hiv play multi way comorbidities with different diseaseshuman lung epithelial cells are likely among the first targets to encounter invading severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov
32 thus a comprehensive evaluation of the complex epithelial signalling to sars-cov is crucial to better understand sars pathogenesis since both of the sars-cov and mers-cov infections cause severe lung pathology we compare and contrast the genes expression level of sars-cov infection and mers-cov infection to compare between sars-cov and mers-cov infections and the affect on the disease comorbidities we have performed the time series microarray data analysis for the both types of infections on lung compared to controls we have considered gene expression microarray data from the ncbi geo 
httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgeoqueryacccgiaccgse45042
64 from the analysis of sars-cov vs mock-infected controls treated the same way except without the virus we have found 215 genes are highly significant and from the analysis of mers-cov vs mock we have found 234 gens are highly significant see details in the additional file
11 table s11 and additional file
12 table s12 interestingly only 4 genes nfkbia egr1 ddit31 and ifit2 are common between these two infections see figure
13 however only 2 genes nfkbia and egr1 play an important role and differentially expressed among the both infections in lung and also in sars infected pbmcs then from the hierarchical cluster analysis of the differentially expressed genes of the lung infection by sars-cov and mers-cov we observed distinct groups of genes that were significantly changed over time see additional file
13 figure s1 and additional file
14 figure s2 and additional file
11 table s11 and additional file
12 table s12the log fold changes of the common 4 genes nfkbia egr1 ddit31 and ifit2 expression level for the infection of mers-cov and sars-cov are presented in the figures
14 and
15 we observed that the log fold changes of nfkbia genes expression level is sharply upregulated in the both types of infections corresponding to time point so nfkbia is an important bio-marker for the both mers-cov and sars-cov infections it is also observed that the inflammatory genes nfkbia is a highly over expressed in the both pbmcs and lung cells for the infection of sars and also for the infection of mers in the lung cells see figure
16 indeed the immune system plays a pivotal role in the outbreak of the inflammatory state so in case of sars infection the nfkbia gene plays an important role for the disease comorbiditieson the other hand similar diseases share common genes and could be treated by the same drugs
17 which may allow us to make predictions for new uses of existing drugs for an instance the anti-diabetic drug metformin plays a major protective effect against cancer development and increases significantly higher survival rate of the cancer patients
65 the finding is that the earlier the metformin regimen was initiated the greater the preventive benefit for the cancer patient there is an evidence that the antiviral medication ribavirin does not work in case of sars infection
66 to this end we used connectivity map cmap which is a database of more than 1400 drug transcriptional signatures in several cell lines
67 this database allows to identify of molecules that induce similar or opposite transcriptional changes relative to the query signature based on their connectivity enrichment scores as a query signature we used our 274 highly dysregulated genes for the sars infection we generated the connectivity score value ranges between 1 and -1 where a highly positive score indicates that the drug induces changes similar to those induced by viral infection while a highly negative score indicates that the drug reverses the expression of the sars signature based on the connectivity score we have selected most potential positive and negative regulators of sars viral response see details in the additional file
15 table s13 potential negative regulators indicate that drugs reverse the sars signature gene expression among the negative potential regulator the drug molecule tetracycline zalcitabine gibberellic acid prestwick-642 and sulfaquinoxaline are more potential for the mcf7 cell line and vorinostat for the hl60 cell line based on the data demonstrate the efficacy of different drug against sars virus can be predicted effective drug treatment for the emergent viruses furthermore immunomodulatory drugs that reduce the excessive host inflammatory response to respiratory viruses have therapeutic benefit to reduce the sars infection as well as disease comorbiditiesextending the concept of subclassifying patient cohorts to the single patient level refers to as personalised medicine during the last few years acceptance level of the personalised medicine is sharply increased as it has been apparent that standard treatment approaches are rarely efficient across the entire patient population advances in high-throughput molecular assay technologies in the fields of genomics proteomics and other omics is increasing the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for personalised treatment as a result declining per-sample cost has given rise to numerous public repositories of biomolecular data in particular the availability of these data sets for many different diseases presents a ripe opportunity to use data-driven approaches to advance our current knowledge of disease relationships in a systematic way the identified disease patterns can then be further investigated with regards to their diagnostic utility or help in predicting novel therapeutic targets medicine will focus on each individual patient it will become intrinsically proactive and will increasingly focus on wellness rather than disease proactive and personalised medicine will bring fundamental changes to healthcare taking carefully targeted preventative or therapeutic action at the earliest indications of risk or disease comorbiditieswe are entering into the genomic era of medicine where a patients geneticgenomic data is becoming important for clinical decision making including disease risk assessment disease diagnosis and subtyping drug therapy and dose selection risk assessment for adverse drug reaction and family planning
73 today multi-scale and complex biomedical data are gathered and analysed to uncover combinations of predictive disease profiles our genome as well as multiple proteomes multiple transcriptomes multiple metabolomes and other personalised data sets obtained at different points in our lives will be readily available at affordable prices for each individual in the near future clinicians will have to consider geneticgenomic implications to patient care throughout their clinical workflow including electronic prescribing of medications therefore for the implementation of the personalised medicine system a model could be developed that will take individual genetic data dysregulated biomarker genes will be identified from this genetic data and disease will be identified from the genedisease association database based on the information of the existing disease the model will predict disease comorbidities using the diseasedisease associations database this will provide us to detect many diseases at the earliest detectable phase even weeks months or maybe years before the symptoms appear and it will afford crucial insights into optimizing of our wellness thus personalised medicine will give fundamental new insights into disease mechanisms and hence will open new opportunities for diagnosis therapy and prevention from the disease comorbiditiesin this study we have considered all available categories of omics and phenotypic data to quantify the sars and hiv-1 infections centred comorbidity associations we have shown that the phenotype disease network pdn has a heterogeneous structure where some diseases are highly connected while others are hardly connected at all our findings showed that disease progression can be represented and studied using network methods offering the potential to enhance our understanding of the origin and evolution of human diseases detecting comorbidity in a large population is of clinical interest due to the fact that it may reveal new information useful for cause of diseases as well as for new treatment strategies this study demonstrates the value of an integrated approach in revealing disease relationships and new opportunities for therapeutic applications so we can say that this kind of approach will be helpful for making evidence-based recommendations about disease comorbidities moreover considering environmental factors such as physiological stress diet ethnic group and gender discriminations are important factors in the comorbidity analysis our network approach could be extended as a comorbidity map by integrating diet exercise and other factors as in
74the gene-disease associations data used in this study were collected from the online mendelian inheritance in man omim database 
httpwwwncbinlmnihgovomim this omim database is the best-curated repository of all known disease genes and their associated disorders
75 76 genotype-phenotype relationships as summarised in the omim database contained more than 5000 human disease-genes associations involving 1500 diseases and 3000 disease associated genes each entry of the omim is composed of four fields the name of the disorder the associated gene symbols its corresponding omim id and the chromosomal location we selected the entries with the 3 tag for which there is strong evidence that at least one mutation is cause of the disorder omim initially focused on monogenic disorders but in recent years has expanded to include complex traits and the associated genetic mutations that confer susceptibility to these common disorders
58 subsequently we classified each disorder into 21 primary disorder classes based on the physiological system affected as introduced in goh cusick valle childs vidal and barabasi et al
14 disorders having distinct multiple clinical features are assigned to the multiple class this classification scheme reflects the phenotypic similarities among diseases in the same class and has been successfully used in the recent studies of systematic disease analysis
77the gene expression data used in this study was obtained from the ncbi gene expression omnibus geo 
httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgeo
59 we have considered 10 different data sets for our analysis accession numbers are gse1739 gse45042 gse17400 gse9006 gse9128 gse15072 gse7158 gse8977 gse18464 and gse7621
32 55 57 64 7882 these data sets contain data from the patients of different age and sex after several rounds of filtering normalization and statistical analysis we had microarrays representing sars mers hiv-1 infections and 7 other human diseases heart failure kidney disorders breast cancer parkinson osteoporosis type 1 and type 2 diabetesthe protein-protein interaction ppi data for human was obtained from the human protein reference database hprd
61 hprd contains the maximum number of ppi data among all publicly available literature-derived databases for human ppi
83 we have used the reactome knowledge base of human biological pathways database for our pathways association analysis
60 for the cross compare analysis between the sars and hiv infections and ageing process we have download ageing data from the human ageing genomic resources 
httpgenomicssenescenceinfodownloadhtml
62 63 they have collected human ageing genes after an extensive review of the literature these genes are commonly dysregulated during the ageing processto test the validity of the proposed disease associations we examined the disease co-occurrence information at the population level we obtained statistically significant pairwise comorbidity associations reconstructed from over 32 million medical records in the us medicare claims database recorded in the icd-9-cm format 
httpwwwicd9datacom which are frequently used for epidemiological and demographic studies and collected from
2 we used medpar records from 1990 to 1993 where the dates and reasons for all hospitalizations were reported in icd-9-cm format and it contains the diagnoses of 13039018 elderly patients each record consists of the date of visit a primary diagnosis and up to 9 secondary diagnosis all diagnoses are specified by icd9 codes of up to 5 digits the first three digits specify the main disease category while the last two are used to give additional information about the disease in total the icd-9-cm classification consists of 657 different categories at the 3 digit level and 16459 categories at the 5 digit level
2to determine whether some existing drug compounds can reverse the sars infection signature we used the publicly available connectivity map cmap database
67 cmap provides associations among genes chemicals and disease or infection conditions it is a collection of genome-wide transcriptional data from cultured human cells treated with 1400 different compoundsthe method of global gene expression analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays has proven to be a sensitive method to develop and refine the molecular determinants of human disorders
55 using this technology we compared the gene expression profiles of sars hiv and other diseases to avoid the problems of comparing microarray data of different platforms and experimental systems we normalized the gene expression data in each microarray sample disease state or control using the z-score transformation zij for each disease gene expression matrix using
 where sd is the standard deviation gij represents the expression value of gene i in sample j this transformation allows for the direct comparison of gene expression values across various microarray samples and diseases to combined more than one data series or experiments for a given disease we employed a linear regression approach to obtain a combined t-test statistic between two conditions data were log2-transformed and we calculated expression level for each gene using a linear regression model  yi  0  1xi where yi is the gene expression value and xi is a disease state disease or control the coefficients 0 and 1 are the parameters of this model and were estimated by least squares the t-test statistic when estimating the value of 1 is the same as the standard t-test statistic between disease and control statestime series microarray gene expression data analysis was divide into two steps pre-processing and identification of statistically significant points by t-test anova and regression analysis to find differently expressed gene profiles in different time points in the first step we pre-processed the experimental data using different statistical methods and finally followed by post less normalization recommended by the golden spike project
84 in the second step we have used a most suitable method masigpro microarray significant profiles to identify differentially expressed genes in time-course microarray experiments which is a two step regression method successfully applied on more than one groups of time-series
85 86 this two steps regression strategy is used to find genes with significant temporal expression changes and significant differences between experimental groups this procedure first adjusts this global model by the least-squared technique to identify differentially expressed genes and selects significant genes applying false discovery rate control procedures then stepwise regression is applied as a variable selection strategy to study differences between experimental groups and statistically significant profiles after finding differentially gene expression profiles among the group of experiments the next step is to cluster them according to their profile similarities the hierarchical clustering and the median gene expression profiles of clusters are performed according to the masigpro package in r
85students unpaired t-test was performed to identify genes that were differentially expressed in patients over normal samples and significant genes were selected a threshold of at least 15 fold change and a p value for the t-tests of less than 001 were chosen in addition a two-way anova with bonferronis post-hoc test was used to establish statistical significance between groups  001 pathways and functional categories were considered as over-represented when fishers exact test p value was  001 for presenting the signalling and interaction pathways of the different significant genes we used cytoscape for data integration and network visualization
87 88 and reactome functional interaction fi cytoscape plugin for knowledge base of human biological pathways and network processes
60for the gene disease association we have considered the neighbourhood based benchmark and topological methods which are better suited to our networks
89 in this case topological refers to methods that rely only on the structure of the network to draw conclusions we construct a gdn from genedisease associations where the node in the network can be either a disease or a gene this network can also be regarded as a bipartite graph diseases are connected when the diseases share at least one significant dysregulated genes let a particular set of human diseases d and a set of human genes g gene-disease associations attempt to find whether gene g  g is associated with disease d  d if gi and gj the sets of significant up and down dysregulated genes associated with diseases i and j respectively then the number of shared dysregulated genes
 associated with both diseases i and j is as follows
1the co-occurrence refers to the number of shared genes in the gdn the common neighbours is the based on the jaccard coefficient method where the edge prediction score for the node pair is as
2where e is the set of all edges the number of shared pathways and protein subnetwork that links between diseases i and j are calculated using the equation 1 and the link prediction score is measured using the equation 2to estimate the correlation starting from disease co-occurrence we need to quantify the strength of disease association for comorbidities by dipicting a distance between two diseases for the analysis of the phenotypic data we used the relative risk rrij as the quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs and checked -correlation ij to measure the robustness of the comorbidity associations the rrij is observing in a pair of diseases i and j affecting the same patient when two diseases co-occur more frequently than expected by chance we will get rrij  1 and ij  0 however rrij and ij are not independent of each other and each carries unique biases that are complementary
1 2 so we used both measures of comorbidity to ensure the robustness of our investigations the rrij allows us to quantify the co-occurrence of disease pairs compared with the random expectation which is calculated as
3where n is the total number of patients in the population pi is the incidencesprevalences of disease i pj is the incidence of disease j and cij is the number of patients that have been diagnosed with both diseases i and j for rrij   1 comorbidity is larger than expected by chance and for rrij  1 comorbidity is smaller than expected by chance to calculate the significance of the relative risk rrij we used the katz baptista azen and pike et al method to estimate confidence intervals
90 according to their estimation the 99 confidence interval for the rrij between two diseases i and j is calculated by lower bounds of the confidence interval lb  rrij  exp-256  ij and upper bounds of the confidence interval ub  rrij  exp256  ij where ij is given by
 disease pairs within the 99 confidence interval are only considered if the lb value is larger than 1 when rrij is larger than 1 or if the ub value is smaller than 1 when rrij is smaller than 1relative risk measure is intrinsically biased towards overestimation of relationships between rare diseases and underestimates the co-morbidity of more frequent diseases
2 this bias can be reduced by introduction of a -correlation measure we can quantify the strength of comorbidities by calculating the correlation coefficient associated with a pair of diseases i and j as
4where cij is the number of patients affected by both diseases n is the total number of patients in the studied population and pi and pj are the morbidity or incidence of the ith and jth diseases respectively the -correlation is the pearsons correlation for the variables which only take 0 or 1 values
91 for ij  0 comorbidity is larger than expected by chance and for ij  0 comorbidity is smaller than expected by chance we can determine the significance of   0 by performing a t-test this consists of calculating t according to the formula
 where n is the number of observations used to calculate to predict the comorbidities considering the primary or index disease we have calculated the conditional relative risk conditional rrij as follows
5for all possible disease pairs i and j for the cases that one index disease i is present k  true or absent k  false then for each pair of diseases we say that i and j are mediated by that index disease if the
 is significantly different higher or lower from
 p  001we have weighted the edges using a mutual information metric which quantifies how much greater the edge relationship is with respect to co-occurrence the mutual information weight between two diseases i and j is defined as
6where cij is the observed co-occurrence and pi and pj are the morbidity or prevalence of the ith and jth diseases respectivelyto compare between sars-cov and mers-cov a gene set enrichment analysis was undertaken using gsea
92 to find out the correlation similarities and distance dissimilarities among the diseases from the integrated analysis of multidimensional data gene expression and protein protein interaction we have applied euclidian distance measurement and metric multi-dimensional scaling mds using majorization
93 mds is a set of methods for discovering hidden structures in multidimensional data based on a proximity matrix derived from variables measured on objects as input entity these distances are mapped on a lower dimensional spatial representation optimization problem is used to find mapping in target dimension of the data based on given pairwise proximity information while minimize the objective function the particular objective function or loss function we used in this work is a sum of squares commonly called stress we used majorization to minimize stress and this mds solving strategy is known as smacof scaling by majorizing a complicated function stress majorization is an optimization strategy used in multidimensional scaling mds where for a set of nm-dimensional data items a configuration x of n points in r m-dimensional space is sought that minimizes the stress function x here r is 2 that means the r  n matrix x lists points in 2-dimensional euclidean space we have applied the cost function  to measures the squared differences between ideal m-dimensional distances and actual distances in r-dimensional space as follows
7x1 of dimension n1  p as the individuals or judges configuration and x2 of dimension n2p as the objects configuration matrix the least squares metric multidimensional scaling or mds problem is the minimization of  and over all mp configurations x here wij are given non-negative weights and dij are given non-negative dissimilarities the dijx are the euclidean distances between rows i and j of x thus
8where wij  0 is a weight for the measurement between a pair of points ij dijx is the euclidean distance between i and j and ij is the ideal distance between the points their separation in the m-dimensional data space note that wij is used to specify a degree of confidence in the similarity between points eg 0 can be specified if there is no information for a particular pair a configuration x which minimizes x gives a plot in which points that are close together correspond to points that are also close together in the original m-dimensional data space programming scripts are freely available at

this editorial refers to cell type-specific expression of the putative sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 in human hearts by l nicin et al on page 1804
the current ongoing pandemic covid-19 coronavirus disease outbreak at the end of 2019 is based on a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix proteins together with sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 belongs to human betacoronaviruses although those viruses show many similarities there are differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure resulting in huge consequences for their pathogenesis whereas fatality rates with previous sars-cov and mers-cov outbreaks were much higher sars-cov-2 shows several unique features there is a much higher contagiosity with a high prevalence for asymptomatic disease spreaders the prolonged incubation period additionally helps the virus spreading towards a worldwide pandemicin infected patients a high rate of asymptomatic and mild courses have been reported with leading symptoms such as fatigue coughing shortness of breath and fever1 however in quite a number of cases there is a rapid spread of the virus in various organs including the lungs neurological system and most probably also the heart1 the notion that pre-existing cardiovascular diseases cvds strongly increase covid-19 fatality rates is important and is due to at least two causes in general underlying diseases such as cvd cancer or immunocompromising diseases probably increase fatality rates in many infectious diseases including general flu or sars-cov-2 a number of pre-clinical studies have shown various organ systems to express the primary sars-cov-2 entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace223 importantly pre-clinical studies in rats indicated increased expression of ace2 after reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitor medication4 while ace inhibitor therapy increased cardiac ace2 mrna but not cardiac ace2 activity in rats an angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blocker arb increased both cardiac ace2 mrna and activity4a study published in the current issue of the european heart journal has now investigated expression of ace2 in human hearts5 nicin et al employed single nuclei rna sequencing to analyse the expression of ace and ace2 in the different cell types of the human heart in five patients with aortic stenosis as two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction hfref and two samples from one healthy donor heart they found ace2 to be expressed in cardiomyocytes and pericytes and at a lower level in fibroblasts endothelial cells and leucocytes ace2 was elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls and also slightly but not significantly increased in endothelial cells and to a lower extent in fibroblasts immunostainings suggest increased expression of ace2 in cardiomyocytes of patients with as also at the protein level in line with previous pre-clinical data4 cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ace inhibitors showed a significantly higher ace2 expression figure 1 in contrast to pre-clinical data they found less ace2 activation in arb-treated patients although preliminary these data provide novel insights into the cell type-specific expression and regulation of ace2 in the human heart
this is an important hypothesis-generating observation with profound implications for basic and translational science as well as another piece of the puzzle in the ongoing discussion of the optimal pharmacotherapy of sars-cov-2-infected cardiovascular patients6there are several points i wish to discuss in light of those findings in general and as mentioned also by the authors this study is clearly underpowered and any conclusions should be drawn very carefully this especially includes the observation of less ace2 activation in cardiomyocytes in patients treated with an arb previous pre-clinical studies in rats had shown partly different results4 however there might be species differences as well as drug class-specific effects that need to be investigated in more detail in future studies eg by employing human induced pluripotent stem cell ipsc-derived cardiomyocytes any clinical speculations on the optimal pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases especially for heart failure patients should at least currently not result in a change of guideline-directed therapies this also includes antihypertensive treatments that should not be discontinued as doing so may be a greater risk factor for severe complications in the future the effects of current and future sars-cov2 antiviral medications or of co-morbidities such as diabetes on ace2 expression should also be exploredalthough several organ systems seem to be affected we currently do not exactly know about the organ-specific invasiveness of sars-cov2 in humans interestingly a previous pathological study obtained from autopsies of fatal cases of sars-cov not sars-cov2 found that with the exception of the lungs and gut there was no viral detection in the heart liver spleen kidney lymph nodes bone marrow or muscles the observations of elevated markers of cardiac damage inflammatory reactions and higher rate of rhythmological problems however may also suggest a direct cardiac infection by sars-cov-2178another important finding of the study by nicin et al is the observation of a cell type-specific expression pattern of ace2 in the human heart this will also lead to follow-up studies investigating the cell type-specific role of ace2 and potential functional implications importantly another recent study also used single cell nuclei rna sequencing in 15 healthy donor hearts and 40 failing explanted hearts obtained from the heart transplantation centre of fuwai hospital9 in contrast to the observation of nicin et al these investigators found only low ace2 expression in cardiomyocytes but again high expression in pericytes they conclude that sars-cov-2 infection in the human heart might attack primarily pericytes and subsequently cause capillary endothelial cell dysfunction thus inducing microcirculation disorders explaining the observed elevation in markers of cardiac damage mechanistic follow-up studies in both cardiomyocytes and vascular cells including pericytes and endothelial cells are clearly warranted this may also lead to intriguing insights and potential consequences for patients with heart failure of ischaemic vascular origin as well as for heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction and impaired microvascular functionfinally we should not become blinded by the covid-19 pandemic for correct diagnosis and therapy of our patients with cvd some of the covid-19 symptoms such as shortness of breath and coughing are typical problems of patients with heart failure making a fast and correct diagnosis extremely important with respect to future treatment another impact of the covid-19 pandemic leading to the heavy overload of hospitals in several regions in the world is a potential increase in event-to-balloon times in patients with acute myocardial infarction10 whether these initial findings can be extrapolated to european or us hospitals is likely but remains to be determined potentially the covid-19 outbreak will also lead to an increase of long-term complications of patients with cvd such as heart failure in both patients infected with sars-cov-2 and those that are not infected but that were treated suboptimally during the ongoing pandemic figure 1in conclusion nicin and co-workers report here an important observation with future implications in both research and potentially treatment of sars-cov-2-infected cardiovascular patients these novel data at least suggest that it will be important to monitor sars-cov-2-infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of arbace inhibitor therapy in more detailthe novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a highly contagious and devastating virus that has currently infected over 25 million people worldwide and resulted in 177 641 deaths as of april 20201 while most people diagnosed with covid-19 exhibit mild-to-moderate symptoms early reports from china described vulnerable patient populations such as the elderly and those with chronic underlying medical conditions including the immunosuppressed having more severe covid-19-related illness compared to the general population23 solid organ transplant sot recipients are one of the largest cohorts of immunosuppressed patients yet little is known about their risk of contracting the virus postinfection outcomes and effect of immunosuppression on the clinical course of the disease unique challenges such as immunosuppression management and interpretation of laboratory data also exist current treatment strategies borrow upon prior experience from other pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and influenza a virus subtype4sars-cov-2 primarily affects the respiratory tract progressing from pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases5 in these cases there is a recognized cytokine release syndrome crs which when occurs results in multiorgan dysfunction and failure6 the role of immunosuppression in mounting such inflammatory response is unclear inflammatory markers such as c-reactive protein crp lactate dehydrogenase ldh and d-dimer may reflect disease progression andor severity7 lymphopenia is reported as a common presentation among covid-19 positive patients89 treatment options are limited antivirals such as hydroxychloroquine hcq with or without azithromycin are widely used empiric options remdesivir an rna polymerase inhibitor has shown in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 and is currently under phase 3 trial10 investigational agents to combat the cytokine response such as tocilizumab an interleukin 6 il-6 receptor inhibitor are being studied although the exact role of immunosuppression on the progression of covid-19 is unknown early case reports of kidney transplant recipients suggest minimizing immunosuppression while continuing steroidal therapy11evaluation of clinical symptoms utility of biomarkers and progression of disease are important to understand for optimizing the management in covid-19 positive sot recipients the effect of covid-19 on the heart lung liver pancreas and kidney transplant organ systems is not well described herein we present our experience with 21 consecutive sot recipients diagnosed with covid-19 at the houston methodist jc walter transplant center followed to april 22 2020sot recipients were tested for covid-19 if they exhibited symptoms of fever cough andor shortness of breath sob diagnostic testing was performed via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at an institutional laboratory patients with concerning symptoms were admitted and monitored in a covid-19 unit or icu until their test returned if the test was positive admitted patients remained hospitalized until resolution of symptoms andor had 2 negative covid-19 tests admission laboratories included cbc bmp lfts dic panel d-dimer ldh crp il-6 fibrinogen and serum triglycerides initial chest x-ray cxr andor computed tomography ct imaging to evaluate for pneumonia was performed in most patients immunosuppression was reduced by holding antimetabolite mycophenolate mofetil mmf or azathioprine with or without adjustment of calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus fk or cyclosporine fk was adjusted to maintain a trough of 37 ngml per institutional protocol steroids were either kept at the maintenance dose or converted to iv for stress dosing administration of hcq  azithromycin ribavirin toclizumab remdesivir nebulized interferon -2b anakinra and convalescent plasma were based on the active institutional algorithm for the treatment of nontransplant covid-19 positive patients and various investigational study protocols figure 1covid-19-specific treatment algorithms were created by a hospital-based multidisciplinary committee designed to standardize treatment protocols and prioritize potential research studies for covid-19 positive patients at our institution this group met twice weekly to review hospital data covid-19-related patient outcomes evolving literature and availability of treatments to adjust protocols as necessary based on the committee review protocol changes were implemented via the hospital electronic medical records and all medical staff were notified of the changes in the weekly hospital-wide updates the algorithm divided patients based on the severity of patient symptoms moderate symptoms were defined by the presence of fever coughsob and 1 of the following age  65 years old presence of diabetes mellitus dm coronary artery disease obesity bmi  30 ldh

were diagnosed with covid-19 the majority of these patients had relatively favorable short-term outcomes with a mortality rate of 48 and nearly 50 of inpatients discharged home all nonhospitalized patients were successfully managed in the outpatient setting this mortality rate is reflective of the us patients in the general population which is currently estimated to be around 11112our preliminary outcomes show a lower mortality rate compared to recently published series of kidney transplant recipients alone and sot from the uk new york montefiore columbia and cornell and madrid which reported 14 1328 and 278 rates respectively813-15 the locations of these 4 centers had significantly higher number of covid-19 cases to date in the general population compared to houston approximately 143 464 75 795 and 158 000 respectively versus 57291617 in new york the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak in the united states a multicenter report of sot from columbia and cornell observed worse outcomes in transplant patients compared to nontransplant patients with higher rates of severe disease and mortality among those hospitalized14there are several differences among our cohort of patients compared to these other published reports1113-15 the case series with the highest mortality rates madrid and montefiore described patients with higher median age of 71 and 60 years respectively compared to 548 years at our center our hospitalization rate was somewhat lower than that seen in montefiore 667 versus 788 suggesting earlier presentation andor diagnosis in our patients while respiratory insufficiency alone was associated with worse outcomes in the columbia and cornell reports14 in our patients concomitant infections had the highest need for icu care and worse outcomessimilar to the published reports13-15 measured inflammatory markers were uniformly elevated on presentation in most patients there did not appear to be a correlation between inflammatory markers and patient outcomes lymphopenia a common finding in nontransplant covid-19 patients89 was also present in our cohort and in the kidney transplant patients from montefiore despite the prevalence of lymphopenia its significance in transplant patients outcome or disease progression remains unknownunlike the covid-19-related risk factors associated with severe illness in the general population18 and observed by the columbia and cornell experience14 both age 65 years and the presence of comorbidity did not appear to play a factor in prognosis for our cohort of the 5 patients 65 years old at our center 3 were admitted with 1 patient admitted to the icu without ventilatory support after transfer from an outside hospital there were no deaths in these older patients at-risk comorbidities such as hypertension dm obesity chronic lung disease and cardiovascular disease2918 were present in 90 of our transplant patients suggesting comorbidities did not drive hospitalization or severity of illness additionally over half 47 of the obese patients bmi  30 kgm2 in our cohort were treated in the outpatient settingwe also observed 73 of patients presented with elevated scr suggestive of aki 1115 although the majority of our covid-19 positive patients had kidney transplants 57 3 of the 4 patients who did not have elevated scr were kidney transplant recipients our observed trend of elevated scr is higher than the 1529 reported of the general population19 and the 40 and 57 observed in case series of kidney transplant recipients from columbia13 and the uk11 such observation may reflect the potential association between sars-cov-2 uptake via ace2 into the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidney thus increasing the risk for aki11despite uncertainty and lack of evidence regarding the optimal management of covid-19 in transplant patients our approach to management focused primarily on early diagnosis and treatment with reduction of immunosuppression before the onset of covid-19 positive cases in our region we devised a testing protocol for our sot that would be performed in the outpatient setting at our transplant center or in an isolated area in the hospital after hours patients were instructed to wear masks and self-isolate similar to the columbia experience13 we utilized telemedicine to aid with triage of symptomatic patients and with follow-up during self-isolation if patients exhibited symptoms suggestive of covid-19 ie fever cough and sob they were tested and assigned to a designated transplant covid-19 isolation unit or home depending on the severity of their symptoms antiviral therapy was initiated early following a positive test for inpatients most hospitalized patients in the early part of our experience received hcq  azithromycin although the use of azithromycin has since been removed from our most current protocol and hcq is now restricted mostly to clinical trials patients with symptom progression were immediately evaluated for enrollment in clinical studies if applicable although early case series reported withholding fk across patients20 or in the critically ill8 we opted to keep fk at low levels as there is experimental evidence that calcineurin inhibitors may inhibit coronavirus replication21 we have also continued maintenance steroid dosing reserving high dose steroids for critically ill and deteriorating patients several of our patients who exhibited severe symptoms on presentation received immunomodulatory therapy such as tocilizumab one patient received remdesivir the short-term outcomes from these agents have been positive with no adverse events such as infection or deaths and 1 patient from each group discharged homethe effect of immunosuppression on the progression of covid-19 is unclear and may be dependent on the severity of disease our institutional algorithm borrows from the theoretical framework by siddiqi et al22 that the pathologic response to covid-19 consists of 2 phases a viral phase and a host inflammatory phase in the early viral phase host autoimmunity is important for recovery against viral infection this is similar to the management of cytomegalovirus or bk virus in sot where reduction of immunosuppression is necessary to combat viral replication in the host response phase immunosuppression may be beneficial in reducing the inflammatory sequalae of the cytokine response which can otherwise lead to multiorgan dysfunction and failure6 use cytokine inhibitors may be potentially beneficial at this later stage although there may be a concern that immunosuppression may increase the risk of secondary infection we did not observe this as none of our inpatients developed subsequent infection it is intriguing to speculate that some transplant patients may not progress to crs because of their present immunosuppression and immunomodulatory state related to their long-term immune suppression although this hypothesis needs further investigation to substantiatethis paper is a retrospective review of 21 covid-19 positive sots at a us high-volume transplant center although we are able to describe our patients and provide short-term outcomes we are unable to make any definitive conclusions regarding long-term outcomes of our treatment strategies or in this patient population given the limitations of a single-center observational study additionally there was no standardized treatment protocol for covid-19 positive patients as our center protocols are constantly adjusted based on new data from the growing number of covid-19 published reports these limitations will be improved upon in future publications as our experience with covid-19 continues to growfuture studies will include evaluation of graft function and rejection risk via monitoring of donor-specific antibodies long-term impact of antivirals immunomodulatory therapy with tocilizumab nebulized interferon alpha or anakinra on inflammatory markers

transplant patientsthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread worldwide123 after the first case on december 31 2019 from wuhan outbreaks become pandemic within three months with a tremendous socio-economic impact45 in south korea the first sars-cov-2 infection was confirmed on january 19 20206 after a one-month quiescent period the outbreak started from a cult in daegu on february 19 2020 most of the cases in south korea occurred in daegu and the north gyeongsang province which together account for about 10 of the total korean population 5 million residents24 million in daegu and 26 million in north gyeongsang province figure 1the case fatality rate of covid-19 worldwide has exceeded 7 with a higher mortality found in patients with an older age age of 60 years and history of cardiovascular respiratory and metabolic disorders37 not just respiratory complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards but cardiac manifestations have drawn attention due to the increased risk of mortality and morbidity related to covid-19891011underlying cardiovascular disease cvd has been common in patients with previous coronavirus infection such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers it has been thought that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is a functional receptor for coronavirus is responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac involvement12 in sars the prevalence of underlying cvd was 10 with a twelvefold increased risk of death1314 in mers cvd was present in approximately 30 of patients with also a higher mortality reported in these patients915 the increased presence of cardiovascular comorbidities are also noted in covid-19 as well most notably among those with more severe disease71617 the prevalence of cvd in sars-cov-2 infections reported in the previous reports has ranges from 840 depending on the patients characteristics and disease severity71218 although the mechanism of the association between cvd and sars-cov-2 infection is not clearly identified it is explained by the fact that the cvd is more prevalent in those with an advancing age functionally impaired immune system elevated levels of ace2 or predisposition to covid-19 in those with cvd16cardiac injury was defined by any abnormality observed in the cardiac biomarkers electrocardiography or echocardiography from the previous studies table 178181920 however the definition in each study varies because there is no unified consensus of the definition in covid-19 associated cardiac injury even though there was a high incidence and substantial impact of cardiac injury it was not always possible to evaluate the whole set of cardiac injury markers cardiac biomarkers electrocardiography and echocardiography during the highly infectious virus pandemic most of the sars-cov-2 infected patients has a milder course with a complete recovery which would not necessitate an evaluation it is reasonable to perform those tests in patients with more serious disease course21for the critical care patients an evaluation of cardiac injury is readily feasible arentz et al21 adopted a more specific definition of cardiac injury more precisely cardiomyopathy in covid-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu cardiomyopathy was defined as evidence of a new-onset left ventricular systolic dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram when any one of following criteria is met clinical signs of cardiogenic shock an elevation in the creatinine kinase or troponin i level a decrease in the central venous oxygen saturation 70in general tests for the cardiac manifestation in covid-19 is performed when the patient has cardiac symptoms such as chest pain or dyspnea cardiomegaly observed on the chest x-ray or on the chest computed tomography ct or when the physician considered the test is necessary in such cases of unstable vital sign cardiac injury associated with covid-19 is diagnosed when any one of the parameters is positive cardiac enzyme elevation new-onset or first detected abnormality by electrocardiography new-onset or first detected abnormality by echocardiography after the diagnosis of covid-19 associated cardiac injury investigation of the etiology the decision for the future treatment strategy and assessment of the prognosis need to be proceeded figure 2the incidence of cardiac injury associated with the sars-cov-2 infection is reported to be 72 in the overall patients 2 in non-icu patients and 22 in icu patients7 in other reports the incidence of cardiac injury reach up to 27831 in accordance with the definitions and patient characteristics819 the incidence of cardiomyopathy in icu patients treated for covid-19 was 333 and the mortality in the study population was 52421the mortality in covid-19 has been caused mainly by respiratory failure due to severe acute pneumonia however a systemic inflammatory response syndrome including a cytokine storm and myocardial damage such as acute fulminant myocarditis with arrhythmic manifestations can lead to sudden cardiac death7101116 in this regard the cardiac injury related to the sars-cov-2 infection is considered as an important issue patients with a previous history of coronary vascular disease and evidence of cardiac injury by elevated cardiac enzymes troponin-t levels had a higher incidence of mortality8the cardiac injury related to the sars-cov-2 infection can be explained by several mechanisms figure 3 the first mechanism is ace2-mediated direct cardiac damage ace2 has been identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses the sars-cov-2 infection is triggered by binding of the spike protein of the virus to ace2 which is highly expressed in the heart and lungs the second one is hypoxia-induced myocardial injury oxidative stress intracellular acidosis and mitochondrial damage followed by hypoxia might result in cardiac injury previously significantly lower oxygen saturation levels and a higher incidence of dyspneic symptoms was noted in the cardiac injury patients the third is the cardiac microvascular damage caused by vessel hyperpermeability and angio-spasms under conditions of inflammation the fourth mechanism is systemic inflammatory response syndrome such as the cytokine storm caused by the inadequate responses of type 1 and type 2 helper t cells which may contribute to the myocardial injury12 fulminant myocarditis can be related to the immunologic response during a viral infection222324 the fifth can be explained by epicardial coronary artery occlusions due to an acute plaque rupture owing to coagulopathy with plaque instability driven by a systemic inflammatory response the last one is stress-induced cardiomyopathy because of the severe stress during the course of the sars-cov-2 infection1216252627 the cardiac injury related to covid-19 cannot be explained separately by each mechanism multiple factors affect the cardiomyocytes epicardial coronary arteries and coronary microvasculature in a various way at each timepoint of the disease trajectory9101112162829 evaluation of the major mechanism of cardiac injury in covid-19 is important to set up further therapeutic strategiesalthough the true incidence is unclear acute coronary syndrome acs can occur in covid-19 patients the risk of acs in sars-cov-2 infected patients may be increased due to an increased thrombotic tendency evidenced by elevated d-dimer levels in the previous studies71819 in the inflammatory milieu endothelial and smooth muscle cell activation macrophage activation and tissue factor expression in atheromatous plaque and platelet activation with further elaboration of inflammatory mediators can precipitate plaque rupture resulting in acs30 not just a typical type 1 myocardial infarction mi but a type 2 mi related to the increased demand during the virus infection can develop especially in patients with underlying coronary artery disease31 frequently the symptoms of an infection and the signs of non-ischemic cardiac injury can masquerade as acs and therefore a high index of suspicion for alternative diagnosis is mandatory by utilizing non-invasive diagnostic methods cardiac biomarkers electrocardiography echocardiography and cardiac ct2832 given the risk of an infection spreading to other patients and to the healthcare providers during the transportation and procedure adjusting the protocols for acs treatment with increasing consideration for thrombolytics is considered in many centers during the virus pandemic33343536increased evidences has shown that covid-19 is burdened by a higher risk of arrhythmic events with a related risk on mortality37 palpitations have been reported as one of the most common initial symptoms of this disease 7337 in 138 hospitalized covid-19 patients arrhythmias represented the leading complication 196 after acute respiratory distress syndrome with an increased risk of up to 444 in those admitted to intensive care units more serious arrhythmic complications such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were found in 59 of cases3738 the risk of arrhythmias can be associated with cardiomyopathy caused by cardiac injury or possibly related to the usage of anti-viralanti-bacterial medications causing qt-prolongation2838 physicians should keep in mind the risk of increased arrhythmic events in covid-19 patients which can significantly affect the overall mortality close monitoring for arrhythmic events and careful decision making for anti-viralanti-bacterial medications is crucial especially in a serious disease status with a vulnerable statusthere are several reports of sars-cov-2 with cardiac involvement as the presentation of acute myocarditis10222439 the pathogenesis of cardiac involvement associated with sars-cov-2 may reflect a process of a replication and dissemination of the virus through the blood or lymphatic system from the respiratory tract tavazzi et al39 reported the myocardial localization of sars-cov-2 with myofibrillar lysis and inflammatory cell infiltration during the acute phase of covid-19 the general immunologic response in viral myocarditis is as follows first there is the viral entry and activation of the innate immune response which takes 17 days after the infection second there is the activation of the acquired immune response by natural killer cells macrophages and t-lymphocytes which takes 14 weeks and lastly there is either recovery by the clearance of the virus or disease progression by the delayed and ineffective viral clearance with chronic inflammation which takes months to years40414243 the extent of the local tissue damage and cytokine storm triggered by the host immune response both contribute to the severity of the myocarditis an exaggerated inflammatory response can be extremely fatal and immunomodulators such as corticosteroids are considered in selected cases even though the efficacy and safety is questionable2844 combined with these mechanisms related to a host immune response multiple factors are responsible for the cardiac consequence of covid-19 such as an oxygen supply and demand imbalance with or without coronary artery disease increased right ventricular afterload due to respiratory acidosis hypoxemia and positive pressure ventilation2939 even though it is difficult to discriminate all the possible mechanisms related to myocarditis accordingly the effort to identify the dominant cause is necessary for the selection of the proper target treatmentpatients with sars-cov-2 infection related cardiac injury including myocarditis could present with acute decompensated heart failure hf figure 2 they might have hf with a reduced or preserved ejection fraction28infection is one of the major precipitating factors of acute decompensation in hf and patients admitted with acute hf precipitated by an infection had a high 90day risk of death4546 it is necessary to exert every effort to reduce the risk of sars-cov-2 infections in patients with hfsocial distancing hand washing wearing personal protective equipment and reducing unnecessary hospital visits4 maintaining an optimal guideline directed medical therapy including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei or angiotensin receptor blockers arb is also highly recommended since there is no sufficient evidence to discontinue these critical medications for the concern of increased viral invasion due to the increased expression of ace2447 this issue will be discussed in detail later in a separated partthrombosis is a common consequence of an infection and is associated with a poor patient outcome many viral infections affect the pathways of hemostasis and coagulation inducing either thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications48 in patients with pneumonia caused by an influenza infection the occurrence of venous thromboembolisms has been shown to be increased49 assessing the risk of venous thromboembolisms is essential especially in covid-19 patients with a critical condition early reports from china showed a higher prothrombin time and d-dimer level on admission in icu patients with covid-19 as compared to non-icu patients19 a retrospective analysis of 183 covid-19 patients also revealed a higher d-dimer and fibrin degradation product in non-survivals50 patients with covid-19 in a critical condition would have complications such as renal failure respiratory failure or liver dysfunction which can affect both venous thromboembolisms and the bleeding status37 among the patients with covid-19 at high risk for venous thromboembolism 44 11 of 407 also had a high risk of bleeding51 therefore anticoagulation should be considered with a balance of the thrombotic risk and bleeding risk when covid-19 patients are indicated for anticoagulation therapy the dose and duration of drug should be adjusted individually and non-medical prophylactic measures need to be fully utilized such as mechanical compressions with elastic compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compressionalthough the cardiac manifestation of covid-19 is an important issue thorough examination of the cardiac injury using advanced diagnostic modalities is often limited owing to the risk of disease transmission during the diagnostic procedures and shortage of medical resources1652 careful planning for the evaluation strategy of cardiovascular manifestations is mandatory in covid-19 patients to protect both healthcare providers and non-infected patients and at the same time save the infected patients there are several instructions needed to prevent infection spreading during the diagnostic procedures primary evaluation and management procedures including laboratory tests electrocardiography and echocardiography should be carried out in a negative pressure isolation room when the patient needs further evaluation at a different location the hospital administration and infection control departments need to arrange for the patients transfer routes using a portable isolation bed to minimize the exposure to the facilities for cardiac ct and magnetic resonance imaging all rooms should be evacuated during the scan and for 45 hours after the sterilization according to the infection control strategy of each hospital23there has been concern about using acei or arb in covid-19 patients owing to their role in altering the ace2 which acts as a functional receptor of sars-cov-21247 a high incidence of sars-cov-2 infections in patients with hypertension heart failure or cardiovascular disease who are common renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas blocker users increased the suspicion of their harmful effects371754 inconsistent results of the previous animal models with respect to the effects of raas inhibitors on ace2 also raised controversy5556575859 the beneficial effect of acei or arb has been suggested by attenuating the local raas activation and unopposed angiotensin ii accumulation caused by a continued viral infection and replication that contribute to reducing the membrane ace2 expression47 there is no concrete evidence or proven benefit to discontinue raas blockers and they are well established medications to improve outcomes in various diseases such as hypertension myocardial infarction chronic kidney disease and heart failure furthermore abrupt withdrawal of them in high-risk patients may result in clinical instability and adverse outcomes therefore we need to maintain raas inhibitors in covid-19 patients as previous guidelines recommendheart transplant patients are at high risk of an infection and challenges exist regarding the maintenance of immunosuppression therapy after the infection which can further raise the risk of graft rejection a case study of two heart transplant patients from the hubei province of china confirmed with the sars-cov-2 infection revealed typical symptoms in these patients one had a milder presentation while the other required hospitalization with cessation of immunosuppression along with treatment with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin60 when routine preventive measures were well adopted the incidence of an infection in heart transplant patients can be minimized a survey of 87 heart transplant recipients in wuhan china did not find a higher risk of infection with sars-cov-261 as of may 31st there have been no confirmed heart transplant patients reported in south korea it is recommended to continue heart transplantations unless the risk of an infection spreading presents during the procedure surveillance of both the donor and recipient and related healthcare providers needs to be performed as per the individual organizations protocol and based on the up to date guideline recommendations6263 even though the evidence is lacking the current consensus for the management of heart transplant recipients who developed covid-19 is to deliver the best supportive treatment for the viral infection and continuation of immunosuppression for mild disease in more serious disease reduction for anti-metabolites mycophenolate or azathioprine and further treatment with immunomodulators need to be considered16since there is no proven therapy for sars-cov-2 the mainstay of the treatment in patients with covid-19 remains supportive care including symptomatic treatment for minor symptoms and full intensive care support for serious complications contemporary candidate drugs are interleukin-6 inhibitors tocilizumab sarilumab type 2 transmembrane serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate membrane fusion and endocytosis inhibitors chloroquine hydroxychloroquine arbidol 3-chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors lopinavir darunavir and viral rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitors ribavirin remdesivir favipiravir64 among them chloroquine hydroxychloroquine lopinavirritonavir ribavirin are repurposed agents which were previously used to treat sars and mers6566 recently remdesivir showed efficacy for reducing hospitalization compared to the placebo in 1063 covid-19 patients from a randomized control trial67 compassionate use of remdesivir for 53 patients with severe covid-19 also revealed 68 of clinical improvement68 adjunctive therapies of corticosteroids anti-cytokine or immunomodulatory agents and immunoglobulin therapy are also considered in selected cases but they should be applied with caution owing to the serious complications that can cause646970 more than 300 clinical trials are underway to investigate the effective medications and vaccines to overcome covid-19 but the most important method at this point would be keeping basic preventive measures of wearing personal protective equipment hand sanitizing and social distancingsubstantial evidence has suggested a non-negligible incidence of cardiac injury related to covid-19 although the clinical significance and exact mechanisms are under investigation we should be aware of the potentially fatal cardiac manifestations when dealing with patients with covid-19 prudent selection of diagnostic and therapeutic methods during the outbreak is crucial to obtain the best therapeutic results without adding a risk of disease transmissionventricular tachycardia vt is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with structural heart disease implantable cardioverter-defibrillators icds enhance survival by effectively terminating vts however icd shocks are associated with an increase in mortality and a reduction of quality of life 15 one of the main approaches to reduce the risk of shocks is the optimization of icds by programming high-rate and delayed therapy windows 6 7 nevertheless shocks are not eliminated and additional therapies are often required to prevent such events the main two options are antiarrhythmic drug aad therapy and catheter ablation ca different antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with increased mortality in patients with structural heart disease some can be ineffective at controlling ventricular arrhythmias or can be poorly tolerated 810 the only drugs that have shown a reduction in vt episodes in randomized clinical trials rcts are amiodarone and sotalol rcts have demonstrated that these drugs can reduce vt recurrences in patients with an icd however their efficacy is moderate with no benefit on overall mortality and significant side effects 1115 nonetheless based on the current expert consensus statement 16 referral for catheter ablation is usually prompted by failure of aads to control vt episodes in this review we will focus on the status of timing of catheter ablation for vt in patients with icd therapiesthe latest expert consensus 16 class i indications to catheter ablation for patients with ischemic heart disease include 1 ablation of vt storm refractory to aad therapy different papers demonstrated a benefit in terms of recurrences and mortality in this group 1719 a meta-analysis 20 on patients undergoing catheter ablation for vt storm showed that the odds of death were four times higher after a failed procedure compared with those with a successful one and that failure of the acute procedure carried a high mortality risk 2 in patients with recurrent vt despite chronic amiodarone therapy catheter ablation is recommended in preference to escalating aad therapy in the vanish randomized clinical trial 21 a significantly lower rate of the composite primary outcome of death ventricular tachycardia storm or appropriate icd shock was observed among patients undergoing catheter ablation than among those receiving an escalation in antiarrhythmic drug therapy 3 patients with ischemic heart disease and recurrent vt despite aad therapy or when aad therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated this is based on prospective trials 2224 that showed how vt recurrences were associated with increased mortality hospitalization and worse quality of lifeindications for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy nicm have strengthened compared to the 2017 guidelines 25 recommendations gained a class i indication based on long-term data 2628 for electrical storm refractory to aad therapy or recurrent vt where medications are ineffective contraindicated or not tolerated in order to reduce vt recurrences and icd shocksoptimal timing of catheter ablation is an important yet unresolved subject guidelines started raising the issue in 2009 29 by searching what density or frequency of vt warrants ablation whether patients should receive prophylactic vt ablation after icd implantation before recurrence of vt and if ablation could eliminate the need for an icd while prospective studies have focused on the aspect of prophylactic ablation and comparison with icd therapy there are currently no published rcts addressing the first question the only data available so far come from retrospective trials 30 31 comparing an early ablation versus a late referral strategy in patients with structural heart disease evidence was provided that an early strategy improved vt-free survival all these studies had an influence on the evolution of the guidelines leading to a new timing indication first the 2015 esc guidelines 32 and recently the expert consensus 16 recommended catheter ablation with a class iia and class iib indication respectively after a first episode of sustained vt in ischemic patients with an icd regardless of the type of icd therapythe attitude toward the timing of ablation tends to reflect locally available expertise and logistics data from the 2015 survey of the european heart rhythm society ehra report that ablation was the treatment of choice in ischemic cardiomyopathy icm patients after the first icd shock due to vt in 133 of centers 33 in 2017 a new ehra survey was conducted 34 showing that patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction lvef presenting with their first episode of hemodynamically stable sustained monomorphic vt despite beta-blocker therapy were treated with vt ablation in 620 of the responding centers amiodarone was typically used as first-line treatment in 197 in patients with non-ischemic etiology the preferred initial strategy was catheter ablation in 371 of the centers and amiodarone in 414 all centers 100 indicated that the appropriate treatment for a patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy presenting multiple appropriate icd shocks despite long treatment with amiodarone would be vt ablation this was recommended in 898 of patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy the reported data show that an increasing number of centers across europe perform catheter ablation after the first icd shock following the release of the 2015 esc guidelines despite a weaker strength of recommendation unfortunately real-world data based on such large surveys from american centers are not availablethree retrospective trials have been published on the timing of vt ablation in patients with icd therapies frankel et al 30 reported a single-center experience on 98 consecutive patients with sustained vt and structural heart disease both icm and nicm referred for the first catheter ablation procedure ninety-six percent of patients had an icd implanted prior to ablation they were divided into two groups late referrals were defined as those with 2 or more episodes of vt with the first and most recent episode separated by at least 1 month all others were considered early referrals patients referred late for vt ablation were more likely to be on high dose amiodarone long-term outcomes showed that the early referral group had improved vt-free survival compared to the late group in multivariate modeling only early referral retained independent statistically significant association with vt-free survival dinov et al 31 investigated a similar population of 300 patients the timing to ablation groups were different early ablation strategy group 1 consisting of patients ablated within 30 days after the first documented vt delayed ablation strategy group 2 patients ablated between 1 month and 1 year after the initial vt very late ablation strategy group 3 ca was performed  1 year after the first documented vt patients referred for vt ablation within 30 days after the first documented vt were the only group who had improved both acute and long-term success rates the authors also analyzed the impact of timing on cardiac mortality reporting that early ablation strategy was not associated with improved survival however vt recurrence was associated with cardiovascular mortality romero et al 35 included 669 consecutive patients who presented for their first percutaneous catheter ablation of sustained monomorphic vt in addition to icm and nicm they also included subjects without structural heart disease their definition of early vs late referral was not defined by time but by the number of failed orally administered aads before referral for catheter ablation hence timing between vt onset and ca were not available patients were divided into 2 groups 1 failure of no aad or a single aad to control vt single-drug failure or 2 failure of  1 aad to control vt multidrug failure they analyzed vt-free survival cardiac transplantation free survival and overall survival the authors report that patients with nicm-related vt who were in the multidrug group had substantially worse outcomes of arrhythmia recurrence heart transplantation and mortality compared with patients referred for ablation following no drug failure or single-drug failure whereas there was no influence in patients without structural heart disease in the icm group multidrug failure was associated with worse ventricular arrhythmia free survival and overall survival however the association was weaker this was predominantly influenced by worse outcomes in patients with failed amiodarone treatment and it is consistent with the vanish study where any amiodarone failure was associated with worse outcomes in icma systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical outcomes of these three studies 36 confirmed that early ablation was associated with an improvement in vt-free survival in patients with both icm and nicm as well as fewer complications however there was no significant association with lower mortality probably because they were underpowered to detect a mortality benefit due to limited follow-up the limited sample size and small number of deaths one of the critical aspects underlined in this analysis is that there is no standard definition of early or late referral factors like clustering frequency and severity of vt are not taken into account making the comparison less stringenthowever retrospective data provide a solid background to support the need for prospective randomized studies to confirm the benefits of an early referral for catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in structural heart diseaserandomized controlled trials addressed the issue of prophylactic catheter ablation in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy even though the majority of patients included did not have an icd implanted at enrollment these are important data on early referral of catheter ablation after a vt episode and the impact on subsequent icd therapy the smash-vt 37 study included 128 patients with a history of myocardial infarction who underwent icd implantation for secondary prevention for ventricular fibrillation hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia syncope with inducible ventricular tachycardia during invasive electrophysiological testing or received an appropriate therapy after primary prevention indications patients were randomized to icd implantation alone or icd implantation plus catheter ablation during follow-up no patient received an antiarrhythmic agent other than beta-blockers patients in the ablation group had a 73 reduction in the risk of receiving subsequent icd shocks there was even a trend toward decreased mortality in the ablation group although it was not statistically significant the vtach trial 38 enrolled 107 patients with previous myocardial infarction who had an indication for an icd as secondary prevention after documented stable clinical vt patients were randomized to either vt ablation followed by icd implantation or implantation alone drug management during follow-up was at the discretion of the investigator patients in the ablation group had a longer time free of any vt or vf recurrence fewer appropriate icd shocks and fewer hospital admissions for cardiac reasons than did patients with an icd only there was no difference in mortality between the groups the sms study 39 published by the same group was a complement to the vtach trial as it had a similar design but it enrolled 111 patients with unstable ventricular arrhythmias in contrast with the two previous studies prophylactic catheter ablation did not prolong the time to first ventricular arrhythmia recurrence the reasons for this difference were probably multiple including different icd programming mapping and ablation strategy drug management fluctuations and the asymmetrical loss to follow-up of the two arms however catheter ablation was associated with a  50 reduction in the total number of icd therapies throughout follow-upthe calypso pilot randomized study 40 aimed at testing whether early use of catheter ablation of vt is superior to aad introduction at reducing mortality twenty-seven enrolled patients with ihd and an icd were randomized to ca or aad if they received an icd intervention  1 icd shock or  3 atps the limited sample size and the follow-up period 3 months did not show any significant difference in the two arms this was a useful pilot study that showed the difficulty to conduct trials for early referrals because of substantial obstacles to enrolling patients in a multicenter rcts comparing a strategy of early ca with a strategy of aad this was due to the common clinical practice of starting aad before ablation resulting in a population referred for ca with progressed disease when drugs have already failed an important alternative design was in the vanish study 21 where patients were randomized to ca or escalated drug therapy after failing an aad showing a significant benefit in the composite endpoint of death vt storm or icd shock in the ablation arm in relatively advanced disease patients failing however to show improvement with respect to mortality alone this led to the ongoing vanish 2 trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct02830360 that aims to define the best first-line therapy for vt randomizing patients with a prior myocardial infarction to catheter ablation or aad introduction after a vt event the objective is to evaluate a reduction in the composite outcome of death appropriate icd shocks vt storm or treated sustained vt below the detection rate of the icda meta-analysis that included these five published rcts 41 showed that patients in the ablation arm were significantly less likely to experience icd shocks vt storm and cardiac hospitalization however no benefit was seen in all-cause mortalitythe latest rct published on this topic is the berlin vt 42 the main difference with the previously randomized trials is that it compares prophylactic catheter ablation to a deferred strategy instead of non-ablative treatments at enrollment 159 patients were randomly assigned to receive catheter ablation for vt either before icd implantation or after the third appropriate icd shock for vt the primary composite endpoint was all-cause death and hospitalization for heart failure or arrhythmia and secondary end points were recurrent episodes of vt and change in quality of life at 1 year the study was interrupted for futility because at the interim analysis the primary endpoint increased sufficiently in the prophylactic treatment arm reaching the futility stopping boundary the authors concluded that preventive vt ablation before icd implantation did not reduce mortality or hospitalization for arrhythmia or worsening heart failure during a 1-year of follow-up compared with the deferred ablation strategy the lack of benefit of prophylactic catheter ablation in this study is not surprising as it seems a combination of factors including the study design and population made the trial underpowered to examine a hard endpoint like mortality the population had a relatively high lvef  30 icds were programmed to reduce shocks the use of aads was not pre-specified and the follow-up period was too short to discern between such groups chance seemingly played a role as well all-cause mortality was reported in 6 patients in the preventive ablation group including 1 case of endocarditis post tavi procedure 4 non-cardiac deaths and one of unknown cause whereas the only death cases reported due to arrhythmias were in the deferred ablation arm an interesting aspect on the timing of ablation comes from the observation that in the deferred ablation group most physicians and patients did not adhere to the protocol and catheter ablation was performed after 1 or 2 icd shocks this echoes a shared opinion by some electrophysiologists in the community that three shocks may be too long to wait and reflects the real-world records availableevidence from recent rcts points to a lack of net benefit of prophylactic ablation of vt at the time of icd implantation even though there is a reduction in the number of recurrences there is no advantage in terms of mortality and it does not eliminate the need for an icd no matter how early it is performed in view of its unfavorable cost-benefit ratio it is unlikely that prophylactic catheter ablation of vt will be applied in clinical practice on the other hand we learned that deferring the timing of ablation to an undefined future definitely poses an increased risk for arrhythmia recurrence with a probable adverse effect on the subsequent clinical course hence what future randomized clinical trials need to address is when to perform ablation between these two extreme timings even more so because that is where the majority of patients are patient recruitment of this population in rcts is challenging first the difficulty to enroll subjects at the right time since referral to large academic centers occurs when aads have failed and the disease is more advanced second limited duration of the available follow-up time comorbidities and advanced age may concur to overall non-cardiac mortality thus increasing the difficulty of proving a mortality benefit composite endpoints including mortality can certainly increase the number of events and shorten the follow-up period but they need to be chosen carefullyin our opinion the right timing for catheter ablation would be after icd implantation but before aad therapy and an icd shock could be the pivotal point in the natural history of the disease for randomization and risk stratification being an intervention with prognostic valuethe rcts published so far were a comparison of strategies however none were true timing trials designed to randomize patients with icds in two different moments of the natural history of vtthe issue of timing of ablation in patients with vt recurrences leading to an icd shock is investigated in the ongoing partita randomized clinical trial does timing of vt ablation affect prognosis in patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct01547208 this is the only study to randomize patients after the first icd shock reflecting real-world practice patterns it is a prospective randomized multicenter study where patients are followed-up with automatic daily remote monitoring all patients with an icd with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy both primary and secondary prevention are enrolled and followed-up until their first appropriate icd shock phase a after the first appropriate shock delivered for vt patients are randomized phase b to either the control group ablation after the next electrical storm or the immediate vt ablation arm the primary endpoint is a composite of heart failure hospitalization and death from any cause the follow-up period is 2 years after the icd shock the secondary endpoints include the correlation of the first appropriate icd shock to the burden of previous vts phase a cardiac death recurrent electrical storm and recurrent vt phase b the study began in september 2012 and at the time of writing there are 16 european sites actively enrolling non-ablative policies of the protocol aim to give insight on the natural history of ventricular tachycardia after icd implant abstention from the use of aads will help observe the natural progression and burden of the arrhythmia with the use of remote monitoring standardized device programming reflecting current clinical practice with long detection intervals favoring antitachycardia pacing atp will help analyze the predictive role of atps on icd shockssimilarly to other trials the primary mortality endpoint is composite and in this case includes heart failure hospitalization the fact that death from any cause is used instead of cardiac death could make it more challenging to demonstrate a net benefit secondary endpoints however target the specific relationship between timing of catheter ablation and cardiac death which is the missing link that is neededthe current practice in our center is shown in fig 1 in patients nave to vt fig 1a we tend not to use aads unless they are required for other arrhythmias up-titrate beta-blockers when icd interventions occur and recommend the use of home monitoring in case of a shock we reprogram the device when possible to delay therapies and perform catheter ablation when  2 shocks occur in 12 months therapeutic strategies after failed vt ablation are less standardized and depend on the clinical characteristics of the patient and of the ventricular tachycardia multicenter data have shown that a repeated catheter ablation is usually performed after multiple electrical shocks or electrical storm and having failed amiodarone and multiple other aads more commonly in nicm 43 in our center fig 1b we usually discharge patients after ca with a home monitoring device an optimized medical therapy without aads in case of atps beta-blockers are up-titrated when possible in case of an icd shock we tend to perform ca earlier after 1 shock in patients with an ischemic substrate whereas we prefer aad therapy in nicm patients and save catheter ablation after further recurrencesin case of refractory vt storm to all the above-mentioned treatments surgical autonomic modulation is a reasonable option the principle of sympathetic modulation is based on the fact that the autonomic nervous system plays an important role in triggering and maintaining ventricular tachycardia indeed beta-adrenergic receptor blockers are a standard therapy used for neuromodulation that aim to block sympathetic transmission surgical interventions such as cardiac sympathetic denervation csd that target the stellate ganglia by video-assisted thoracoscopy can reduce the burden of sustained vt and icd shocks 44 the 2017 guidelines 25 and the expert consensus 16 consider this emerging therapeutic option reasonable in patients with vt storm after beta-blockers aads and vt ablation have failedin this historic moment it is timely to analyze how the management of patients with vt is going to change due to the coronavirus pandemicfollowing the outbreak the common decisional pattern of all european centers was to adapt to the national health authorities request to shut down elective procedures thereby allowing a shift of personnel and equipment resources in favor of the intensive and nonintensive covid care units as a result and according to a recently published survey from our institution 45 the number of non-urgent procedures dropped almost to zero the number of vt ablation procedures thereby performed only on an emergency indication decreased roughly by 85 with respect to the pre-outbreak metricspatient visits and especially referrals will become more difficult this will also have an impact on enrolment and follow-up in trials due to the important impact on morbidity and mortality of ventricular tachycardia it will be our duty to intensify the activity of remote monitoring to ensure prompt recognition of evolving arrhythmia patterns chasing warming patterns setting earlier indications to vt ablation as compared to the current behavior to avoid progressive deterioration of the arrhythmia and overall clinical course home monitoring will become crucial in evaluating the disease progression adjusting therapy accordingly and shortening referralsconsidering the interactions of class iii agents with drugs used for the treatment of viral infection their use might be reduced due to their impact on qt prolongation the resulting reduced shelter could lead to an increased susceptibility to arrhythmias that should be treated by catheter ablationlastly there is increasing evidence of elevated troponin levels in covid-19 patients 46 47 while at the moment we are uncertain whether this could lead to a significant cardiac damage and substrate for ventricular tachycardia we should be prepared to a potential increase in vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias and risk stratification in this new scenarioindication to catheter ablation is usually recommended when aads have failed to control vt recurrences and icd shocks in patients with a more advanced disease there is a growing amount of evidence that an early referral for ablation reduces vt recurrences though a benefit in terms of mortality has not been demonstrated yet this however led to a guideline indication to consider icd patients for ablation after the first vt episode real-world data suggest that it is an increasingly common clinical practice to evaluate patients for catheter ablation earlier in the natural history in order to avoid the demonstrated negative impact on patients quality of life and possible side effects of drugs randomized clinical trials powered to assess mortality are essential in order confirm the beneficial effects of an early strategyaberrancy in immune response can result in failure to clear virus and viral sepsis while proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 are essential to mediate innate immunity they can cause host damage as part of a maladaptive process viral sepsis remains highly heterogeneous and is likely to encompass a complex and not yet fully understood pattern of pathophysiologic pathways and immune responses that are distinct from bacterial infections8 however the current consensus guidelines are primarily based on studies of bacterial sepsis and are not pathogen specific9 about 5 of patients with covid-19 develop critical illness and are admitted to the icu5 respiratory failure due to expansion of pulmonary infiltrates and secondary bacterial infection septic shock and multiorgan failure are among the reasons for an untoward clinical course in this setting4 the expression and distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace-2 the primary host cell receptor of sars-cov2 in various systems make it possible for the virus to infect a variety of cells and induce multiple organ failure figure 1similar to other patients with hemodynamic instability these patients are likely to undergo aggressive fluid administration as the mainstay of management in fact fluid resuscitation remains the most enduring of sepsis treatments predating even antibiotics although mounting evidence has recently challenged its central role in this setting10 a potentially simplistic and possibly incorrect reasoning at the foundation of such conjecture is the presumed hypoperfusion resulting in an increase in serum lactate levels accompanied by low blood pressure oliguria hepatic dysfunction and altered mental status in patients with sepsis11 in this hypoperfusion-centric paradigm the microcirculatory dysfunction is the key driver of sequential pathophysiologic mechanisms ultimately leading to multiorgan failure not only have some observations challenged the validity of this hypothesis eg lack of correlation between oliguria and renal blood flow in sepsis1213 but alternative plausible biological explanations eg bioenergetics failure have also been offered11 moreover due to known changes in the glycocalyx structure and hyperpermeability of vasculature in sepsis the administered fluid is rapidly redistributed into an extravascular compartment14 in keeping with these concepts there is clinical evidence that the increase in intravascular volume after fluid bolus therapy might be small and short lived leading to only transient improvement in hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output15these observations coupled with the strong evidence on the association of adverse outcomes with extravascular volume overload an unintended consequence of aggressive fluid therapy in sepsissee below make fluid stewardship a serious consideration for the care of these patients this concept is even more crucial in critically ill patients with covid-19 in whom expanding lung infiltrates ards and respiratory failure often coexist with sepsispragmatic endpoints for fluid resuscitation are difficult to delineate in general the goal is for cardiac output to become preload independent ie reaching the plateau portion of the frank-starling curve but this is difficult to assess clinically16 in the absence of universally accepted objective measurement tools that are validated in a wide spectrum of patients admitted for sepsis syndromes acquired volume overload remains an obvious risk of aggressive fluid resuscitation17 there is ample evidence of the detrimental impact of interstitial edema and congestion on the function of multiple organ systems including the kidney and the lungs18since the ventricular pressurevolume relationship is curvilinear atrial pressures increase rapidly as the patients reach the plateau of their frank-starling curve increased atrial pressure is associated with an increase in pulmonary and venous hydrostatic pressures leading to a shift of fluid into the interstitial space further disturbing capillary blood flow and oxygen diffusion19 this effect is more pronounced in those clinical settings such as covid-19 where lung tissue architecture is already disturbed by an active and rapidly expanding inflammatory process moreover a significant subset of patients with covid-19 develops ards which is characterized by pulmonary edema resulting from increased capillary permeability making these patients even more vulnerable to resuscitation-induced lung congestionthe incidence of aki in covid-19 varies widely estimates range from 05 to 291420 it is noteworthy that a subset of patients experiences fever malaise nausea vomiting and possibly diarrhea for several days before seeking medical care as such they are prone to intravascular volume depletion and prerenal aki in these patients early aggressive volume resuscitation is indicated to avoid development of extensive acute tubular injury due to prolonged severe renal hypoperfusion while it has been suggested that direct cellular injury via ace-2 that is expressed in proximal renal tubules could contribute to aki21 it remains likely that shock and in some cases cytokine storm are the primary causes of acute tubular necrosis in this setting moreover similar to right-sided heart failure following aggressive fluid administration the increased right atrial pressure is transmitted retrograde leading to elevated venous pressure in abdominal organs such as the kidney liver and the guts kidneys are particularly vulnerable to a rise in interstitial pressure and tubular compression due to the capsule surrounding them ie renal intracapsular tamponadethe detrimental impact of high backward venous pressure on renal hemodynamics and development of congestive renal failure has been well studied in heart failure22 in the fluids and catheters treatment trial facct the incidence of aki was similar between restrictive and liberal fluid management groups23 however liu et al showed that after correcting serum creatinine levels for fluid balance the incidence of aki was lower with a restrictive fluid strategy24 besides venous wall stretch is a stimulus for activation of endothelium and subsequent release of inflammatory mediators which in turn may lead to interstitial damage and functional abnormalities such as diminished tubular reabsorption and retention of sodium and water25 increasing intra-abdominal pressure due to progressive volume overload can also contribute to further impairment of renal hemodynamics and functionin keeping with these pathophysiologic mechanisms an accumulating body of evidence has established positive fluid balance as a strong and independent predictor of poor outcomes in the critically ill2628 for example a large international study on more than 1800 patients with sepsis found that a higher cumulative fluid balance 3 days after icu admission was proportionately associated with an increased risk of death29 similarly the sepsis occurrence in acutely ill patients soap study on more than 1100 patients with sepsis from 198 european icus reported positive fluid balance as an independent risk factor for mortality30 further supporting this notion is the observation that achieving a negative fluid balance in volume-overloaded patients with sepsis is associated with improvement in survival rates27with the increase in our understanding of the adverse consequences of aggressive fluid administration and volume overload several studies have tried to compare a conservative fluid or deresuscitation ie active removal of fluid strategy with a standard care or liberal fluid strategy in critically ill patients233132 while a comprehensive review of these studies is beyond the scope of this article improved outcomes have generally been reported with conservative or deresuscitative fluid strategies in patients with sepsis or ards33importantly there has also been greater recognition of phases of shock and the importance of a dynamic approach that takes into consideration the distinct clinical characteristics of each phase the widely accepted international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock ie surviving sepsis campaign which have gone through much scrutiny and updates emphasize early fluid resuscitation 30 mlkg within the first 3 h34 recently vincent et al proposed separating management of shock into four distinct phases rescue optimization stabilization and de-escalation16 while the primary focus of the first phase is to reach the minimum effective blood volume through fluid administration the main goal of the de-escalation phase is to reach a negative fluid balance interestingly not only has early fluid resuscitation been shown to reduce mortality in patients with sepsis35 but earlier negative volume balance during the de-escalation phase is also associated with an improved survival rate27 in support of this notion murphy et al reported that among patients with acute lung injury secondary to septic shock those who received both adequate initial fluid resuscitation as well as conservative late fluid management ie negative to even fluid balance on 2 consecutive days during the first week after sepsis had the best survival rates compared with those who achieved only one of these goals or neither of the two36 therefore a dynamic approach and optimal timing ie early administration followed by early termination or active removal appear to be the key in fluid resuscitation of patients with sepsis it remains to be explored whether more precise assessment of volume status through invasive methods eg central venous pressure measurement or pulmonary arterial catheterization or noninvasive techniques eg bioimpedance spectroscopy or cardiac echography can prove helpful in certain subsets of patients such as those with preexisting heart failure or renal dysfunctionwhile fluid management goals beyond the resuscitation or salvage phase of critical illness remain the subject of considerable uncertainty it is clear that reaching an even or negative fluid balance in the de-escalation phase would be crucial in order to avoid complications associated with lingering congestion loop diuretics are often used to counter positive fluid balance in icu patients37 studies evaluating the impact of loop diuretics in the icu have yielded inconsistent results with some showing benefit38 others reporting no benefit39 and some suggesting harm40 interestingly in a recent study on 14896 patients librio et al found that loop diuretic use in critically ill patients with positive fluid balance was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation41 since patients receiving diuretics had a serum bicarbonate level of 2 meql above others and metabolic alkalosis can reduce the neural respiratory drive and minute ventilation the authors argued that the metabolic side effect of diuretics could contribute to the observed mechanical ventilation weaning difficulties4142in the face of positive fluid balance during the de-escalation phase of sepsis management one might consider earlier application of renal replacement therapy rrt especially in those patients with more severe volume overload progressive metabolic alkalosis with diuretic use suboptimal diuretic response or diuretic refractoriness and development of oliguric aki in light of evidence on the detrimental impact of rrt use for treatment of sepsis through clearance of inflammatory mediators and cytokines43 rrt should be considered only if indicated for optimization of volume status or treatment of azotemia while a modality that provides clearance eg continuous venovenous hemofiltration will be needed for those cases with progressive renal function impairment isolated ultrafiltration is an optimal strategy that primarily focuses on fluid extraction and optimization of volume status extraction of sodium-rich fluid represents an advantage over diuretics because use of balanced or unbalanced fluids during the salvage phase is associated with significant sodium loading while urine generated with the use of diuretics typically remains hypotonic portable ultrafiltration devices could prove particularly helpful in that their extremely small extracorporeal volume ie 35 ml will help avoid a potential adverse hemodynamic impact in the critically ill moreover the predictability of the fluid extraction will make it more likely to achieve the precise goal for the de-escalation process44applying the aforementioned general concepts of management to specific features of covid-19 is the key for optimized therapy plans pulmonary involvement can rapidly progress in a significant subset of these patients in a study on 416 patients with covid-19 shi et al reported the incidence of ards as high as 23345 in addition to respiratory failure and shock the course of the critically ill patients with covid-19 is characterized by some patients developing refractory heart failure with features of cardiogenic shock6 it remains unclear whether this results from direct myocardial damage by infection stress cardiomyopathy similar to other forms of shock or right heart failure due to prolonged ards myocardial injury identified by elevated cardiac biomarkers was reported among early cases in china in a study of 138 hospitalized patients with covid-19 cardiac injury elevated high-sensitivity troponin i or new electrocardiographic or echocardiographic abnormalities was present in 22 of the patients who required icu care46 the concomitant increase in other inflammatory biomarkers eg d-dimer ferritin and interleukin-6 implies that the rise in high-sensitivity troponin i is more reflective of cytokine storm or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis than isolated cardiac injury similar to the kidney there has been a yet not well-studied proposal for direct viral injury ie myocarditis through ace-2dependent entry of the sars-cov2 into cardiomyocytes a few cases of covid-19 have been reported where the patients predominantly presented with cardiac manifestations and cardiogenic shock4748 histological findings have not been reported in such cases yet as respiratory failure worsens there is a need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to hypoxemia and distributive and cardiogenic shock49 the large majority of mortality in these patients is attributed to respiratory failure and shock6these observationsthe frequent development of ards and the possibility of cardiac dysfunction in addition to active expanding lung infiltratesmake it crucial for physicians to be vigilant with fluid management strategies we should remain mindful that fluid resuscitation exerts its potentially therapeutic effect mainly by increasing the stressed volume of the circulation leading to improved venous return and cardiac output if these effects are not anticipated due to concomitant pathophysiologic mechanisms eg onslaught of cytokine storm and declining cardiac function aggressive fluid administration is likely to result in volume overload and its extensive adverse consequences in patients with already diminished respiratory reserve due to pulmonary infiltrates it has been reported that a restricted initial resuscitation strategy ie preventing overload might be advantageous compared to fluid removal after more liberal administration50 a proactive and collaborative approach to achieve a negative fluid balance is also warranted once the patients clinical status is deemed stabilized in addition to the aforementioned benefits of rrt in this setting rapid device deployment capability and ease of use of the dedicated ultrafiltration machines eg possibility of using peripheral venous access can be advantageous as the number of infected patients is rapidly escalating worldwide with overutilization of available resourcesthe outbreak of covid-19 is undoubtedly one of the most challenging global health care problems in recent years yet due to its explosive nature and resource utilization potential it can help us refine our skills and reconsider our approaches constantly reminding ourselves of the currently available evidence on fluid resuscitation strategies and judiciously applying those principles to the specific features of this disease as we learn them eg high percentage of heart failure volume overload and circulatory failure is likely to help optimize the care of these patientsthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus composed of a single stranded positive-sense rna the specifics of the detailed pathobiology and human cellular interactions have been described previously 1 2 3 4 this virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2ace2 a cellular transmembrane homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme ace in order to enter most human cell lines including pneumocytes and those in the cardiovascular system 4 consequently in addition to the eponymous respiratory complications covid-19 is associated with increased vascular thrombosis myocardial inflammation arrhythmia and potentially increased risk for adverse outcomes in patients with htn 5 in a recent meta-analysis of 6560 patients from 30 studies htn was associated with an increased composite poor outcome which included mortality acute respiratory disease syndrome need for intensive care and disease progression in patients with covid-19 6 other studies have shown similar findings of the deleterious effects of covid-19 patients with htn 7 8 yet it remains unclear how contemporary guideline recommendations may be impacted in the setting of the covid-19 pandemicmoreover the current public health crisis of covid-19 has already impacted patients with htn from multiple aspects approximately 15 million people in the us lost their employment-based health insurance coverage directly affecting patients with htn and other chronic conditions 9 coverage losses are likely the steepest in states without medicaid expansion under the patient protection and affordable care act unfortunately access to health coverage is most deficient in states with the largest racialethnic disparities in cardiovascular care potentially impacting adherence and medication affordability 10 11 specifically african americans may suffer worse outcomes related to covid-19 exposure due to a variety of reasons including socioeconomic factors and limited health access 12this review will compare and contrast contemporary evidence-based guidelines for the prevention and treatment of htn the 2017 american college of cardiologyamerican heart association accaha guideline for the prevention detection evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults the 2018 european society of cardiologyeuropean society of hypertension escesh guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension the 2019 national institute for health and care excellence nice hypertension in adults and the 2020 international society of hypertension ish global hypertension practice guidelines accordingly this review will summarize current best practices in htn management taken into account the current covid-19 pandemic emerging data on diagnosis and bp monitoring and evidence-based treatment of certain special populations including related to raceethnicity guidelines-directed medical care will provide best strategies to battle the acute and long-term cardiac complications of htn across diverse populations in the covid-19 era and beyondhtn the most widely prevalent and potent risk factor for atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease ascvd and associated microvascular complications affects an estimated 14 billion people worldwide disproportionately so in low- and middle-income countries globally upwards to 1 in 4 men and 1 in 5 women have the chronic htn 13 14 consequently htn is the leading global cause of mortality accounting for 104 million deaths per year and a major cause of premature death worldwide 15 regarding systolic blood pressures sbp there are over 78 million deaths and 140000 million disease adjusted life years dalys attributed to a sbp  140mmhg alone 13 14 15as well there are unique considerations and persistent world-wide disparities in htn death and morbidity in specific populations such as related to racialethnicity female sex advanced age and socioeconomic status recent data from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc noted a significantly higher prevalence of uncontrolled htn among us racialethnic minority groups compared with non-hispanic whites 16 the prevalence of self-reported htn in 2017  14090 mmhg was much higher in non-hispanic blacks african americans and american indians 40 vs 37 respectively than the self-reported prevalence of htn in hispanics and whites 28 vs 29 respectively 16 after the introduction of the 2017 accaha and multi-society high blood pressure hbp guidelines the prevalence of htn increased from 32 in the us to 46 using a bp threshold for htn  13080 mmhg further disproportionately affecting blacks and older individuals 17 due to the increasing prevalence of htn in younger patients the us preventive task force recommendations now support office bp screening in patients 18 years of age and older 18 therefore there may be further disparate prevalence among various groups with htn as time progressesthis review evaluates current recommended lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy within the major guidelines and the ongoing efforts to combat the challenges of htn management in the setting of covid-19 although recommended in evidence-based guidelines the covid-19 pandemic has limited physical activity secondary to social distancing home quarantining and fitness center shutdowns 19 moreover the covid-19 pandemic has forced the practice of medicine into a new paradigm where telehealth technologies and self-monitoring techniques have developed more prominent roles for clinical management of htn and ascvd risk reductioncurrent guidelines despite major and minor differences serve as tools for the advancement of standard of care recommendations in clinical practice including specific populations usually with a regional emphasis the 2017 accaha recommendations for tighter bp control were supported by several sources including several meta-analyses of observational cohorts associated with a significantly higher range of hazard ratios 11-15 for cardiovascular disease cvd and stroke with sbpdbp  120-12980-84mmhg as compared to 12080mmhg 17 20 furthermore data for the benefit of tighter bp control also emerged from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial sprint this national institute of health landmark trial was a large randomized control study which evaluated the benefits of intensive bp goals 120 mmhg compared with standard treatment goals 140 mmhg 21 as a result of an overwhelming positive effect sprint was stopped early after demonstrating a 25 and 27 relative risk reduction rrr in the primary endpoint and all-cause mortality in the intensive bp lowering group compared to standard treatment hr 075 95 ci 064-089 hr 073 95 ci 060-090 respectively thus the prospect of encouraging patients and providers in the us to manage htn more intensively was recommended to decrease end-organ damage and mortalitythe 2018 escesh htn guidelines reflected a broad scope intended for the treatment of hypertensive individuals in countries with various socioeconomic populations 22 the prevalence of htn 14090 mmhg in central and eastern europe is approximately 30-45 affecting over 150 million adults with an increasing prevalence of up to 60 in adults of advanced age instead of focusing on tighter bp control the escesh guidelines defined htn as the level of bp at which the benefits of treatment whether lifestyle interventions or medications outweighed the risks recommendations were based on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials rcts in which treatment of stage i bp values of 14090 mmhg were considered beneficial 22 moreover utilizing older and high-risk cohort studies may increase statistical power over a shorter duration of follow-up these differences in the type of evidence used between the 2017 accaha and the 2018 escesh guidelines may provide clarity as to why the bp thresholds for htn vary between the reportsmost recently published are the nices hypertension in adults in 2019 and the 2020 ish report 23 24 the nice guidelines only reviewed evidence beyond the year 2000 reflecting the current use of electronic bp devices however both guidelines use the sbpdbp threshold of 14090 mmhg to define stage i htn the 2020 ish proposes htn guidelines for global use fit for low and high resource settings by advising essential and optimal standards in a concise and easy to use format therefore the overarching goal of contemporary htn development is to reduce the adverse outcomes in the populations of interest and regional differences often inhibit complete uniformityalthough the cvd morbidity and mortality of increased bp is linear direct and continuous the definition of htn varies among guidelines 
table 1

the current recommendations in general provide bp thresholds based on average measurements in an office setting the rationale for these categorizations is determined primarily by in-office observational data related to the association of sbpdbp and cvd risk randomized-controlled trials rcts of lifestyle modifications to lower bp and rcts of medication therapy to reduce bp 17 the 2018 escesh htn definition characterizes optimal bp defined as sbp  120 mmhg and dbp  80mmhg on the other hand this level of blood pressure is considered normal by the 2017 accaha definitions 17 table 1
the nice and ish publications use similar thresholds for the definitions of htn 14090 mmhg the bp for a visit is determined by the average of at least two measurements in the clinic setting at least one minute apart if the final bp measurement is between 14090 and 180120 mmhg the nice and ish guidelines recommend offering ambulatory blood pressure monitoring abpm to confirm the diagnosis 23 24 additionally all of the reviewed guidelines strongly recommend the utilization of out-of-office bp measurements for monitoring andtitration antihypertensive therapies the various reports reviewed herein support the initial or concomitant use of nonpharmacological interventions for most patients which include lifestyle modifications of dietary and activity levels prior to medications in most individuals to reduce bp valuesthe accurate measurement of in-office and out-of-office bp is crucial in htn diagnosis and management although the traditional use of devices calibrated to a column of mercury is still utilized in some regions most guidelines report recommendations from data using electronic devices for bp monitoring all of the guidelines recommend validated devices whether electronic or manual 25 26 the us blood pressure validated device listing vdltm was the first us list of blood pressure bp measurement devices developed to assist physicians and patients in identifying bp devices that are validated for clinical accuracy bp devices listed on the vdltm have specific criteria detailed as determined through independent review visit validatebporg to view the current device listings for more information on the independent review process 27 the escesh guidelines recommend validated devices by the association of medical instrumentation 26as errors in bp measurements are common in most settings the htn guidelines all thoroughly describe protocols to obtain accurate results 28 bp is measured in both arms to detect any differences in the first office visit most guidelines recommend using the arm with the higher bp reading for a subsequent visit all of the reviewed guidelines suggest taking the bp 2-3 times separated by at least 1 minute apart averaging at least two of the readings for the final result the escesh and nice guidelines also suggest measuring the standing bp at least once after standing for 1 minute to determine the likelihood of orthostatic bp changes 22 29 all guidelines also suggest measuring bp in at least two separate office visits to diagnose htn before any interventions are recommended expert panels of the aha and acc have published recent scientific statements evaluating the accuracy of bp measurements in further detail emphasizing the need for proper and ongoing training of technicians and healthcare providers for the use of validated devices 28 30the reviewed htn guidelines acknowledge the benefits of abpm and home blood pressure monitoring hbpm and provide strong recommendations of these techniques to confirm the diagnosis of htn and monitor medication adjustments hbpm is an alternative to confirm the diagnosis of htn if abpm is not possible the technology for abpm has been available for many years and is recommended by the accaha eshesc nice and ish guidelines with similar protocols suggested for use abpm has a stronger association with hypertension-related target-organ damage and adverse clinical outcomes 30the abpm devices usually measure bp every 15-30 minutes during the day and every 15 minutes to 1 hour during the night over a 24-hour period there are bp correlate values to in-office setting bp measurements within the guidelines for htn management to assist with htn management 
table ii
 abpm is also useful to detect certain bp phenotypes of htn that may confer increased cvd risk white-coat htn occurs when individuals demonstrate higher bp measurements in the office setting when compared with measurements outside of the office the white-coat effect is a term used to describe the same phenomenon in patients having a history of htn and receiving antihypertensive medications 26 although the data are limited there may be a modest increase in cvd risks for patients experiencing these conditions most studies demonstrating an increased cvd risk are in patients with other cvd risk factors that could explain the higher risk 31 32 the guidelines also reference terminology of isolated office htn and other subclasses of htn although these conditions are not covered extensively within this review 17 22 24abpm has also been used to detect masked htn which refers to individuals demonstrating a mean out-of-office bp in the hypertensive range and normal bp measurements in an office setting the escesh guidelines suggest incorporation of nighttime bp measurements with daytime readings for this diagnosis although most guidelines use daytime readings of abpm 22 30 incorporation of nighttime readings also increases the detection and prevalence rates of masked htn in blacks associated with higher rates of declining renal function 33 34despite the evidence supporting the use of abpm in htn management several issues limit its use and availability for patients the monitoring requires proper training of patients and providers as well as compliance of use to provide accurate and helpful information the reimbursement rates for the utilization of abpm is historically low representing 1 of medicare beneficiary claims in some studies 35 there are also only modest data supporting better outcomes with the treatment of white-coat or masked htn outside of standard treatment of existing cvd risk factors further investigations as to whether abpm can specify individuals requiring additional treatments to reduce cvd risk may be warrantedas recommended in all contemporary guidelines hbpm and self-monitored blood pressure smbp outside the office are considered a more practical alternative to abpm the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq found strong evidence that smbp plus additional support defined below was more effective than usual care in lowering blood pressure among patients with htn 36 37 smbp protocols are likely to become much more useful in htn control as the covid-19 pandemic continues to direct current day medical carepublic health organizations have recognized the devastating effects of htn on the us population and have developed several initiatives to utilize the techniques of smbp to manage cvd outcomes for htn the million hearts 2022 is a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes within 5 years through the implementation of evidence-based strategies that can improve cardiovascular health for all this effort recognizes the use of out-of-office bp monitoring and recommends use of these strategies according to the best evidence 36 the targetbp national initiative formed by the aha and the american medical association also assists health care organizations and care teams at no cost in improving bp control rates through a quality improvement program 38 these large-scale efforts will provide new insights into the challenges and management of adherence with bp recommendations for all populations within the usin general the use of hbpmsmbp have been recommended by several societies and most recently as a potential means to manage htn during the covid-19 outbreak in conjunction with the 2020 surge in telehealth 13 18 39 it is likely these bp measuring methods will become more useful over time as the readings outside of the office may decrease the prevalence of white-coat hypertension and inconsistent readings within office measurements these measures in conjunction with advancing telehealth services have the potential to provide more responsibility for the patients htn management thus the increasing steps to use out of office bp monitoring and telehealth services may indirectly increase patient engagement and health literacymany health centers and medical practices have quickly introduced more pronounced telehealth services into the current models of care management which is ideal at this time several barriers to overcome include payment and regulatory structures state licensing and credentialing across health centers 40 yet the use of remote patient monitoring patient-initiated messaging telephone visits and video visits are within the reach of telehealth medicine should be beneficial for bp control in a large population effort wosik and colleagues suggest the covid-19 pandemic will stimulate the need for telehealth services in significant shifts or phases of care phase i or the initial outpatient management of conditions such as htn with the stay at home order has already begun as some health centers have increased the need for telehealth services to as much as 70 of total outpatient visits phase ii is described as the telehealth needs during inpatient related surge through the use of network care management and e-consultations phase iii is considered the post-pandemic recovery period which is still unknown at this time the authors appropriately discuss the issues in delayed care for serious non-covid-19 related medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes which has already occurred in many communities a care debt is described as well from the first two phases and will likely require intense sustained telehealth efforts 41in addition mobile health services may become a preferred method of htn management during and post the covid-19 pandemic particularly in poorer populations with less health care access mobile health interventions for htn usually involve the use of a patients mobile phone along with a validated bp measuring device to track and communicate measurements with providers a recent meta-analysis of eleven randomized controlled trials 4271 participants associated significantly lower systolic and diastolic bp measurements with the use of mobile health interventions in patients with htn 42 these findings were consistent through study duration and treatment intervention intensity within the trials further investigations involving nonpharmacologic interventions and modes of patient engagement may increase the effectiveness of future mobile and telehealth bp interventionstherapeutic lifestyle changes are necessary to prevent poor cvd outcomes with htn all of the major htn guidelines support interventions of weight-control weight loss if necessary sodium restriction smoking cessation regular physical activity healthy diet and limiting alcohol consumption to reduce blood pressure in all individuals 
table 3
 17 22 29 however the dietary approaches to stop hypertension dash pattern appears most effective to yield significant reductions in bp for all individuals blacks with reductions of sbp as high as 20mmhg slowing the decline of renal dysfunction and for weight loss with overweight status 43 44 45increased potassium intake 3500-5000 mgday aside from following the dash diet is recommended by the accaha to provide further reductions in bp 2-5 mmhg for hypertensive individuals 17 dietary supplementation of potassium can help further lower blood pressure by easing tension on blood vessel walls behavioral therapies such as yoga and meditation effectively reduce blood pressure 24 additionally the 2019 accaha guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and a report from the american society of preventive cardiology aspc support the benefits of therapeutic lifestyle interventions for bp control 13 46additionally mediterranean diet meddiet may have a favorable effect on the risk of htn in contrast to unfavorable dietary patterns such as red meat processed meat and poultry47 the meddiet or dash diet are also likely beneficial over the western diet wd in relation to covid-19 susceptibility as the high rate of consumption of saturated fats sugars and refined carbohydrates in the wd contribute to the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes t2d potentially increasing the risk for severe covid-19 pathology and mortality 48patient engagement in addition to nonpharmacologic interventions will likely require more emphasis during and post covid-19 as the prevalence of htn could increase over time with decreased activity and attention to diet the need for health coaching by clinicians and members of the community may increase in order to initiate or maintain adherence to nonpharmacologic bp interventions a recent meta-analysis comparing implementation strategies for htn control evaluated a total of 55 920 patients which included studies evaluating the use of patient-level health coaching health coaching was associated with a significant reduction in blood pressure over a minimum of 6 months -39 mmhg 95 ci -54 to -23 mmhg 49 thus multilevel interventions including patient-level strategies are likely to become more important in the treatment of htn during and after the covid-19 pandemicnonadherence affecting as much as 80 of patients with htn increases the associated risk for cvd morbidity and mortality with approximately one of every four patients not filling their initial prescription 17 24 the major htn guidelines equally recognize the economic burden of htn medications increasing nonadherence 50 in a recent study 67 of patients who do not experience financial barriers to pharmacotherapy are more likely adherent and have normal bp within the past 12 months 50 51 52 53 there are promising data using highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry biochemical measurements of drug levels in the serum or urine as a surrogate of compliance 54 55 although these measurements are now available for clinical use and covered by some insurance plans more research is warranted for determining the effect on large populations and mainstream useguideline-recommended strategies include adherence feedback to the patient hbpmsbpm linkage of behavior with daily habits electronic aids such as mobile phones and reduction of polypharmacy utilizing a single pill combination is possible 24 46 56 
table 4
 as most patients will often require more than one antihypertensive agent to control bp fixed-dose combinations fdc pills for htn are supported by the major guidelines 17 22 24 a recent meta-analysis of 62481 patients with htn reported a mean medication adherence difference of 15 in patients receiving fdc medications vs free separate equivalent dose pills 57 many common fdc htn therapies are included in formularies at reduced co-pays and may attenuate htn management costs during the covid-19 pandemic and beyondthe polypill concept including htn and lipid drugs may help reduce prescribing complexities for cvd prevention 58 59 60 a recent randomized controlled polypill atorvastatin 10mg amlodipine 25 mg losartan 25 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 125 mg trial involving adults with a cvd risk of 10 demonstrated significant bp and ldl reduction at 12 months versus standard care of participants at a federally qualified community health center in alabama 61 the mean estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk was 127 for the participants with a mean baseline blood pressure ldl cholesterol of 14083 mmhg and 113 mg per deciliter respectively the monthly cost of the polypill was 26 at 12 months polypill adherence was 86 the mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 9 mm hg in the polypill group as compared with 2 mmhg in the usual-care group difference -7 mm hg 95 confidence interval ci -12 to -2 p  0003 61as previously noted telehealth prior to the covid-19 pandemic had been heralded as a potential advancement in successful htn and cvd risk management moreover due to safety concerns the covid-19 pandemic required telemedicine for routine outpatient visits significantly affecting htn and other chronic medical condition management initiatives such as million hearts 2022 and target bp have emphasized the importance of sbpm with continual patient and provider feedback in addition the centers of medicare and medicaid services cms recently published reimbursement information for telephone and other monitoring services 62 see
table 5
 as a significant amount of time and detail must be devoted to these modes of communication and assessment it is important that providers receive adequate compensation therefore cms expanded telephone consultation payment on a temporary and emergency basis under the 1135 waiver authority and coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act particularly for high-risk covid-19 beneficiaries and with widespread availability of smart phones telehealth may become future standard medical practice 6263nevertheless the use of digital technology may further increase disparities a recent study evaluating telehealth in cardiac clinics suggested disparate use of video encounters in low income and black patients 64 of the 2940 patients scheduled for a telehealth encounter during the study 1339 46 completed telehealth encounters and 1601 54 patients had a canceledno-show visit on unadjusted analysis patients with a completed telehealth visit were slightly older more likely to be male and speak english however low income and black patients were less likely to video visits possibly related to insurance coverage 64 more investigation is warranted in the future to understand the risks and benefits of video telehealth encounters to enhance cardiac carealthough each guideline provides specific comments for the management of special populations including persons with diabetes dm and certain involving raceethnicity sex and older age this review will only detail various aspects of care for certain groups 17 22 24 29 65 the vast majority of adults with dm have 10-years ascvd risk  10 placing them in a high-risk category however in the most recent ada recommendations patients with dm and a 10-year ascvd risk 15 should maintain a target of 14090 mmhg with 13080 mmhg for the highest risk patients 66 in accaha 2017 and other major guidelines antihypertensive drug treatment with diabetes should be initiated at a bp of 13080 mmhg or higher with a treatment goal of 13080 mmhg 1767 moreover major guidelines recommend the addition of renin-angiotensin modulators including an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ace-i or angiotensin receptor blockers arb in the setting of compelling comorbid issues such as diabetes with albuminuria renal dysfunction or hf 17 22 24 66 67the accaha escesh and ish guidelines discuss the significance of raceethnicity in htn management in the us as well as globally black ancestry may be associated with a higher prevalence of htn than that of hispanic americans whites native americans and other groups 17 22 24 in some parts of the world htn prevalence is greater than 60 among blacks 15 68 in comparison to the us the prevalence of htn in the black population in europe is higher than the non-black population the escesh guidelines emphasize the data are scarce for the european black populations and extrapolate much of their recommendations from us studies 22 non-hispanic us white adults are more likely to have a higher prevalence of controlled htn when compared to other groups the lower rates of control in hispanic americans are likely secondary to decreased awareness however american blacks have lower controlled rates due to more severe htn and possibly to less effective treatments 17thiazide-type diuretics and calcium channel blockers ccbs are most effective as the first step in lowering bp and stroke in blacks although ace-i and arb are less effective in blacks as monotherapy when compared to whites combination therapy is equally effective in whites and blacks 51 69 70 perhaps due to suppression of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system ace-i and arb may not only lower bp less effectively but also for the prevention of heart failure and stroke 69 70 71 ace-i are also associated with a higher incidence of angioedema in blacks and arbs are recommended over an ace-i by the escesh and ish guidelines for htn treatment in combination with a diuretic or ccbs the accaha escesh and ish guidelines recommend two or more antihypertensive medications to achieve adequate bp control in blacks with a diuretic or ccbs used as first-line agents patients with bp that is 2010 mmhg above target may be considered for combination therapy at treatment onset given resistant hypertension rhtn is more common in african american patients multidrug pharmacological therapy may be often indicated 17 22 24the ish guidelines acknowledge ethnic-specific characteristics for east and south asian populations who have a greater likelihood of salt-sensitivity accompanied with mild obesity 24 east asians also have a higher prevalence of hemorrhagic stroke and nonischemic heart failure when compared to western populations associated with morning or nighttime htn individuals from the indian subcontinent have high risks for cvd and type 2dalthough of considerable interest special populations related to sex and older age are not detailed in this review although detailed in the accaha and escesh guidelines 17 22 furthermore the ish guidelines also provide extensive recommendations for the treatment of htn in pregnancy whereas this area is covered in supplementary documents for the others 24 most recently aronow extensively reviewed the management of htn in the elderly 65 overall recognizing unique aspects in the treatment of various populations including regional differences is an important component for optimal careaccording to the most recent data from the world health organization covid-19 has infected over 111 million people responsible for over 528000 deaths worldwide 72 further clinical observation may be required to determine the long-term risk of covid-19 and htn the devastating effects of covid-19 have also disproportionately affected several vulnerable populations including those with certain comorbid diseases advanced age and lower socioeconomic status covid-19 also has the potential to impact cvd outcomes via a domino effect which is initiated by social fears and issues stemming from social distancing due to concerns of visiting hospital facilities patients may not present for outpatient and emergent care needed such as with acute coronary syndromes furthermore physical inactivity and unhealthy eating due to home quarantine status along with the social stressors related to increasing unemployment may increase the rates of htn obesity and cvd events in years to come 73despite the early concern that aceiarb therapy would worsen outcomes by upregulating ace2 ras inhibitors may actually improve the clinical status of covid-19 patients with hypertension and may even be preferential for antihypertensive treatment 2 74 75 76 in a recent study of 417 covid-19 patients with htn from china the data suggest aceiarb therapy attenuated the inflammatory response potentially through the inhibition of il-6 levels which is consistent with the findings that acei and arb therapy alleviated pneumonic injury 77 perhaps aceiarb therapy has a beneficial effect on the immune system by avoiding peripheral t cell depletion thereby allowing for a better immune response to the virus in these patientsas the standards of practice the heart failure society of america acc aha and american society of preventive cardiology currently recommend the continuation of ras inhibitors with compelling complications such as heart failure hypertension or ischemic heart disease 3978 moreover abrupt withdrawal of ras inhibitors in high-risk patients including those who have heart failure or have had recent myocardial infarction may result in clinical instability and adverse health outcomes 79on the other hand dihydropyridines ccbs nifedipine and amlodipine may be a benefit for the treatment of hypertensive patients with covid-19 in a retrospective analysis a small cohort of elderly hypertensive patients treated with a ccb during a covid-19 infection had a significantly higher survival rate and were much less likely to require mechanical intubation 50 vs 146 respectively as compare to those not on ccbs 80 although further clinical studies are warranted the data are promising that treatment of a ccb in hypertensive patients with covid-19 may significantly improve outcomescurrent guideline recommendations emphasize the importance of evidence-based care to curtail the widespread mortality and morbidity related to htn and associated ascvd additionally the acute and long-term effects of covid-19 may influence treatment in the hypertensive population and require further investigation the importance of unifying recommendations that help to curve the burden of htn may become more significant in the coming years as we learn more about new treatments and the long-term effects of the current covid-19 crisis the covid-19 associated morbidity and mortality including patients with underlying htn and cvd are likely to have profound impact for several decades due to the worldwide medical economic and psychological effects however although contemporary guidelines suggest benefits of the use of telehealth technologies and out-of-office medical management as recently required by the covid-19 pandemic these evolving techniques will be increasingly used for htn control and cvd risk control ultimately future htn guidelines may increasingly reflect the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the utility of measures such as smbphbmp over timethe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in

47coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 is the condition caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-2-cov-2 infections which is now prevalent in all 50 states with clustering of cases in major cities in new york michigan california and new jersey covid-19 that was initially thought to be the great equalizerno discrimination with who can become infectednow reveals patterns of disparities for low-income persons and racial and ethnic minority populations this novel coronavirus which results in increased rates of respiratory failure and death among infected individuals1 2 is found to disproportionally affect those with comorbidities such as diabetes heart disease and asthma these conditions are known to disproportionately affect minorities who are already impacted by health disparitieseven before covid-19 health disparities were pervasive in the usa we define disparities as differences in healthcare utilization and health outcomes among distinct social groups3 emerging data show that racialethnic minorities and those from the working class have worse health outcomes due to covid-19 in chicago blacks comprise 30 of the citys population but 70 of covid-19 deaths based on our personal experience and data from our health system covid-19 is uncovering disparities embedded within our society in this paper we identify areas in which covid-19 is exacerbating existing disparities and offer potential solutions to address these disparitiesstructural barriers contributed to disparities in covid-19 testing and diagnosis in the early weeks of the pandemic one of the major issues with diagnosing covid-19 is limited testing availability initially testing was centralized and there were few testing sites to control the number of patients presenting for tests residents in new york were required to obtain a doctors prescription previous studies have shown that racialethnic minorities are less likely to have access to a primary care provider4 thus this requirement may have served as structural barrier in obtaining covid-19 testing then the state implemented drive-thru testing to increase the number of patients receiving tests but this required access to a vehicle though the intention was to control the number of patients getting tested through prescriptions and drive-thru testing patients without a doctor or without access to a vehicle were less likely to be tested controlling access to tests in this way likely disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities and those who rely on public transportation furthermore if a patient has a high clinical suspicion for covid-19 infection but lacks a primary care provider or vehicle their only recourse is to seek testing in an emergency room given the cost of emergency room copays some patients have to decide whether to pay to get evaluated for testing or monitor their symptoms at home additionally covid-19 results are available 7 to 10 days after and during this time patients again encounter a dilemma whether to quarantine themselves at home or go to work therefore having an established policy for free and easily accessible covid-19 testing would reduce the impact of the structural barriers to testing and in turn minimize disparitieswe are witnessing unintended consequences of the covid-19 outbreak patients with non-covid-19 medical conditions avoid healthcare to reduce the risk of covid-19 exposure as hospitals are filled with patients who test positive for covid-19 covid-19-negative patients with existing medical conditions are more susceptible to complications of those conditions cardiologists are noticing a reduction in the number of patients with heart attacks and those who are presenting with heart attacks are having worse outcomes surgeons also observe patients that require surgical interventions are presenting with gangrene or with increased risk of surgical complications patients from racial and ethnic minorities have an increased prevalence of common medical conditions compared to non-hispanic whites and a high percentage of them have undiagnosed common medical conditions4 to reduce disparities arising from the management of both covid-19 and non-covid disease outcomes it is critical to develop testing to rapidly assess covid-19 status isolate covid-19 patients from non-covid patients and efficiently manage non-covid-19 diseasespublic health recommendations to contain covid-19 can worsen disparities due to a lack of resources and underlying institutional racism to reduce the spread of covid-19 states have implemented various procedures including social distancing wearing masks in public areas working from home and closing schools these recommendations seem sensible for containing the disease but may be difficult to implement depending on ones social situation access to masks has been difficult given the nationwide shortage of masks also wearing a mask has been associated with having the diseases and in some instances society may perceive criminality when none exists when the government communicates ambiguous messages about wearing masks to reduce covid-19 infection it is difficult for the public especially racial and ethnic minorities and the working class to interpret and adopt the recommendation therefore it is important to have clear recommendations to ensure general public safetysocial distancing has contributed to decreased expected mortality a positive outcome but negative impacts will be the hardest among the working class in new york bus drivers limit the number of passengers riding each bus to respect social distancing rules during a phone conversation a patient stated that this practice would effectively double his travel time to the clinic for a doctors visit he usually rides two buses but with limits to the maximum number of people allowed he more often needs to wait for the next bus considering that new york city public transportation is now running on a weekend schedule those who rely on public transportation experience significantly longer travel times and an increased risk of exposure during the pandemic this becomes more problematic if someone is an asymptomatic carrier of the viruslastly we are anticipating significant disparities arising from the lack of health insurance due to one of the highest unemployment rates in history in the coming months this will have a significant impact on healthcare utilization and health outcomes the longer the covid-19 outbreak persists the more employees will be at a risk of becoming furloughed in the beginning of the outbreak a television news anchor suggested that people should receive their health checkups now while they still have their health insurance as the majority of people in the usa obtain their health insurance through their employer given the increase in unemployment it is unclear what will happen in situations when these uninsured patients need medical care also those without health insurance will no longer receive routine checkups cancer screening and disease management visits this likely will result in a widening of the disparity gap in the long term especially among vulnerable populationsthough present before the pandemic health disparities may increase after our society begins to recover from covid-19 until covid-19 becomes eradicated or a vaccine is developed society must combat this disease as one to minimize mortality complications and social consequences ie unemployment arising from this disease it is imperative that rapid covid-19 screening be freely available to the general public and those who have an increased risk of exposure only then can we elevate the care for all medical conditions and mitigate the health disparities arising from covid-19 though covid-19 is not the great equalizer based on disparities in outcomes our response can result in more equitable access to care for all segments of the populationon 17 march 2020 a 69yearold lady presented to the emergency department feeling generally unwell with a cough she reported a 1week history of fevers associated with shortness of breath blood cultures taken on admission revealed staphylococcus aureus on culture and she initially tested negative for coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 on an oronasopharyngeal reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rtpcr swab test at the referring institution the patient was febrile 384c with a heart rate of 84 she was saturating at 96 a respiratory rate of 18 with no supplemental oxygen and clinically very stable from a respiratory point of view physical examination was unremarkable except for an ejection systolic murmur there was no clinical evidence of heart failure she was transferred to our institution for surgical management a week laterher past medical history is significant for a tissue aortic valve replacement in 2012 23 mm hancock ii porcine valve recently diagnosed impairment of ejection fraction january 2020 of 40 while under valve surveillance and chronic back painshe was started on intravenous iv antibiotics gentamicin 70 mg and flucloxacillin 2 g to treat suspected infected endocarditis at the referring hospital initial transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a normal functioning and well seated aortic valve replacement with a reduced 40 left ventricular ejection fraction repeat transesophageal echocardiography a week later revealed vegetations on all three cusps with no significant aortic regurgitation but suspicious appearances of an early root abscess computed tomography ct on presenting admission revealed a heavily calcified prosthetic aortic valve with low attenuation material around the root with a mass effect on the anterior wall of the left atrium she was subsequently transferred to the regional cardiac surgery center for consideration of a redo aortic valve operation due to the unprecedented covid19 pandemic our institution mandated that all hospital transfer patients for consideration of surgery receive a repeat covid19 swab test as well a repeat ct thorax on arrival

on initial clinical assessment at our institution she remained clinically well with no respiratory compromise there was no orthopnea or shortness of breath on exertion she was provisionally placed on an urgent operating list for a redo aortic valve replacement pending our mandatory investigationsunfortunately she tested positive for the routine rtpcr nasopharyngeal swab for covid19 at our institution on admission she underwent a routine ct thorax which demonstrated widespread bilateral reticular enhancement of the lung parenchyma see figure 1 not seen at her referring institutions ct an urgent heart team meeting involving cardiology anesthesiology and cardiac surgeons unanimously agreed that operating in a covid19 positive patient with evidence of radiological respiratory compromise would constitute a highrisk approach despite being clinically stable this was on the basis that covid19 is as of yet an unknown disease entity and the outcomes of emergent cardiac surgery in a clinically stable patient is unpredictableinitial management involved continuing iv antibiotics and she remained stable clinically without respiratory compromise unfortunately 4 days after admission to our hospital she had a significant hemoglobin drop to 47 gl baseline of 95 gl she underwent urgent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy after transfusion which revealed a bleeding point and a dieulafoys lesion in the second part of the duodenum adrenaline and a clip were deployed to the lesion with good effect and she was started on iv pantoprazole she had no previous history of gastrointestinal gi bleedher oxygen requirements progressively increased and she was intubated 9 days after her positive swab serial bedside echocardiography showed no significant cardiac changes to her baseline function from admission she developed fast atrial fibrillation rate 120 controlled by iv amiodarone and anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin unfortunately her pneumonia got significantly worse with multiorgan failure including severe acute kidney injury requiring heparin for renal replacement therapy she developed an acute dilated left pupil on day 17 ct head revealed a large acute intracerebral hematoma with an appearance possibly secondary to the heparin and midline shift she died 18 days after her admission to our hospitalthe novel coronavirus now termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 has caused a significant global impact on the economy politics and health in the space of 4 months covid19 the clinical syndrome from the virus has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization in most cases fever is the most common presenting symptom followed by cough
2
 the natural disease process can be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome multiorgan failure and ultimately death the prevalence of covid19 in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease is underreported with evidence that preexisting cardiac disease can render patients more vulnerable to the disease process
3
 we report the first case of active prosthetic valve endocarditis complicated by covid19establishing a diagnosis of covid19 using rtpcr is not without its limitations the availability of testing clinical suspicion complicated by active endocarditis and a high falsenegative rate with the current test have made it difficult to diagnose in a timely fashion
4
 initial swab test was negative at the referring institution which raises concerns that this may have been a false negative result however contact with multiple health workers and the interhospital transfer itself may have inadvertently exposed her to iatrogenic covid19 contraction given the patients clinical history and presentation it is likely that the endocarditis almost certainly preceded covid19 rather than covid19 complicated by endocarditisct thorax changes may even precede rtpcr findings and clinical signs of covid19 as alluded to in a recent study the inclusion of ct thorax has now become part of routine preoperative cardiac surgical workup in our institution during this pandemic
5
 the standard of treatment in active prosthetic valve endocarditis with suspicion of a developing aortic root abscess almost always necessitates surgical replacement the ct findings however played an instrumental role in the heart teams decision to continue medical therapy initially as the effects of covid19 pneumonia on bypass followed by mechanical ventilation during recovery are unknown in hindsight this was most likely the correct decision given that the patient deteriorated ultimately from respiratory covid19 complications rather than a cardiac complicationrecent studies from wuhan china have suggested that covid19 could also manifest in significant abnormal coagulation parameters particularly longer prothrombin pt and activated partial thromboplastin aptt times
6
 in contrast during the sarscov1 epidemic of 2014 a higher risk of vessel thrombosis predisposed to a worse prognosis and patients were routinely anticoagulated a theme which is continuing in current patients with covid19 our patient had mildly elevated aptt 35 seconds with normal pt values throughout and it is unlikely that these would have caused her sudden gi bleed more likely it was a stress injury that precipitated an acute rupture from an existing dieulafoys lesion a welldocumented phenomenon in patients with acute hospitalization
7
 she was started on iv heparin post endoscopy for atrial fibrillation and subsequent requirement for renal replacement therapy it is postulated that her acute intracerebral bleed is likely secondary to heparin therapy based on the ct report and possibly an as yet unknown clinical disease manifestation of covid19our case highlights important facets of managing complex cardiac surgical patients during this pandemic first patients who fall into the highrisk surgical category should be discussed at an extended heart team meeting particularly during this crisis we involved radiologists in these discussions due to the addition of routine ct to help clarify image interpretation which was done remotely via video conferencing of all specialists this proved invaluable in our case where the patient initially tested negative for covid19 second it is important to be vigilant about the extracardiac clinical manifestations of covid19 whether specific or nonspecific to the covid19 disease process the role of cardiac surgery and bypass in active covid19 infection is still yet to be determined and further studies are clearly needed to determine the right approachthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsindividual consent was obtained from each patient local institutional ethical processes were followedmortality related to cardiovascular disease cvd is the single leading cause of death in the united states us and globally in high-income countries accounting for 231 of all american deaths1 furthermore hypertension htn defined as systolic blood pressure of 130 mmhg andor a diastolic blood pressure 80 mmhg is the most prevalent and potent cvd risk factor in the us affecting 454 of the adults aged 18 or older in 20172018 up from 417 in 201320142 the most recent epidemiologic data confirm that diagnosed htn is more prevalent among non-hispanic blacks compared to non-hispanic whites with 572 of adult males and 567 of adult females2 it has been established over multiple decades that htn disproportionately affects african americans compared to whites with increased cvd prevalence prematurity and severity poorer htn control and increased burden of associated risk factors including diabetes chronic kidney disease ckd physical inactivity and overweight status and obesity3 unfortunately despite advancements in risk factor identification and availability of effective htn therapies cvd disparities including premature myocardial infarction stroke peripheral arterial disease ckd end-stage renal disease ersd and heart failure persist among african americans compared to non-hispanic whites3 this review includes the most recent concepts on htn in african americans including perspectives on casual factors effective approaches and future considerations especially in the covid-19 pandemic erain consideration of the above poorly controlled htn markedly diminishes overall black life expectancy accordingly in 2017 primarily driven by uncontrolled and more severe htn the life expectancy for white females was 810 years compared to 781 years for black females and 761 for white males versus 715 years for black males figure 1

although control of htn represents the greatest opportunity for cvd prevention in african americans management of uncontrolled blood pressure bp is impeded by multiple factors including delayed diagnosis less access to insurance primary and preventative care and medication nonadherence3 many individuals for whom htn medication is recommended are untreated or undiagnosed5 tools such as the american college of cardiologyamerican heart association accaha atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd risk estimator can be used to assess an individuals 10-year risk of developing cvd with added risk calculated for patients self-identified as black however despite having similar or even greater awareness and treatment paradoxically blacks display lower htn control rates 479 in blacks compared to 56 in whites3 in addition non-hispanic blacks are more likely to be uninsured compared to non-hispanic whites6 and overall uninsured adults are less likely to be aware of and treated for htn and less likely to be controlled when treated compared to insured adults5 as the prevalence of htn increases despite extensive available pharmacologic agents in recent years us control of htn has plateaued showing no improvement in non-hispanic blacks individuals aged 60 or greater and individuals with other cvd risk factors7
cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities are shown to have increased association with htn and risk clustering has an increased prevalence in blacks common risk factors for both type 2 diabetes t2d and htn include overweightobesity status unhealthy diet and physical inactivity8

9 recent data demonstrate that approximately 74 of adults with diabetes have comorbid hypertension9 in african americans greater cvd morbidity and mortality is compounded by higher prevalence of t2d increasing diseases including ckd esrd stroke and heart failure10 the economic cost associated with the treatment and management of cvd in the us was approximately 3512 billion in 20142015 accounting for preventable costs of both healthcare and loss of productivity10
heart failure which is predominantly due to htn in blacks as opposed to coronary artery disease in whites is the leading cause of hospitalization in the medicare population11 hospital readmission costs with associated medicare reimbursement penalties in instances of 30-day readmission are particularly problematic the burden of heart failure provides an additional burden on the already strained healthcare system further emphasizing the importance of htn prevention early intervention and control12
mortality rates from 1999 to 2017 related to heart failure were studied by glynn et al13 in comparison of heart-failure related death rates of adults aged 6584 years black men and black women showed a 143-fold and 154-fold increase respectively compared to white men and white women13 notably prevalence of heart failure was markedly increased in younger black male adults13 and in younger adults aged 3564 black men had 297-fold greater increase in death rate related to heart failure consistent with other cvd complications occurring at an earlier age13
therefore these trends of increasing htn t2d and other forms of cvd are particularly devastating in blacks there are multiple causal factors for the increased prevalence and difficult to manage htn including unhealthy diet suboptimal lifestyle overall health inequity adverse social environment and potentially harmful cultural beliefs14

15 unfortunately the persistent and unacceptable high prevalence of htn and htn-related complications in african americans such as heart failure are projected to increase in the future especially in younger age groups16
recent data from the jackson heart study and the reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke regard study were analyzed including 12947 black participants to assess the association of htn and cvd authors of the study calculated the population-attributable risk and found that htn contributes to 325 of cvd in black adults specifically noting increased coincidence of coronary artery disease stroke and heart failure17 in another recent study by nambiar et al age-adjusted mortality data were assessed to observe the correlation of htn and cvd death rates their analysis demonstrated increased prevalence in mortality attributed to htn therefore underlying htn portends an upward trend in cvd associated with htn as a major public health concern18 moreover the apparent current upward cvd mortality trend appears due to other cvd comorbidities especially diabetes and obesity13
several physiologic determinants are implicated for htn in african americans including increased body mass index bmi and overweightobesity status higher salt sensitivity low plasma renin levels abnormal vascular function due to sympathetic overactivity attenuated nocturnal decrease in bp greater prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes physical inactivity and positive family history figure 2
19 however overall the increased prevalence and risk of htn is mainly due to environmental and lifestyle factors versus definitive genetic underpinningsnevertheless genetic factors have also been theorized to play a role in htn-associated risk for ckd and esrd a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the association of htn traits and apol1 risk alleles which are polymorphisms acquired for increased resistance against trypanosoma brucei infections common in sub-saharan africa20 elevated systolic bp preceded decline in glomerular filtration rate and earlier onset of htn occurred in individuals who were homozygous for the apol1 variant alleles indicating predisposition to htn and ckd20
also related to an emerging area of study dungu et al described in blacks increased incidence of hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy a genetic condition that caused by myocardial deposition amyloid of misfolded liver-produced transthyretin due to a mutation in ttr v122i21 this mutation is not due to or associated with htn per se but it is common across the african diaspora including afro-caribbean populations in the uk and variant alleles carried by up to 4 of african americans21 it is possible that the finding of increased heart failure incidence and mortality in blacks is affected by amyloid cardiomyopathy especially in older black men and is unfortunately often misdiagnosed as htn-related cardiomyopathy delaying diagnosis and application or use of newer potentially effective therapies22
beyond genetic factors development of htn and the cvd disparities that exist among african americans are influenced by a variety of interconnected risk factors including poor diet adverse lifestyle deleterious environment and social determinants according to the 2017 accaha and multisociety guidelines for the prevention detection evaluation and management of high blood pressure a diet lacking in fruits vegetables and whole grains and higher in sodium increases the risk for htn and cvd22 commonly due to traditional cultural dietary preferences for a southern diet high in sodium sugar and fats african americans face unique challenges in implementing and adhering to current dietary recommendations3 in regards study data it was demonstrated that african americans are more likely to consume a typical southern diet regardless of geographic location and the highest incidence of stroke occurs among those with the lowest adherence to a recommended diet3 in addition african americans have demonstrated increased time spent engaged in sedentary behavior compared to whites3 african americans in general are less likely to fulfill the accaha primary prevention guideline recommended 150 minwk of moderate intensity physical activity or 75 minwk of high intensity physical activity22
overall socioeconomic and environmental factors have an important influence on cardiovascular health on average african americans experience an increased rate of poverty 26 compared to the general population 15 leading to decreased access to preventative health resources such as availability of healthy foods and safe spaces for exercise3 additional psychological stressors such as income instability and coping with the effects of racial discrimination adversely affect and contribute to disparity in cvd outcomes figure 23 african americans who are less likely to be insured are also at greater risk of uncontrolled and undiagnosed hypertension due to lack of access to preventative care such as screening tools and long-term management7

22 additionally ahmad et al observed the correlation between poverty and heart failure outcomes and found that individuals with lower socioeconomic status experienced increased cvd-related hospitalization and mortality23
according to accaha and multisociety 2019 guidelines on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease for hypertension htn recommendations are concentrated on lifestyle modifications these recommendations to prevent or delay htn include weight loss adequate physical activity use of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension dash diet and reduced dietary sodium24
by the release of free fatty acids excess adipose tissue is associated with reduced arterial compliance secondary to insulin resistance this metabolic state also has an inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production25 systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials have shown that a weight reduction of 1 kg correlates to an approximate 1 mmhg reduction in systolic blood pressure sbp26 and can improve htn prevention and management by promoting the vasodilatory actions of nitric oxidedifferent types of physical activity have varying degrees of impact on blood pressure however aerobic exercise has been identified as the modality with the most significant impact on hypertension management as few as 90 min of exercise per week can cause a 58 mmhg decrease in sbp aerobic exercise has been shown to dampen excess autonomic nervous system activity which is a postulated mechanism for vascular dysfunction in african american patients27
the dash diet is the most widely evaluated dietary intervention for primary htn across several patient populations especially in african americans consisting of lean protein sources low fat dairy foods fruits and vegetables the dash diet is the only non-pharmacological intervention with results comparable to that of pharmacotherapy28

29
in patients for whom lifestyle modifications do not confer adequate blood pressure control pharmacotherapy is indicated for initial monotherapy race and age are the primary clinical considerations when choosing a therapeutic agent african american patients have consistently responded well to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers ccb andor thiazide-like diuretics as initial therapy patients with blood pressure that is 2010 mmhg above target may be considered for combination therapy at treatment onset for these patients an angiotensin ii receptor blocker arb or angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor can be prescribed in conjunction with a ccb or thiazide-type diuretic given resistant hypertension rhtn is more common in african american patients multidrug pharmacological therapy may be often indicated19

30
although this review focuses on htn in african americans a recent publication provided insights on pharmacological approaches in native africans the comparison of three combination therapies in lowering blood pressure in black africans creole study evaluated two-drug combinations in sub-saharan africans in 728 randomized patients a regimen of amlodipine plus either hydrochlorothiazide or perindopril was more effective at reducing blood pressure at six months compared with perindopril plus hydrochlorothiazide31 the creole results indicate ccb-based regimens are efficacious in black african hypertensive patientscommunity-based interventions in addition to lifestyle modifications may improve the control of htn in the african american community the success of these programs is based on identification and mitigation of the barriers to htn control in african american patients and increasing health knowledge impediments to conventional medical and hypertensive care includes historical distrust of the healthcare system lack of access to care and inadequate communication between patients and providers the goal of community level intervention has been to provide health information from a trusted source where attendance is certain the national medical association and association of black cardiologists inc abc have historically proposed various community-based approaches and continue to advocate community-based public health32
pioneers of community level interventions amongst african americans include the late elijah saunders md and b waine kong phd of baltimore maryland from 1979 to 1984 this team directed the churchcommunity health awareness and monitoring program champ in concert with the abc in this program more than 500 parishioners representing 100 churches in the baltimore area were trained to monitor their bp and make adequate transfers of care empowering community members and bringing healthcare to a persistently underserved area drs saunders and kong began the initiative of using barbershops as bp control centers33

34 which has served as a model for subsequent community level efforts especially in a difficult to reach cohort african american menmoreover in the 1990s daphne p ferdinand phd rn and the lead author established the healthy heart community prevention project inc hhccp in new orleans la the original hhccp approach utilized a threefold approach involving hair salons and barbershops churches and large group meetings with healthcare professionals the first initiative titled cut your pressure trained barbers and estheticians on how to measure blood pressures and counsel clients on lifestyle modifications the second titled give god a hand involved working with pastors to develop teachings that educated members on how to improve their cardiovascular risk profiles lastly hhccp hosted meetings to educate health professionals on best practices and advances in blood pressure management from a clinical standpoint33 interestingly hhccp remains active today httpshealthyheartcpporg and includes education and outreach on diabetes and influenza immunizationin 2018 a federally sponsored randomized trial confirmed a potent means of controlling htn in african american men the study used an interdisciplinary team bringing team-based care into black barber shops on the west coast over the course of six months 319 participants represented in 52 barbershops in los angeles ca underwent blood pressure screenings lifestyle modification training and pharmacological intervention when indicated while the evidence-based pharmacotherapeutic intervention was led by clinical advance-trained pharmacists the conversation surrounding health interventions were driven by the barbers at the end of the study there was a 270 mmhg mean reduction in systolic blood pressure from baseline of 1528 mmhg35 the success of the study is attributable to three key components collaborative care delivery effective anti-hypertensive therapy and a trusted place of interventionby definition resistant hypertension rhtn is the inability to meet blood pressure goals despite aggressive medical treatment with three or more medications14

36 with a higher prevalence in african americans fluid retention high dietary sodium intake and excess aldosterone are major mechanisms current evidence-based guidelines suggest a three-step regimen first lifestyle modifications and an adequate three drug regimen including a ccb and thiazide-type diuretic and an ace inhibitor or arb secondly replacing hydrochlorothiazide with a thiazide-type diuretic specifically indapamide or chlorthalidone with loop diuretics depending on the patients kidney function lastly adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist like spironolactone or eplerenone is often effective to control difficult to treat htn patientsmany clinicians have opted for clonidine in the setting of rhtn due to its rapid onset of action the resistant hypertension optimal treatment rehot study randomized study performed in brazil confirmed the superior efficacy and ease of use of spironolactone to that of clonidine as a fourth line treatment aldosterone antagonists including spironolactone and eplerenone are effective and better tolerated than clonidine36 there is a present consensus that clonidine is an antiquated therapy with adverse side effects not conducive for long term use and aldosterone antagonists depending on adequate renal function are the ideal fourth line pharmacological therapy for patients with rhtn including african americanstragically covid-19 mortality is disproportionately high in african americans with blacks representing 275 of all cases nationally despite comprising 134 of the population37

38 in fact in the may 2020 center for disease control and prevention cdc report that surveyed raceethnicity among covid-19 cases demonstrated that incidence is increased among non-hispanic blacks who represent 368 of newly reported cases39 in louisiana in may 2020 blacks who represent 327 of the population comprised 5740 of covid-19 related deaths throughout the state40 increased covid-19 mortality and complications occur with greater incidence in individuals for whom certain comorbidities are pre-existent among these conditions is htn 589 obesity 498 diabetesmetabolic disease 415 and cvd 345 comorbidities that are more prevalent in african americans39
while special considerations regarding treatment approaches in hypertensive covid-19 patients are unproven and presently under review there is some suggestion that aceis and arbs upregulate ace2 receptors where the coronavirus enters tissue including pneumocytes41 nevertheless recent clinical cohort data do not show that the ace inhibitors and arbs have deleterious effects with covid-19 mortality importantly a collaboration of the heart failure society of american hfsa and accaha released a statement in march 2020 recommending against discontinuation of acei and arbs42 however there is no postulated issue with use of ccbs and possible adverse effects on covid-1943
therefore ccbs may be an alternative if no compelling indications such as heart failure post-myocardial infarction status or ckd and in addition to thiazide-type diuretics in recent guidelines remain optimal first-line treatments in african americans41 however current evidence-based medical therapy confirms regardless of race with compelling indications acei and arbs should be a component of a cvd reduction and htn regimencertainly social determinants have a profound impact on the risk and mortality related to covid-19 african americans are more likely to reside in densely populated areas and thus encounter greater challenge with adherence to social distancing guidelines and are more likely to have employment in essential service jobs that cannot be performed remotely thus increasing risk of exposure44 additionally african americans are less likely to have access to financial resources in the event of a health emergency or economic disruption notably blacks and other people of color are neither genetically nor biologically predisposed to covid-19 but these social factors do contribute to increased risk of coronavirus exposure44
comorbid conditions such as htn t2d and obesity contribute to greater mortality risk of covid-19 and poorer prognosis upon development of the disease the emergence of covid-19 as a global health crisis is an opportunity to address longstanding disparities and underlying structural factors that have been well-documented to contribute to poorer overall health outcomes among african americans44 furthermore regarding these inequities specific approaches to identify discrimination and racialethnic variations in testing and treatment are essential to minimize covid-19 mortality among blacks44
one of the unintended outcomes of the covid-19 pandemic is the increase of virtual and phone consultations with providers although not studied in an african american cohort a recent european report suggested smart technology with electronic home bp monitoring may yield similar percentages of patients with controlled htn compared with the standard of care45 especially with conditions such as htn and t2d that require continued monitoring telemedicine may assist with risk factor control and provide access to critical medication refills with covid-19 and under new medicare provisions physicians and other providers can now receive greater reimbursement when collaborating with patients to monitor bp at home46 in the us this approach may be necessary and beneficial in monitoring hypertension in blacks and other minorities going forwardalthough still investigational renal denervation is a growing area of study as a treatment option for htn a recent study has shown the benefit of this method using the spyral catheter participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups renal denervation with a spyral catheter and sham and blacks comprised a significant number of both groups while ambulatory blood pressure changes were modest there was a significant improvement in office blood pressure measurements specifically without medications in the denervation group there was a 92 mmhg reduction in sbp and 51 mmhg in diastolic blood pressure dbp47 given the significant representation of african americans in this study future consideration may be given to renal denervation as a reasonable treatment strategy for htn not well controlled with pharmacotherapy figure 3
as previously noted one comorbidity commonly associated with rhtn is t2d48 sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 sglt2 inhibitors are hypoglycemic agents that reduce blood glucose by increasing the excretion of glucose in urine beyond their clinically approved use in t2d treatment sglt2 inhibitors have been shown to be cardioprotective although the mechanisms are still unclear some suggested mechanisms include diuresis sympathetic nervous system attenuation and increasing the release of nitric oxide49 while multiple cardiovascular and renal outcome studies show clinical benefit for the use of sglt2 inhibitors to improve multiple conditions unfortunately in the multiple major trials black patients were under-represented and conventionally approximately 5 or less blacks in major studies composed the treatment and placebo groups respectivelythe antihyperglycemic and blood pressure effects of empagliflozin in african americans with t2d and htn was a recent study sought to account for this disparity in this study of 150 self-identified blacks with a mean age of 568 and longstanding t2d and htn notably the treatment group showed a stepwise reduction in sbp at the 12-week 58 mmhg and 24-week 839 mmhg points suggesting a need for extended use for maximum therapeutic impact with comparable results to treatment with a single anti-hypertensive medication sglt2 inhibitors should be further studied for consideration in the treatment of rhtn50
a novel investigational approach to htn management would be firibrastat a therapeutic agent that acts on the renin angiotensin system ras of the brain in this system angiotensin iii activity on the at1 receptor is associated with elevated bp due to increased adh secretion51 the novel evaluation with qgc001 in hypertensive overweight patients of multiple ethnic origins new-hope study investigated the efficacy of firibrastat an aminopeptidase inhibitor in a group with over 50 minority participants at the end of the treatment period firibrastat caused a mean reduction of 95 mmhg in sbp and 42 mmhg dbp14 firibrastat after further evaluation may be a future direction for pharmacological therapy in the rhtn populationfueled partly by the covid-19 crisis and the disruption of in-person conventional outpatient care regardless of emerging and future developments in htn treatment the use of in-home or self-monitoring bp measurements to conrm hypertension diagnosis and to monitor htn control will increase in the future clinicians and their staff will continue to be reimbursed for telemedicine including teaching patients to take accurate bp measurements as self-measured blood pressure smbp the virtual visit to evaluate smbp will empower patients to accurately measure their bp at home to improve bp control figure 3 one recently launched website wwwvalidatebporg offers clinicians and their patients a list of home bp monitors which are certified for appropriate validity for accurate bp readings52 the smbp model has been embraced by medicare services for payment and it is expected that private health plans will continue to increase support of this approachin african americans htn is the most significant contributor to the increasing cvd burden and mortality unfortunately the number of deaths in which htn was a factor has steadily increased over the past decade18 african americans have the highest prevalence of htn in the us which is often poorly managed htn in blacks is burdened by clinical inertia in which despite unacceptably high bp clinicians make no changes or intensification of pharmacotherapy even when patients have access to care providers often fail to increase pharmacotherapy in accordance with treatment guidelines placing patients at risk for adverse cvd outcomes a meta-analysis found that a combination of regular blood pressure monitoring patient education and provider training concerning implicit bias improved bp control53 physicians and other providers seeking to alleviate this disparity must improve communication and strengthen the provider-patient relationship this should include culturally-sensitive literacy-level appropriate communication using models web-based and printed materials to explain the patients condition and treatment plansit is unacceptable that for decades the american healthcare system has failed african americans and other minority communities in both primary and secondary cvd prevention it is essential in this present pandemic and in the future that clinicians ensure continuation of cvd medications including anti-hypertensives antiplatelets and anticoagulation medications statins and other lipid-modifying agents and if possible prescribe 90-day supplies with sufficient refillsthe higher covid-19 african american mortality is a sentinel event similar to hospital sentinel events which are harbingers of poor-quality in-patient care such as wrong-site surgeries and falls the higher black pandemic deaths place a harsh spotlight on their longstanding higher mortality and diminished longevity44 beyond the conventional clinical setting specific programs are needed to help patients overcome barriers to care access appropriate lifestyle interventions utilize pharmacotherapy and offer health education to achieve health equity and overcome structural biasresearch grants 1013039100001003boehringer ingelheim 1013039501100002973daichii-sankyo

implemented4 the first case in the usa was announced on 20 january 20205 and the first cases in europe were reported in france on 24 january 2020 in individuals with a travel history to the hubei province china subsequent human-to-human transmission followed and cases with no travel history were reported6 africa reported its first case on 14 february 2020 in egypt since then the number of cases has risen dramatically figure 1this is the third coronavirus outbreak in as many decades7 the previous two were severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 which had mortality rates of 10 and 37 respectively8 the mortality rate of sars-cov-2  although lower compared to sars and mers seems to have a more devastating effect globallythe sars-cov-2 has a single-stranded rna genome enveloped in a lipid membrane embedded with glycoprotein spikes giving the impression of a crown  hence the name coronavirus cov rna viruses use an error-prone rna polymerase for replication and therefore have high mutation rates and can easily mutate during epidemics adapting to local environment to facilitate transmission9 however these mutations are part of the virus life cycle and should not impact outbreaks10zhu et al extracted viral rna from respiratory samples of three patients admitted in wuhan2 and on 7 january 2020 the chinese centre for disease control and prevention identified a novel betacoronavirus from one of the samples they described 85 sequence homology with bat sars-like cov which caused the sars outbreak in 200323 the virus was originally named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and later changed to sars-cov-2 this is the seventh member of the coronavirus family of the six previously described covs four cause no more than minimal common cold symptoms in humans the other two members are sars-cov and mers-covall covs have zoonotic origins with bats considered the natural reservoir hosts3 in sars-cov-2 the sequence identity of pangolin origin covs and sars-cov-2 is 99 and this raised the question whether the virus is of pangolin origin11 the natural hosts namely bats have a limited inflammatory response as seen by lower interleukin il-1 concentrations and adequate type i interferons giving rise to a generalized anti-inflammatory milieu and an ability to limit excessive inflammatory response12 interestingly this may also explain bats relatively long lifespan of 3040 years12 type i interferon is known to assist with antiviral control cov cannot infect humans unless the virus undergoes mutation and recombination in animal hostssars-cov-2 is a highly virulent virus the original infection distribution in mainland china was found to be 7145 in patients 3065 years of age and only 035 in patients less than 10 years old13 it is easily transmissible with initial studies finding that each infected person is capable of infecting another 22 individuals4 the virus is stable on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces for up to 72 h14 further enhancing its ability to spread the relatively long incubation period worsens the situation as individuals may be asymptomatic carriers for up to two weeks thereby releasing the virus in their surroundings in a process called viral sheddingthe most common symptoms of covid-19 are respiratory transmission is via droplets directly and on surfaces and direct contact sars-cov-2 has also been detected in stool which may point to a possible faeco-oral route of transmission513although covid-19 may present mildly as a flu-like disease or even be asymptomatic some patients develop significant cardiovascular and other adverse effects according to present data 81 of infected individuals have only mild flu-like symptoms and recover within two weeks 14 have severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and 5 become critically ill15 these differences in presentation are thought to be due to viral load age and the presence of comorbidities12 as many carriers may be asymptomatic and an underestimated source of transmission13 effective screening and contact tracing are important to identify high-risk individuals advise self-isolation where transmission risk is high and trace possible cases to limit community spread children may also be possible carriers of asymptomatic infection lu et al described that children under 10 years old may be asymptomatic in 158 of cases16the elderly are considered high risk this may be due to an aging immune system with concomitant lymphopaenia and decreased cd4-count and t-cell regulation12 elderly people have a propensity to excessive autoimmune and inflammatory responses which may be exacerbated by covid-19 infection12 male patients and those with associated comorbidities are also at increased riskrisk factors for complicated infection were identified in early studies most of these corroborated the increased risk associated with age male sex and certain comorbidities the studies also described several laboratory and clinical markers that can be used to determine prognosisthe first study reported 41 cases admitted early in january 2020 in wuhan china the median age of 49 years there were no adolescents or children 73 were male and 66 had exposure to the huanan seafood wholesale market of this cohort 13 32 were admitted to an intensive care unit icu lymphopaenia increased d-dimer levels increased partial thromboplastin time ptt increased aspartate aminotransferase ast increased high-sensitivity troponin-i hs-tni and increased inflammatory cytokines indicated poor prognosis and outcome8another early study described 99 hospitalized cases in wuhan the average age was 55 years most were male and 49 had a history of exposure to the huanan seafood market age obesity and comorbid illness were associated with increased mortality and concern was expressed about individuals with compromised immune function such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv increased age diabetics or those on immunosuppressive therapy17a subsequent study of six family members in shenzhen china who had returned from a visit to wuhan described the first person-to-person transmission of the virus18yang et al described the clinical course and outcomes in 710 patients with covid-19 pneumonia including 52 who were critically ill in the critically ill the mean age was 597 years 67 were male 40 had comorbidities and 615 had died at 28 days median time seven days non-survival risk was associated with advance age and comorbidities19li et al collected demographic information exposure history and illness timelines on 425 of the initial confirmed cases in wuhan the median age was 59 years and 56 were male as 55 of cases were linked to the original huanan seafood wholesale market this was evident of human-to-human transmission they described a doubling of cases every 74 days and suggested a 14-day observation or quarantine period for exposed persons they described that each infected person spread the virus to an average of 22 people they come in contact with as none of their cases were children they postulated that children may be less likely to be infected or have milder symptoms4ruan et al examined factors associated with increased mortality in 150 patients from wuhan they collected demographic clinical and laboratory data and found that age the presence of comorbidities or secondary infections and increased cardiac tn c-reactive protein crp and il-6 concentrations were predictors of fatal outcome20the cytokine storm occurs in a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 this is defined as a hyperinflammatory state characterized by a fulminant and fatal increase in inflammatory cytokines with subsequent multiorgan failure ferritin concentrations are raised cytopaenia occurs and approximately half of the patients develop significant pulmonary involvement such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards21 these findings suggest that in the study by ruan et al the mortality in the severely ill patients was probably caused by a cytokine storma study of 195 covid-19 patients from two hospitals in china of which one was in wuhan found that 54 276 died in hospital increased risk of in-hospital death was associated with older age organ failure and raised d-dimer levels and the authors postulated that these could possibly be used on admission to identify patients with a worse prognosis3wang et al examined the epidemiological demographic clinical laboratory radiological and treatment data on 138 patients hospitalized with covid-19 they found that 26 of patients needed icu admission and 43 died the median patient age was 56 years and 543 were male older age comorbidities and abnormal laboratory tests including lymphopaenia increased d-dimer increased lactate dehydrogenase ldh and prolonged ptt were associated with a worse prognosis22liu et al performed a small study on only 12 patients in shenzhen china of which eight were males and seven were older than 60 years they found that laboratory parameters associated with worse prognosis were decreased albumin concentrations lymphopaenia and elevated crp and ldh concentrations they measured angiotensin ii concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and found them to be increased this increased angiotensin ii was associated with a high viral load and lung injury suggesting an imbalanced renin angiotensin system ras the authors therefore questioned the possible utility of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker arb as possible treatment modalities23the first case diagnosed in usa on 20 january 2020 was a young male patient who had travelled to wuhan china he never visited the wuhan market or any healthcare facility and also had no contact with ill people while in the city the usas patient zero initially presented with mild symptoms but progressed to pneumonia on day nine his laboratory results showed leucopaenia mild thrombocytopaenia elevated creatinine and liver enzymes alkaline phosphatase alp alanine transferase alt aspartate transferase ast5arentz studied 21 critically ill covid-19-infected patients in washington state with a mean age of 70 years of which 52 were male seventeen 81 were admitted to icu 33 developed cardiomyopathy and the mortality rate was 67 again most were elderly patients and had comorbidities24the ras is an important regulator of blood pressure homeostasis renin is a protease secreted by the kidney which cleaves angiotensinogen a serpin family protein produced by the liver to inactive angiotensin i this is then cleaved to the active angiotensin ii by ace which is secreted by the kidneys and lungs and expressed ubiquitously in the vasculature angiotensin ii binds angiotensin type 1 at1 receptors and causes vasoconstriction and the secretion of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone with subsequent renal sodium and water reabsorption and raised blood pressure25when angiotensin ii binds at1 receptor it leads to an increase in blood pressure as well as inflammation fibrosis oxidative stress and vasoconstriction26 this is important for the regulation of cardiovascular haemodynamic neurological and endothelial functions27receptors of the ras2728 figure 2when angiotensin ii binds to the at1 receptor vasoconstriction inflammation fibrosis and proliferation follow leading to hypertension cardiac fibrosis thrombosis and ards binding of angiotensin 17 to mas receptor leads to vasodilatation anti-apoptotic anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferation activity and a reduction in blood pressure decreased cardiac fibrosis decreased thrombosis and decreased ards37when at2 is bound no is released which is an anti-inflammatory vasodilator reduces platelet aggregation and may facilitate the insulin action29 therefore angiotensin ii binding of at1 is an inflammatory mediator via reactive oxygen species ros and nuclear factor kappa  nfk and provides a mitogenic stimulus for smooth muscles leading to oxidative stress this is a common feature of atherosclerosis diabetes mellitus hypertension and hyperlipidaemia stimulation of at1 also leads to upregulation of adhesion molecules and interferes with insulin signalling leading to insulin resistance ace inhibitors and arb therapy were found to decrease circulating crp and this is thought to be due to decreased angiotensin ii stimulation of at1disruption of ace2 in mice leads to severe cardiac contractility defects increased angiotensin ii concentrations and the expression of hypoxia-induced cardiac genes when ace was also decreased this cardiac phenotype was rescued however loss of ace2 did not affect blood pressure or kidney development in these mice and it was postulated that ace could potentially compensate for loss of ace2 yet even when these mice were treated with ace inhibitor there was a similar reduction in blood pressure as in wild type therefore ace2 has no apparent direct effect on blood pressure25a strong association between ras and cardiovascular disease neurodegenerative disorders and acute lung injury was demonstrated in mice with acid aspiration lung injury in severe acute lung failure a significant downregulation of ace2 was noted the expression of ace was unchanged leading to a marked increase in angiotensin ii as its formation is upregulated by ace therefore ace promotes disease through increased angiotensin ii and ace-deficient mice were partly protected against acid-induced lung injury recombinant ace2 and at2 receptor expression protected mice from severe lung disease in this scenario38 the inactivation of ace on an ace2 knockout background rescued the mice from severe lung failure therefore it was postulated that ace promotes acute lung injury and ace2 alleviates it38patel and verma found that high pulmonary ace2 concentrations protect against lung injury39 the loss of ace2 expression in acute lung injury led to leaky pulmonary blood vessels through at1 receptor stimulation however hydrostatic oedema could not be excluded as a causative factor emphasizing the need for further studies on the local effects of angiotensin ii in lungs38pathology of the ras is associated with pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis40 angiotensin ii upregulates the expression of profibrotic cytokines leading to pulmonary fibrosis and severe inflammation with increased vascular permeability treatment with ace inhibitors and arb may attenuate this40 animal models of ards found reduced ace2 concentrations and treatment with exogenous ace2 alleviated the symptoms37further studies found that the loss of ace2 rendered subjects susceptible to heart failure and postulated that increasing ace2 concentrations were cardioprotective loss of ace2 also led to age-dependant cardiomyopathy pulmonary cardiac and renal injuries33diabetes mellitus a major comorbid risk factor in covid-19 is associated with increased ace2 expression this may explain why patients suffering from diabetes have greater susceptibility to sars infection33ace2 is involved in the possible protective arm of the ras the ace2angiotensin 17mas axis counterbalances the aceangiotensin iiat1 axis which is associated with vasoconstriction inflammation cell proliferation hypertrophy fibrosis and tissue modelling therefore ace2 protects against ras-induced injuries by decreasing angiotensin ii and generating angiotensin 17 which increases substrate availability of the protective axis41 ace2 knockout mice and those on ace2 inhibitors had increased susceptibility to myocardial infarction hypertension angiotensin ii-induced myocardial hypertrophy microvascular complication inflammation fibrosis diastolic and systolic dysfunction and oxidative stressace inhibitors block ace and arb block the action of angiotensin ii on ati receptors both lead to an increased ace2 activity42 the drugs may alleviate inflammation decrease endothelial dysfunction and increase insulin sensitivity29 the arbs have more potential to block the ras than acei as about 40 of angiotensin ii is formed via non-ace pathways in humans29 arbs are known to have less side-effects than ace inhibitorsanother area of interest is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ppar- insulin resistance is strongly associated with hypertension ace2 expression is increased with the use of ppar- agonists26 ppar- agonists thiazolidinediones attenuate the development of hypertension and improve endothelial dysfunction in angiotensin ii-infused rats43 these rats had decreased at1 expression therefore the effects were most likely mediated through at2 receptor activation44 however ppar- agonists were shown to increase the risk of congestive heart failure and possibly myocardial infarctionother medications that have an effect on ace2 concentrations include mineralocorticoid antagonists such as the aldosterone receptor antagonist spironolactone which possibly increases ace2 concentrations in macrophages this was not the case in the heart tissue of patients suffering from chronic heart failure45 statins possibly augment ace expression in heart and kidney tissue and may also bring about epigenetic changes in ace2 gene but more work is needed to determine the exact mechanism of these findings26presently there is still a paucity of evidence on how ace inhibitors or arb may impact the ace2angiotensin 17 pathway in the lung heart and brain and ongoing research in this field is neededhuman ace2 is a functional receptor essential for cellular entry of covs and is the same receptor used by sars-cov to gain access to cells32 kuba et al provided the first genetic proof that ace2 was a crucial receptor for sars-cov in vivo46 when ace2 knockout and wildtype mice were infected with sars-cov the knockout mice had very low levels of viral replication in their lungs in the wildtype mice sars-cov infection was associated with lung failure which was attenuated by treatment blocking the ras they postulated that sars-cov infection downregulated ace2 concentrations possibly explaining the decline in lung function observed with viral infection46the spike s proteins of covs facilitate viral entry into the target cells by attaching to ace2 as an entry receptor3247 sars-cov-2 like sars-cov has a viral envelope studded with spikes consisting of glycoproteins made up by two subunits namely s1 and s2 subunit s1 binds the cell surface bound ace2 and subunit s2 fuses with the cell membrane42 the cellular serine protease tmprss2 is essential for s-protein priming and facilitates viral cell entry47 tmprss is expressed on sars-cov target cells48 after subunit s1 of the spike binds to membrane bound ace2 tmprss2 activates the spike and cleaves the ace2 receptor tmprss2 also acts on the s2 subunit causing an irreversible conformational change facilitating fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane and endocytosis1347 therefore both ace2 and tmprss2 are essential for cellular entry sars-cov-2 binds human ace2 with 1020-fold higher affinity than sars-cov13 this may be due to a more compact virus structure enabling better receptor affinity and enhanced ability to be internalized figure 3 shows the cellular entry of the sars-cov2the binding of sars-cov-2 may decrease ace2 concentrations and increase the angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 ratio which may exacerbate pulmonary injury and tissue fibrosis26 angiotensin 17 may provide resilience from the development of pulmonary failure in covid-19 further supporting this finding49oudit et al33 determined that sars-cov infection has a detrimental effect on cardiac function and led to cardiac dysfunction arrhythmias and death they measured ace2 concentrations in mice infected with human strain sars-cov and in hearts obtained from autopsy of patients who died from sars infection they found that sars-cov infection led to a decrease in ace2 expression in the myocardium of mice with subsequent myocardial dysfunction sars-cov mrna expression was found in 35 of the autopsy heart samples which was associated with decreased ace2 protein expression therefore they postulated that sars-cov leads to cardiac dysfunction by downregulating myocardial ace2 possibly due to a cytokine-mediated downregulation of ace2 mrna33the gastrointestinal system is also not spared from the effects of sars-cov-2 infection xiao et al found that ace2 was abundant in the glandular cells of gastric duodenal and rectal epithelia50 hamming et al described ace2 in the small intestine further underlining the importance of sars-cov-2 involvement in the gastrointestinal system34an interesting observation is the difference in infection rate and adverse outcomes in adults and children although there have been reports of less covid-19 infection in children there is a lack of evidence that ace2 changes with age37 a possible hypothesis is that children are less susceptible to covid-19 infection due to cross-protective antibodies from multiple upper respiratory tract infections and that their lower respiratory tracts have less ace249 limited studies and data in children are available and conclusive evidence to support postulations that children are less likely to be adversely affected by sars-cov-2 infection is lackingit is clear from statistical data that older people especially men are more affected by covid-19 increased ace2 have been described in older individuals and in males52 which could possibly be linked to the worse outcome in this population groupas yet there is no evidence of causal relationship between ace2 activity and sars-cov-2 mortality also ace2 concentrations do not correlate with the degree of disease severity53 activation of the ras is associated with endothelial dysfunction and multiple organ injuries therefore theoretically treatment focusing on manipulation and control of this system may be beneficial37covid-19-infected patients have a worse prognosis when they suffer from comorbidities especially cardiovascular ras inhibitors have been shown to have a protective effect on the kidney and myocardium and it may therefore be dangerous to withdraw treatment in these patients a higher risk of relapse in patients with cardiovascular or renal disease has also been demonstrated54angiotensin ii concentrations were found to be increased in covid-19 infection and positively correlated with viral load and lung injury23 increased ace2 concentrations may possibly lead to a greater susceptibility for covid-19 infection but may also be cardioprotective this led to a crossroad in clinical decision-making ras blocking treatment may increase ace2 and facilitate virus entry but the beneficial effects it has in patients suffering from comorbid conditions cannot be ignoreda lot can be learned from studies involving other respiratory viruses where the use of ace2-lowering treatment was investigated a study on patients with novel influenza a h7n9 a virus of avian origin from eastern china in 2013 found that more than 70 developed ards and had a high mortality patients with markedly elevated angiotensin ii concentrations had poorer disease outcome with a predictive value higher than crp the authors speculated that recombinant ace2 and angiotensin ii-lowering treatment such as ace inhibitors and arb could be beneficial51avian influenza a h5n1 primarily infects poultry and birds but since 2003 has also been infecting humans increased angiotensin ii and downregulation of ace2 was linked to infection severity and mortality when mice infected with h5n1 were given recombinant ace2 the virus-induced lung injury was ameliorated55the use of intravenous ace inhibitors and arb in experimental animals increases ace2 expression in the cardiopulmonary circulation systems causing a possible increased risk for sars-cov-2 infection56 severe covid-19 outcomes were described in patients with existing hypertension coronary artery disease diabetes and chronic kidney disease57 the question was asked whether their current treatment regimens were increasing their risk for infectiontheoretically if ace2 activity in cell membranes decreased it should reduce the ability of sars-cov-2 to enter cells but this also decreases the protective effects of ace2 in various organ systems where ace2 is expressed angiotensin ii may contribute to organ damage in covid-1958 and concentrations were found to correlate with viral load and lung injury23 downregulation of ace2 in the lung tissue may facilitate neutrophil infiltration leading to angiotensin ii accumulation and ras activation54when covid-19 binds ace2 and enters the cell the expression of ace2 is downregulated this downregulation essentially removes the brakes from angiotensin ii and possibly induces local activation of immune cells in lungs decreased ace2 in alveolar type ii cells leads to surfactant deficit and the development of lung injury59 although an increase of ace2 may lead to higher cell infection rates and proliferation of the virus it may be beneficial in patients with lung injury and withdrawal may be harmful especially in high-risk patients54in a study on acid-induced lung injury in mice ace2 downregulation by sars-cov worsened lung injury the induced lung injury improved with the use of arbs and the findings are suggestive that sars-cov exacerbates lung injury by decreasing ace2 and that it is also reversible by arbs46an increase in ace2 in heart tissue may be cardioprotective therefore sars-cov-2 could possibly influence the fine balance between angiotensin ii and angiotensin 17 whereas treatment could block ras and protect the heart and other organs37cardiac tissue function may be compromised by the increase in angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17 ratio loss of ace2 in the central nervous system specifically the brain stem cardiovascular centre may cause an increased sympathetic drive changes in baroreflex and worsening of hypertension26 loss of ace2 in the vasculature can contribute to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation and exacerbate existing atherosclerosis and diabetesthere have been concerns that increased ace2 expression in heart brain and urine after treatment with arb may increase an individuals risk of infection but very little evidence is available showing significant changes in serum of pulmonary ace2 concentrations however the significance of ace2 expression and its effect on covid-19 pathogenesis and mortality are uncertain39therefore do the benefits outweigh the risks a joint statement issued on 17 march 2020 found that no experimental or clinical evidence demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes in covid-19 patients using ace inhibitors or arb was available and that urgent additional research is needed it stated that treatment should not be discontinued if patients become infected with sars-cov-260downregulation of ace2 was proposed as a possible treatment to reduce susceptibility to covid-19 infection however the ensuing relatively unopposed action of angiotensin ii could lead to worsening hypertension inflammation thrombosis and adverse lung and cardiac outcome41 a study by kuba et al determined that infection with sars-cov downregulates the expression of ace2 these low ace2 concentrations were associated with lung oedema and acute lung injury which contributed to the severe lung pathology in patients already on ace inhibitors at the time of sars-cov infection they concluded that modulating ras may therefore be useful in treating infection46some studies also questioned the use of anti-ace2 antibodies to inhibit viral replication of sars-cov these could possibly inhibit virus-induced cytopathicity in a dose-dependent manner32trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant human ace2 and the arb losartan in covid-19-infected patients infusion of recombinant human ace2 may act as a decoy to interfere with viral replication soluble ace2 could potentially bind sars-cov and thereby prevent the binding of the viral spike protein to full length membrane-bound ace236 reducing viral infection of cells36 recombinant ace2 was shown to reverse lung injury in sars-cov-infected patients55 wang et al found that ace inhibitors and arb offer partial cardiovascular protection by increasing ace2 and that iv recombinant ace2 may be beneficial in preventing pulmonary arterial hypertension and acute lung injury41however circulating ace2 concentrations are usually very low to undetectable and do not accurately represent the amount of membrane-bound ace2 and would not be sufficient to sequester sars-cov-2 in the circulation26 a proposed clinical trial with recombinant ace2 was withdrawn due to the unknown effects and the possibility of the drug inducing significant hypotension26ace2 interaction with sars-cov is important in the development of sars-associated cardiomyopathy as viral rna was found in the myocardium on postmortem examination the associated cardiac injury due to reduced expression of ace2 possibly played a major role in the morbidity and mortality of patients infected with sars-cov recombinant ace2 was found to normalize angiotensin ii concentrations suggesting that it may be beneficial to prevent organ damage caused by sars-cov the question thus arose if it is possible and beneficial to balance ras control to reduce infection and prevent organ damage in covid-19-infected patients33protease inhibitors against tmprss2 block viral entry in vitro by inhibiting the entry of sars-cov-2 into cells47 camostat mesylate a serine protease inhibitor used in japan to treat chronic pancreatitis inhibits tmprss2 and can block entry of sars-cov-2 into bronchial epithelial cells in vitro4748many patients with severe covid-19 infection admitted to icu are in septic shock as most angiotensin i to angiotensin ii conversion by ace occurs in the lungs significant lung injury may decrease this decreased ace function was found to be a predictor of mortality angiotensin ii a novel vasopressor agent may be beneficial in this patient populationstrategies to decrease ace2 may possibly attenuate sars-cov-2 infectivity this may happen in a number of ways firstly endogenous angiotensin ii theoretically prevents infection by binding the ace2 during its degradation and therefore may compete with sars-cov-2 to bind to the receptor secondly binding of angiotensin ii to at1 causes internalization and downregulation of ace2 and lastly angiotensin ii causes at1-dependent destruction of ace2 further decreasing the virus ability to enter cells angiotensin ii is not yet available for use commercially but due to the number of critically ill patients and the promising outcome of the drug it has been made available for compassionate use in italy germany and uk61another focus area is the use of angiotensin 17 as a novel treatment for covid-1926 experimental studies found that angiotensin 17 reduced the acute inflammatory response and subsequent fibrosis in acid-induced ards in mice62 angiotensin 17 protected the lung against inflammation and fibrosis inhibited alveolar cell apoptosis attenuated endothelial cell activation loss of barrier function and oedema and decreased synthesis of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines the authors therefore recommended that the concentrations of angiotensin 17 should be increased to protect covid-19-infected patients62the effects of ace2 on covid-19 infections need to be further evaluated and randomized control trials are necessary to obtain the highest level of evidence although ace2 has beneficial effects by regulating the protective arm of ras some authors postulate that high levels make patients more susceptible to covid-19 infection the ras has numerous attractive therapy targets for covid19 infection trials are needed to evaluate the use of ace inhibitors and arbs in covid-19 patients
although type 2 diabetes t2d is a major comorbidity of novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the impact of blood glucose control on the degree of medical interventions required and on all-cause mortality of patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d remains unclear here zhu et al report that among 7300 individuals with covid-19 among which nearly 1000 had t2d in hubei province china those with t2d had significantly increased medical interventions and mortality risk but among the patients with t2d those with well-controlled blood glucose regulation upper limit  10 mmoll fared much better than those with poorly controlled blood glucose upper limit  10 mmoll these findings provide clinical evidence correlating more proper blood glucose control with improved outcomes in patients with covid-19
the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is caused by infection from the newly emerged highly contagious coronavirus sars-cov-2 wu and mcgoogan 2020 sars-cov-2 mainly invades the respiratory tract and lungs leading to a new type of coronavirus pneumonia zhu et al 2020 the severe cases of covid-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods guan et al 2020 elderly individuals along with those with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension cancer cardiovascular diseases diabetes mellitus and acute kidney injury have a demonstrated higher risk for developing more severe cases of covid-19 as well as suffering a higher risk of mortality wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b zhou et al 2020 the collision between the two global pandemics of covid-19 and type 2 diabetes t2d has led to the grim reality that t2d is already the second most common comorbidity of covid-19 zhou et al 2020 however current evidence implicating t2d in worse covid-19 prognosis has mostly come from relatively limited-sized cohorts deng and peng 2020 zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 thus the clinical features of patients with t2d infected by sars-cov-2 remain to be comprehensively clarified in a large-scale analysis which is needed to more efficiently and precisely manage the treatment of such patientsit has been well established that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to infections in general and exhibit worse prognosis once infected compared to the non-diabetic population kumar nathella and babu 2017 xu et al 2019 such a higher susceptibility has also been previously observed for other coronaviral epidemics for example in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pre-existing t2d was independently associated with poor outcomes the percentage of known t2d history was significantly higher among patients who succumbed to sars than who survived booth et al 2003 yang et al 2006 further epidemiological studies also indicate that t2d was the primary comorbidity associated with severe or lethal mers-cov infections alqahtani et al 2018 and with regard to the current covid-19 pandemic several recent studies though with limited participants have already suggested that t2d is a common comorbidity and constitutes a higher proportion of patients with severe and icu-admitted cases of covid-19 than patients with mild symptoms deng and peng 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 these associations between diabetes and worse outcome in viral infections are not unexpected as hyperglycemia is detrimental to the control of viremia and inflammation aggravating morbidity and mortality in a variety of patients forbes et al 2018 however an overly rigid glucose control may increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia which can also lead to an increased mortality rodriguez-gutierrez et al 2019 consequently previous clinical trials examining the effects of glucose control on mortality have yielded conflicting results forbes et al 2018 van den berghe et al 2006 for individuals with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d a key challenge for clinicians is to improve outcomes in the face of uncertainty regarding the degree of glycemic management that should be maintained and any effects this might have on the benefits and risks of overall treatment thus detailed analyses of data from such patients is needed that links plasma glucose levels with clinic outcomes including mortalityin this report we performed a retrospective longitudinal multi-centered study from a cohort of 7337 confirmed covid-19 cases enrolled among 19 hospitals in hubei province china focusing on the association between plasma glucose levels and clinic outcomes in covid-19 patients with t2d in addition to a significant association between diabetic status and higher mortality rate in patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d versus non-diabetic subjects with covid-19 our study indicated that well-controlled glycemia was associated with a markedly improved outcome of patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2dclinic characteristics were collected from a total of 7337 participants out of 9663 confirmed cases of covid-19 including 952 subjects with pre-existing t2d n  510 male 536 and 6385 non-diabetic cases n  2967 male 465 figure 1
 of the initial 9663 cases enrolled 2326 patients with covid-19 were excluded from the study including 1013 patients younger than 18 or older than 75 years old 872 patients without complete medical records 13 patients with acute myocardial infarction 5 patients with acute coronary syndrome 8 patients with acute pulmonary embolism 10 patients with acute stroke 11 patients with acute severe

malignancy 7 patients with type 1 diabetes 2 patients with a history of gestational diabetes and 1 patient with drug-induced diabetes from the final cohort of 7337 covid-19 patients analyzed the prevalence of t2d was 130 which was similar to the nationwide prevalence of t2d in china about 109 wang et al 2017 the median ages were 62 5568 and 53 4063 in the diabetic and non-diabetic groups respectively table s1 the median body mass index bmi in patients with or without t2d was 247 220264 and 234 210260 respectively the median duration from the first symptom to admission was 10 days 619 for both groups the major symptoms for both groups were fever 718 cough 635 fatigue 323 and dyspnea 161 similar to the general population of patients chen et al 2020 guan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 patients with t2d reported significantly higher incidences of fatigue 380 versus 314 and dyspnea 205 versus 154 compared to the non-diabetic group pre-existing hypertension 534 versus 197 coronary heart disease chd 137 versus 37 cerebrovascular disease 56 versus 15 and chronic kidney disease 49 versus 13 had higher frequencies in the t2d group compared to the non-diabetic group chest ct scans indicated that the incidence of bilateral lung lesion was higher 881 versus 804 in the diabetic group compared to non-diabetic patientswhile heart rate and respiratory rates did not show differences between the diabetic and the non-diabetic groups systolic blood pressure was modestly higher in the diabetic group 130 mmhg 120142 versus 126 mmhg 120136 lab findings showed that blood glucose bg level was much higher in the diabetic group compared to the non-diabetic group as expected 83 mmoll 62124 versus 52 mmoll 4761 with higher levels of hba1c 79 6895 versus 61 5766 patients with t2d had a significantly higher incidence of lymphopenia 445 versus 326 and higher ratio of elevation of leukocyte 113 versus 66 and neutrophil 172 versus 99 counts in peripheral blood relative to the non-diabetic individuals at the same time elevated serum markers indicating inflammation c-reactive protein crp 570 versus 424 and procalcitonin 333 versus 203 decreased kidney function creatinine 120 versus 50 and increased coagulation status d-dimer 505 versus 333 were found more frequently in the t2d group than in the non-diabetic group furthermore spo2 lower than 95 occurred more frequently in the diabetic group versus the non-diabetic group 188 versus 132 on admissionthe patients with pre-existing t2d received significantly more intensive integrated treatments to manage their symptoms of covid-19 than the non-diabetic subjects the former group registered a higher need for antibiotics 613 versus 569 antifungal drugs 25 versus 12 systemic corticosteroids 294 versus 228 immunoglobin 230 versus 177 anti-hypertensive drug 451 versus 211 and even vasoactive drugs 77 versus 22 oxygen inhalation 769 versus 612 noninvasive ventilation 102 versus 39 and invasive ventilation 36 versus 07 were also applied significantly more frequently to the individuals with t2d compared to the patients without t2d table s2during the 28-day follow-up period we performed a retrospective longitudinal analysis on various parameters starting from the time of admission to the hospital for each patient in the study we noticed that despite having received more aggressive treatment against covid-19 and the comorbidities the diabetic group had greater incidences of decreased lymphocyte counts and increased neutrophil counts as well as higher levels of serum interleukin-6 il-6 crp and lactic dehydrogenase ldh accompanied by higher bg levels compared to the non-diabetic group the bg level was also significantly associated with comorbid hypertension chd the incidences of decreased lymphocyte count and elevated neutrophil count and the levels of serum crp and creatinine in the entire cohort figure s1during the 28-day follow-up period starting from admission the in-hospital death rate was significantly higher in patients with pre-existing t2d relative to the non-diabetic individuals 78 versus 27 p  0001 table s3 the crude hr of the 28-day all-cause mortality in the diabetic group versus non-diabetic individuals was 290 95 ci 221381 p  0001 table s4 after adjusting for age gender and hospital site on admission the hr of the all-cause mortality between these two groups was 170 95 ci 129224 p  0001 table s4 we further adjusted for the severity of covid-19 and found that the hr of the all-cause mortality between these two groups was 149 95 ci 113196 p  0005 figure s2 table s4 we here did not adjust for comorbidities closely related to t2d including hypertension chd cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease as these diseases often co-exist with t2dfurthermore the individuals with t2d had a greater occurrence of ards 169 versus 72 acute heart injury 73 versus 30 acute kidney injury 39 versus 08 septic shock 38 versus 10 and disseminated intravascular coagulation dic 05 versus 02 than the non-diabetic group table s3 mixed-effect cox analysis indicated t2d was significantly correlated with the occurrence of ards acute kidney injury and septic shock with respective adjusted hrs of 144 95 ci 120173 301 95 ci 194468 and 195 95 ci 118320 after adjusting for age gender and severity of covid-19 among the patients table s4 our current study was based on the largest diabetic covid-19 cohort so far analyzed and the results were unequivocal to implicate diabetes mellitus in higher risk of death and other detrimental outcomes of covid-19 notably care must be taken in interpreting the significant difference in outcomes between diabetic and non-diabetic patients with covid-19 since there were notable differences in the covariate distributions between the two groupsthe pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the impact of t2d on covid-19 progression remain to be fully investigated in patients with diabetes pulmonary dysfunction involving lung volume pulmonary diffusing capacity control of ventilation bronchomotor tone and neuroadrenergic bronchial innervation have been reported fuso et al 2019 which may account for the propensity of poor outcomes in patients with covid-19 and t2d at the same time a dysregulated immune response caused by t2d is likely also responsible for the increased disease severity of covid-19 in patients with t2d as a higher ratio of lymphopenia and increased levels of neutrophils serum crp and il-6 were observed in the patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d in our study these findings dovetail with immune dysregulation observed in other coronavirus infection-triggered pneumonia kulcsar et al 2019 in an experimental model of mers diabetic mice had lower numbers of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages and cd4 t cells which was accompanied by lower levels of ccl2 and cxcl10 expression kulcsar et al 2019 furthermore t2d is associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system in different tissues candido et al 2002 considering sars-cov-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 to bind and gain entry to infected cells hoffmann et al 2020 lu et al 2020 and reduces the expression of ace2 kuba et al 2005 overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system may also contribute to the increased adverse risk in patients with covid-19 and diabetes in this respect application of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors may have therapeutic effect in patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2damong the cohort with covid-19 and t2d there were 282 individuals with well-controlled bg 136 males 482 and 528 individuals with poorly controlled bg 298 males 564 the median bg level was much lower in the well-controlled bg group than the poorly controlled bg group 64 mmoll 5275 versus 109 mmoll 76143 figure s3 and the levels of hba1c in these two groups were 73 6682 and 81 72101 respectively the patients from the well-controlled bg group also had significantly lower incidences of lymphopenia 305 versus 496 lower rates of increased counts of leukocyte 63 versus 122 and neutrophil 107 versus 194 and elevated serum crp 475 versus 595 and procalcitonin 242 versus 350 the same pattern was observed for elevated aspartate transaminase ast 113 versus 204 and d-dimer 376 versus 554 table 1
 notably fewer individuals from the well-controlled group had spo2 lower than 95 compared to the poorly controlled group 126 versus 227 but other parameters between the two groups were not significantly different in particular these two groups had a median age of 62 5567 and 63 5668 respectively table 1 the difference of the median bmi between patients with well-controlled bg or poorly controlled bg was modest 250 239264 versus 232 210249 respectivelyother clinical manifestations including chest ct imaging and the incidences of major comorbidities were similar between the two groups on admission even so the patients with covid-19 and t2d with well-controlled bg acquired significantly less integrated treatments than those with poorly controlled bg there was a significantly lower frequency of pharmacological therapy in the well-controlled bg group versus the poorly controlled group including the usage of antivirals 628 versus 712 antibiotics 532 versus 665 antifungal drugs 04 versus 28 systemic corticosteroids 202 versus 349 immunoglobin 153 versus 265 and vasoactive drugs 25 versus 89 the incidences of oxygen inhalation 702 versus 835 noninvasive ventilation 46 versus 119 invasive ventilation 00 versus 42 and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 00 versus 08 were lower in the well-controlled group than in the poorly controlled group table 2
correlated with persistent lower bg levels the well-controlled group had higher lymphocyte counts lower neutrophil counts and lower serum levels of il-6 crp and ldh throughout the 28-day observation period starting from the time of hospital admission figure 2
 we further noticed that the in-hospital death rate was significantly lower 11 versus 110 in the well-controlled group relative to the poorly controlled group table s5 the crude hr for the 28-day all-cause mortality between the two groups was 009 95 ci 003030 p  0001 table s6 after adjusting for age gender the severity of covid-19 comorbidities and site effect the hr of the all-cause mortality in the well-controlled bg group versus the poorly controlled bg group was 013 95 ci 004044 p  0001 table s6 the e-value for the point estimate was 1487 with upper limit of ci at 397 further relative to the poorly controlled bg control the patients from the well-controlled bg group developed less frequent occurrences of ards 71 versus 214 acute heart injury 14 versus 99 acute kidney injury 07 versus 38 septic shock 00 versus 47 and dic 00 versus 06 table s5 after adjusting for age gender the severity of covid-19 site effect and comorbidities the respective hrs of ards and acute heart injury were 041 95 ci 025066 p  0001 and 021 95 ci 007059 p  0003 between the well-controlled bg group and poorly controlled bg group table s6a propensity score-matched psm analysis was further performed to avoid confounding variables that could have interfered with the association between bg levels and all-cause mortality due to the lack of reliable indicators for the severity of t2d we specifically included t2d-related comorbidities for matching since comorbidities are closely related to the severity of t2d these comorbidities included hypertension cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease chronic liver disease and chronic kidney injury we were able to match 250 patients from the well-controlled bg group to 250 patients from the poorly controlled bg group at a ratio of 11 and these 500 individuals were included in the psm analysis figure 1 by applying mixed-effect cox model using the hospital site as a random effect and adjusting imbalanced durations from symptom onset to admission the results consistently and significantly demonstrated a lower risk of all-cause mortality in the patients from the well-controlled bg group adjusted hr 014 95 ci 003060 p  0008 compared to those from the poorly controlled bg group figure 3

and s7 although stronger integrated treatment was applied to the poorly controlled bg group table s8 the robustness of the association between glycemic variability and mortality was further assessed with additional sensitivity analyses by using different matching variables the results in these sensitivity analyses were similar to the above analysis with hrs of 017 95 ci 005061 p  0006 in the first sensitivity analysis and of 016 95 ci 005058 p  0005 in the second analysis table s9 in the psm analysis the respective adjusted hrs of ards acute heart injury and acute kidney injury were 047 95 ci 027083 p  0009 024 95 ci 008071 p  0010 and 012 95 ci 001096 p  0046 between the well-controlled bg group and poorly controlled bg group table 3glycemic variability has been shown to be an important indicator and a possible risk predictor for death and other complications in individuals with t2d forbes et al 2018 the impact of hyperglycemia on the pathogenesis of viral-induced respiratory diseases remains unclear elevated bg level has been reported to increase the glucose concentration in airway epithelial secretion philips et al 2003 which may disrupt the defensive capacity of airway epithelia on the other hand too rigid glucose control increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia which can also result in an increased mortality rodriguez-gutierrez et al 2019 in this study we found that compared to individuals with well-controlled bg poor glycemic control in patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d was associated with worse outcome involving increased need for medical interventions multi-organ injuries and higher mortalities in contrast to such patients in those with glycemic variability between 39 and 100 mmoll there was a significant association with reduced medical interventions major organ injuries and all-cause mortality the findings here provide direct evidence supporting the recent suggestions for clinical management of t2d during covid-19 bornstein et al 2020in conclusion t2d is an important risk factor for covid-19 progression and adverse endpoints and well-controlled bg maintaining glycemic variability within 39 to 100 mmoll is associated with a significant reduction in the composite adverse outcomes and death these findings provide critical insights into the clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d and the possible avenues to improving their disease outcomesdue to the retrospective nature of the study and the unprecedented scale of the covid-19 pandemic this study has several limitations first all data were obtained from patient cohorts admitted in the 19 hospitals in hubei province china therefore the effect of bg control may be different among patients with covid-19 and pre-existing t2d in the outpatient setting or in ethnically or geographically diverse populations second we were not able to retrieve the pre-hospital status of t2d from the current cohort due to the urgent circumstance of the covid-19 pandemic the status of pre-hospital t2d could be significantly associated with numerous clinical parameters which are known independent risk factors for the poor outcomes of covid-19 including cardiovascular abnormalities and immunological dysfunction while we performed psm analysis to support the independent association of t2d with covid-19 pathology the influence from these cofounders cannot be fully excluded also given this lack of pre-hospital data it was not possible for us to access if bg levels changed as result of covid-19 progression andor severity third the number of the patients with t2d and well-controlled bg in this study was modest and might not be powered sufficiently to reflect the overall complexity of the general population therefore large-scale prospective cohort studies will be required in ethnically and geographically diverse cohorts to better understand the association and importance of bg control in the disease progression of covid-19 fourth given the retrospective nature of the study it was not possible for us to determine if active management of bg levels to a more normal range could ameliorate covid-19 severity or adverse outcomes finally individuals with type 1 diabetes were excluded from our analysis as there were too few of them in the initial cohort but it is possible that blood glucose control may also affect their outcomes during covid-19

association between bg and the outcomes of covid-19 were addressed using the propensity score-matching psm method waljee et al 2013 psm requires a complete set of variables for every patient randomly missing values of 10 selected parameters from noninvasive tests were therefore imputed the non-parameter imputation method missforest was applied and the estimation of the imputation error was 408 the bootstrapped cross validation was further applied and repeated 10 times for evaluating imputation performance on the training data after 10 more parameters were randomly introduced the missforest method yielded 411 iqr 191544 differences between the datasets before and after parameters were introduced the algorithm of the psm is as followslogisticp  lnp1-p  0  1x1  2x2   kxk p  e0  1x1  2x2   kxk1e0  1x1  2x2   kxk the p in this formula is the predicted probability of glucose control procedure and the beta value before each variable is the regression coefficient of that variablethe variables potentially confounding the association between bg and the outcomes of covid-19 were addressed using the psm method when evaluating the association of glucose control level and outcomes the psm cohorts were identified by balancing age gender fever cough dyspnea ct-diagnosed lung lesions spo2 breath frequency incidence of increased leukocyte count alt ast d-dimer creatinine crp procalcitonin and decreased of lymphocyte count as well as comorbidities hypertension coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease chronic liver diseases and chronic renal disease the propensity score a predicted probability of glucose change contributed by the above variables were estimated based on multivariable logistic regression model the matching ratio was at 11 for well-controlled bg versus poorly-controlled bg during the entire hospitalization exact matching with a caliper size of 005 was applied for all matching pairs according to the propensity scores evaluation of the balance between covariates was conducted by estimating standardized differences before and after matching only those with small absolute value less than 01 were considered qualified balancingthe robustness of the association between bg level and all-cause mortality was assessed by analyzing e-value in the mixed-effect cox proportional hazards model to address unmeasured confounders using the methodology of vanderweele and ding haneuse et al 2019 mathur et al 2018 vanderweele and ding 2017 two sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of propensity score-matched cohort analyses among all pairsall statistical analysis was performed using r-363 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria and spss statistics version 230 ibm armonk ny usa data with continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile range iqr and data with categorical variables were presented as frequency rates and percentage  comparison between 2 groups was analyzed using students t tests

corresponding hazard ratio hr were analyzed using cox proportional hazard model and mixed-effect cox model the cumulative rates of death were plotted by applying kaplan-meier method a difference with a two-side  less than 005 was considered statistically significantthe world health organization who has declared sars-cov-2 covid-19 a pandemic although the evidence to date suggests that most cases manifest mildly up to 16 of cases may require hospital admission1 to date the relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and covid-19 is not clear although various studies show that the main comorbidities related to the development of a serious form of the disease are high blood pressure diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease2 we know that copd is associated with an increased risk of admission to an intensive care unit as well as death3
many of the most common chronic diseases occur more frequently in patients with copd compared to the general population up to 60-90 of copd patients develop some comorbidity an aspect that will contribute to the severity of symptoms and jeopardize patient survival reported complications of sars-cov-2 infection such as extensive pneumoniaacute lung damage or adult acute respiratory distress syndrome the occurrence of myocarditiscardiac arrhythmias or the development of thromboembolic episodes are events that may worsen the baseline condition of the copd patient surviving the process having to take into account their existence when planning their outpatient follow-upunfortunately we do not have information about how the sars-cov-2 infection will impact our patients in the medium-long term and for the time being we must make assumptions based on the knowledge gained from other coronaviruses such as sars-cov-1 or mers-covviral infections cause an intense systemic inflammatory response resulting in an imbalance between the homeostatic pro-coagulant and anticoagulant mechanisms4 therefore thromboembolic disease is an aspect to analyse based on the limited evidence we currently have there is a possibility that sars-cov-2 infection increases the risk of a venous thromboembolic event5 multiple pathogenic mechanisms appear to be involved including endothelial dysfunction elevation of von willebrand factor toll-like receptor or tissue factor pathway activation4 however apart from infection we must be aware that other factors such as strict and prolonged quarantine and subsequently immobilization could lead to itdespite what has been described there is a lack of evidence about the incidence of pulmonary embolism in patients with sars-cov-26 7 a study published by cui et al7 determined that the incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism in 81 patients admitted to an intensive care unit for a severe sars-cov-2 infection was 25 in the case of sars-cov-1 post-mortem studies in infected patients detected thrombi in the pulmonary vascular bed8 a study carried out in singapore that included autopsies of 8 confirmed cases of sars-cov-1 described pulmonary thrombi in 4 patients deep vein thrombosis in 3 and generalized multiorgan infarctions due to thrombi in two of the patients8 although the main scientific societies have formulated positions and consensus related to the diagnosis of covid-19 and the role of tests such as ct in this procedure no specific proposals have been made on the indication of ct angiography to diagnose a thromboembolic pulmonary event despite the lack of sufficient evidence at the moment the results reported to date and the pathogenic mechanisms plausibly involved make it advisable to consider this aspect in those patients with copd who after hospital discharge develop in the medium to long term an increase in dyspnoea not justified by spirometric parameterson the other hand we have to consider the risk of cardiovascular disease development abnormal biomarkers consistent with heart damage are a prominent feature of sars-cov-2 infection and are associated with a poorer prognosis9 the underlying mechanisms are not well established but it is likely that it involves the presence of myocardial stress in relation to hypoxemia or it might be related to a direct effect of the viral infection with a systemic inflammatory response or with a combination of the 3 factors a post-mortem real-time pcr of heart tissue during the sars-cov-1 epidemic detected the presence of the viral genome in 35 of those deceased10 it is noteworthy that these hearts had a decrease in the expression of angiotensin 2 receptors an aspect that could highlight the relationship of this receptor in the mediation of the infection and a greater hypertrophy10 myocardial pericytes which play an important role in maintaining endothelial function express angiotensin-2 receptors abundantly11 pericyte and endothelial cell dysfunction either due to direct infection or global inflammation can lead to coronary microcirculation disruption with subsequent ischemic consequences but its possible relationship with sars-cov-2 infection is pure conjecture for now we do not know if patients suffering from a sars-cov-2-related myocarditis will develop any type of medium to long-term heart failureother aspects of cardiac involvement to consider in sars-cov-2 infection are cardiac arrhythmias such events may arise from severe hypoxemia from ion disorders from systemic inflammation from the use of drugs to combat coronavirus or from direct damage to the myocardium caused by sars-cov-212
furthermore patients with sars-cov-2 can develop acute coronary syndromes and acute myocardial infarction but the incidence of such events is unclear a priori the risk of coronary event in these patients may increase due to an increased thrombotic predisposition as evidenced by the significantly high levels of d-dimer in these patients13 underlying this risk are predisposing factors related to inflammation that will have a relevant role in this process such as endothelial and smooth muscle cell activation macrophage activation and tissue factor expression in addition to platelet activationcardiovascular complications are possible even after recovery from infection in italy the development of fulminant myocarditis has been described in a convalescent patient one week after respiratory symptoms had resolved14 this suggests that the underlying inflammation may persist and progress silently with its complications manifesting in a delayed manner in the sars-cov-1 epidemic some of the survivors developed avascular necrosis pulmonary fibrosis and dyslipidaemia after viral infection15 16 which may have a relevant impact on those patients who already had some underlying respiratory or cardiovascular conditiontaking into account the aforementioned we must carefully evaluate case by case the worsening or the de novo onset of cardiovascular comorbidity when planning outpatient follow-up in patients with copd who have suffered a sars-cov-2 infection since patients with copd and concomitant heart disease suffer a greater degree of dyspnoea and exercise intolerance and an increased risk of hospitalizationfinally we must evaluate acute lung damage severe pneumoniaadult acute respiratory distress and lung function deterioration similar to that described in the mers-cov and sars-cov-1 the most common radiological findings are ground glass opacities with or without consolidation and predominantly in the lung bases with posterior and peripheral location although considerable information is available on the acute radiological manifestations of the disease we do not yet have information on its long-term progression nor on its possible impact on lung function therefore at the moment one can only speculate about whether future changes will be similar to those described in other viral infections chen et al17 conducted a follow-up of 56 patients for h7n9 influenza with the intention of assessing the functional and radiological progression on ct during 2 years after infection despite the persistence of interstitial changes and fibrosis on imaging tests the functional parameters of ventilation and diffusion showed a tendency to improve after 6 months however after 2 years a mild-moderate impairment in the diffusing capacity of lung for co dlco persisted in 77 of cases ong et al18 evaluated lung function in 94 patients one year after suffering from a sars-cov-1 respiratory infection this study demonstrated that 18 of the cases had a slight-moderate reduction in dlco values while 63 of patients showed no anomalies in the spirometric parameters zhang et al19 monitored the functional respiratory and radiological progression of sars-cov-1 infection patients for 15 years they described how in the first year of follow-up there was a radiological improvement that stabilized in subsequent years from a functional point of view patients without interstitial changes on ct showed a more significant improvement in spirometric parameters compared to those with interstitial involvement if sars-cov-2 infection behaves similarly to that described by these authors a radiological and functional improvement is expected in the months following infection but we do not know whether a certain degree of irreversible deterioration will persist especially in patients with copd or if there will be changes in functional decline nor do we know if the hypothetical functional impact depends on the prevalence of a phenotype of airway or lung parenchyma involvement emphysemafinally there is evidence that severe sars-cov-2 infection cases may develop traction bronchiectasis20 the potential impact of this fact in a patient with copd is very great since the presence of bronchiectasis in these subjects increases the risk of chronic bronchitis and neutrophilic inflammation of the airway and is associated with a greater functional decline quality of life deterioration and increased risk of exacerbation and deathin conclusion the sars-cov-2 pandemic will involve changes in the care of copd patients suffering from the infection there is sufficient theoretical basis to fear that some of these patients will suffer new comorbidities or the worsening of the existing ones with special impact on cardiovascular health and that the infection could have an impact on lung function of uncertain extent the effect on the symptoms exacerbations and the vital prognosis of our patients is still an area of uncertainty and in the coming months we will have to incorporate the information generated regarding the foreseeable modifications that will be made in the monitoring and treatment schedules of the disease

evidence for transmission was based on elevated immunoglobulin ig-m antibody values in blood drawn from the neonates following birth no infant specimen had a positive reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction test result therefore there was no virologic evidence for congenital infection in these cases to support the serologic suggestion of in utero transmission
17
a second study of six known covid-19-positive mothers and their infants showed similar results
18
however several other studies have not demonstrated any evidence of vertical transmission of covid-19

21

there are no current coronavirus-specific vaccines or therapeutics available
1
5
in the absence of vaccines or targeted therapy management of covid-19 in pregnancy must focus on prevention
22
23
pregnant women should be advised to avoid unnecessary travel group events public transportation and contact with symptomatic individuals
5

all patients presenting for triage or scheduled delivery should be screened for symptoms of covid-19 by staff at time of presentation to labor and delivery the number of entry points to labor and delivery should be limited to ensure all patients and visitors are screened women should be evaluated for signs or symptoms of covid-19
4
5
if a patient calls the hospital prior to arrival screening should occur over the phone to best prepare and allocate resources prior to the patients arrival

current data suggest that person-to-person transmission most commonly occurs during close contact with infected individuals primarily through respiratory droplets
22
not all individuals infected are symptomatic and therefore may not be identified through screening upon entry to the hospital or the labor and delivery unit therefore there should be limited visitation on labor and delivery no visitors should be allowed for persons under investigation pui or covid-19-positive patients for all other patients on labor and delivery during the current pandemic institutions could consider one visitor at time of delivery however for those areas of the country with a significant covid-19 burden a universal no visitation policy may be more advantageous

women with symptoms suggestive of covid-19 should be immediately isolated for those with confirmed testing patients should be placed in a negative pressure room if negative pressure rooms are not available then patients should be placed in isolated rooms away from other occupied rooms isolation room filtration systems such as the high-efficiency particulate absorbing hepa units can also be utilized to create portable negative pressure rooms when options are otherwise limited
24
25
26
movement of both puis and confirmed positive patients should be limited throughout the facility personnel involved in patient care should be limited to only those necessary

standard respiratory precautions should be utilized in all areas of labor and delivery by providers patients and visitors all health care professionals caring for puis or confirmed covid-19-positive patients should use appropriate personal protective equipment ppe droplet and contact precautions including face shield or goggles surgical mask gown and gloves should be used for all clinical interactions in agreement with centers for disease control and prevention cdc and world health organization who guidelines
3
22
n95 masks should be used whenever an aerosolizing procedure is being performed or likely to be performed on a patient with suspected or confirmed covid-19 such as cesarean delivery postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfer to the operating room or intubation
22
27
all patients and visitors should be encouraged to wear surgical masks at all times but particularly those with suspected or confirmed infection

a designated room with negative pressure capabilities should be reserved for puis or covid-19-positive patients a negative pressure operating room for pregnant women who warrant cesarean delivery with suspected or confirmed infection should also be established in advance of need special consideration should also be made to ensure there is a designated isolation room for newborns of mothers with suspected or confirmed infection in close proximity of delivery or operating room if negative pressure rooms are not available then patients should be placed in isolated rooms away from other occupied rooms hepa units can also be considered for the prevention of the spread of airborne viral organisms
24
25
26
mode of delivery should continue to be individualized based on obstetric indicationsas long as there is an appropriate indication and it is performed at the appropriate gestational age scheduled cesarean deliveries should not be delayed based on the covid-19 pandemic this procedure efficiently moves the patient through the delivery process allowing the patient and her newborn to be discharged in a timely fashion consideration can be given to day 2 postpartum discharge if the patient is stable and has adequate home resources if a patient who is covid-19-positive has a scheduled cesarean delivery for unrelated medical indications a negative pressure operating room should be utilized as described above if a pui or covid-19-positive patient is requiring medical treatment due to covid-19 complications the cesarean delivery may need to be postponed to optimize respiratory status prior to procedure the mother should always be stabilized prior to delivery anesthesia maternal-fetal medicine and neonatology should be involved in the preoperative planning of any pui or covid-19-positive patient to ensure all necessary resources are available in advance
there should be some consideration of delaying elective inductions with a poor bishops score while the cesarean section rate was not increased with induction at 39 weeks in a randomized trial of induction versus expectant management arrive it did establish that time to delivery and length of stay were increased
28
an extended induction even with successful vaginal delivery increases exposure time for both patients and staff medically or obstetrically indicated inductions however should not be delayed

the decision for delivery in the setting of severe covid-19 infection is challenging the increased oxygen consumption and reduced functional residual capacity of pregnancy predisposes to rapid deterioration of both maternal and fetal status when combined with the physiologic changes associated with severe infection the decision for delivery should take into consideration gestational age maternal status and fetal status importantly stabilizing the mother prior to emergent delivery for fetal indications is imperative through stabilization of the mother the fetus status will likely improve
29
clinical scenarios for which delivery is likely indicated to maximize resuscitative efforts in cases of severe covid-19 complicated by sepsis and septic shock are presented in
table 1
 of note uterine distention secondary to multifetal gestations macrosomia and polyhydramnios among other processes can result in compromised cardiopulmonary function due to diaphragm displacement in such patients with compromised cardiopulmonary dysfunction that requires intubation delivery at 32 weeks should be considered and decision balanced with benefits of pregnancy continuation following consultation with neonatology

the potential benefits of additional in utero time for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes pprom must be balanced in light of current covid-19 pandemic circumstances and known adverse outcomes in patients with pprom such as chorioamnionitis placental abruption cord prolapse cord compression or uteroplacental insufficiency
30
despite the recent randomized control trial of singletons between 34
07
and 36
67
weeks with pprom by morris et al demonstrating no increased risk of neonatal sepsis or composite neonatal morbidity sepsis mechanical ventilation 24 hours stillbirth or neonatal death in the current setting there are additional risks associated with extended hospital stays to be considered for patients
31
additionally this trial also demonstrated increased maternal morbidity such as hemorrhage and infection associated with expectant management of pprom after 34 weeks that would further increase exposure to different medical personnel movement between different hospital settings ie labor operating room and intensive care unit and overall length of stay
31
as median latency following pprom is 7 days particularly after 29 to 30 weeks the potential benefits of expectant management beyond 34 weeks may be mitigated by the development of associated adverse outcomes and continued hospitalization during the covid-19 pandemic
31
32
33
a case could also be made for induction at 32 weeks of gestation based on the perinatal outcomes from previous studies following consultation with neonatology
34
35
36
pasquier et al conducted a randomized control trial of 139 women with pprom between 28
07
and 31
67
weeks and allocated them to either expectant management with delivery at 34 weeks or delivery 24 hours after completion of steroid course
35
this study found no significant differences in neonatal outcomes between groups a second randomized control trial conducted by cox and leveno of 129 women with pprom between 30 and 34 weeks had similar results
36

as the primary risk factor for infection with covid-19 is close contact with infected individuals limiting frequency and duration of exposure is key in prevention for medical professionals
3
21
this involves limiting unnecessary time in rooms and reducing the number of digital cervical exams by both nurses and physicians when possible for uncomplicated labor patients exams should be spaced to limit the number of providers in direct contact with patients ultrasound assessments should be limited and utilized only when likely to alter clinical management

although there has been a recent trend to allow a longer second stage of labor in hope of reducing the cesarean delivery rate due to failure to progress in the second stage a prolonged second stage may be ill advised during the covid-19 pandemic due to an increased risk of respiratory secretion exposures to visitors and medical personnel
37
as such it may be prudent to resume previous recommendations of a 1-hour second stage in a multiparous patient without an epidural 2 hours with an epidural and a 2-hour second stage in a nulliparous patient without an epidural 3 hours with an epidural consideration should also be given to shortening the second stage with an operative vaginal delivery in those patients that meet prerequisites including a fully dilated cervix fetal head engagement low fetal station adequate clinical pelvimetry and patient consent
if possible active pushing during the second stage of labor should be minimized deep breathing and maternal expulsive efforts may increase visitor and personnel exposure to the patients respiratory secretions the pushing process therefore potentiates the risk of transmission to those in the room particularly the nurses and physicians as such every effort should be made to labor down patients as much as feasibly possible however the patient should not be discouraged to push if she has a strong urge to push
as previously discussed two recent cohort studies suggest the possibility of covid-19 vertical transmission
17
18
while several other studies have not shown these results we must remain cautious without definitive data
5
7
8
19
20
21
as such we recommend avoidance of delayed cord clamping given the potential increased risk of viral transmission to the newborn

individuals on labor and delivery particularly puis or confirmed covid-19-positive cases should be cautiously treated with intravenous iv fluids aggressive hydration can worsen oxygenation status
4
further although normal saline and lactated ringers are excellent choices for iv fluid in a patient for which delivery is anticipated the additional sodium load can predispose patients to pulmonary congestion if iv fluids are required in a patient for which delivery is not anticipated iv fluids with reduced sodium load 14-normal saline or 12-normal saline should be considered

several studies have demonstrated that the use of oxygen face and nonrebreather masks can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions thereby increasing viral transmission
38
39
40
on labor and delivery maternal oxygen supplementation has historically been used for intrapartum resuscitation of nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings however available evidence has not suggested any neonatal benefit to intrapartum maternal oxygen supplementation
41
42
rather some trials have suggested risks to the neonate including prolonged resuscitation and acidemia
43
44
45
in light of the increased risk of viral transmission and lack of proven fetal benefit of maternal oxygenation for fetal resuscitation we suggest use of maternal oxygen therapy for treatment of maternal hypoxia and limiting its use for fetal resuscitation we recognize that this may be a difficult change therefore we suggest a physician review the fetal heart rate tracing prior to administration of supplemental oxygen therapy in all patients maternal oxygen supplementation should be reserved for patients with fetal bradycardia prolonged recurrent or persistent decelerations or other situations with a severely abnormal fetal heart rate tracing with the suspected hypoxia

for women 34
07
weeks who are candidates for an initial course of antenatal corticosteroids acs we should follow current practices and administer acs as indicated
46
however use of acs after 34 weeks or as a rescue course should be reconsidered during the current covid-19 pandemic data regarding the benefits of late preterm steroids remain mixed some studies support improved respiratory outcomes for infants administered steroids in the late preterm period while others do not show these improved outcomes and instead demonstrate an increased risk of adverse outcomes such as neonatal hypoglycemia and sepsis
47
48
49
50
51
data regarding rescue course of steroids is similarly inconsistent
52
53
54
55
56
57
given these inconsistencies regarding perinatal benefit to late preterm and rescue acs as well as the suppression of the maternal immune response associated with steroid administration we recommend all late preterm antenatal steroids and rescue courses to be withheld during the pandemic
5
for puis or covid-19-positive women we should evaluate the risk and benefits of any steroid administration on a case-by-case basis for these individuals the riskbenefit ratio for acs would suggest the benefits do not seem to outweigh the risks of facilitating or worsening covid-19 infection patients with unstable conditions including but not limited to eclampsia pulmonary edema acute respiratory distress syndrome or barotrauma disseminated intravascular coagulation suspected abruptio placentae or nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings should be delivered regardless of the benefit of corticosteroids following maternal stabilization however the decision to deliver should be individualized with involvement of maternal-fetal medicine intensivists and neonatology

magnesium sulfate is a widely used medication on labor and delivery it is usually recommended for neuroprotection for extremely premature fetuses 32 weeks and for seizure prophylaxis in patients with preeclampsia
58
59
however magnesium is not without risks one major albeit uncommon side effect is respiratory depression this can have serious implications for maternal outcomes particularly for puis and known covid-19-positive patients with an already compromised respiratory status as such the benefits of magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection and seizure prophylaxis should be weighed against the risks to the maternal respiratory function in light of gestational age and maternal respiratory status the society for maternal fetal medicine smfm has suggested that a single 4-g bolus dose of magnesium sulfate may serve as an alternative to usual dosing in the setting of mild respiratory distress with caution of any use in those with moderate-to-severe respiratory distress
23
this is appropriate in the case of impending delivery in pregnancies at 31 weeks for patients with preeclampsia without severe features or gestational hypertension magnesium sulfate therapy should not to be administered in those with severe features however magnesium sulfate prophylaxis is indicated as suggested by the results of the magpie trial an iv loading dose of 4-g magnesium sulfate over 15 to 20 minutes followed by an iv maintenance dose of 1 gh could be used rather than a traditional higher loading dose 6 g or maintenance dose 2 gh
60
providing informed consent for randomized trials requires extensive patient interactions with research and clinical staff for studies that are not directly related to the treatment or management of covid-19 a delay in studies until resolution of the current pandemic may be prudent
there is limited data regarding use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids in the covid-19 population
61
62
some reports have suggested nsaids may exacerbate symptoms of covid-19 this is largely based on data regarding other respiratory infections
61
63
the primary mechanism through which nsaids are hypothesized to impact covid-19-positive patients is through inhibition of cyclooxygenases
63
however there remains no evidence that nsaids worsen disease outcomes in covid-19 patients
61
62
64
65
further some studies have actually suggested a benefit to nsaid use
62
66
a 2006 study demonstrated that indomethacin may actually have antiviral activity against the sars-cov
66
given the lack of conclusive data regarding nsaid use in covid-19 as well as limited analgesic options postpartum we recommend continued use as clinically indicated

the 15-methyl prostaglandin f
2
is a commonly utilized uterotonic for postpartum hemorrhage
67
it should be used cautiously in patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection due to its ability to increase pulmonary vascular resistance it is therefore contraindicated in patients with active respiratory disease such as those with severe covid-19 infection
67
for covid-19-positive patients or puis undergoing inpatient evaluation and treatment venous thromboembolism vte prophylaxis should be considered these patients have risk factors for vte including limited ambulation pregnant or postpartum status and infection among other individualized risk factors as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism can mimic respiratory distress associated with severe covid-19 infection this should be considered in the differential of puis particularly those with hypoxia unless otherwise medically indicated vte prophylaxis can be discontinued for puis or covid-19-positive patients upon dischargein the wake of the covid-19 pandemic health care professionals must seek ways to adapt their clinical practice to protect patients themselves and health care resources while the health care system in the united states has minimized elective encounters and procedures at large obstetricians are in a unique position the birthing process cannot be considered elective as such labor and delivery cannot be scaled down in the same manner as other units within the hospital however through thoughtful deliberate planning and feasible changes in approach to care we can make a difference in both exposure of potentially infected patients to health care workers and in reducing length of stay without impacting perinatal outcomesdespite the limited data regarding covid-19 in pregnancy it is important to make changes in clinical practice that consider the current health care climate it is our belief that implementation of the above recommendations will protect patients and health care workers while also conserving health care resourcesfollowing are our recommendations summarizeda recently identified novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 covid-19 emerged in december 2019 in wuhan city china and rapidly spread to the rest of world with a 4-12 mortality rate covid-19 is an emerging threat to global public health according to the world health organization who china reported a cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan hubei province on december 31 2019 it was reported that no deaths were associated with this pneumonia outbreak which involved 44 patients as of january 4 2020 on january 5 2020 who announced that the pneumonia outbreak was due to a new virus that originated in the huanan seafood market in wuhan china on january 12 2020 the virus was confirmed as a novel coronavirus ncov the first case of ncov outside of china was reported in thailand on january 13 2020on the following day the who announced that there was limited human-to-human transmission of ncov mainly through family members and suggested the possibility of a wider outbreak on january 30 2020 the who declared that 2019-ncov was a public health emergency of international concern pheic on february 11 2020 2019ncov was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 by the coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses and the who officially named the disease caused by the 2019ncov as coronavirus disease covid19 a month later march 11 2020 the who declared covid-19 a pandemic and sars-cov-2 infection has since reached pandemic status worldwide the worldwide spread of this virus from china is associated with international travel and subsequent communal transmissioncurrently the virus is aggressively and rapidly spreading infecting millions of people globally and causing high mortality and morbidity indeed compared to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is more virulent infecting a greater number of individuals world-wide than these earlier viruses the available public health tools to control transmission are passive approaches such as isolation and quarantine social distancing and community containment measures moreover after the current crisis abates there remains a high probability of a reemergence of sras-cov-2 and covid-19 in the fall or upcoming years as there are currently no vaccines or specific treatment available for covid-19while previous recognition of sars pathogenesis greatly facilitates our understanding of the pathogenesis of covid-19 our current understanding remains limited and is based largely on clinical observations and a few autopsy findings a better understanding of the pathogenesis will help us develop better more specific treatment and prevention strategies for covid-19 one potential target for therapeutic intervention is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 a peptidase in the renin-angiotensin system ras figure 1 ace2 plays a crucial role in sars infection and is believed to serve as a major entry receptor for sars-cov-2 in humans figure 1in infected patients sars-cov-2 mainly infects the type ii pneumocytes in lungs and but also infects proximal tubule epithelial cells in kidney in severe cases 1 these cells express its receptor ace2 which facilitates viral entry 2 3 the endothelial cells in a variety of tissues may be also infected by the virus although they appear to express little to no ace2 infection leads to the downregulation of ace2 figure 1 which impacts the function of ang ii and ras in a variety of tissues including lung heart vasculature and kidney and may facilitate the progression of covid-19 from mild and moderate to more severe disease figure 1 indeed direct infection of endothelial cells may explain some of the clinical features of advanced disease including massive activation of coagulation pathways and platelets as well as immune cells such as monocytes and neutrophils in the lung heart and kidney these observations suggest that ace2 may play a critical pathogenic role in covid-19 which warrants further extensive investigation here we review the current view of ace2 in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infectionace2 serves as an entry receptor for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in humans by binding to the viral envelope protein spike s protein which may contribute to pathogenesis of sars 4-7 the prompt identification of ace2 as the receptor for sars-cov-2 is largely due to its identification as the receptor for sars-cov which emerged approximately 17 years ago at that time ace2 was identified as the functional receptor for sars-cov after the fusion protein gene of sars-cov was characterized 8 through in vitro studies li et al 9 found that 1 ace2 efficiently binds the s1 domain of the sars-cov s protein 2 a soluble form of ace2 but not ace1 blocked association of the s1 domain with ace2 3 sars-cov replicated efficiently in ace2-transfected but not mock-transfected 293t cells and 4 anti-ace2 but not anti-ace1 antibody blocked viral replication on vero e6 cells from african green monkey kidney a cell sensitive to sars-cov 10 middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 11 and sars-cov-2 infection 12 in addition exogenous ace2 expression allows refractory cell lines to support sars-cov replication 13 these results convincingly demonstrate that ace2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov 9in vivo studies also consistently demonstrate that ace2 is a crucial sars-cov receptor 14 a deficiency of ace2 in mice results in a dramatic decrease in viral replication and much less severe pathologic alterations in lungs as compared to wild-type mice 14 15 transgenic overexpression of human ace2 hace2 in mice renders them more likely to develop severe sars phenotypes similar to those seen in human patients 16-18 the injection of sars-cov spike s protein into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo
14 recombinant ace2 can protect mice from severe acute lung injury by blocking sars-cov from binding to the membrane-bound form of ace2 in pneumocytes which suggests that soluble ace2 may have a therapeutic potential for treatment of sars 15 as well as covid-19 together these extensive in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that ace2 serves as a major receptor for sars-cov infectionsars-cov-2 and sars-cov s proteins share 765 identity in amino acid sequences 19 the s protein of sars-cov-2 is a 1273 amino acid aa protein consisting of two very important regions referred to as s1 and s2 in addition to the n-terminal 19 aa signal peptide and in the carboxy terminal a short transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain the s1 region harbors the n-terminal domain ntd and a c-terminal domain ctd both of which function as the receptor-binding domain rbd figure 2a ace2 serves as an entry receptor for both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in humans via binding to their s proteins 5 6 20 which have almost identical 3-d structures recent studies from three independent groups using biolayer interferometry binding analysis reported kd values between ace2 and sars-cov rbd of 31 152 and 50 nm and 152 47 and 12 nm between ace2 and sars-cov-2 rbd 21-23 25- crystal structure of sars-cov-2 ctd complexed with hace2 revealed the sars-cov-2 rbd is similar to that of sars-cov rbd 24 through a separate study using surface plasmon resonance ace2 was reported to bind the sars-cov2 s ectodomain with 15 nm affinity which is 10- to 20-fold higher than ace2 binding to sars-cov s 25similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 utilizes cellular proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 26-29 and the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin b and l 30 for s protein priming to enhance virus entry 6 28 proteolysis of the s protein into s1 and s2 is essential for s protein-mediated cov infection 31 interestingly sequence analysis of sars-cov-2 demonstrates the presence of four novel amino acid prra insertions between s1 and s2 21 in comparison to sars-cov figure 2b which results in the introduction of a cleavage site by furin a member of the kexin-like subfamily of proprotein convertases 32 this sequence is conserved among all sars-cov-2 isolates sequenced to date but is not found in the sequence of the s protein of its closest relative ratg13 33 in addition the s1s2 cleavage site of sars-cov-2 s harbors several arginine residues that are not present in ratg13 the functional significance of this multibasic cleavage site remains to be ascertained hoffmann and co-workers demonstrated that the endosomal ph modulator ammonium chloride which blocks cathepsin b and l activity strongly inhibited sars-cov-2 entry in tmprss2- 293t cells 6 furthermore the tmprss2 inhibitor camostat mesylate partially blocked sars-cov-2-s entry into cells while e-64d an inhibitor of cathepsin b and l in combination with camostat mesylate fully inhibited sars-cov-2 s-mediated entry into cells 6tmprss2 is required for activation of a viral fusion protein but not for the s protein synthesized in and transported to the surface of cells 28 tmprss2 proteolytically cleaves and activates the s protein in subunit s1 which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells 27 34 tmprss2 is expressed in lung tissue and subsegmental bronchial branches in the subsegmental bronchial branches ace2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type 35 colocalization of tmprss2 with ace2 enhances cell entry which correlates with tmprss2-mediated proteolysis of adsorbed s and ace2 complexes 29 the significance of tmprss2 in mediating efficient virus infection is demonstrated in mice deficient of tmprss2 which have reduced body weight loss and virus in lungs following challenge with a mouse-adapted sars-cov 36 adam17 a metalloprotease can also cleave ace2 37 tmprss2 was found to compete with the metalloprotease adam17 for ace2 processing 37 suggesting that adam17-cleaved ace2 may confer organ protection 38 conversely with the help of tmprss2 adam17-regulated ectodomain shedding of ace2 may also support sars-cov cell entry through endocytosis thereby contributing to infection 38 thus the exact role of adam17-mediated ace2 shedding in sars-cov-2 infection of kidney and lungs requires further investigation these findings suggest that a cell surface complex comprising a primary receptor ace2 and tmprss2 operates as a major portal for activation of sars-cov 29 and sars-cov-2 cell entry 6together these observations demonstrate that priming of the viral s protein by host cell proteases is essential for sars-cov-2 entry into cells this involves cleavage at the s1s2 and s2 sites by cellular protease allowing fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and subsequent viral entry these processes also contribute to the pathogenesis of sars and covid-19 39consistent with widespread expression of ace2 several organ systems appear to be impacted by infection indeed reports of new disease symptoms are disclosed almost daily however these may also reflect existing comorbidities or vulnerabilities of the infected individual typically patients initially present with fever chills dry cough and fatigue although less common gastrointestinal complications including abdominal pain nausea vomiting andor diarrhea have also been reported 40 41 viral rna levels from upper respiratory specimens appear to be higher soon after symptom onset as compared with later times 42-44 thus sars-cov-2 can be transmitted prior to the development of symptoms and throughout disease particularly early in the course 42-44 a large number of patients first show the infection in the lower respiratory tract possibly requiring hospitalization with mild or no symptoms 45 sars-cov-2 has a mean incubation period of 52 days and a median duration of the onset of symptoms to death of 14 days patients 70 years of age have a shorter median duration from the onset of initial symptoms to death of 115 days highlighting the vulnerability of this particular patient cohort 45 among the more severe cases requiring hospitalization leukopenia reduced white blood cells lymphocytopenia reduced lymphocytes and shortness of breath that may advance to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and requiring mechanical ventilation are frequently observed 41 46 47 bilateral lung ground-glass opacity is seen on computed tomography ct imaging in the majority of patients with covid-19 consistent with pulmonary involvement 41 48 49 50studies focused on the clinical characteristics of infection report that patients with underlying comorbidities are more likely to progress to severe respiratory disease and even death 40 41 48 among these aging hypertension diabetes and obesity appear to confer the greatest risk for the development of severe disease 41 47 51 52 the majority of individuals eventually recover from infection even among those requiring prolonged hospitalization concerns regarding whether patients attain full recovery prior to discharge have surfaced following anecdotal reports of a number of cured patients testing positive for the virus at a later date although it has been posited that this may reflect an absence of protective immunity among these individuals a recent report demonstrated sars-cov-2 in postmortem lung acquired from a patient who had been slated for discharge prior to succumbing to sudden cardiac arrest 53 interestingly this individual had three consecutive sars-cov-2 pcr negative nasopharyngeal swabs and improved significantly indicating she had recovered from the infection immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy however revealed residual virus in the lung and histopathological investigation showed diffuse alveolar damage consistent with lung injury previously observed in patients with sars and mers 53 the findings from this postmortem investigation yield important insight into sars-cov-2covid-19 pathogenesis and argue against the idea that previously infected individuals remain at risk for a second sars-cov-2 infection this remains a significant clinical and public health concern that requires further investigationalthough lung appears to be the primary site of infection and injury other tissues are also impacted by covid-19 particularly the vascular system a comprehensive autopsy study 54 revealed deep vein thrombosis in 7 of 12 patients 58 studied in whom venous thromboembolism was not suspected before death in the same investigation pulmonary embolism had been the direct cause of death in 4 patients consistently postmortem examinations reveal diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lung and other organs suggesting covid-19-related endothelial cell infection endotheliitis and vascular dysfunction 55-58 postmortem investigation of tissues that may harbor virus demonstrated that high levels of sars-cov-2 rna in lung of all 12 patients examined while 5 of the 12 patients demonstrated high viral titers in liver kidney or heart 54 these autopsy observations indicate that the pathogenesis of severe covid-19 involves significant coagulation and platelet activation endothelial cell and severe ongoing lung damage and other organ failure although clinical observations and autopsy studies greatly help us to understand the pathogenesis of covid-19 the mechanism underlying covid-19 pathogenesis still require further experimental studiesras consists of renin angiotensin and aldosterone ras plays an important role in regulating blood volume and systemic vascular resistance which together influence cardiac output and arterial pressure 59-61 ace2 is a peptidase of the ras a primary cardiovascular regulatory system 59-61 ace a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase in the ras converts the inactive decapeptide ang i into the active octapeptide and potent vasoconstrictor ang ii figure 1 and inactivates the vasodilator bradykinin 62 ace2 largely counteracts the activity of ace by degrading ang i into the nonapeptide ang 1-9 an inactive form of angiotensin it can also degrade and hydrolyze the vasoconstrictor ang ii into a heptapeptide ang 1-7 which acts as a potent vasodilator 59-61 ang ii a peptide with multiple actions promotes cardiovascular diseases cvd which can be antagonized by the effects of ang 1-7 63 64 it is important to note that the conversion of ang ii to ang 1-7 is the primary function of ace2 and kinetic studies reveal that ang ii is a much better substrate for ace2 than ang i 65 figure 1 the effects of ang ii are largely mediated through angiotensin ii receptor type i at1 which is opposed by ang 1-7 63 figure 1 ace breaks down ang 1-7 into ang 1-5 the major degrading pathway for ang 1-7 63ang ii is responsible for most of the physiological and pathophysiological effects of the ras figure 1 inhibitors of ace that reduce the formation of ang ii have been successfully applied as an effective hypertension treatment figure 1 ace inhibitors are also a standard therapy following myocardial infarction to delay the development of heart failure and reduce the progression of renal disease figure 1 ace2 influences ace by altering the ratio of ang ii and ang 1-7 effectively modulating the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators within the heart and kidney 66-68 figure 1 human ace2 has some homology 40 identity and 61 similarity at the amino acid level to human ace 69 despite sharing significant homology and many biochemical properties with ace ace2 activity cannot be blocked by classical ace inhibitors 70the ace2 gene contains 18 exons that map to chromosome xp22 thus gender differences in the ras cvd and renal diseases may be linked to the ace2 gene 60 69 both human and mouse ace2 contain 805 amino acids that include an n-terminal signal sequence a single active-site catalytic region and a c-terminal hydrophobic membrane-anchor region 70 ace2 is expressed predominantly by epithelial cells of the lungs and kidneys and cardio myocytes 66 primary targets of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 64 scrna-seq data analyses recently revealed that ace2 is highly expressed in organs at risk for injury in the context of covid-19 and sars including lung heart esophagus kidney bladder ileum oral mucosa and specific cell types eg type ii alveolar cells at2 in lung myocardial cells proximal tubule cells of the kidney ileum and esophagus epithelial cells and bladder urothelial cells 42 71 ace2 protein expression is high in renal and cardiovascular tissues and much of the gastrointestinal tract particularly ileum duodenum jejunum caecum and colon 2 interestingly ace2 expression is regulated by aging and genetic alteration which may explain the varying susceptibility among different ages and individuals one study showed no gender-related differences in ace2 expression between young and middle-aged adults however greater ace2 expression is observed between young adults those of advanced age which may contribute to the predominance in sars-cov-2 infection and development of more severe disease among older individuals 72 a more recent study however does not support this finding 73 car et al analyzed four large-scale datasets of normal lung tissue and found that race age or gender do not appear to influence ace2 gene expression 73 this study did reveal significantly higher ace2 gene expression in lung of smokers compared to non-smokers suggesting that smokers may be more susceptible to covid-19 73 genetic alterations in the expression of ace2 develop a diverse pattern of phenotypes ranging from hypertension and metabolic and behavioral dysfunctions to impairments in serotonin synthesis and neurogenesis 74 75the level of ace2 is also influenced by some cvd and antihypertensive drugs targeted to ras such as ang ii receptor blockers arbs but not ace inhibitors figure 1 76 plasma ace2 activity is low in healthy subjects but elevated in patients with cvd 77 arbs such as olmesartan but not ace inhibitors increase urinary ace2 76 this potentially offers additional renoprotective effects in patients who use olmesartan 76 ace inhibitors increase ang 1-7 through ang i conversion by neprilysin so altered ace2 is not required 63 increased ang ii levels are suggested to upregulate ace2 activity 60 in ace2-deficient mice ang ii levels are approximately double that of wild-type mice while ang 1-7 levels are almost undetectable 60 loss of ace2 accelerates diabetic kidney injury in these mice and contributes to the late development of ang ii-dependent glomerulosclerosis 78 79 using adeno-associated virus aav or adenoviral-mediated gene delivery of ace2 or ang 1-7 protects against diabetes-induced retinopathy and glomerular injury in rodent models 80-82 further targeting the degradation of ang ii with recombinant ace2 prevents angiotensin ii-dependent hypertension 83 and human recombinant ace2 reduces the progression of diabetic nephropathy 84 together these findings suggest that ace2 plays a crucial role in the ras because it opposes the actions of ang ii 60 69 figure 1 moreover ace2 has a beneficial role and therapeutic potential in many diseases such as hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease because ace2 performs these vital functions as well as serving as a receptor for sars-cov-2 infection that result in its downregulation it is conceivable that ace2 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of sars and covid-19sars-cov s protein downregulates ace2 expression and thereby promotes lung injury 85 this downregulation effect may result from enhanced sheddinginternalizing processes and other unknown mechanisms 85 86 consistently sars-cov replicated efficiently in ace2-positive vero cells which also reduced ace2 expression indicating robust receptor interference in the context of sars-cov 14 since a virus must dock and enter the cells before it can replicate surface localization of ace2 and the state of cell differentiation may have a strong impact on sars-cov disease and other pathologies triggered by acute lung injury 75 as discussed above the maintenance of normal ace2 levels in lung is beneficial for combatting inflammatory lung disease 66-68 the ras acts both systemically and locally in a variety of tissues including the lung 75 these results suggest a molecular mechanism for sars-cov-associated severe and often lethal lung failure and support a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing or attenuating sars and covid-19 14 75although ace2 is widely recognized as the primary receptor for sars-cov-2 its role in the pathogenesis of covid-19 remains elusive ace2 plays an essential role in virus infection and dissemination however whether ace2 contributes to the progression of severe covid-19 through additional means remains unclear sars-cov-2 infects ace2-expressing cells in the lung leading to shedding of ace2 from tissue effectively reducing the level of ace2 expression by infected cells on the other hand if ace2 is shed into the bronchial space by sars-cov-2 the peptidase is still active and can cleave ang ii to ang 1-7 within the bronchial space ace2 can still bind sars-cov-2 but doesnt internalize since it is no longer attached to the apical membrane of the epithelial cells figure 1 whether this shedding prevents other cells from sars-cov-2 infection remains elusive and warrants further investigationin a mouse model membrane-bound ace2 was demonstrated to play a critical role in anti-inflammation through ras signaling and conversion of ang ii to ang 1-7 which protected animals against acute lung injury 15 it is conceivable that the reduction of ace2 expression may promote inflammation in the lung and the subsequent cytokine storm that presents in many severe covid-19 patients figure 1 ace2 maintains proper function of heart and kidney and downregulation of ace2 by sars-cov-2 may compromise this protective feature and contribute to the damage caused by infection of these organs figure 1 since ace2 also serves as a binding site for sars-cov-2 enriched expression in lung and other tissues may play a dual role in facilitating virus entry detrimental and protection from additional viral attack protective figure 1 depending on the stage of infection 87 88 of note ace2 has collectrin domains that facilitate amino acid transport there is 478 identity between ace2 collectrin domains and tmem27 collectrin 89 since tmem27 is expressed in multiple tissues including guts and lacks the extracellular peptide domain of ace2 it is not expected to directly bind and enable internalization of sars-cov-264 90 animal studies indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs may increase ace2 expression patients who take aceis and arbs were assumed to be at increased risk for sars-cov-2 infections due to elevated ace2 expression 91 92 use of aceis were thought to cause increased morbidity and mortality of covid-19 93 however this hypothesis is not supported by other clinical findings where recent studies show that aceisarbs are unrelated to the severity or mortality of covid-19 in such patients 94 95 and may even improve the outcome of covid-19 as discussed extensively below 96 these clinical studies suggest that the downregulation of ace2 caused by sars-cov-2 infections may accelerate the progression of covid-19 from mild to severe disease via increased activity of the ras figure 1many patients with covid-19 present with dysfunction of multiple organs including heart kidney and intestine which are also rich in ace2 expression it is still unclear whether the damage is from direct infection of ace2-expressed endothelialepithelial cells at those tissues or an indirect effect from the whole-body cytokine storm in severe covid-19 patients enriched ace2 expression in endothelialepithelial cells might make these tissues vulnerable to the virus entering the circulation system from the lung sars-cov-2 infection of kidney tubules and the digestive system has been documented through biopsy studies 97 98 this may result in renal injuryfailure and digestive disorders such as loss of appetite and diarrhea experienced by some infected individuals 97 98 cardiovascular complications are rapidly emerging as a key threat in covid-19 in addition to respiratory renal and digestive diseases 99 recent findings show the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and an accumulation of inflammatory cells in addition to endothelial and inflammatory cell death 99 these findings suggest that sars-cov-2 infection facilitates the induction of endotheliitis in several organs as a direct consequence of viral involvement as noted by the presence of viral bodies and of the host inflammatory response 99 covid19 patients also exhibit some neurological manifestations including loss of smell ataxia and convulsions indicative of a potential direct or indirect attack on neurons andor glia 51 100 it is likely that disease exaggeration up to the late stage may be attributed not only to direct viral damage but also generalized hypoxia andor immune-mediated injury induced by sars-cov-2 101 two pathological features occur in severe covid-19 patients progressive increase of immune activation and cytokine storm and an unusual trend of hypercoagulation and platelet activation 101 however whether ace2 expression on cells of multiple organs contribute to multi-organ damage in patients is unclear as does the role of ace2 in immune activation and cytokine storm whether downregulation of ace2 in the infected organs facilitates multiple organ failure also remains uncleara recent study using an engineered human tissue system demonstrated that soluble human ace2 can reduce viral growth in vitro and inhibit sars-cov-2 infection in blood vessels and human kidney organoids on the early stages of infection 102 suggesting exogenous ace2 could block early entry of sars-cov-2 further because of the protective effects of ace2 on chronic underlying diseases and ards the development of therapeutic enhancers of ace2 activity such as diminazene aceturate dize 103 which are currently used as antiparasitic drugs has been proposed for the treatment of covid-19 patients in the late stages of disease 104 however due to lung gut liver and kidney toxicity it is very unlikely to enter clinical trial 105 106 further whether or not administration of soluble ace2 or ace2 activator is beneficial in later stages of the disease requires further study ace2 gene polymorphisms do not affect the outcome of severe ards 107 and results obtained from human studies of the role of ace2 gene polymorphisms in human hypertension are inconclusive some studies suggest that the gene polymorphism is association with human hypertension 108-115 which is not supported in other studies 116 the role of ace2 in the development of covid-19 is complex it may serve as a binding target but it may also directly participate in the pathogenesis of disease and contribute to immune activation and dysfunction further investigation in animal models and clinical trials is much needed to clarify these mechanismsno single model offers a direct reproduction of what is seen in humans with sars 118 120 121 in the spontaneous condition without molecular engineering monkeys cats ferrets mice swine chickens hamsters guinea pigs and rats have been experimentally infected 117 122-124 most display mild signs with severe acute pneumonia-like symptoms after infection and show sars-cov replication in their serum followed by spontaneously clearing the virus 117 122 123 some studies show that ferrets exhibit the strongest clinical symptoms and pathology 120 123 125 however these findings were not reproduced in later studies 121 123 126 studies conducted in various species of nhps such as rhesus macaques cynomolgus macaques and african green monkeys support sars-cov replication and the animals develop pneumonitis with variable mild clinical symptoms depending upon the species employed 120 127 no single nhp species is highly preferred at this time 120although mice are the best model for pathogenesis studies of sars inbred mouse strains such as b6 balbc and 129 mice infected with sars-cov do not show associated signs of clinical illness or overt pathology that are reproducible and equivalent in severity to those observed in sars patients 118 in addition sars-cov infects old balbc wild type mice 12-14 months old and shows some severe phenotypes 128 while sars-cov-infected aged balbc mice demonstrate signs of clinical illness characterized by significant weight loss hunching ruffled fur and slight dehydration measured by skin turgor 128 although this age-related increase in morbidity in balbc mice represents the clinical characteristics seen in humans in the 2003 sars outbreak as well as the current sars-cov-2 crisis in which age is a significant risk factor for severe disease and poor outcome old mice are very difficult to procure for experimental studies and their immune senescence also complicates pathogenesis studies 118 129to compensate for the disadvantage of using old mice a mouse-sensitive sars-cov derived from the urbani strain by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young balbc mice has been developed 129 fifteen passages resulted in a virus ma15 that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation 129 lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs viremia and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia neutrophilia and pathological changes in the lungs 129 abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli with only mild and focal pneumonitis 129 these observations suggest that mice infected with ma15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells 129 the ma15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence when introduced into a recombinant sars-cov these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus rma15 duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived ma15 virus 129 intranasal inoculation with ma15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of sars another new strain of sars-cov was further derived from serially passaged 25 times in balbc mice at 3-day intervals and resulted in a highly lethal strain designated as v2163 130 this v2163 strain was more severe with higher lethality even in 5- to 6-week-old balbc mice than ma15 strains it had nine mutations affecting 10 amino acid residues strain v2163 increased interleukin il-1 il-6 macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 and regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted rantes in mice with high il-6 expression correlating with increased mortality 130 the infection largely mimicked human disease but lung pathology lacked hyaline membrane formation 130 nonetheless these strains may be very helpful for pathogenesis studies 130 however since the strains are mutated to be sensitive to mice but not humans there are some concerns regarding the clinical relevance obtained by using these strains for preclinical studies in miceto compensate for this drawback transgenic overexpression of hace2 in mice may serve as a viable alternative for sars and covid-19 models 16-18 introduction of hace2 to mice renders them highly sensitive to the development of sars as seen in human subjects 16-18 yang and co-workers developed a mouse model of human sars-cov infection by introducing hace2 driven by the mouse ace2 promoter into the mouse genome 16 mice infected with a human sars strain show pulmonary lesions including interstitial hyperemia and hemorrhage monocytic and lymphocytic infiltration protein exudation alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and desquamation and even death 16 additionally sars-cov replicated more efficiently in the lungs of transgenic mice than in those of wild-type mice other pathologic changes including vasculitis degeneration and necrosis were found in the extrapulmonary organs of transgenic mice and viral antigen was found in brain 16 two other transgenic mouse models that express hace2 specifically in the airway and other epithelia or systemically in multiple tissues and cells develop a rapidly lethal infection after intranasal inoculation with sars-cov 17 18 infection begins in airway epithelia with subsequent alveolar involvement and extrapulmonary virus spread to the brain 17 infection results in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in both the lung and the brain 17 further another rapid model for sars and covid-19 can be achieved by over-expressing hace2 in lungs of wild type b6 mice by intranasally administering adenovirus 5-expressing hace2 ad5-hace2 an advantage of this model is that it can be easily adapted for performing pathogenesis studies in any given molecular-engineered mouse lines without multiple mouse crosses this approach has been successfully used to generate a rapid mouse model for mers via instilling an ad5 vector encoding mers receptor hdpp4 and prior to mers-cov infection 131some studies indicate that mice cats hamsters ferrets and nonhuman primates can be infected by sars-cov-2 132 after infection however only mild phenotypes in lung are seen that do not progress to severe disease a recent study demonstrates that ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to sars-cov-2 while dogs have low susceptibility and livestock including pigs chickens and ducks are not susceptible to the virus 132 however sars-cov-2 only replicates in the nasal turbinate soft palate and tonsils of ferrets which is not comparable with sars-cov which replicates in both the upper and lower respiratory tract of ferrets 132 another study reported that syrian hamsters infected by sars-cov-2 developed mild to moderate clinical syndrome and mild lung pathology changes 133 the maximal clinical signs included rapid breathing weight loss histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair airway and intestinal involvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression high lung viral load and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation all of which were observed within the first week of virus challenge 133 challenged index hamsters consistently infected nave contact hamsters housed within the same cage resulting in similar pathology but not weight loss 133 all infected hamsters recovered and developed mean serum neutralizing antibody titer 1427 fourteen days post-challenge immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved a significant decrease in lung viral load but not in lung pathology 133 several laboratories across the world have shown with high reproducibility that rhesus macaques are infectable with sars-cov-2 showing evidence of virus replication and shedding in nasal swabs with mild clinical signs 119 a very recent study by sars-cov-2-infected rhesus macaques show sars-cov-2 infection protects against rechallenge 134 indicating that immunologic approaches to the prevention and treatment of sars-cov-2 infection may be possible 134 other nonhuman primate models for covid-19 are currently being developed by several labs including those at the tulane national primate research centerusing hace2 transgenic mice bao et al documented that mice overexpressing hace2 were infected with sars-cov-2 the infected mice showed weight loss and virus replication in lung with mild to moderate changes in lung pathology 135 the typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of significant lymphocytes and monocytes in alveolar interstitium and accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities viral antigens were observed in bronchial epithelial cells alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia this phenomenon was not found in wild type mice with sars-cov-2 infection 135 the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 in hace2 mice was clarified and the kochs postulates were fulfilled 135 although it does not develop severe clinical manifestations seen in severe covid-19 this mouse model will facilitate our understanding the pathogenesis of covid-19 together with the sars-cov-2-infected nonhuman primate ferret cat and hamster models mouse models will be very useful for the development of therapeutics and vaccines against sars-cov-2 however they require further optimization including conducting experiments in old mice or mice with induced pre-existing conditions such as hypertension obesity diabetes and respiratory deficits as seen in human patients or with immune compromised or conditionally induced-immune cell depleted conditions 136-140in summary there are no perfect animal models that develop severe covid-19 phenotypes as seen in severe human covid-19 there is a pressing need to develop animal models that show reproducible and severe covid-19 symptoms for pathogenesis studies of the role of ace2 in covid-19 and preclinical studies of potential therapeutics and vaccinesthe spike s protein mediates viral receptor-binding and membrane fusion as such inhibitors that prevent either receptor binding or membrane fusion may serve as viable strategies for preventing further virus dissemination in infected patients specifically disruption of the interaction between ace2 and the critical motifs within the s2 subunit consisting of a fusion peptide fp region and two heptad repeat regions hr1 and hr2 figure 2 may be particularly effective in this regard a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor peptide ek1 targeting the hr1 domains of hcov s proteins has been proven to be effective against sars-cov-2 s protein-mediated membrane fusion in vitro 142 the same group has also shown that a lipopeptide version of ek1 known as ek1c4 prevented sars-cov-2 s protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with ic50s of 13 and 158 nm this inhibitory effect is 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original ek1 peptide respectively 143 with regards to spike protein and ace2 receptor interaction an alternative approach is to mop up the virus using high concentrations of apn01 a recombinant soluble form of human ace2 rhace2 to not only block viral entry but also protect lungs from injury it has been reported that s protein from sars-cov does not influence the hydrolysis of ang ii to ang-1-7 by soluble ace2 144 therefore spike inhibitors may not bind and downregulate ace2 ang ii or other peptide substrates would directly interfere with sar-cov-2 binding and internalization a clinical trial assessing effects of rhace2 in covid19 patients was proposed in china but was later withdrawn nct04287686 64 however apn01 rhace2 developed by apeiron is slated for a multicenter trial in europe nct04335136 it is important to note that giving ace2 in the circulation would not necessarily prevent sars-2 infection instead an intranasal delivery of rhace2 would likely increase the efficacy for prevention and treatment of covid-19 which warrants further clinical trial studies some other potent recombinant ace2 drugs such as ace2-ig that has a better pharmacological property and a potent neutralizing effect in sars-cov-2 pseudotyped virus is under the development for the countermeasure of covid-19 145in contrast to vaccines since an antibody offers immediate protection development of an antibody that binds to a conserved epitope on the spike protein of sars-cov-2 can neutralize the virus in patients even before they produce their own antibodies following studies thus far have been successful in generating neutralizing antibodies targeting the s protein that are effective in vitro single domain antibodies vhhs from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized coronavirus s protein neutralizes sars-cov-2 s pseudotyped viruses 146 a human monoclonal antibody mab 47d11 that most likely targets the conserved core structure of the s1b rbd neutralizes sars-cov-2 in cell culture 147 a cross-neutralization antibody s309 potently neutralizes sars-cov-2 and sars-cov pseudoviruses as well as authentic sars-cov-2 by engaging the s rbd 148 spike-specifc monoclonal antibodies derived from single b cells of sars-cov-2 infected individuals have been isolated and characterized 149 these neutralizing antibodies will be tested for preventing the spread of covid-19 and treating covid-19 severe patients 148 further convalescent plasma therapy for covid-19 is viable approach to reduce covid-19 mortality since it appears safe and clinically effective in this regard several studies showed that convalescent plasma obtained from recently recovered covid-19 patients improved the clinical outcomes by neutralizing viremia in severe covid-19 cases if started early but not in critically ill patients 150-153the amplified immune response and cytokine release or cytokine storm seen in sars-cov-2 infection could result in multiorgan failure therefore monoclonal antibodies directed against inflammatory cytokines or its receptors can be adjunctive therapies for covid-19 in this regard clinical studies show increased il-6 to be a key driver of inflammation 7 several randomized clinical trials with tocilizumab monoclonal antibody against il-6 alone or in combination nct04310228 chictr20000297 and sarilumab another il-6 receptor antagonist nct04315298 are underway in patients with covid-19 worldwidethere is an unprecedented need to develop effective covid-19 vaccine to meet this challenge there is a world-wide multipronged strategic approach for vaccine development around the globe in this effort just released clinical data from phase i study of mrna-1273 vaccine candidate encoding for a perfusion-stabilized form of the sars-cov-2 spike protein report that patients dosed at 25 g or 100 g had seroconverted by day 15 after a single dose mrna-1273 vaccination resulted in high neutralizing antibody titers in eight patients that exceeded levels seen in convalescent sera national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid and modernain a recent study dna vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the sars-cov-2 spike s protein was evaluated in rhesus macaques vaccinated animals developed humoral and cellular immune responses and neutralizing antibody titers comparable to those found in convalescent humans and macaques infected with sars-cov- 2 154the other strategy involves using ad5-ncov a recombinant vaccine incorporating the adenovirus type 5 vector by cansino which has received approval from the chinese authorities to begin human trials inovio pharmaceuticals in collaboration with beijing advaccine biotechnology is developing a dna vaccine against covid-19 called ino-4800 development of a heterologous sars-cov rbd recombinant protein has been proposed to be a vaccine approach potential against covid-19 155hypertension is a common risk factor for mortality among individuals with covid-19 it is postulated that the angiotensin system modulation by acei such as enalapril lisinopril captopril and ramipril or arbs such as losartan candesartan and valsartan could be used in prevention and treatment of sars-cov-2 the use of these two angiotensin system modulators in clinical management of covid-19 has taken center stage due to controversial findings in animal studies that show increase in ace2 expression with use of the acei lisinopril or arbs losartan at doses that are much higher than that prescribed to patients 156 inpatient use of aceiarbs is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and improvement of clinical outcomes compared with aceiarbs non-users 157 158 treatment with aceis or arbs continues to provide cardiovascular and renal protection in patients diagnosed with covid-19 157 158 so discontinuing these medications may be harmful in this patient population 159 therefore several scientific societies highly recommend that patients continue their current hypertensive medication regimen as we await the results of randomized controlled trials addressing the impact of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors rasis on covid-19 morbidity and mortality 160 for example the current centers for disease cdc control and prevention guidance for clinical care of patients with covid-19 april 3 2020 highlights that there are no data to suggest a link between aceis or arbs with worse covid-19 outcomes the american heart association aha the heart failure society of america hfsa and the american college of cardiology acc recommends continuation of these drugs for patients already receiving them for heart failure hypertension or ischemic heart disease hfsaaccaha statement addresses concerns re using raas antagonists in covid-19it is important to note that data from human studies show no increase ace2 expression by acei or arbs 161-163 a caveat of arb or acei effects on ace2 expression in human is that only the shed form of ace2 is studied in plasma or urine where ace2 content is quite low and local tissue concentration of ace2 are unknown and require further investigation very recent study shows that acei offers greater protection than arbs in covid-19 patients 164since hyper-inflammation state seen in covid-19 cases can be a result of angiotensin peptide 1-7 deficiency figure 1 a non-randomized interventional clinical trial to evaluate the possible effect of plasma derived angiotensin peptide 1-7 supplementation on treatment of covid-19 cases nct04375124 is in progress to examine the therapeutic values of acei and arbs in covid-19 patients several clinical trial studies have recently launched two randomized clinical trials examining the role of losartan in covid-19 in usa nct04312009 nct04311177 is underway a double-blind placebo-controlled 11 randomized clinical trial to assess if arb valsartan may prevent the development of ards and avert morbidity admission to intensive care unit icu and mechanical ventilation is initiated in netherland nct04335786remdesivir is an inhibitor of the rna-dependent rna polymerase to date studies on remdesivir show that is highly effective in inhibiting 2019-ncov infection in vero e6 cells 165 166 in a recent study compassionate-use of remdesivir in patients hospitalized for severe covid-19 showed clinical improvement in 36 of 53 patients 167 in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial in severe covid-19 patient hubei china showed no statistically significant clinical benefit 168 preliminary results from a randomized controlled clinical trial with remdesivir indicate that critically ill covid-19 patients who were given intravenous infusion of remdesivir had a 31 faster time to recovery than those who received placebo the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days who were in placebo group nct04280705lopinavir was shown to have antiviral effect against sars-cov-2 virus in vero e6 cells 166 a study with lopinavirritonavir showed that it does not shorten the duration of sars cov-2 shedding 169 however in a study from hong kong compared with ribavirin alone patients treated with lopinavirritonavir plus ribavirin had a lower risk of ards or death caused by sars-cov after the onset of symptoms 170chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq are aminoquinolines which have been used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases recent studies show that cq and hcq is effective against sars-cov-2 infection in vero e6 cells 165 171 however a prospective randomized trial of 30 adults with covid-19 in china revealed that hcq with conventional treatment were compared with 15 patients treated with conventional treatment only showed no effectiveness of hcq and one patient in the hcq group progressed to severe disease 172 an open-label non-randomized clinical trial showed that azithromycin added to hcq was significantly more efficient for virus elimination 173 the outcome of a randomized double-blind phase iib clinical trial clorocovid-19 study showed that at two different cq doses as adjunctive therapy for sars-cov-2 patients patients on high dose cq arm presented more qtc  500 ms 25 and higher fatality 17 than the lower dosage in the first recruited 81 patients 174 in a recent observational study assessing the effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without a macrolide in 96032 hospitalized covid-19 patients indicate any benefit of 4-aminoquinoline-based treatments in this population and suggest that they could even be increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrythmia 175 these data prove that hcq or cq has no therapeutic role either in the treatment or in the prophylaxis of covid-19sars-cov-2 continues to spread globally without any approved therapies and researchers are urgently searching for effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions therefore repurposing existing drugs approved for other uses could greatly benefit covid-19 patients around the world despite benefits and limitations as an example in vitro studies using drugs such as lopinavirritonavir hcq and cq and remdesivir have shown effectiveness against sars-cov-2 however small non-randomized trials using these drugs alone or in combination have shown mixed results in the context of convalescent plasma therapy and vaccines earlier studies have shown that high concentrations of anti-sera against sars-cov neutralized sars-cov infection while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased sars-cov infection wang et al 2014 in another study certain epitopes against the s protein enhanced infection in rhesus macaques and was attributed to antibody-dependent disease enhancement ade 176 177 therefore even with the selection of perfect adjuvant and appropriate antigen or antigens for sars-cov-2 vaccine development ade remains a concern when neutralizing antibodies are elicited at sub-neutralizing doses randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials with existing drugs approved for other diseases is an attractive strategy since it may reduce the costs and time furthermore with the existing pharmaceutical supply chain for formulation and distribution there is the possibility of rapid repositioning of drugs for covid-19 treatmentin summation the covid-19 treatment guidelines panel recommends against the use of the following drugs for the treatment of covid-19 combination of hcq and azithromycin because of potential toxicities the use of lopinavirritonavir or other hiv protease inhibitors because of unfavorable pharmacodynamics and negative clinical trial data we are waiting for the results regarding the therapeutic and vaccine developments related to blocking ace2 and s protein interactions and inhibiting rassars-cov2 appears to have gained increased capacity for transmission over time infecting millions of people globally and causing significant morbidity and mortality this is seen particularly among the elderly and those with comorbid conditions including advanced age hypertension diabetes and obesity the severity of the pandemic is far beyond expectation and much worse than previous coronavirus epidemics including sars and mers which had a comparatively faster but limited spread efforts to minimize transmission including closure of businesses and limitation of many activities have had significant and life-changing impacts including personal economic hardships and damage to global economies there is significant debate regarding the best way to restore economies and bring people back to work without enabling a second wave of infection it is critical that we identify a means to end the current pandemic and prevent the emergence of a second wave of infection while the clinical and pathological features of covid-19 are similar to those of sars there are several gaps on our current understanding of covid-19 pathogenesis first although ace2 serves as a receptor for sars-cov2 the pathogenic role of ace2 may be more complex but remains unclear second the sars-cov-2 infection also downregulates ace2 expression in ace2-expressing cells via shedding ace2 from tissue and reducing the level of ace2 in the infected cells whether these changes in tissue or blood have any prognostic value for predicting the disease progress remains unclear 178 third although clinical trial studies with ang ii inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers indicates the critical roles of ace2 covid-19 pathogenesis there remains a pressing need to develop effective therapeutic strategies through clinical trials and studies in animal models animal models for dissecting the pathogenic role of ace2 in covid-19 and for the evaluation of therapeutic strategies targeting to block ace2 interaction with the s protein and inhibit the immune activationcytokine storm for modulating severe covid-19 are also sorely needed finally current and future preclinical and clinical trials of passive antibodies and vaccine strategies focusing on the interaction of ace2 with the s protein are urgently needed to inform the development of safe and effective vaccines to mitigate morbidity and mortality of covid-19 infection filling these gaps with multiple approaches and effort will add in our understanding of covid-19 pathogenesis and allow for the identification of targets for therapeutic intervention and the development of safe and effective neutralizing vaccinetraditional calf feeding programs have involved providing calves with restricted levels of milk or milk replacer mr as a means of encouraging starter intake and thus facilitating earlier weaning and rumen development 1 however restricted milk feeding programs have also been linked with low live weight gains 2 and increased abnormal non-nutritive feeding behaviours suggestive of a decrease in calf welfare 3 in recent years there has been growing interest in providing calves with higher levels of mr which has been positively associated with improved growth rates in early life 4 reduced age at first calving 5 and increased first lactation milk yield 1 however providing greater volumes of milk or mr can result in reduced starter feed intake prior to weaning 6 which may impede rumen development 7 gradual weaning programs have previously been suggested as a means of encouraging starter intake in calves offered high levels of milk 8 however as reported by de passille et al 9 calves fed higher milk levels may still display lower total dmi than those fed conventional levels of milk following complete milk withdrawal despite the adoption of a gradual weaning program which could impact on overall calf performance and welfare in the post-weaning period recently imani et al 10 reviewed the varying effects of forage provision on calf intake and performance during the transition from a liquid to a solid feed diet although results of previous research have been inconclusive both castells et al 11 and khan et al 12 reported that forage provision improved feed intake and was beneficial for rumen development in calves offered conventional and increased levels of milk respectively provision of forage has been shown to affect lying and feeding behaviour in calves offered high levels of mr 13 however little is known about the interactive effects of milk replacer level and forage inclusion on calf activity which could have a potential effect on calf welfareinsufficient nutrition in the pre-wean period can impact negatively on immune function and increase the potential for susceptibility to infectious disease 14 it could be expected that providing increased levels of mr would result in fewer incidences of ill-health however results of previous research have been varied several authors have reported either improvements or no differences in health scores of calves offered increased levels of mr 41516 whereas quigley et al 17 reported increased incidence of diarrhoea and number of veterinary treatments in calves fed greater volumes of mr previous research has suggested that ill-health in early calf-hood can impact negatively on future performance 18 and that morbidity and mortality from disease is increased in the presence of physical and psychological stressors 19 as indicated by khan et al 20 neonatal calf feeding regime can have an extensive impact on performance behaviour health and welfare previous research has also provided evidence of long-term consistencies in individual differences of behavioural and physiological response to acute stressors 21 this suggesting that experiences in early calfhood could impact development of future coping strategies as such there is a need to examine if nutritional regime can impact on behavioural and physiological responses to management strategies commonly encountered in the first months of liferecently peli et al 22 reported on the neurochemical effects of stress related to intake of different diets in veal calves the study described an increase in oxytocin production in veal calves offered either a mr only or mr plus concentrate diet control diet when compared to calves offered a diet of mr concentrate and hay these results suggest that stress related to different diets can impact on measureable immunoreactive parameters and highlights the need for further examination of how nutritional regimes can impact on calf health and welfare however traditional methods of monitoring calf behaviour and reaction to stressors can be labour intensive eg visual observations and invasive eg blood sampling immunohistochemical methods recently there has been increasing interest in employing the use of remote-sensing technologies such as activity and heart rate monitors which could allow the non-invasive measurement of behavioural and physiological responses to stressors on an individual basis and provide a more comprehensive indicator of calf wellbeing 2324 within this study the primary objective was to examine behavioural and physiological responses of calves to milk feeding level using remote monitoring technologies applicable to on-farm use it was hypothesized that reduction in mr feeding frequency and weaning would likely be considered a stressor particularly in those calves offered higher levels of milk replacer and would provoke a measureable behavioural and physiological response a further objective was to examine the impact of forage inclusion at different ages on calf activity and if there was an interactive effect with mr feeding level seventy-four holstein friesian calves 39 females and 35 males born between 16th february and 11th april 2016 were allocated

calf-rearing unit single point blood samples were taken via jugular venipuncture using 10 ml clot activated serum separation vacutainer tubes bd plymouth uk at 2436 h old to allow determination of calf immune status using the zinc sulphate turbidity zst technique as described by mcewan et al 25 all calves allocated to the study were determined to have a zst value of 20 units which is indicative of successful passive transfer of immunity 25 calves were individually penned in order of birth and allocated to treatment in a 2 milk replacer feeding level  4 forage provision factorial design table

heart rate table 8 p  0001 and lower rmssd table 8 p  0058 at 72 days of age there was no significant effect of forage treatment on hr or rmssd throughout the experimental period table 8responses to common management practices such as restricted feeding and weaning have previously been assessed using measures of calf activity with technological developments meaning that standing and lying behaviour can now be recorded automatically 36 de paula vieira et al 37 reported a decrease in lying time observed in limit-fed calves and suggested that this was due to hunger in the present study daily lying time was reduced by 31 mind in cml calves and was characterized by a reduced number of shorter lying bouts between d3642 the period prior to reduction in mr feeding frequency and volume for hml calves as reported by terr et al 7 calves offered lower levels of mr consume more concentrate in the present study and as will be reported elsewhere average daily concentrate consumption between d542 was 190 g dm and 330 g dm for hml and cml calves respectively p  0001 as such it is likely that cml calves in the present study were spending more time standing to consume concentrate that hml calves calves offered chopped straw at 14 days of age cs14 also displayed an increased number of shorter lying bouts during this period castells et al 11 reported differences in calf activity between calves offered alfalfa hay and those not provided with forage it could be therefore that changes in behaviour observed in the present study were due to cs14 calves consuming the chopped straw at 43 days of age mr volume and feeding frequency was reduced in hml calves during this period lying time was reduced in these calves both in comparison to the pre-step down period and to that recorded in cml calves a reduction in lying time was also observed in hml calves in the period following complete milk withdrawal the decrease in lying time in hml calves is similar to that reported by budzynska and weary 28 and likely a sign of increased hunger following reduction in or withdrawal of mr as indicated by de passille et al 9 a decrease in overall dmi due to reduced solid feed intake has been observed in calves offered high levels of mr in the pre-wean period even when managed in a gradual weaning program the decrease in lying time in hml calves during this period of milk step down and complete weaning could therefore be due to hml calves spending longer standing to consume solid feed as a means of addressing the reduction in available feed energy during d6870 cs14 calves displayed increased lying time when compared to gs56 and nf calves calves spend more time ruminating whilst lying down 11 as such it could be considered that rumen development was potentially more advanced at in calves offered forage at an earlier age and the increase in lying time was due to increased rumination the lack of direct observations to distinguish specific behaviours such as feeding and rumination could be considered a limitation to the present study future research could implement the use of calf appropriate rumination halters to allow feeding behaviours to be distinguished however the results do highlight how activity monitors could be used on-farm by producers to distinguish changes in behaviour as a result of changes in nutritional regime application of activity meters in group housed situations could also provide further information regarding the impact of feeding regime on diurnal behaviour of dairy calvesheart rate monitors have previously been shown to provide increased opportunities for non-invasive monitoring of physiological responses to stress 38 an increase in heart rate hr and decrease the root mean square of successive differences rmssd a time domain measure of heart rate variability hrv have been linked to increased stress load 39 in the present study measures of hr and hrv were comparable across the pre-wean period however there was a reduction in rmssd in hml calves following weaning as hr and hrv measurements were collected when the calves were at rest 39 this could indicate a potential increase in stress response and corresponds with the changes in lying behaviour observed in hml during this period this again highlights that calves high levels of mr in the first weeks of life could display an increased stress response to withdrawal of mr when compared with calves previously fed a conventional level of mr adopting a more prolonged weaning approach whereby mr volume is reduced on a daily basis such as that described by sweeney et al 8 may improve concentrate intake in calves fed high levels of mr and thus reduce stress associated with mr withdrawalill-health in early calfhood can have a significant impact on animal behaviour welfare and productivity all of which can affect the economic efficiency of dairy operations 4041 enteric and respiratory diseases are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the first weeks of life prevalence and severity of which can be affected by housing conditions colostrum intake and feeding management 42 providing calves with milk or milk replacer at a level equivalent to 10 of calf birth weight per day in two portions is an accepted industry standard and is designed to encourage earlier intake of solid feed 17 however it has been suggested that restricted feeding can impact negatively on growth rates and immune function in calves and thus may potentially increase susceptibility to disease 43in the present study it could have been considered that calves offered high hml levels of mr would have been less likely to suffer from ill-health when compared to those offered conventional cml levels of mr however comparable to that reported by quigley et al 17 hml calves in the present study had increased faecal scores between d1420 and were more likely to receive treatment for diarrhoea than cml calves in the study by quigley et al 17 calves fed either conventional or increased levels of mr were subject to transport stress and then housed in hutches where the bedding material had been contaminated with coronavirus as increased incidence of morbidity and mortality was observed in calves provided with increased levels of mr in the study this was directly apportioned to the feeding level leading the authors to advise a cautionary approach if providing increased mr levels to calves under stress diaz et al 44 also reported increased faecal scores in calves offered increased levels of mr however this was considered to be as a result of the differences in total volume of feed and water consumed as opposed to disease in the present study although faecal score was elevated in hml calves it was below that considered indicative of neo-natal calf diarrhoea ncd suggesting that the increased scores were as with diaz et al 44 likely as a result of the fact that hml calves were receiving 5lday more mr than the cml calves additionally anecdotal evidence within the present study indicated that scour was milky in colour reinforcing the consideration that the higher faecal scores in hml calves was due to the higher initial mr volume as opposed to infection further research could aim to examine if scour scoring systems could be modified or improved to take into account the presence of milky scour the average respiratory score observed in cml calves between days 5662 although increased in comparison to hml calves was again below the threshold score considered to be indicative of brd these results indicate that under the management conditions described calves can be fed either increased or conventional levels of milk replacer without severe impact on health throughout the pre-wean period this may have been influenced by the fact that calves were individually housed which has been shown to reduce health problems 45 however the increased faecal scores in the first 3 weeks of life in hml calves could suggest that it may be advisable to delay increasing mr levels until after this period when calves are less susceptible to enteric disease 46 one of the primary detectable physiological responses to infection and inflammation is a change in core body temperature and as such it is often used as an indicator of ill-health 47 in addition to illness stress a result of common management practices in early calfhood can also result in changes in blood flow and thus heat production as a result of increased hypothalamic pituitary adrenal hpa axis activity 48 infrared thermography irt has been indicated as a non-invasive and viable method of detecting these small changes in radiated temperature 49 and has been highlighted as a potential method for the early detection of ill-health 50 in the present study there was no difference in radiated temperature of the eye or rectal area this suggesting that calves were able to maintain thermoregulation throughout the experimental period despite differences in mr feeding levels this was particularly evident in the period following calf jacket removal as it could have been anticipated that cml calves may have struggled to maintain thermoregulation when faced with the combined factors of reduced energy intake and lower ambient temperatures however no difference in temperature measurements were found this could have been due to the fact that calves were 4 weeks of age at the time of calf jacket removal and as such were better able to withstand lower ambient temperatures 51 at this age cml calves were also likely to be consuming greater amounts of solid feed 52 and thus nutritional energy was potentially sufficient to cope with increased heat production demands 53 as a result of exposure to lower ambient temperatures following calf jacket removalthere is limited published research addressing the correlation between infrared ir temperature and core body temperature in very young calves although variable in the present study correlation between ir eye temperature and core body temperature was within the range to that found in jersey heifers by salles et al 54 and comparable to the correlation between core body temperature and indwelling rumen bolus temperature reported by knauer et al 55 the reason for the variability in correlation is unknown and requires further investigation however it could be that ir temperature should be used as a standalone measure wherein individual calves are used as their own control particularly in situations when incidence of ill-healthpyrexia is low the results of the present study suggest that ir temperatures were not affected by the mr feeding level however it may also be that the number of calves used in the experimental design was not sufficient to detect any differences as a result of feeding level additionally there is limited information regarding the effects of feeding level on body temperature an area requiring further investigation comparable to previous research 56 in the present study irt was able to detect the febrile response linked to vaccination again this response did not differ between mr treatments however it does highlight the potential for irt to be used in the detection of pyrexia associated with symptoms of disease and if automated as per schaefer et al 57 it could offer a less invasive option of continuous temperature assessment in young calves under the management conditions described in the present study mr feeding level had limited effects on calf health and physiological responses to common management practices however changes in activity which could be linked with hunger as a result of conventional feeding levels and following reduction in mr volume in calves offered high levels of mr in early life were detectable using automatic activity sensors additionally the higher lying time observed in cs14 calves between 6870 days of age could point to increased rumination as a result of earlier forage introduction this suggests that providing calves with a forage source in addition to concentrate feed could be beneficial to rumen development in the present study calves were individually housed which perhaps contributed to the low level of ill-health amongst calves calves were also monitored on a daily basis with a combination of traditional and novel indicators this potentially resulting in earlier detection and treatment of ill-health as such future research should incorporate techniques described here into group housing systems results of the present study also provide evidence for the role of remote-sensing technologies within calf rearing systems using a range of traditional and novel methods increases the possibilities for collection of behavioural and physiological data this will allow producers to obtain an overall indicator of calf well-being and responses to common management practices encountered in early life further research which aims to compare and correlate these technologies with hormonal biochemical and immunological parameters could help in the development of early warning systems for calf health and welfare issuespandemics and re-emerging diseases put pressure on the health care system to prepare for patient care and sample management for diagnostics requiring personnel protective equipment ppe for exposed health care workers hcws the majority of european hospitals are not equipped with isolation units for patients and high security containments for sample management in the event of emerging or re-emerging

protective suit systems for different applications are commercially available and the selection of the most appropriate ppe optimal protection best ergonomic features and best tolerance by wearers

consequently there is a need to test various types of ppe for material compatibility determination of protection factors wearer comfort and additional adaptations to specific needs 2 3 so far tests mimicking the event of a biological threat have been performed in different contexts for example the assessment of whole hospitals by the french biotox-pirotox network 4 performance of resuscitation

crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv 10 and the quick spread of sars-cov originating from the guangdong province of china to 33 countries worldwide within 6 months 9 the ebola outbreak in west africa demonstrated the need for a quick response to unusual emerging infections using rapidly deployable field laboratory equipment and that wearing of ppe has several limitations under these conditions 11 12 13recent studies highlight that additional research and comparative studies on various types of ppe are needed to determine optimal ppe for hcws 14 15 furthermore testing of current

following characteristic numbers were calculated 658 items per series was the maximum number tn is the total number of items processed e error score is the sum of all mistakes including e1 errors of omission and e2 errors of commission ie wrongly identified character wrong dashes wrong letters e is calculated as the proportion of errors made e within the number of all items processed tn-e is the total number of items processed minus error score e cp is the index of concentration performance calculated as the difference of correct items and errors of commission e2 12 13 this number was at least constant or even increased with duration of the working time fig 4 tn-e was almost constant for every participant in all series an increase of tn-e was observed from the first to the second or third series for almost all participants at 22c working temperature this tendency was not observed at 28c e decreased over the first four series and remained constant until the 6th series for 5 subjects at 22c four subjects showed an increase of e in the last two series at 28c the trend of decreasing e was not observed for subjects wearing suit a heart rates at 22c were below 100 beats per minute for both suits at 28c subjects with suit a showed an average increase of heart rate from 100 to 110 beats per minute no increase was obvious when subjects wore suit b mean values of heart rates were calculated for each subject at each time point fig 4c 4d 4g and 4h mean values of tn-e e and cp of all subjects at each time point were calculated and connected with a trend line fig 4i 4j 4k and

both suits at 22c rmanova p  0001 fig 5a indicating a major training effect there was also an improvement in the series at 28c which was significantly more pronounced with suit a than suit b rmanova interaction p  0016 the heart rate of subjects wearing suit b at 28c was significantly higher than those in suit a fig 5b mean values showed a shorter reaction time fig 5c and a higher heart rate fig

interference leading to termination of the study assessment sheets were completed before and after each task series at 22c and 28c respectively fig 6 at 22c we found no major effects for the parameters dizziness thirst concentration restricted respiration need for toilet break urinary urgency fine motor skills mobility or other problems considerable but not significant differences were seen for temperature perception sweating headache and hunger which were more pronounced for suit a the view was considered more restricted by the flexible face shield of suit b than the fixed shield of suit a rmanova p  0001 at 22c and this difference became more pronounced with proceeding working time rmanova interaction p  0021 back pain was noted to be more pronounced with suit b than suit a but this parameter did not show statistical significance p  0096at 28c working temperature the view was again rated to be more restricted with suit b compared to suit a rmanova p  0027 discomfort due to sweat increased in both suits p  0001 and significantly more with suit a than with suit b rmanova interaction p  0003 but was still tolerablebased on the facts that wearing full body suits and powered-air-purifying-respirators papr protect from exposure to pathogens but constrict mobility view and cause heat stress we tested whether these restraints could impact for example on concentration and increase in error rates due to fatigue the combined evaluation of biophysical conditions and working performance of test persons should provide data on usability of ppe which can be easily and widely implemented in health care for bio-hazard protection 3measurable physical parameters for example fluid loss were dependent on working temperature at 28c the average loss of fluid was higher although not statistically significant fig 2c an unexpected observation was the slight statistically not significant decrease of body temperature when subjects were wearing the total body ventilated suit b at 22c but not for the head ventilated suit a although tympanic infrared body temperature measurement may show some variability this decrease might indicate a cooling effect due to the continuous ventilation of the whole suit for 6 hours at 22c this difference was not observed at 28c where the mean body temperature was the same for both suits fig 2d an increase of body temperature over 39c which is a sign of dangerous heat stress 18 was not observed at any of the conditions tested the decrease of heart rates at 22c which however did not show statistical significance was not an expected physiological outcome this could indicate that there is a certain stress level when donning the equipment for the first time leading to increased heart rates at the beginning of the study which decreased again after adaptation to the conditions the increased heart rates at 28c with both suits indicate increased heat stress which was expected fig 2e however the increase in body temperature as well as the fluid loss was perceived according to the individual perception as moderate to high stress which was not a limiting factor even after 4 hours of working at the high temperature of 28canalysis of task i for both suits and both working temperatures revealed an increase of correct tubes and consequently a better ratio of total to wrong tubes with increasing numbers of the task series up to 6 and 4 hours of working respectively this indicates that effects of fatigue had less impact than the training effect under these experimental conditions since the training effect was also seen at the second series of tasks performed on another day at the higher temperature of 28c we conclude that training effects did not interfere with general results of the tasks performed but rather serve as a relative indicator for stress and fatigue intensity there was however a tendency towards differences between suit a and b with respect to the total number of correctly processed tubes which was higher for suit a this difference is most likely explained by improved dexterity due to better fitting gloves for suit a than b as shown in the assessment of fine motor skills fig 6 fine motor skillssimilar observations to those in task i were made for the d2 test task iii individual performances fig 4a 4b 4e and 4f demonstrated that some subjects decreased their errors red bars and raised their index of concentration green bars with increasing numbers of task series fig 4i 4j 4k and 4l significant differences in the performance of the d2 test were observed neither for the two suit types nor for the two working temperaturesresults of the reaction test task iv also demonstrated that fatigue effects were less pronounced than training effects showing continuous decrease of reaction times with increasing number of task series as this test required physical activity low reaction time indicated ambitious activity and corresponded with high heart rates and both parameters were further mirrored by higher temperature perception the heart rate of subjects wearing suit b at 28c was higher than for suit a fig 5b this could be attributed to either increased physical activity as indicated by the shorter reaction time or increased work load of exercising in a fully ventilated suit suit b surprisingly mean values of reaction times fig 5c for both suits showed lower reaction times at 28c than 22cassessment of restrictions and discomfort due to the different suit types revealed that for suit b restricted view caused by the flexible face shield was the most relevant parameter furthermore the respiration system worn as a rucksack led to back pain in contrast study participants reported for suit a increased temperature and sweating as the most pronounced factors which was expected for this suit with head ventilation none of these parameters reduced the performance nor did they result in earlier termination of the studywe did not evaluate the maximum possible working time since six hours at 22c and four hours at 28c were longer than the maximum allowed working periods typically maximal four hours at 22c in positive pressure suited bsl4 laboratories as a limitation it must be acknowledged that 9 out of 10 subjects allocated to suit a and 5 out of 9 subjects allocated to suit b indicated previous experience with ppe in general more precisely the use of any kind of protective suits but without paprin our study the use of papr providing constant ventilation and cooling of the head might have increased the tolerability of heat stress which probably would not have been the case with face masks or unpowered respirators 19 the comparison of papr with other devices was not the focus of this study a preferred use of papr is further underlined by increased safety due to reduced risk of unintentional contamination of the face papr are also recommended by who the us centers of disease control and prevention and the public health agency of canada to protect from airborne infections eg tuberculosis ebola virus disease and toxic aerosol generating procedures 20 there are however reports with in part contradictory conclusions concerning possible restrictions caused by papr studies from the 1990s 21 22 23 stated no change in cognitive performance while wearing respirators contradicting a study from 2013 24 that ascertained a significant effect on errors made during cognitive tasks by wearing a full-face respiratorin conclusion both suit types were well tolerated when performing different tasks related to sample processing and analyses necessary when protection of hcws by ppe is required the combined evaluation of physical parameters and subjective perception of restrictions and discomfort in task series was informative for identifying limiting factors for working in different types of ppe and should generate trust and confidence of personnel for working in ppe furthermore data generated on the impact of wearing ppe under prolonged and stressful working conditions on error rates should be considered in defining working procedures and safety measures this study can add to data about the impact of ppe on health care worker performance and comfort which may be of value for future pandemicsthe first cases of pneumonia due to a novel betacoronavirus were first identified in december 2019 in wuhan china1 later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has infected hundreds of thousands across 6 continents1 the overall case-fatality rate of covid-19 remains in flux but was initially reported to be 23 in mainland china while italy has reported a case-fatality rate of 7223 of note case-fatality rates have been reportedly higher in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease2the transmission of sars-cov-2 occurs by person-to-person spread through respiratory droplets and self-inoculation after contact with virus on contaminated surfaces the disease has an incubation period of approximately 5 days4 the most common signs and symptoms of covid-19 include fever dry cough shortness of breath and myalgia however some patients present with gastrointestinal eg diarrhea nausea and vomiting or neurological eg headache hypogeusia and hyposmia symptoms56 cardiovascular complications such as myocarditis acute myocardial infarction and heart failure have been reported as has been previously observed with other acute upper respiratory infections eg influenza7 an extensive discussion of these complications and their relationship to covid-19 has been described elsewhere8currently there is no established treatment or vaccine against sars-cov-2 several antiviral and immunomodulating therapies have been used and are under clinical investigation sars-cov-2 infection seems to lead to a more severe disease in patients who are elderly or have comorbidities9 in this review we provide an overview of the pharmacology and cardiovascular considerations with the most promising therapies being investigated for use in patients with covid-19 with a particular consideration on how the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection may be particularly challenging in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular diseases fig 1while a complete understanding of covid-19 is lacking reports from china and italy describe 2 phases of the disease1011 the initial phase is primarily an infection characterized by predominantly lower respiratory symptoms of which most patients recover however some patients progress to an immune-mediated respiratory failure leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure which is associated with a very high mortality rate9early approaches to treatment have involved antiviral therapies aimed at reducing viral replication representing the main pathogenetic mechanism at least in the early phase immunomodulatory therapies targeting the inflammatory response that leads to ards are also being explored it is important to recognize that at this time there are only low-quality data to support the use of any therapy for covid-19 and the field is evolving rapidly therefore this review should not be considered to be comprehensive a summary of the current approaches to prevention and treatment is described in figure 2it is important to consider that the patients at greatest risk for covid-19related mortality and in whom aggressive treatment should be considered are also receiving concomitant cardiovascular therapies therefore drugdrug interactions must be considered and accounted for when managing cardiovascular patients with covid-19 table 1the antimalarial agents hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis and disrupt immune activation at the cellular level by inhibiting both innate and adaptive immune responses in addition by impairing endosomal and lysosomal acidification which is required for viruscell binding these therapies may exert antiviral activity16
in vitro studies suggest that chloroquine may be more potent at inhibiting sars-cov-2 than hydroxychloroquine but hydroxychloroquine seems to be less toxic16hydroxychloroquine is administered orally in a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for 4 days17 electrocardiogram ecg monitoring is recommended to watch for cardiac arrhythmias including qt prolongation torsade de pointe and atrioventricular block8 a reduction in the dose or discontinuation should be considered with qtc 500 ms or an increase in qtc 60 ms and caution is advised if used together with other therapies that prolong qtc especially antiarrhythmics an antimalarial-induced hypertrophic restrictive cardiomyopathy can also occur but this is exceedingly rare and occurs with prolonged use which is not a concern given the short duration 5 days of treatment required for covid-1918 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also inhibit cyp2d6 which may increase beta-blocker exposure and risk of bradycardia pr interval prolongation and atrioventricular block other potential adverse effects include severe hypoglycemia erythroderma hematological and psychiatric disturbances thus routine monitoring should include a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panela small pilot study19 randomized 30 patients to either the intervention hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily for 5 days or conventional therapy only on day 7 patients were tested through respiratory pharyngeal swab for evidence of covid-19 nucleic acid there was no difference in the number of negative swabs between the hydroxychloroquine n  13 and control n  14 groups p  005 no favorable trends were observed in other secondary measures including duration of hospitalization body temperature regulation or radiological progressionin another small single-arm study the effects of hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily in hospitalized patients on the presence or absence of virus at day 6 were studied20 twenty-six french subjects received the protocol and 16 served as controls six stopped hydroxychloroquine therapy early due to either being transferred to the intensive care unit n  3 leaving the hospital n  1 death n  1 or nausea n  1 on day 6 of treatment 70 of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologically cured compared with only 125 in the control group p  0001 the addition of the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more effective for virus elimination with a 100 cure rate suggesting this combination may be superior to hydroxychloroquine alone the same authors have published a preprint21 of a larger sample n  80 of patients who received the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin showing clinical improvement in all but 2 patients the authors report that only 15 of subjects required oxygen therapy 93 had a negative nasopharyngeal viral load on day 8 and the length of stay was limited to an average of 5 days despite the favorable outcomes reported in these observational studies a proper randomized controlled trial is warranted before any definitive decisions can be made regarding the role of these therapies in treating covid-19although the mechanism of how azithromycin would be effective in patients with covid-19 azithromycin has been found to have antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in both in vivo and in vitro studies202223 azithromycin also has activity against proinflammatory cytokines interleukin il-6 and il-8 which may reduce the development of cytokine storm but this warrants further study22 one potential concern however with concomitant antimalarial therapy with azithromycin is the potential for qtc prolongation warranting daily ecg monitoring24 although other macrolides have demonstrated similar effects azithromycin minimally inhibits cyp3a4 while others eg erythromycin and clarithromycin are strong inhibitors of cyp3a4 and not as well tolerated as azithromycin at this time the data supporting the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for covid-19 are very limited given the potential for significant toxicity use of this regimen should be considered with cautionsome have also suggested there may be a role for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to be used for prophylaxis in high-risk individuals such as health care workers therefore chloroquine is being studied as a potential preventative measure against covid-19 in health care workers and other individuals in high-risk environments nct04303507 participants will be randomized to placebo or chloroquine loading dose of 10 mgkg followed by 150 mg daily for 3 months the primary outcome will be the number of covid-19 cases at 100 days at this time however there is little evidence for pharmacological measures to reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 in health care workers or other high-risk individualsremdesivir gilead sciences inc foster city ca is a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity initially used against ebola25 in vivo and in vitro testing has shown to inhibit human coronavirus replication including sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov152627 remdesivir was initially only available for compassionate use but received orphan drug status from the us food and drug administration fda on march 23 2020 the recommended dosing is an initial single dose of 200 mg intravenously followed by 100 mg every 24 hours for the duration of the hospitalization up to 10 days25several phase 3 clinical trials are underway in the united states south korea china and europe nct04302766 nct04280705 nct04292899 nct04292730 2020-000936-23 two of the larger ongoing multicenter clinical trials nct04292899 nct04292730 are evaluating remdesivir in hospitalized patients with moderate n  600 or severe n  400 symptoms not yet requiring mechanical ventilation patients in these studies are randomized to 5 or 10 days of remdesivir or to an additional standard of care arm in the moderate disease trial with a focus on discharge fever and oxygen saturation at 14 days patients with more severe symptoms requiring mechanical ventilation must pursue individual compassionate use protocols in to receive access to remdesivir importantly these trials have no cardiovascular-specific reasons for exclusionoverall remdesivir is generally well tolerated but self-limiting hepatotoxicity has been observed nephrotoxicity is also possible thus its use is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 mlmin173 m2 or those on dialysis monitoring recommendations include a complete blood count with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel there is limited information available at this time regarding the potential for drugdrug interactions with remdesivir information from a clinical trial protocol nct04280705 suggests that remdesivir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form as a substrate of cyp3a4 and remdesivir is a substrate for cyp2c8 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 in vitro yet it also states that coadministration with drugs that affect these cyp isoforms is unlikely to significantly affect the metabolism of remdesivirlopinavir is a protease inhibitor primarily used for the treatment of hiv that is combined with ritonavir and another protease inhibitor that also inhibits cyp3a4 and is combined with lopinavir to enhance its potency28 from a cardiovascular perspective lopinavirritonavir does not induce endothelial dysfunction or insulin resistance however it can cause hypertriglyceridemia2930 a retrospective single-center study suggests that ritonavir-boosted regimens may worsen cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hiv and heart failure31 importantly these data are not sufficient to restrict the use of lopinavirritonavir in patients with cardiovascular disease or heart failure given the life-threatening potential of covid-19 and short-term 2 weeks duration of treatmentthere are notable drugdrug interactions with lopinavirritonavir and select cardiovascular therapies because ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 and p-glycoprotein mdr132 this may result in increased concentrations of cardiovascular therapies metabolized through cyp3a4 such as rivaroxaban apixaban simvastatin and lovastatin all of which should not be used in combination with ritonavir3334 likewise ritonavir inhibits the bioactivation of clopidogrel and prasugrel which may decrease antiplatelet activity however this may not affect the antiplatelet activity of prasugrel making it still a reasonable option3536 ticagrelor should not be used with strong inhibitors of cyp3a4 such as ritonavir due to an increased risk of bleeding3536 the use of p2y12 platelet function assays may be appropriate to ensure adequate antiplatelet activity gastrointestinal symptoms eg nausea vomiting and diarrhea and elevations in hepatic transaminases can also occur routine monitoring includes complete blood count comprehensive metabolic panel and a baseline ecg is recommended when used with concomitant agents eg antiarrhythmics that prolong the qt intervalrecently 199 hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 disease were randomized to either a fixed dose of lopinavirritonavir 400 and 100 mg respectively twice daily for 14 days or standard of care28 the intervention did not improve time to clinical improvement or mortality although the study was underpowered to detect a mortality benefit gastrointestinal complaints nausea vomiting and diarrhea were also common and 138 of patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events additional clinical trials are ongoing including one clinical trial comparing lopinavirritonavir with hydroxychloroquine nct04307693 and another clinical trial comparing lopinavirritonavir with remdesivir 2020-000936-23 in patients with covid-19 of note interferon-beta may also be used in combination with lopinavirritonavir which has been shown to improve pulmonary function and reduce viral loads in marmosets and mice with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus but this has not yet been evaluated in humans2637patients with severe infection may progress to severe respiratory failure due to ards mediated by a catastrophic inflammatory cascade3839 early observations in china and italy led to widespread use of tocilizumab a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor il-6r4041 although originally fda approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis tocilizumab is routinely used in the treatment of cytokine release syndrome secondary to chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapy in hematologic malignancies42 an observational series of patients with severe respiratory symptoms in china showed recovery in 1921 91 after treatment with tocilizumab 4 mgkg iv maximum dose of 400 mg43 other emerging treatment protocols recommend more aggressive doses 8 mgkg up to 800 mg and repeated doses at 12 and 24 hours for patients showing inadequate responses the primary risks of tocilizumab relate to immunosuppression through neutropenia and interruption of t-cell-mediated immunity infusion reactions and transient transaminase elevations may also occur frequently although tocilizumab significantly increases cholesterol levels and blood pressure a recent network meta-analysis found the cardiovascular risk with tocilizumab was comparable with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs44 regardless given the high mortality rate among patients with covid-19mediated ards 50 the potential benefits of short-term tocilizumab use seem to outweigh risks of treatment for most patientsthe parallels in inflammatory pathophysiology between chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapymediated cytokine release syndrome and covid-19mediated ards suggest that il-6 suppression is a key advancement in treatment of severe covid-19 infection sarilumab regeneron pharmaceuticals inc tarrytown ny is the only other il-6 blocker currently on the market if tocilizumab is unavailable however there is limited evidence to guide the selection and dosing of these agents at this timean urgent public health priority to combat covid-19 in the future is to develop a safe and effective vaccine widespread vaccination could also play a role in modulating the cardiovascular risk similar to what has been observed with influenza thus the importance of identifying a safe and effective vaccine45 the first phase 1 clinical trial nct04283461 evaluating a vaccine for covid-19 mrna-1273 began on march 19 2020 and is being sponsored by the national institutes of health the open-label study will enroll 45 healthy adults between 18 and 55 years over 6 weeks although 40 vaccine candidates are in the pipeline it is unlikely a vaccine will be available until at least 2021there has been increased concern regarding the use of ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs in patients with covid-1946 this is due to the potential of ace inhibitors and arbs to upregulate ace2 receptors which are found in vascular endothelial cells of the heart kidneys and lungs and have been shown to be the host cell entry point for sars-cov-247 thus there is a theoretical increased risk for covid-19 in patients taking these medications it also seems that sars-cov-2 consumes ace2 and increases angiotensin2 at2 activity which activates an inflammatory response resulting in microvascular constriction and ischemic injury48 moreover the sars-cov led to downregulation of ace2 and more severe lung injury in mice which could theoretically be attenuated by administration of an arb49 mice lacking ace2 have also been shown to have worse outcomes with influenza h7n9 infection50 observational evidence suggests that ace inhibitors but not arbs may reduce the risk of pneumonia51 given the limited data available supporting either harm or benefit multiple professional organizations have released statements to provide guidance a joint statement from the heart failure society of america american heart association and american college of cardiology recommends not to add or remove any raas-related treatments beyond actions based on standard clinical practice and calls for further research in this area52 likewise the council on hypertension of the european society of cardiology also released a position statement recommending physicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual antihypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with acei or arbs should be discontinued because of the covid-19 infection53to help determine the potential role or harm of ace inhibitors and arbs 2 randomized multicenter clinical trials are underway patients with a presumptive positive test for covid-19 who require hospitalization and are not already taking an ace inhibitor or arb will be randomized to either losartan 25 mg daily or placebo nct04312009 the primary outcome of this study is the sequential organ failure assessment respiratory score which is used to determine the risk of mortality from respiratory failure a similarly designed study nct04311177 will compare losartan 25 mg daily to placebo in patients who test positive for covid-19 but do not require hospitalization the primary outcome of this study will be hospitalization rates at 28 daysin addition to ace inhibitors and arbs ibuprofen was purported in a recent correspondence to also increase ace2 and potentially the risk of worsening covid-1946 despite no definitive evidence supporting this claim it was promoted by the french health minister on social media54 although the world health organization originally backed the claim they later retracted that advice and now do not recommend against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nsaid use55 the european medicines agency56 and fda57 have also confirmed the lack of evidence to support a link between nsaids and worsening covid-19 regardless nsaids should still be avoided in patients with cardiovascular disease especially those with heart failure and renal disease because they can increase bp and cause fluid retentionit is well established that statins have vascular and myocardial anti-inflammatory effects which may exert some potential benefit in patients with acute viral respiratory infections58 observational studies have reported an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes and even mortality in statin-treated patients with influenza or pneumonia however a healthy user bias could be a contributing factor to these findings5960 the randomized controlled trial data are very limited and has found conflicted results6162 importantly there has been no reported harm associated with statin use in these patients which supports the continued use of statins in patients with an indication for statin therapy such as those with established cardiovascular disease diabetes or other high-risk features this is particularly true given the higher mortality rates observed in covid-19 patients with cardiovascular and cardiometabolic comorbidities as previously discussed however dose reductions or therapy substitutions may be warranted if patients receive lopinavirritonavir treatment while on statin therapy table 1 in rare instances patients with covid-19 may develop rhabdomyolysis or acute liver injury which would require prompt statin discontinuationthe spectrum of covid-19 disease ranges from mild to severe and it has been well described elsewhere8 patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease are at particular high risk of severe illness and mortality9 myocardial injury as witnessed by elevation in troponin levels is common in patients with covid-193863 and is likely to reflect demandsupply mismatch type ii myocardial infarction or septic cardiomyopathy for which no specific therapy is recommended other than attempting to optimize oxygen supply delivery and demand as much as possible by intervening on the pulmonary hematologic cardiac and vascular systems increased troponin i identifies patients with severe covid-19 and is associated with very high mortality but whether myocardial injury reflects a specific pathologic mechanism of disease or a subgroup of patients with more severe disease is unclear64 anecdotal cases of myocarditis have been reported6566 but they seem to be rarean elevation in d-dimer levels38 suggests an activation of the coagulation cascade in patients with covid-19 however an increase in thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been widely reported regardless anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin in patients with markedly elevated d-dimer levels should be considered although precise recommendations are challenging given the lack of evidence recently the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis released a pragmatic statement recommending clinicians measure d-dimers prothrombin time and platelet count in all patients with covid-1967 furthermore they also recommend a prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin in all patients including those who are not critically ill barring any contraindications additional study is warranted to understand the anticoagulation needs of patients with covid-19for patients with covid-19 who experience an acute coronary syndrome access to emergency coronary angiography can become restricted in some instances and fibrinolysis can become first-line therapy for lower risk st-segment elevation patients to preserve personal protective equipment and prevent spread of the infection across different areas of the hospital hospitals should also develop protocols for st-segment elevation management for patients with covid-19 in collaboration with their infection prevention departments to optimize patient management while reducing the risk for patient and health care worker transmissionin patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction a careful review of medical treatments should be considered in case of the initiation of the aforementioned investigational drugs to treat covid-19 when possible guideline-directed medical therapy should be continued but additional monitoring is warranted lopinavirritonavir may only modestly affect ace inhibitors and arbs while sacubitrilvalsartan levels can increase warranting close monitoring of bp lopinavirritonavir can increase levels of beta-blockers warranting ecg monitoring and potentially dose downtitration while hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine may reduce levels of beta-blocker and require a dose uptitration68 among mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists spironolactone can be safely used with lopinavirritonavir whereas eplerenone which is mainly metabolized by cyp3a4 should not be coadministered for the same reason coadministration of ivabradine and lopinavirritonavir should be avoided digoxin levels should be followed closely in patients on lopinavirritonavir hydroxychloroquine or chloroquinelimited contact with others to minimize the spread of sars-cov-2 during the epidemic phase of the disease is advised this usually implies rescheduling routine follow-up visits options include the use of telehealth to conduct brief focused remote visits or postponement of visits for more stable patients regardless there are some additional considerations for managing these patients home blood pressure monitoring devices weight scales heart failure telemonitoring and other remote equipment should be offered when possible to augment telehealth visits such equipment may require training of the patients and health care providers but also may reveal unequal access to such resources reinforcing heart healthy lifestyle and stress management are also important given the inherent impact of social distancing and quarantine during a pandemic on daily routines and mental health additional medication-related considerations include ensuring patients have sufficient refills and prescribing a longer supply for maintenance medications these represent some of the potential challenges of social isolation during the pandemicin closing sars-cov-2 is a novel virus that has spread rapidly throughout the world causing a potentially life-threatening disease covid-19 causing disproportionally high mortality among elder patients with concomitant pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases although no approved therapies currently exist multiple collaborative efforts are underway to identify effective therapies and a vaccine to prevent future infection cardiovascular clinicians however may not be accustomed to the concomitant use of antivirals and immunomodulators in their patients thus the need to understand how these therapies might impact underlying cardiovascular conditions and medications despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with covid-19 there is an immense opportunity to enhance our understanding of how to prevent and treat such emerging infections as well as improve our understanding of the relationship between infection immune response and cardiovascular disease
